      "content": " The Clutch Chess: Champions Showdown took place in Saint Louis Mon 27th Oct to Wed 29th Oct 2025. Magnus Carlsen, Fabiano Caruana, Hikaru Nakamura and World Champion Gukesh played three days of fast rapid chess (10m+5spm), a double round robin each day, eventually adding up to 18 rounds, Clutch chess is a special scoring system where the points available from each game increased each day from 1 to 2 to 3 with similar increases for draws from 0.5 to 1 to 1.5. <p>Magnus Carlsen was the runaway winner, the large margin was due to his domination of Gukesh who made huge errors in their games and only managed one draw, there has to be a psychological component to these mistakes as his score was perfectly decent against the other players. Carlsen won all the mini-matches and continues to be better than anyone else. Fabiano Caruana finished second, Nakamura third and Gukesh last. The scoring system didn't change the finishing order of the players in any way.</p>",

      "content": "<p>RIP Mihai Suba (Bucharest 1 June 1947 - Spain 26 October 2025, aged 78)  Suba was a Romanian-born chess player who became an International Master in 1975 and a Grandmaster in 1978.\n  </p><p>\n    Suba didn’t begin playing chess until the unusually late age of 19, yet within just a few years he had risen to become a formidable competitor. He was crowned Romanian Champion three times - in 1980, 1981, and 1985 -\n    and narrowly missed qualifying for the Candidates Tournament after finishing third at the 1982 Las Palmas Interzonal.\n  </p><p>\n    Among his tournament triumphs were first place at Dortmund 1983, and shared first at Prague 1985 and Timisoara 1987. \n    In 1988, during the Lloyds Bank Masters in London, Suba defected from Romania to England, though he would soon represent his home country again after the fall of the communist regime. \n    In 2017, he transferred his federation to Spain, having spent much of his life there.\n  </p><p>\n    His book , first published by Pergamon Chess in 1991, offered a distinctive and personal perspective on chess through his own games. It has since become a classic, with a new edition released by New In Chess in 2016.\n  </p>",

Polina Shuvalova, Leya Garifullina, Olga Girya, Valentina Gunina and Alisa Galliamova were the leading women's players. 22 year old Arseniy Nesterov won the title for the first time with 6.5/11 half a point clear of Daniil Dubov, Andrey Esipenko and Vadim Zvjaginsev. Anna Shukhman won the women's event with 7/10 half a point clear of Leya Garifullina (who she beat in the final round in the first game to finish) and Daria Charochkina. Alisa Galliamova had to withdrew due to health reasons at around the half way stage and her results were annulled. </article>",
