Become a Vanguardista or an Ultra Vanguardista to get video episodes of Take Two every week, plus member‑only chat rooms, polls and submissions to influence the show, behind‑the‑scenes photos and videos, the monthly Redactor’s Roundup newsletter, and access to a new fortnightly LIVE show—a raucous, unfiltered lunchtime special with the Good Doctors, new features, and live chat so you can heckle, vote, and have your questions read out in real time.  \nMark actually went to the BAFTAs this year IRL—and this week’s Take kicks off with a rundown of the winners and all the big moments of the ceremony, including of course some reflections on its controversy from Mark and Simon and from your correspondence.  \nIn celebration of Pixar’s 40th anniversary, Chief Creative Officer Pete Docter is our special guest this week. As the creative force behind some of Pixar’s most beloved films—including Up, Monsters Inc. and Inside Out, he joins Simon and Mark to celebrate the studio’s milestone birthday, and to look ahead to the release of their brand-new adventure, Hoppers. Featuring reflections on four decades of storytelling, a peek behind the animation curtain, and the secrets to making grown adults crumple into sobbing wrecks (in a good way).  \nMark’s Hoppers review is still to come next week—but first it’s another packed show with the Good Doctors’ verdicts on all the biggest big screen releases of this week. First up, the latest instalment in a horror institution, Scream 7, where the body count rises and we’re once again promised that this really is the last one of these films (bet it isn’t though). Remember what Mark thought of the last one? Well, you’re in for a ranty treat...  \nThen there’s EPiC: Elvis Presley in Concert—so anyone who knows how Mark feels about Elvis will know we’re in for a ravey treat. Plus The Testament of Ann Lee, a Shaker musical exploring faith, fervour, and ecstatic song starring Amanda Seyfried. You can hear her and director Mona Fastvold on last week’s show too. Finally, Sirât—the nerve-jangling desert-set tale from Oliver Laxe that is blowing minds left right and centre. Mark throws his hat into the ring.  \nPlus all the usual delights of the Take: the box office top 10, the unpredictable and unbridled joy of the Laughter Lift, and your always-excellent correspondence.

Faced with limited options for a career as a cameraman in New Zealand, Martin sailed to England, and five years in TV and 51 Tom Jones shows later, Martin transitioned into directing full time. As big fans of Martin's EDGE OF DARKNESS (1985), we didn't miss the opportunity to ask him about the making of the six-part BBC limited series, and we extensively discuss his choices and the challenges he faced. Martin describes the relative freedom the BBC gave him to shoot it, and we learn why he cast Bob Peck and Joe Don Baker in the two lead roles. Martin also reveals how they filmed the show as the scripts came in, and we discuss the alternative ending originally written for the final episode. Plus, Martin reveals why he remade the show as a feature years later in the United States. With two Bond films under his belt, Martin later shares how he was approached to direct GOLDENEYE, and he reveals why CASINO ROYALE was chosen to be grounded in reality. Martin also shares his tips for dealing with studio notes, and he reflects on how, throughout his life, his previous experiences set him up for success for what came next.</p><p>Recommended Viewing: EDGE OF DARKNESS (1985 UK TV Series)</p><p>This episode is sponsored by Picture Shop &amp; Aputure</p>",

Become a Vanguardista or an Ultra Vanguardista to get video episodes of Take Two every week, plus member‑only chat rooms, polls and submissions to influence the show, behind‑the‑scenes photos and videos, the monthly Redactor’s Roundup newsletter, and access to a new fortnightly LIVE show—a raucous, unfiltered lunchtime special with the Good Doctors, new features, and live chat so you can heckle, vote, and have your questions read out in real time.  \nAmanda Seyfried is our special guest this week. She’s starred in Mean Girls, The Housemaid and Mamma Mia!, but she’s never been a Mancunian... until now. She joins Simon alongside writer-director Mona Fastvold to talk about The Testament of Ann Lee, in which Seyfried stars as the titular leader of the Shakers. You might not have heard of her and the 18th century radical religious sect she founded—and we promise you’ve definitely never seen a musical about her. Seyfried talks about her struggle to crack a Manchester accent for the role, never mind all that ecstatic song and dance—and we hear from Fastvold about he old-school filmmaking techniques that helped her and co-writer husband Brady Corbet bring this unique story to the screen on shoestring budget.  \n\nMark will review The Testament of Ann Lee next week, but we’ve got four more movie reviews for you in the meantime—it's a packed show! First, The Secret Agent, where paranoia and deception collide as an ex-academic gets caught up in South American political turmoil. Then there’s If I Had Legs I'd Kick You, a darkly comic tale of maternal burnout pushed to surreal extremes. We also have Wasteman—a gritty prison drama starring Rye Lane’s David Jonsson. And finally, Good Luck Have Fun Don't Die, a genre-bending evil-tech adventure starring Sam Rockwell.  \n\nPlus all the usual delights: the box office top 10, the unpredictable joy of the Laughter Lift, and your tip-top correspondence.

      "content": "<article>Tell us all about it, sailor! You asked for it! Here it is! MOAR TRIVIA! This time, the elderly clown-man, Mike curates a bunch of random questions about horror pictures for Jay and Josh to answer and be made fools of. Finding questions that didn’t seem too easy or too hard was actually kind of difficult. Mike knows some things about horror, but not too mech. He nows moar about Star Trek and eating ultra processed foods from the Dollar Store. Did you know he shops for groceries at the Dollar Store?!? I once caught that man eating a box of shortbread cookies and ramen noodles for “dinner” then for a dessert he had a generic brand frozen pizza with a bottle of that sugar juice. I looked at the “nutritional” facts on the pizza. Zeros in all categories except carbohydrates and sodium. 50,000mg of sodium - 100 million times your recommended daily amount. Same with the carbs. 250 million grams of carbohydrates. 55 billion times your daily limit. That’s like eating liquid concrete. No food value. Anyway, I digress. Jay and special guest Josh Roger Thompson join the gang for this embarrassing trivia show down. Josh knows horror though. Him and Jay chat it up constantly. Like the saying goes, Jay is Josh’s brother from another individual(s) that currently identifies as a woman or person or person(s) assigned that specific gender or non-gender at birth. Josh knows lots of things, but he’s no match for Jay’s recall. Jay can remember mostly any actor from any movie. His memory is a steel bear trap. But I guess the biggest takeaway from this whole video is that Josh thinks Shaun of the Dead is “Hipster horse sh*t” “A two star film at best”. Get ready for the battle of the century as these two titans of weird perv*rted horror movies duke it out in a filthy Wisconsin warehouse!!!</article>",

Spanning the worlds' jungles, mountains, and open plains, Jack's work as a designer brings the real world to the audience on the big screen. Throughout our conversation, Jack discusses his views on designing, and he recalls numerous stories detailing the exhaustive work behind his contributions to films such as DAYS OF HEAVEN, THE THIN RED LINE, and THE REVENANT. Later, Jack reveals how he resurrected post-war New York City in the Lower East Side in MARTY SUPREME, and we discuss how he collaborated with cinematographer Darius Khondji (Season 1, Episode 135) on the film and strove for originality in its design. Jack also reflects on the evolution of his lifelong friendship with David Lynch from high school up until his death in 2025, and he shares how he overcame a number of obstacles while designing MULHOLLAND DRIVE. Plus, Jack recalls how he survived the \"highway of death\" in Costa Rica.</p><p>Listen to Ruth De Jong's episode (Season 2, Episode 49) to learn even more about Jack.</p><p>Recommended Viewing: MULHOLLAND DRIVE, DAYS OF HEAVEN</p><p>This episode is sponsored by Aputure &amp; Picture Shop </p>",

We also reflect on the varying natures of scores across film history, and Nicholas shares the challenges of composing for television. He also shares the types of conversations he has with directors after he's brought onto a project, and we learn how he developed the themes for JAY KELLY, DON'T LOOK UP, and THE BIG SHORT. In addition to composing full scores, Nicholas has also contributed music heard within a film's world—during the development of 12 YEARS A SLAVE, he was brought on to compose the songs played in individual scenes, and he reflects on how he balanced the music as both a dramatic element and a piece of history. </p><p>Recommended Viewing: DON'T LOOK UP</p><p>This episode is sponsored by Picture Shop &amp; Aputure</p>",

Inspired by a haunting André Kertész photograph on the cover of a French magazine, this avant-garde silent master­piece centers on a man and two women lost at sea, their pasts unfolding through flashbacks propelled by the music of Erik Satie, Claude Debussy, Igor Stravinsky, and others. An early work of independent Latin American filmmaking, LIMITE was famously difficult to see for most of the twentieth century. It is a pioneering achievement that continues to captivate with its timeless visual poetry.</article>",
