First, Saipan—the football drama starring Éanna Hardwicke as Roy Keane and Steve Coogan as Ireland manager Mick McCarthy, which charts their legendary bust-up ahead of the 2002 world cup. From Korean cinema superstar Park Chan-wook we’ve got No Other Choice, a black comedy about a white-collar worker who turns lethal after being laid off. And last but certainly not least we’ve got even more Josh O’Connor and more Paul Mescal (surely those two lads deserve a holiday?) in The History of Sound—a gay romance between two student musicians in WW1 era America.   \nPlus all the cinema action from the box office top 10, the endless hilarity of the laughter lift, and your tip top correspondence.

      "content": "<article>Best friends Rick and Morn talk about the remaining episodes of season 1 of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. As of this writing, the new show Star Trek: Starfleet Academy has come out and it's release is totally unrelated to this release. The timing is pure coincidence I assure you. Mark and Gork love Star Trek and probably will continue to talk about. However, after seeing Starfleet Academy (or SA as Kurtzman calls it) it is so bad and misguided it's almost a moot point. Star Trek as it once was... is lost. I think it's too far gone. It is possible to make a new series (with new producers) and set it in the 24th century in an isolated setting and have smaller, well written stories that don't involve revenge, a super-weapon, or people that sound like total idiots and are annoying, but knowing that the future of Starfleet will eventually look like it does is a specter that cannot be ignored. What has happened? HOW did this happen? Who has dirt on who? Is NuTrek a scam? A tax write-off? Is 80% of the budget going to the 24 credited producers? I mean, how does a show with so few viewers even become profitable for a streaming service. Or even an asset and not a liability? Morg smells something fishy going on... maybe? At least according to his opinion. Rork and Glorg in no way suggest any illegal activity, but just perhaps activity that might not be moral at the very least. I mean, seriously? It's become a joke at this point. Anyway, no one can ever take my DS9 DVDs away from me. You'll have to pry them from my cold, dead hand. Anyway, enjoy this deep dive into old Trek. Rich and Mike promise more. MUCH MORE!!! WE WILL NOT STOP. WE WILL CONTINUE!!!</article>",

How does someone become a colourist? What do they really do? What is a CDL? DI? QC? DIT? P3? HDR? James, with whom we've worked with several times, graciously explains what all these acronyms (and more) mean, how a colourist generally goes about their work nowadays on any given project, and what he's able to do to help filmmakers solve problems and help realize their visions in the final stages of post-production. James has experience timing dailies and also applying the finishing grade, and he helps us explain the different responsibilities and expectations of each process. James later helps us provide an overview of the different types of deliverables for a film, and he shares some common mistakes young colorists today should avoid. Though the role of a colourist is technically and creatively demanding, James, throughout our conversation, stresses the importance of being able to work with others as a member of the team.</p><p>This episode is sponsored by Aputure</p>",

      "content": "<article>Javier Bardem calls his career an “accident”. He never planned to be an actor. He never expected to learn English or work in Hollywood. For most of his early career, he assumed he would stay in Spain until Before Night Falls earned him an Oscar nomination. What started as an experiment changed the direction of his career.\n\nSoon after, Bardem became the first Spanish actor to win an Oscar for No Country for Old Men, delivering one of the most iconic villain performances ever. Hollywood took notice, pushing him into major studio films like Skyfall, where he did it again.\n\nBut Bardem never abandoned Spanish cinema. Some of his best work came outside Hollywood, in films like The Sea Inside and Biutiful. As his Hollywood momentum grew, that balance became harder to maintain, eventually leading to the worst stretch of his career. It was only when Bardem focused on both Spanish films and Hollywood that everything clicked again, with performances in The Good Boss, Being the Ricardos and Dune.\n\nThis is the story of when an actor didn’t need Hollywood, moving in and out of it without ever letting it define him. This is Javier Bardem.\n\nChapters:\n00:00 - The Intro\n00:59 - Never The Plan\n05:13 - Hello Hollywood\n11:59 - Balance\n\nJavier Bardem. Penelope Cruz. Best Spanish Actor. Best Supporting Actor Oscar. No Country For Old Men. Skyfall. Anton Chigurh. Raoul Silva. Dune. Dune Part Two. Stilgar. Before Night Falls. The Sea Inside. Jamón, jamón. Mondays in the Sun.

      "content": "<article>Rich and Mike talk about Star Trek Deep Space Nine! Finally! But it's season one you say? You're right! Rarely are the first seasons of shows outright exceptional (with some outright exceptions) most times they're good enough to pass muster, until they find stable footing. Deep Space Nine is no different! Light years ahead of the awkward first season of TNG, DS9 slides right into it's groove early on. While there are lots of isolated TNG-esque one-off story lines and some early character developing episodes, DS9 season one is a solid layer of quality \"paste\" as Rich Evans so eloquently puts it. Rich and Mark talk briefly about each episode, pausing to pick favorites along these way. Watch them two old, confused, boring, elderly, genXer scumbags wax nostalgic for quaint old television before the time of woke nightmare sauce spilling out of every eyeball. Before shows made it based on viewership ratings and not streaming service fodder for animal troughs of marketable IP's and stock market shareholder data portfolios for investors. In addition to the Matlock reboot for the olds, we've got this over-produced glossy, fast moving, fart-filled, hip gen-zers (not watching Star Trek I can assure you) tiktok framed clips and nightmare fuel. This embarrassing attempt by old cracker boomer producers to create a program to appeal to Z's that not a single one will take the time to watch. out-of-touch,  buzz-worthy hip-hop, busin' zazz dancin' kidz in Starfleet, bouncing pronouns off the shields as they flubba dubb to the latest crunchy zen-dash touch grass brah. Stella zoinks, lady no cap! You going to the no-alcohol Trek bash in Hall H later where WE DANCE with Starfleet costumes and tell each other we're boss-folks and learn about ourselves while respecting each other's rizz? Heck yeah! It's gonna be tripe and no one there will be sus or clutch fringe cringe. Insta-gram it for me brah! I'll be beaming in later after my exams!</article>",

Directed by Nia DaCosta, who loyal listeners may remember from our live Christmas Extravaganza, it’s the second installment in a sequel trilogy to Danny Boyle’s zombie smash hit.

We worked with Chris on SKYFALL, and we had a great time catching up with him. In addition to production design, Chris has had a long career as an art director, and he helps us understand how the two positions work together on any given project and what each one's responsibilities are. Throughout the episode, Chris also shares his strategies for communicating with directors and producers, creatively adapting to shifting budgets, and delegating duties to members of the art department. We also reflect on why and how the Shanghai skyscraper scene in SKYFALL pivoted from a location to a set, and Chris shares an episode of creative problem solving from THE LAST JEDI involving the Millennium Flacon, Yoda, and a tree. Plus, Chris reveals how he built Bangkok in Prague during the COVID-19 pandemic for THE GRAY MAN.</p><p>This episode is sponsored by Aputure</p>",

Embeth's directorial debut, DON'T LETS GO TO THE DOGS TONIGHT (an adaptation of the book of the same name written by Alexandra Fuller), is one of our favourite films from this past year, and we spend most of our conversation learning how Embeth pulled it off. The film is centered around the experiences of a young white child living in Zimbabwe at the end of the Rhodesian Bush War, and Embeth shares how her own childhood memories of South Africa's Apartheid influenced her telling of the story. Among many topics, we discuss: the film's effective use of voiceover, Embeth's approach to directing the lead child actress, managing a monkey break-in on location, the deceptive allure of the Steadicam, how the movie was financed, and whether or not she considered changing the title. We also reflect on the challenges of navigating a career in the entertainment industry, and we learn what Embeth has planned next.</p><p>Recommended viewing: DON'T LETS GO TO THE DOGS TONIGHT</p><p>This episode is sponsored by Aputure</p>",
