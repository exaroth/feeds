Become a Vanguardista or an Ultra Vanguardista to get video episodes of Take Two every week, plus member‑only chat rooms, polls and submissions to influence the show, behind‑the‑scenes photos and videos, the monthly Redactor’s Roundup newsletter, and access to a new fortnightly LIVE show—a raucous, unfiltered lunchtime special with the Good Doctors, new features, and live chat so you can heckle, vote, and have your questions read out in real time. \n\nA leather-clad Alexander Skarsgård is riding into this week’s Take as our very special guest. That’s because he’s here to talk about ‘Pillion’, the one-of-a-kind comedy drama where he stars as mysterious BDSM biker Ray. The film follows his unfolding relationship with Colin, a shy small-town boy played by Harry Melling—who you might have heard on the show a few months back chatting to Simon about ‘Harvest’. Colin begins to discover his submissive streak under Ray’s dominant hand, as their complex relationship develops. Alexander sits down with Simon to unpack the film—a ‘Dom-Com’, as he calls it—and gives us the lowdown on what a Skarsgård Christmas looks like too.  \n\nDon’s miss Mark’s review of ‘Pillion’ on next week’s show. This week we’ve got his verdicts on three more juicy new releases for you as usual. First up, ‘Sisu: Road to Revenge’--the Finnish action sequel to 2022’s ‘Sisu’, where seemingly unkillable action man Aatami Korpi goes on a revenge rampage against the Red Army. Plus, Bizarre biblical horror ‘The Carpenter’s Son’, starring Nicolas Cage going full Nicola Cage yet again—and ‘Wicked: For Good’ – the sequel to last year’s musical smash spectacle.  \n\nThe Good Doctors run down the box office top 10 too—and from the top of the charts to the bottom of the barrel, there’s the Laughter Lift. Plus your excellent and erudite correspondence answered.  \n\nAND Don’t miss our upcoming LIVE Christmas Extravaganza at London’s Prince Edward Theatre on 7th December—with special guests Nia DaCosta, Gurinder Chadha, and more!

Ted has spent his life working in entertainment, from producing commercials in Florida to exploring virtual reality at Fox and Paramount, and we thought his perspective on the relationship between technology and entertainment could help us better understand where we might be headed. Over the course of our conversation, we discover that to think of the future, we need to remember the past, and Ted connects recent developments in technology to a number of breakthroughs he was witness to himself. We learn about Grass Valley—the video equivalent of Silicon Valley—and of the origins of the RED camera system, and Ted reveals Apple's early attempts to bring digital video to their computer systems. We also discuss modern consumer trends and our changing relationships with screens, and we learn about Kodak's missed opportunity in the prehistoric days of digital cameras. Ted later shares his observations on AI, and he makes a prediction of what we'll see over the next five years of cinema. </p><p>This episode is sponsored by Sandstorm &amp; Aputure</p>",

      "content": "<article>What happens when your dream role ends up breaking your heart? For Andrew Garfield, it only made him better.\n\nAfter years of working his way through British films, Garfield broke out in Hollywood with The Social Network. He was charming, vulnerable, and instantly in demand. Then came Spider-Man, his dream role since childhood. He poured everything into it, but behind the scenes, the experience was far from heroic. Studio politics and the scrapping of his sequels left him feeling lost, both with the industry and himself.\n\nBut he didn’t give up. He chased riskier and more personal roles that challenged him as an actor, like a soldier who refused to use a weapon in Hacksaw Ridge, a priest questioning his faith in Silence, a composer racing against time in Tick, Tick… Boom!, and a performance so demanding it nearly broke him in Angels in America. Some of those roles took a year to prepare, but each one brought him closer to the kind of actor he wanted to be.\n\nThis is the story of an actor who refused to give up, both with his career and his commitment to every role. This is Andrew Garfield.\n\nChapters:\n00:00 - The Intro\n01:00 - The Rise\n05:16 - The Human Spider\n08:44 - Moving On\n14:16 - Acceptance\n\nAndrew Garfield. The Amazing Spider-Man.

      "content": "<article>A few weeks ago, we were invited onto a livestream to interview Tracy J. Butler &amp; Fable Siegel of Lackadaisy. (https://www.youtube.com/@LackadaisyComic)\n\nFor those who don’t know, Lackadaisy is an indie comic that became an indie animated series. It’s about a group of cats who run a speakeasy in St. Louis during Prohibition.\n\nWe thoroughly enjoyed the experience and want to share the results.\n\nThis conversation was put together with the support of Eat Your Peas (https://www.youtube.com/@EatYourPeas_Acc) an animation coaching collective run by Lindsay Knowler.\n\nOur conversation with the Lackadaisy team focused on three major topics.\n\nThe first - a guide through the opening sequence of the pilot, available here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vffu6FG4YP4\n\nThe second - what it was like for them to run an indie animation studio remotely.\n\nAnd the third - the current state of the animation industry itself. \n\nSo come join us by the fire and enjoy!\n\n​​00:00 Intro\n01:13 Part One, opening sequence of pilot\n04:10 From comic to animation, working on your opening later\n08:31 The sample platter vs. traditional pilot, additive nature of animation\n12:46 Small details, the moon, screen direction, car driving by\n16:19 80s &amp; 90s influences, Great Mouse Detective, Secret of Nimh, The Rescuers\n19:17 Part Two, The Average Day on an Indie Production\n21:51 Value of a Production Manager\n25:27 Overestimating abilities, being a leader, hustle culture\n27:38 Downtime, needing to live, finding inspiration for art in life\n32:32 A lot of animation production is cloistered off\n34:39 Part Three, The Industry\n36:53 Why is indie animation happening right now?\n40:44 Art is communication, not worried about GenAI, perfection\n46:09 Fable’s intentions\n49:54 Tracy’s intentions\n52:58 Last bit\n\n\nLackadaisy\nWebsite: https://lackadaisy.com/\nYT: https://www.youtube.com/@LackadaisyComic\nStore: https://lackadaisy.store/\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/Lackadaisy\n\nEat Your Peas\nInsta: https://www.instagram.com/eatyourpeas_acc/\nYT: https://www.youtube.com/@EatYourPeas_Acc\nWebsite: https://eatyourpeas.ca/</article>",

A spooky day where kids come to your home asking for candy and grownups watch horror movies, although apparently not in the theaters? Mike and Ray have seen some scary movies recently, but there was nothing scarier than the box office returns this year! Are movie theaters FINALLY dead? Ray seems to think so. Boy, does he like to complain! Talking about box office numbers being low all the time. Well... did he get out there and support horror movies and first-time directors in movie theaters? Or did he hide in his weird dungeon basement making his automated can openers and spend his time filling up thousands of \"silosilianium hydroxyosuccinate\" capsules all night? What he does with those I'll never know! Powders, scales, jars, capsules, duct tape, video cameras. I'll never understand it! LOL. He so craaaazy! Anyway, these two old as* clowns talk some big talk while sitting on their fat a*ses drinking coffee to sober up. So everyone get Atlanta drunk and listen to these guys talk movies!!!</article>",

If you've seen a film directed by Barry Jenkins (Season 2, Episode 156), then you've seen James' work. Throughout much of the episode, we discuss his longstanding collaborative relationship with Barry, but we also learn how James tries to fit into the visions of the other directors he's worked with. The three of us share a love for preparation, and we learn how James' prep process has evolved and also stayed the same in both his work with Barry and with other filmmakers. James later reveals his perspective on executing the sweeping camera move in the diner in the final act of MOONLIGHT, and we discuss his work using colour in ANYTHING. We also compare our experiences working in animation, and James reflects on being a terrible assistant camera in his salad years.</p><p>Recommended Viewing: ANYTHING, MOONLIGHT, MEDICINE FOR MELANCHOLY</p><p>This episode is sponsored by Aputure &amp; Sandstorm</p>",

We’re welcoming debut filmmaker Ronan Day-Lewis, and his dad who’s come with him and is apparently quite famous or something? Yes, that’s Sir Daniel Day-Lewis, star and co-writer of ‘Anemone’—the father-son co-created drama that has brought him out of retirement. Day-Lewis stars as reclusive and damaged former soldier Ray, who reconnects with his brother Jem (Sean Bean) after years in the wilderness. The pair unpack the film with Simon—including how a 16th Century manuscript partially inspired it, their family history in Ireland, and what it was like to write and shoot an intense father-son story as a real life father-son team. \n\nMark reviews it too, along with three more big movies you can head down to the cinema to watch this weekend—code compliantly, obvs. First up, ‘Predator: Badlands’—the latest instalment in this very loooong running sci-fi action franchise which the classic villain turns hero and the hunter turns hunted. In calmer territory, we’ve got ‘The Choral’ too—a cosy drama about a Yorkshire village choir during WWI, led by controversial new conductor Dr. Henry Guthrie (Ralph Fiennes). And finally, the new and long-awaited Lynne Ramsay film ‘Die My Love’—a dark family drama starring Jennifer Lawrence and Robert Pattinson. Reckon Mark’s going to be excited about this one...  \n\nAll the usual email excellence, bantz, rantz, and everything you’ve come to expect from a top Take too. \n\nAND Don’t miss our upcoming LIVE Christmas Extravaganza at London’s Prince Edward Theatre on 7th December.
