      "content": "<p>Crypto’s most infamous collapse is back in the spotlight, and this time the blast radius reaches deep into Wall Street. A new lawsuit doesn’t just revisit the <a href=\"https://www.disruptionbanking.com/2024/04/10/unraveling-the-terra-luna-crash-sec-investigations-shed-light-on-allegations/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"></a>; it questions whether one of the world’s most sophisticated trading firms saw the collapse coming and moved first. If the allegations hold up in court, the narrative around Terra’s death spiral may shift from inevitable failure to something far more uncomfortable: informed players exiting while everyone else was still being told to hold.</p><h2><strong>Jane Street Accused of Rigging the Market in Crypto’s Most Destructive Collapse</strong></h2><p>The trading firm Wall Street calls untouchable is now fighting a lawsuit that could rewrite the history of the $40 billion Terra-Luna implosion.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-24/jane-street-sued-for-insider-trading-by-terraform-administrator\"></a><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-24/jane-street-sued-for-insider-trading-by-terraform-administrator\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">was sued</a> on February 23 by , the bankruptcy court-appointed administrator winding down , the firm whose collapse in 2022 roiled crypto markets and contributed to the downfall of .</p><p>The complaint, <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.658441/gov.uscourts.nysd.658441.1.0.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">filed</a> in a Manhattan federal court, accuses one of the world’s most profitable trading firms of using stolen information to walk away clean while retail investors lost everything. Claims invoke the , , fraud, and unjust enrichment. Snyder seeks damages, disgorgement, interest, and a jury trial in the <strong>U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (Case No. 1:26-cv-1504)</strong>.</p><h2><strong>The 10-Minute Window That Changed Everything</strong></h2><p>According to a Wall Street Journal exclusive, the complaint <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/jane-street-accused-of-insider-trading-that-helped-collapse-terraform-659e6993\"></a><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/jane-street-accused-of-insider-trading-that-helped-collapse-terraform-659e6993\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">details</a> a damning sequence. On May 7, 2022, Terraform Labs withdrew  from the  without any public announcement. Within 10 minutes, a wallet allegedly linked to Jane Street withdrew an additional  from the same pool. That single move, characterized in the lawsuit as Jane Street’s largest-ever single swap, is described as a turning point in the market’s confidence in TerraUSD.</p><p>The lawsuit claims this triggered the market panic that sent TerraUSD spiraling off its dollar peg, ultimately erasing $40 billion in value. The timing is hard to explain away. Ten minutes is not a coincidence. It is a trade.</p><h2><strong>The Back-Channel That Leaked It All</strong></h2><p>Jane Street’s relationship with Terraform dates back to 2018, when the firm was brought on as a liquidity and market-making partner. Activity on the account reportedly surged in 2022, after , a former Terraform intern, reconnected with his old colleagues at the company. Pratt is accused of creating a private communication channel with Terraform’s business development lead, described in the complaint as a “<em>back-channel source for material non-public information</em>.”</p><p>On May 9, Pratt sent a group message to <a href=\"https://www.disruptionbanking.com/2024/06/19/deep-dive-on-the-do-kwon-saga-how-he-build-terraform-labs-on-lies-and-how-he-evades-justice/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"></a> and Terraform staff, floating offers to buy <a aria-describedby=\"tt\" data-cmtooltip=\"<div class=glossaryItemTitle>Bitcoin</div><div class=glossaryItemBody>&amp;lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;According to Kraken, &amp;#039;Bitcoin is an invention that, for the first time in history, enabled a group of software users to create and manage a digital money supply outside the control of any government or bank.&amp;#039;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&amp;gt;</div>\" href=\"https://www.disruptionbanking.com/Fintech Glossary/bitcoin/\" data-gt-translate-attributes=\"[{&quot;attribute&quot;:&quot;data-cmtooltip&quot;, &quot;format&quot;:&quot;html&quot;}]\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"link\">Bitcoin</a> or Luna. It reads less like a rescue offer and more like a firm positioning itself while holding all the information.</p><p>The lawsuit also<a href=\"https://cryptobriefing.com/jane-street-terra-market-manipulation-lawsuit/\"></a>names Jane Street co-founder  and employee  alongside Pratt as defendants.</p><h2><strong>Jane Street’s Defense: Blame the Fraud</strong></h2><p>Jane Street has called the lawsuit a “” and “” attempt to extract money, with a spokesman stating that losses suffered by Terra and Luna holders were the result of a “<em>multibillion-dollar fraud</em>” perpetrated by Terraform’s own management.</p><p>It is a reasonable deflection on its face. Do Kwon did commit fraud. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to  in a U.S. prison. Terraform also<a href=\"https://www.theblock.co/post/390915/terraform-labs-sues-jane-street\"></a>agreed to pay the&nbsp;  in penalties. But Terraform’s guilt does not automatically excuse profiting from insider knowledge of its collapse. Both things can be true.</p><h2><strong>The Jump Trading Thread Running Through It All</strong></h2><p>This lawsuit does not stand alone. Last December, Snyder <a href=\"https://dockets.justia.com/docket/illinois/ilndce/1:2025cv15414/491795\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">sued</a> and its top executives (co-founder  and former Jump Crypto president ), claiming Jump “” the Terraform ecosystem through a backdoor deal to inflate the value of TerraUSD before it imploded, seeking  in damages (plus other relief) under fraud, manipulation, and fraudulent transfer claims. Snyder alleges Jump was also involved in circulating confidential information to Jane Street. Jump has denied the claims.</p><p>These are not isolated; they are part of Snyder’s broader efforts to recover assets for Terraform creditors and victims.</p><p>What is taking shape is a picture of Wall Street’s most sophisticated trading firms sitting at the center of crypto’s worst disaster. Not just as bystanders, but as alleged participants with a front-row seat and advance notice.</p><p>Legal experts note that insider trading claims in crypto are complex, since courts must decide what counts as securities and what constitutes material non-public information in token markets. If the claims proceed, Jane Street may need to disclose internal communications and trading data tied to TerraUSD, a discovery process that could expose how major market makers manage risk when protocols begin to fail.</p><p>The message? It’s becoming clear to the broader crypto market that the firms that claimed to be providing liquidity may have been extracting it. That question now belongs to a federal judge.</p><p>According to <a href=\"https://x.com/InvestWithD/status/2026381475776692426?s=20\" type=\"link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">reports</a>, Jane Street desks were given an urgent memo to immediately cease <strong>“manipulative <a aria-describedby=\"tt\" data-cmtooltip=\"<div class=glossaryItemTitle>Bitcoin</div><div class=glossaryItemBody>&amp;lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;According to Kraken, &amp;#039;Bitcoin is an invention that, for the first time in history, enabled a group of software users to create and manage a digital money supply outside the control of any government or bank.&amp;#039;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&amp;gt;</div>\" href=\"https://www.disruptionbanking.com/Fintech Glossary/bitcoin/\" data-gt-translate-attributes=\"[{&quot;attribute&quot;:&quot;data-cmtooltip&quot;, &quot;format&quot;:&quot;html&quot;}]\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"link\">Bitcoin</a> trading activity” </strong>— with algos reportedly shut down.

      "content": "<p>3 February 1967 is a day that belongs in the annals of music history. <a href=\"https://www.jimihendrix.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">It’s the day that Jimi Hendrix</a> entered London’s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Studios\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Olympic Studios</a> to record a song using a new component. The song was “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGoDaYjdfSg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Purple Haze</a>,” and the component was the Octavia guitar pedal, created for Hendrix by sound engineer <a href=\"https://www.roger-mayer.co.uk/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Roger Mayer</a>. The pedal was a key element of a complex chain of analog elements responsible for the final sound, including the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/acoustics\">acoustics</a> of the studio room itself. When they sent the tapes for remastering in the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/united-states\">United States</a>, the sounds on it were so novel that they included an accompanying note explaining that the distortion at the end was not malfunction but intention. A few months later, Hendrix would deliver his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-IRA5UrZ7g\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">legendary electric guitar </a>performance at the Monterey International Pop Festival.<a href=\"https://www.jimihendrix.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"></a></p><p>“Purple Haze” firmly established that an electric guitar can be used not just as a stringed instrument with built-in pickups for convenient sound amplification, but also as a full-blown wave synthesizer whose output can be manipulated at will. Modern guitarists can reproduce Hendrix’s chain using separate plug-ins in <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/digital-audio\">digital audio</a> workstation software, but the magic often disappears when everything is buffered and quantized. I wanted to find out if a more systematic approach could do a better job and provide insights into how Hendrix created his groundbreaking sound.</p><p>My fascination with Hendrix’s Olympic Studios’ performance arose because there is a “Hendrix was an alien” narrative surrounding his musical innovation—that his music appeared more or less out of nowhere. I wanted to replace that narrative with an engineering-driven account that’s inspectable and reproducible—plots, models, and a signal chain from the guitar through the pedals that you can probe stage by stage.</p><p>Although I work mostly in the digital domain as an edge-computing architect in my day job, I knew that analog circuit simulations would be the key to going deeper.</p><p>My first step was to look at the challenges Hendrix was trying to address. Before the 1930s, guitars were too quiet for large ensembles. Electromagnetic pickups—coils of wire wrapped around magnets that detect the vibrations of metal strings—fixed the loudness problem. But they left a new one: the , which specifies how the amplitude of a note varies as it’s played on an instrument, starting with a rising initial , followed by a falling , and then any  of the note after that. Electric guitars attack hard, decay fast, and don’t sustain like bowed strings or organs. Early manufacturers tried to modify the electric guitar’s characteristics by using hollow bodies fitted with magnetic pickups, but the instrument still barked more than it sang.</p><p>Hendrix’s mission was to reshape both the electric guitar’s envelope and its tone until it could feel like a human voice. He tackled the guitar’s constraints by augmenting it. His solution was essentially a modular analog signal chain driven not by knobs but by hands, feet, gain staging, and physical movement in a feedback field.</p><p>Hendrix’s setups are well documented: Set lists, studio logs, and interviews with Mayer and Eddie Kramer, then the lead engineer at Olympic Studios, fill in the details. The signal chain for “Purple Haze” consisted of a set of pedals—a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzz_Face\" target=\"_blank\">Fuzz Face</a>, the Octavia, and a<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wah-wah_pedal\" target=\"_blank\"> wah-wah</a>—plus a <a href=\"https://mopop.emuseum.com/objects/100504/marshall-super-lead-amplifier-formerly-owned-by-jimi-hendrix\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Marshall 100-watt amplifier</a> stack, with the guitar and room acoustics closing a feedback loop that Hendrix tuned with his own body. Later, Hendrix would also incorporate a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uni-Vibe\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uni-Vibe</a> pedal for many of his tracks. All the pedals were commercial models except for the <a href=\"https://www.roger-mayer.co.uk/octavia.htm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Octavia</a>, which Mayer built to produce a distorted signal an octave higher than its input.</p><p>I obtained the schematics for each of these elements and their accepted parameter ranges, and converted them into <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netlist\" target=\"_blank\">netlists</a> that <a href=\"https://ngspice.sourceforge.io/\" target=\"_blank\">ngspice</a> can process (ngpsice is an <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/open-source\">open source</a> implementation of the Spice circuit analyzer). The Fuzz Face pedal came in two variants, using <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/germanium-can-take-transistors-where-silicon-cant\" target=\"_blank\">germanium</a> or silicon <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/transistors\">transistors</a>, so I created models for both. In my models, Hendrix’s guitar pickups had a resistance of 6 kiloohms and an inductance of 2.5 henrys with a realistic cable capacitance.</p><p>I chained the circuit simulations together using a script, and I produced data-plot and sample sound outputs with <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/python\">Python</a> scripts. All of the ngspice files and other scripts are available in my <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/github\">GitHub</a> repository at<a href=\"https://github.com/nahorov/Hendrix-Systems-Lab\" target=\"_blank\"> github.com/nahorov/Hendrix-Systems-Lab</a>, with instructions on how to reproduce my simulations.</p><h2>What Does The Analysis of Hendrix’s Signal Chain Tell Us?</h2><p>Plotting the signal at different points in the chain with different parameters reveals how Hendrix configured and manipulated the nonlinear complexities of the system as a whole to reach his expressive goals.</p><p>A few highlights: First, the Fuzz Face is a two-transistor feedback amplifier that turns a gentle sinusoid signal into an almost binary “fuzzy” output. The interesting behavior emerges when the guitar’s volume is reduced. Because the pedal’s input impedance is very low (about 20 kΩ), the pickups interact directly with the pedal circuit. Reducing amplitude restores a sinusoidal shape—producing the famous “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/XJdw_KrUN2w\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">cleanup effect</a>” that was a hallmark of Hendrix’s sound, where the fuzz drops in and out as desired while he played.</p><p>Second, the Octavio pedal used a rectifier, which normally converts alternating to <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/direct-current\">direct current</a>. Mayer realized that a rectifier effectively flips each trough of a waveform into a peak, doubling the number of peaks per second. The result is an apparent doubling of frequency—a bloom of second-harmonic content that the ear hears a bright octave above the fundamental.</p><p>Third, the wah-wah pedal is a band-pass filter: Frequency plots show the center frequency sweeping from roughly 300 hertz to 2 kilohertz. Hendrix used it to make the guitar “talk” with vowel sounds, most iconically on “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0XwPUFfFwE\" target=\"_blank\">Voodoo Child</a> (Slight Return).”</p><p>Fourth, the Uni-Vibe cascades four phase-shift sections controlled by photoresistors. In circuit terms, it’s a low-frequency oscillator modulating a variable-phase network; in musical terms it’s motion and air.</p><p>Finally, the whole chain became a closed loop by driving the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-cool-sound-of-tubes\" target=\"_blank\">Marshall amplifier near saturation</a>, which among other things extends the sustain. In a reflective room, the guitar strings couple acoustically to the speakers—move a few centimeters and you shift from one stable feedback mode to another. To an engineer, this is a gain-controlled acoustic feedback system. To Hendrix, it was part of the instrument. He learned to tune oscillation with distance and angle, shaping sirens, bombs, and harmonics by walking the edge of instability.</p><p>Hendrix didn’t speak in decibels and ohm values, but he collaborated with engineers who did—Mayer and Kramer—and iterated fast as a systems engineer. Reframing Hendrix as an engineer doesn’t diminish the art. It explains how one person, in under four years as a bandleader, could pull the electric guitar toward its full potential by systematically augmenting the instrument’s shortcomings for maximum expression.</p><p><em>This article appears in the March 2026 print issue as “.”</em></p>",

Anyone who scrapes it can access your uploaded files, cached content, and rack up your AI bill.&nbsp; Nobody told you.</p><p dir=\"auto\"> When you create a new API key in Google Cloud, it defaults to \"Unrestricted,\" meaning it's immediately valid for every enabled API in the project, including Gemini.

If the vendor's own engineering teams can't avoid this trap, expecting every developer to navigate it correctly is unrealistic.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">Proof of Concept: Google's Own Keys</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">We provided Google with concrete examples from their own infrastructure to demonstrate the issue. One of the keys we tested was embedded in the page source of a Google product's public-facing website. By checking the Internet Archive, we confirmed this key had been publicly deployed since at least February 2023, well before the Gemini API existed. There was no client-side logic on the page attempting to access any Gen AI endpoints. It was used solely as a public project identifier, which is standard for Google services.</p><img alt=\"\" width=\"781\" height=\"251\" src=\"https://framerusercontent.com/images/ytu85bikTvXkeNJd3hFH5ZVAw4A.png\" srcset=\"https://framerusercontent.com/images/ytu85bikTvXkeNJd3hFH5ZVAw4A.png?scale-down-to=512&amp;width=1562&amp;height=503 512w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/ytu85bikTvXkeNJd3hFH5ZVAw4A.png?scale-down-to=1024&amp;width=1562&amp;height=503 1024w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/ytu85bikTvXkeNJd3hFH5ZVAw4A.png?width=1562&amp;height=503 1562w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1000px) 100vw, (max-width: 999.98px) 100vw\"><p dir=\"auto\">We tested the key by hitting the Gemini API's  endpoint (which Google confirmed was in-scope) and got a  response listing available models. A key that was deployed years ago for a completely benign purpose had silently gained full access to a sensitive API without any developer intervention.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">We reported this to Google through their Vulnerability Disclosure Program on November 21, 2025.</p><ul dir=\"auto\"><li data-preset-tag=\"p\"><p> We submitted the report to Google's VDP.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=\"p\"><p> Google initially determined this behavior was intended. We pushed back.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=\"p\"><p> After we provided examples from Google's own infrastructure (including keys on Google product websites), the issue gained traction internally.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=\"p\"><p> Google reclassified the report from \"Customer Issue\" to \"Bug,\" upgraded the severity, and confirmed the product team was evaluating a fix. They requested the full list of 2,863 exposed keys, which we provided.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=\"p\"><p> Google shared their remediation plan. They confirmed an internal pipeline to discover leaked keys, began restricting exposed keys from accessing the Gemini API, and committed to addressing the root cause before our disclosure date.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=\"p\"><p> Google classified the vulnerability as \"Single-Service Privilege Escalation, READ\" (Tier 1).</p></li><li data-preset-tag=\"p\"><p> Google confirmed the team was still working on the root-cause fix.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=\"p\"><p> 90 Day Disclosure Window End.</p></li></ul><p dir=\"ltr\">Transparently, the initial triage was frustrating; the report was dismissed as \"Intended Behavior”. But after providing concrete evidence from Google's own infrastructure, the GCP VDP team took the issue seriously.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">They expanded their leaked-credential detection pipeline to cover the keys we reported, thereby proactively protecting real Google customers from threat actors exploiting their Gemini API keys. They also committed to fixing the root cause, though we haven't seen a concrete outcome .</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Building software at Google's scale is extraordinarily difficult, and the Gemini API inherited a key management architecture built for a different era. Google recognized the problem we reported and took meaningful steps. The open questions are whether Google will inform customers of the security risks associated with their existing keys and whether Gemini will eventually adopt a different authentication architecture.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">Where Google Says They're Headed</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">Google publicly documented <a href=\"https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/troubleshooting#googles_security_measures_for_leaked_keys\" rel=\"noopener\">its roadmap</a>. This is what it says:</p><ul dir=\"auto\"><li data-preset-tag=\"p\"><p> New keys created through AI Studio will default to Gemini-only access, preventing unintended cross-service usage.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=\"p\"><p> They are defaulting to blocking API keys that are discovered as leaked and used with the Gemini API.</p></li><li data-preset-tag=\"p\"><p> They plan to communicate proactively when they identify leaked keys, prompting immediate action.</p></li></ul><p dir=\"ltr\">These are meaningful improvements, and some are clearly already underway. We'd love to see Google go further and retroactively audit existing impacted keys and notify project owners who may be unknowingly exposed, but honestly, that is a monumental task.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">What You Should Do Right Now</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">If you use Google Cloud (or any of its services like Maps, Firebase, YouTube, etc), the first thing to do is figure out whether you're exposed. Here's how.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Step 1: Check every GCP project for the Generative Language API.</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Go to the GCP console, navigate to APIs &amp; Services &gt; Enabled APIs &amp; Services, and look for the \"Generative Language API.\" Do this for every project in your organization. If it's not enabled, you're not affected by this specific issue.</p><img alt=\"\" width=\"779\" height=\"235\" src=\"https://framerusercontent.com/images/xlkOD29iyoDWFO04pCKhMEx6Syo.png\" srcset=\"https://framerusercontent.com/images/xlkOD29iyoDWFO04pCKhMEx6Syo.png?scale-down-to=512&amp;width=1558&amp;height=470 512w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/xlkOD29iyoDWFO04pCKhMEx6Syo.png?scale-down-to=1024&amp;width=1558&amp;height=470 1024w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/xlkOD29iyoDWFO04pCKhMEx6Syo.png?width=1558&amp;height=470 1558w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1000px) 100vw, (max-width: 999.98px) 100vw\"><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Step 2: If the Generative Language API is enabled, audit your API keys.</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Navigate to APIs &amp; Services &gt; Credentials. Check each API key's configuration. You're looking for two types of keys:</p><ul dir=\"auto\"><li data-preset-tag=\"p\"><p>Keys that have a warning icon, meaning they are set to unrestricted</p></li><li data-preset-tag=\"p\"><p>Keys that explicitly list the Generative Language API in their allowed services</p></li></ul><p dir=\"ltr\">Either configuration allows the key to access Gemini.</p><img alt=\"\" width=\"779\" height=\"279\" src=\"https://framerusercontent.com/images/7V9bS4iNFPLgtPyDVZym8oCA.png\" srcset=\"https://framerusercontent.com/images/7V9bS4iNFPLgtPyDVZym8oCA.png?scale-down-to=512&amp;width=1558&amp;height=558 512w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/7V9bS4iNFPLgtPyDVZym8oCA.png?scale-down-to=1024&amp;width=1558&amp;height=558 1024w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/7V9bS4iNFPLgtPyDVZym8oCA.png?width=1558&amp;height=558 1558w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1000px) 100vw, (max-width: 999.98px) 100vw\"><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Step 3: Verify none of those keys are public.</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">This is the critical step. If a key with Gemini access is embedded in client-side JavaScript, checked into a public repository, or otherwise exposed on the internet, you have a problem. Start with your oldest keys first. Those are the most likely to have been deployed publicly under the old guidance that API keys are safe to share, and then retroactively gained Gemini privileges when someone on your team enabled the API.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">If you find an exposed key, rotate it.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Bonus: Scan with TruffleHog.</strong></p><p dir=\"auto\">You can also use TruffleHog to scan your code, CI/CD pipelines, and web assets for leaked Google API keys. TruffleHog will verify whether discovered keys are live , so you'll know exactly which keys are exposed and active, not just which ones match a regular expression.</p><div data-width=\"fill\"><div><div><div><div><div><pre translate=\"no\"><code> //// ---</code></pre></div></div></div></div></div></div><p dir=\"auto\">The pattern we uncovered here (public identifiers quietly gaining sensitive privileges) isn't unique to Google. As more organizations bolt AI capabilities onto existing platforms, the attack surface for legacy credentials expands in ways nobody anticipated. </p><p dir=\"auto\">Webinar: <a href=\"https://trufflesecurity.com/webinars/google-api-keys-werent-secrets-but-gemini-changed-the-rules\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google API Keys Weren't Secrets.

Include \"om.hpp\" to include all Om header files.</li><li>Configure the project to link to the code dependencies as necessary, built with the correct configuration for the project. See the dependency \"build.cmake\" scripts for guidance.</li></ul><p>For more in-depth usage of the library, see the <a href=\"https://www.om-language.com/namespace_om.html\" title=\"The Om library.\">Om</a> code documentation.</p><p>An Om program is a combination of three elements—operator, separator, and operand—as follows: </p><p>An operator has the following syntax: </p><p>Backquotes () in operators are disregarded if the code point following is not a backquote, operand brace, or separator code point.</p><p>A separator has the following syntax: </p><p>An operand has the following syntax: </p><p>The Om language is <a href=\"http://concatenative.org\">concatenative</a>, meaning that each Om program evaluates to a function (that takes a program as input, and returns a program as output) and the concatenation of two programs (with an intervening separator, as necessary) evaluates to the composition of the corresponding functions.</p><p>Unlike other concatenative languages, the Om language uses <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_notation\">prefix notation</a>. A function takes the remainder of the program as input and returns a program as output (which gets passed as input to the leftward function).</p><p>Prefix notation has the following advantages over postfix notation:</p><ul><li>Stack underflows are impossible.</li><li>Prefix notation more closely models function composition. Instead of storing a data stack in memory, the Om evaluator stores a composed partial function.</li><li>The evaluator can read, parse and evaluate the input stream in a single pass, sending results to the output stream as soon as they are evaluated. This cannot be done with a postfix, stack-based language because any data on the stack must remain there as it may be needed by a function later.</li><li>Functions can be optimized to only read into memory the data that is required; stack-based postfix languages have no knowledge of the function to apply until the data is already in memory, on the stack.</li><li>Incoming data, such as events, become simple to handle at a language level: a program might evaluate to a function that acts as a state machine that processes any additional data appended to the program and transitions to a new state, ready to process new data.</li><li>An integrated development environment can provide hints to the user about the data that is expected by a function.</li></ul><p>Only the  (operators and operands) of a program are significant to functions: separators are discarded from input, and are inserted between output terms in a \"normalized\" form (for consistent formatting and proper operator separation).</p><p>There are three fundamental types of functions:</p><ul><li> A function whose output program contains all the terms in the input program.</li><li> A function whose output program contains a term, defined by the function, followed by all terms in the input program.</li><li> A function that is named by an operator and defines a computation. An operation processes operands at the front of the input program as data for the computation, and pushes any terms generated by the computation onto the output program, until one of two things happens:<ul><li>If the computation is completed, the rest of the input terms are pushed onto the output program.</li><li>If the computation cannot be completed (due to insufficient operands), the operator that names the operation is pushed onto the output program, followed by all remaining input terms.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Programs are evaluated as functions in the following way:</p><ul><li>The  evaluates to the identity function.</li><li>Programs that contain only a  evaluate to functions as follows:<ul><li> Evaluates to the identity function.</li><li> Evaluates to a constant function that pushes the operand, followed by all input terms, onto the output program.</li><li> Evaluates to the operation defined for the operator in the environment. If none, evaluates to a constant function that pushes the operator, followed by all input terms, onto the output program.</li></ul></li><li>Programs that contain  can be considered a concatenation of sub-programs that each contain one of the elements. The concatenated program evaluates to the composition of the functions that each sub-program evaluates to.</li></ul><p>For example, program \"A B\" is the concatenation of programs \"A\", \" \", and \"B\". The separator evaluates to the identity operation and can be disregarded. The programs \"A\" and \"B\" evaluate to functions which will be denoted as  and , respectively. The input and output are handled by the composed function as follows:</p><ul><li>Function  receives the input, and its output becomes the input for function .</li><li>Function  receives the input, and its output becomes that of the composed function.</li></ul><p>Any programs may be concatenated together; however, note that concatenating programs \"A\" and \"B\" without an intervening separator would result in a program containing a single operator \"AB\", which is unrelated to operators \"A\" or \"B\".</p><p>All operation implementations provided are documented in the <a href=\"https://www.om-language.com/group__om____operation____.html\">Operation</a> module.</p><p>There are no traditional data types in the Om language: every data value is represented by an operand.</p><p>The Om language uses a unique  type system, from Ancient Greek πᾶν (pan, \"all\") and μορφή (morphē, “form”), in which all data values are exposed exclusively through a common immutable interface.</p><p>In the case of the Om language, every data value is entirely represented in the language as an operand. Any operation will accept any operand as a valid input and interrogate its data solely through its contained program (a sequence of operator, separator, and/or operand). The operation is then free to process the data however is appropriate, and any operand that it produces as output can then be interrogated and processed by the next operation in the same way.</p><p>Although any operand can be treated as containing a literal array of operand, operator and/or separator elements, the implementation of operands takes advantage of some optimizations:</p><ul><li>Each operand in memory actually contains one of several possible program implementations, each optimized for a specific set of operations. For example, some operations treat separators as insignificant; operands produced by these operations could contain a program implementation that stores only terms (operators and/or operands) and presents a \"normalized\" separator (such as a line separator) between each term.</li><li>Operations can interrogate an input operand for its program implementation type; if it is the optimal implementation type for the operation, the operation can manipulate the operand directly to produce the same result more efficiently.</li></ul><p>Operations in a program can be ordered by the programmer to increase performance by minimizing conversions between program implementations, but it is not necessary for obtaining a correct computation. Where relevant, an operation will document the program implementation types of its inputs and outputs to allow for this optional level of optimization.</p><p>All program implementations provided are documented in the <a href=\"https://www.om-language.com/group__om____program____.html\">Program</a> module.</p><p>The following program contains a single operand containing an operator \"\", a separator \"\", and another operator \"\": </p><table><tbody></tbody></table><p>The following program contains a single operand containing an operator \"\", a separator \"\", and an operand \"\" which in turn contains a single operator \"\": </p><table><tbody></tbody></table><p>Note that separators are significant inside operands: </p><table><tbody></tbody></table><p>Operands can be dropped and copied via the <a href=\"https://www.om-language.com/group__om____operation____drop__operation____.html\">drop</a> and <a href=\"https://www.om-language.com/group__om____operation____copy__operation____.html\">copy</a> operations: </p><table><tbody></tbody></table><p>The <a href=\"https://www.om-language.com/group__om____operation____drop__operation____.html\">drop</a> operation can therefore be used for comments: </p><table><tbody><tr><td><code><b>drop {This is a comment.} {This is not a comment.}</b></code></td></tr></tbody></table><p>The <a href=\"https://www.om-language.com/group__om____operation____choose__operation____.html\">choose</a> operation selects one of two operands, depending on whether a third is empty: </p><table><tbody><tr><td><code><b>choose {It was empty.}{It was non-empty.}{I am not empty.}</b></code></td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><td><code><b>choose {It was empty.}{It was non-empty.}{}</b></code></td></tr></tbody></table><p>An operation without sufficient operands evaluates to itself and whatever operands are provided: </p><table><tbody><tr><td><code><b>choose {It was empty.}{It was non-empty.}</b></code></td></tr><tr><td><code><em>choose{It was empty.}{It was non-empty.}</em></code></td></tr></tbody></table><p>The <a href=\"https://www.om-language.com/group__om____operation____quote__operation____.html\">quote</a> and <a href=\"https://www.om-language.com/group__om____operation____dequote__operation____.html\">dequote</a> operations add and remove a layer of operand braces, respectively: </p><p>Operands can be popped from and pushed into: </p><table><tbody></tbody></table><table><tbody></tbody></table><p>A new operator definition can be provided with the <a href=\"https://www.om-language.com/group__om____operation____define__operation____.html\">define</a> operation, where the first operand is treated as containing a <a href=\"https://www.om-language.com/group__om____lexicon____.html\">Lexicon</a> with operator-to-operand mappings, and the second operand contains the program to evaluate using the defined operator: </p><table><tbody><tr><td><code><b>define { double-quote {quote quote} } { double-quote {A} }</b></code></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Any string can be used as an operator, with separators and operand braces escaped with a backquote: </p><table><tbody><tr><td><code><b>define { double` quote {quote quote} } { double` quote {A} }</b></code></td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><td><code><b>&lt;-[terms] { double` quote operator }</b></code></td></tr><tr><td><code><em>{double` quote}{operator}</em></code></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Unicode is fully supported: </p><table><tbody></tbody></table><table><tbody></tbody></table><p>Recursion is very efficient in the Om language, due to (a) the \"eager\" evaluation model enabled by prefix concatenative syntax (i.e. data is consumed immediately rather than being left on a stack), and (b) the non-recursive evaluation implementation in the evaluator that minimizes memory overhead of recursive calls and prevents stack overflow.

Scheduled to open in 2023, it was originally budgeted <a href=\"https://www.archpaper.com/2020/12/renzo-piano-glassy-100-million-addition-to-the-johns-hopkins-campus-gets-the-go-ahead/\">at $100 million</a>—before the postpandemic surge of inflation. Walking past, the professor wonders what the final price tag will be, and who will pay for the faculty and staff who’ve already been hired by the institute, not to mention the robust programming. <em>How much will it even cost to clean all that glass?</em></p><p>He pictures the trustees and donors at the building’s inauguration, whenever that happens. There will be soaring paeans to values of openness and transparency. It’s a glass building, after all. To him, the gargantuan structure doesn’t signal ancient Greek democracy as much as a Singapore convention hall or the atrium of a Dubai tower. It’s the placeless architecture of 21st-century global capital. He calls it “Airport Sublime.”</p><p>The day before the fall semester begins, the professor attends a convocation for new undergraduates. They look as eager as he feels jaded.</p><p>Johns Hopkins is launching its 150th anniversary celebration. When it was founded in 1876, American universities were still mostly finishing schools for children of the nation’s elite. Hopkins introduced the modern research university to the US, importing the model from Germany, helping reshape American higher education in its image.</p><p>At the convocation, speakers announce the coming “sesquicentennial”: once, twice, three times, and then again, lest anyone forget. , he thinks. He tries to use it in a sentence.</p><p>The incoming chair of the university’s board of trustees is on hand. He looks nervous. He’s younger than most faculty on stage, the managing partner of a private equity firm based in Boston, with offices in London, Mumbai, Hong Kong, and Menlo Park. Kept, like all faculty, at a safe distance from the trustee, the history professor asks himself what this person can know about running a university.</p><p><em>Does the Hopkins board still include that retired </em><a href=\"https://www.northropgrumman.com/who-we-are/leadership/gary-roughead\"></a><em>—the one who once sat on the </em><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/court-documents-shed-light-on-theranos-boards-response-to-crisis-1496136600?mod=Searchresults&amp;pos=1&amp;page=1\"></a><em> of the Silicon Valley blood-testing company Theranos?</em><em>How did he become a trustee anyway? Did someone think: “Now there’s a guy who knows about oversight!”?</em></p><p>The convocation speeches are, as the genre demands, ridden with clichés. Deans urge students to think differently, explore fearlessly. “Be the class that embraces that sense of limitless possibility,” <a href=\"https://hub.jhu.edu/2025/08/26/convocation-2025/\">exhorts</a> the university’s president, a lawyer specialized in corporate governance.</p><p>The president wanted to provide beanies for the event, in a nod to tradition, but decided on white bucket hats instead. They are hidden under the chairs like so many car keys gifted by Oprah. New bucket hat for you! New bucket hat for you!</p><p>The president puts one on and grins. The students put on theirs and grin back. They look like a sea of little Gilligans, spread across the gym floor.</p><p>The university’s vice provost of student affairs gives the final speech. She has the students stand up and applaud the university president, to thank him for the hats. From the podium, she turns to face the president and applauds along with the audience. <em>Here’s a woman who knows on which side her bread is buttered. </em>The professor recognizes the name: she’s the official in charge of disciplining students who protest genocide in Gaza.</p><p>On its 150th anniversary, the university doesn’t even have the courage of its own platitudes. <em>Maybe its motto shouldn’t be “America’s First Research University,”</em> he thinks, <em>but: “We Suck Up and Punch Down.”</em></p><p>There he sits, like an ornament on the dais, dressed in his frayed academic regalia as though cosplaying at a Harry Potter convention. The speeches finally end. He gets a cookie.</p><p>Across campus, a magnificent new building, with 150,000 square feet of floor space, is having its “soft opening.” On orders of the donor’s foundation, photos are embargoed until the grand opening sometime later in the fall. Evidently a PR blitz will come when the time is right. For now, students are allowed to enter and linger on the polished marble.</p><figure><blockquote><p>On its 150th anniversary, the university doesn’t even have the courage of its own platitudes. <em>Maybe its motto shouldn’t be “America’s First Research University,”</em> he thinks, <em>but: “We Suck Up and Punch Down.”</em></p></blockquote></figure><p>The project was initially budgeted at $250 million, also in prepandemic dollars. The history professor is curious to know the final price tag. He thinks about the soaring utility bills for his old Baltimore row house. <em>What must it cost to maintain this colossus?</em></p><p>Johns Hopkins, he’s often been told, follows a decentralized budgeting model. Responsibility-centered management, it’s called. It sounds like something for Serious People who know numbers—executives who throw around phrases like “fiduciary responsibility.” The professor thinks about the trustees who approved this ostentatious facility, knowing they’d pass the bills for upkeep to future deans. He’s no fiduciary, but he wonders how responsible that is.</p><p>Still, he has to admit the building is stunning. With its 29 cantilevered roof planes and its clerestory glazed windows, it will quickly become the highlight of campus tours. Prospective students will look on with envy. Maybe it will attract more applicants.</p><p>He sometimes wonders why the university would need more applicants, given that its admissions rate now hovers under 6 percent. There’s a statistic to make the  rankers swoon. But is it wise to choose a university based on the number of cantilevered roof planes in its student center? He also wonders where those prospective students are to be taught. Space has been tight for years. The campus only has 84 classrooms for its 65 departments, teaching 5,600 undergraduates and 3,500 graduate students.</p><p>America’s First Research University!</p><p>Though it lacks new classroom space, the student center will <a href=\"https://hub.jhu.edu/2025/08/25/student-center-celebration/\">have</a> “new dining options, a theater, dance studios, club meeting rooms, recording spaces, and an esports lounge.” That all sounds a little like the arts center the university tore down to make room for this new building, which also had dance and visual arts studios, a digital media center, a theater, music practice rooms, and an outdoor cafe.</p><p>But <a href=\"https://www.baltimorebrew.com/2015/05/13/hopkins-weighs-option-of-tearing-down-mattin-center-for-100m-student-union/\">no one</a> thought the old building looked good. Actually, the history professor hated it too.</p><p>He remembers when that building came up, back in 2001, replacing a grove of elm, beech, and oak trees on campus. The old arts center hadn’t been cheap: $17 million was real money at the turn of the millennium, in the wake of the dot-com bubble’s collapse. The architects had even worked with a specialized manufacturer to create a unique “Johns Hopkins brick,” speckled with a bespoke glaze to give a special blue-gray hue.</p><p>He marvels that the erstwhile arts center had a shorter life span than his Honda, which still runs pretty well despite once having its catalytic converter stolen. He’s pretty sure several of his home appliances were older than the arts building when it came down.</p><p><em>What did they do with that special JHU brick?</em></p><p>Posters across campus advertise the new student center. The gleaming faces look wonderfully multicultural, like a Benetton ad of yore. Diversity lives on in these posters, at least. On campus, meanwhile, the number of underrepresented minorities in the freshman class plunges: to 17.6 percent in 2024, down from 37 percent the previous year. It will probably continue to dip lower. “Universities CANNOT offer preferential or different paths for individuals based on race or ethnicity at any stage of the application process, including outreach to candidates,” <a href=\"https://policies.jhu.edu/d/TvhPLaE0\">reads</a> the latest guidance from the school’s general counsel.</p><p>Stalls in the student center will soon <a href=\"https://hub.jhu.edu/2025/07/14/johns-hopkins-student-center-dining-options/\">offer</a> food from Egypt and China. One will be run by a local restaurateur, the first Black woman to open an oyster bar in the US. He wonders if this carefully curated variety of what used to be called ethnic food is allowed under the new legal guidance.</p><p><em>Maybe the university could add a Chick-fil-A stand in the name of culinary diversity?</em> He doubts it would keep the Trump administration off the university’s back.</p><p>Hopkins gets more federal money than any other American university, it regularly brags. First research university, first in federal spending, first in the hearts of its fiduciaries.</p><p>Since January 20, 2025, however, that sweet, sweet federal money is starting to taste a little sour. What Clark Kerr <a href=\"https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674005327\">once called</a> the “common-law marriage” between the federal government and major research universities is suddenly undergoing an acrimonious divorce. Last March, the university made global headlines when it lost $800 million in USAID funding and laid off thousands of staff across the world, abruptly shuttering public health programs in developing countries. Other cuts, equally arbitrary, have paralyzed the research agendas of faculty across the institution.</p><p>Did anyone game this possibility out? Being a historian, he remembers when the pandemic hit, five years earlier. No one could have predicted such a thing!, said the executives of a university with a world-class public health school, whose faculty had spent years predicting just such a thing.</p><p>But of course faculty aren’t fiduciaries. Their role is purely advisory, as the president regularly reminds them, although they do win the grants that pay the university’s bills. In 2025, sponsored research by faculty generated more than $4.8 billion. Compared to that sum, donors contribute a pittance: even the profligate Mr. Bloomberg doesn’t come close. And yet for some reason it’s the donors rather than the faculty who sit on the board and make the big decisions.</p><p>Everyone thinks universities have to do what donors want because they pay the bills. But that gets it backward, and not just at Hopkins. Giant donations, he’s come to realize, often increase the university’s bills, generating new operating expenses for projects that may have only tenuous links to the university’s core mission. The new fixed costs cannibalize existing funding streams, increasing pressure to grow revenue. He remembers the quip from a former dean: “The endowment is the gift that keeps on taking.”</p><p>No matter. Here they all find themselves, five years later: same leadership, different crisis. Down at the public health school, the dean warns the faculty senate that it could face dramatic cuts to its faculty. Tenure doesn’t mean much when you’re on soft money, does it?</p><p>The fiduciaries on the university board and in its C-suite keep a tight lid on information about the university’s finances. The professor wonders if Hopkins followed the same path as the University of Chicago. There, the leadership went on a wild spending spree, <a href=\"https://www.chronicle.com/article/how-the-u-of-chicagos-financial-strains-are-a-warning-for-higher-ed\">growing</a> the university’s fixed assets from $1.16 to $4.3 billion in just 20 years. Now the great research university is restructuring its humanities departments and slashing PhD funding by nearly a third.</p><p>An <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/finance/investing/the-ivy-league-keeps-failing-this-basic-investing-test-747c8b8c?st=CDNoi1&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink\">article</a> in the  helps explain why such wealthy universities are suddenly so cash-strapped—again. The richest ones have mostly invested their towering endowments in illiquid assets, like private equity. Alas, as Columbia University has learned, tens of billions of dollars in opaque assets don’t even add up to protection money. Then again, Columbia does have some great new Piano-designed atriums up in Harlem now. What must those maintenance costs be?</p><p>The historian thinks about the only thing he remembers from the economics class he took in college—an old joke. “What do you call a failed mathematician?” it went, demonstrating that even practitioners of the dismal science can have a self-deprecating sense of humor.</p><p>He wonders what you call a failed economist. A fiduciary, maybe?</p><p>Hopkins hasn’t yet shut down any departments, but it did announce a hiring and salary freeze in the lead-up to its 150th anniversary. The number of graduate students his department trains has fallen precipitously. It’s hard to imagine the graduate program returning to size anytime soon.</p><p>Meanwhile, the number of arts and sciences faculty has grown in recent years. “Growth” was one of the president’s strategic priorities. But what are these faculty supposed to do, other than look marvelous to  rankers? Graduate students are disappearing, and he can’t even get a room in which to teach the undergraduates.</p><p>Last year, his department underwent one of its regular reviews. Everyone went through the motions, like so many obedient schoolchildren. Meetings and discussions and many drafts eventually led to a departmental “white paper.”</p><p>The dean brought in experts from top departments around the country; internal and external committees spent two days meeting with faculty and students. Each committee drafted a report assessing strengths and weaknesses and making recommendations. The department drafted answers. How many person hours went into the whole process, he could hardly guess.</p><p>The history professor couldn’t stop thinking of . Did Jim Carrey write reports for his job in that movie?</p><p>Not so long ago, faculty lines were negotiated between departments and deans, who established strategic priorities in collaboration with faculty. No longer. “There is a need to centralize authority in strategic planning at the university,” read a recommendation solicited by the president shortly after he arrived in 2009. Sixteen years later, that need has been addressed, and then some.</p><p>It is plain that faculty and even deans have lost control of the strategic direction of departments. </p><figure><blockquote><p>Faculty aren’t just ignored when it comes to strategic planning; they’re often blindsided by major new initiatives.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Decisions about new faculty hiring no longer come from the divisions, now hemorrhaging resources to meet ever-growing demands from the central administration. Instead, they are made in the president’s office, in line with priorities developed by his senior advisors, with help from the development team, probably in light of algorithms created by education consultancies like <a href=\"https://academicanalytics.com/about-academic-analytics/\">Academic Analytics</a>. External advisory boards oversee the president’s hiring programs, putting departments into a permanent state of semireceivership. He doubts anyone making these decisions reads departmental evaluations.</p><p>Faculty aren’t just ignored when it comes to strategic planning; they’re often blindsided by major new initiatives. The history professor recalls the surprise of his colleagues in political science when the university announced it would establish an entirely new division: a School of Government and Policy. Maybe that news was embargoed too?</p><p>The history professor is curious to know what role donors play in all this. He’s heard from some colleagues that appointments to endowed professorships need to be approved by the donor. </p><p>He has to admit it has all worked to push Hopkins up in the rankings game. But is it wise? To him, it looks like the president has mortgaged the university’s future in a desperate quest to get Hopkins into the top 10. Well, it’s in—at least for now—in a four-way tie for seventh place with Northwestern, Duke, and the University of Pennsylvania, whose executives also probably relied on expensive consultants to scrape their way up the rankings. Then again, if the editors at  decide to tweak their algorithm, all four could slip in the ratings tomorrow.</p><p>These buildings aren’t going anywhere, however. He wonders what the price tag of deferred maintenance will amount to when Hopkins celebrates its 200th anniversary. He’s glad he won’t be around to find out.</p><p>He wonders if  would consider adding numbers of funded graduate students to its rankings algorithm. That might get his PhD program back on track.</p><p>Last spring, the history professor took a mandatory training on Title VI rules. He was surprised by the contents, which seemed to suggest that he should report potentially discriminatory speech even in the context of a classroom discussion. To find out, he wrote to a vice provost of institutional equity.</p><p>Say he were teaching a course on the history of the Middle East or the history of slavery, he asked, and the students were working through difficult ideas in complex readings. If one student inadvertently offends another, is the professor required to report the incident to university lawyers? The answer is yes. In fact, even if no student is offended, he’s required to report potentially discriminatory speech.</p><p>He ponders. <em>Can words be illegal if spoken in the woods when no one is there to hear them? </em>No matter: there aren’t any more woods on campus. There are barely any classrooms.</p><p>There are, however, more atriums!</p><p>Two years ago, the university celebrated the grand opening of a spectacular new building at 555 Pennsylvania Avenue, in Washington, DC, next door to the Canadian embassy. The site had previously housed the Newseum, launched by the Gannett Foundation in 2000. After pouring more than $500 million into the building, however, the foundation confronted the possibility that its upkeep would <a href=\"https://nonprofitquarterly.org/funderfounder-syndrome-ceo-revolving-door-nonprofit-newseum/\">drain</a> the “entire endowment,” and looked desperately for ways to rid itself of the gigantic albatross.</p><p>Undaunted, the university’s board of trustees evidently saw a good thing. Fiduciary responsibility!</p><p>He wonders if any trustees know how The Cooper Union, the famed engineering school, was brought to its knees in the wake of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/11/business/how-cooper-unions-endowment-failed-in-its-mission.html\">years of bad decisions</a>, after its board of fiduciaries commissioned a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/10/business/cooper-union-inquiry-puts-nonprofits-on-notice.html\">lavish</a> new building designed by a world-famous architect—with an atrium, naturally. He bets no one teaches that case study in the classes taken by the MBAs who run his university’s finances.</p><p>It only took two-thirds of a billion dollars for Hopkins to launch its new Washington campus, renamed the Bloomberg Center in honor of the donor, who may have wanted the former museum as a consolation prize for not winning a more prestigious address down the street. It now houses, among other things, the Henry A. Kissinger Center for Global Affairs.</p><p>No one can understand why Hopkins would need such a monumental footprint on the Washington Mall. Certainly it wasn’t for any teaching or research need. When faculty from the university’s school of international affairs moved into the new building, they discovered windowless offices so small they couldn’t fit their book collections. Others, from the school of continuing education, didn’t even get offices, making meetings with students awfully awkward. Rumor has it the donor wanted a more open concept and, well, he did foot the renovation bills.</p><p>Only later, apparently to justify the expensive new edifice, did the university announce the launch of its new division of government and policy studies. , he wonders, <em>and what will the consequences be for the university’s other divisions?</em></p><p>The danger that a new, underfinanced division might cannibalize the existing ones appears not to have figured in the deliberations. Recently, word leaked that several revenue-generating professional programs will be transferred out of the Krieger School of Arts &amp; Sciences to help fund the university’s new School of Government &amp; Policy—creating new challenges for the professor’s beleaguered dean.</p><p>Predictably, it isn’t long before a representative from the dean’s office comes to a department meeting to inform his colleagues that they will have to come up with “revenue-positive” ideas to bring the department back to fiscal sustainability. The dean’s representative blames the graduate students’ new collective bargaining agreement. She intimates that if the department wants to maintain its PhD program and even its staff, it will have to play ball. The history professor wonders how many of his colleagues make the connection between the mercenary new programs leadership is demanding and the fantastic expense of the donor’s building in Washington.</p><p>Still, he has to admit the DC building also looks great, its exterior <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/17/arts/design/00johns-hopkins-bloomberg-center-review.html\">wrapped</a> in woven bands of pink Tennessee marble, its interior marked by soft-toned walnut paneling. Lounges, furnished with upmarket sofas and fashionable Danish chairs, look like high-end coffee shops; he can almost smell the roasted organic beans.</p><p>A spot on the Washington Mall: it may have questionable academic value, but it was an indisputable branding opportunity. For months last year, he couldn’t take the DC Metro without seeing ads for the Hopkins Bloomberg Center. <em>Who was that advertising for</em>, he wonders? <em>What was the university even selling? </em>New revenue-generating programs, maybe? He kept thinking about the number of graduate fellowships that advertising budget could have funded.</p><p>“Where Washington Comes to Think,” reads an ad in his Facebook feed.</p><p>While Hopkins in Washington thinks, Hopkins in Baltimore is feverishly planning its next venture. Thanks to yet another anonymous donation, the university is honoring its 150th birthday by breathlessly joining the artificial intelligence mania, recruiting at least 110 new faculty in the field.</p><p>The hiring spree will grow the number of tenure-track faculty in the engineering school by 50 percent; when it’s over, fully one-third or more will be dedicated to that single subject.</p><p>That’s a heck of a bet. He wonders what happens if it doesn’t pan out.</p><p>The historian is curious if anyone on the board of trustees worries about this abrupt shift in strategic orientation, on which the future of the engineering school now rests. Probably not. They must be too busy buying up Nvidia stock. Or maybe they’re busy shorting it.</p><p>To support its headfirst dive into a shallow AI pool, the university has announced the construction of a 500,000-square-foot facility on the edge of campus. That’s <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/petition-baltimore-mayor-s-office-to-protect-our-green-spaces-from-jhu-s-dsai-complex?recruiter=1387381689&amp;recruited_by_id=fb7a2930-89d2-11f0-817b-274f3e022e4f\">more floor space</a> than found in Baltimore’s downtown convention center, plunked down on a residential street. Not surprisingly, neighbors hate the proposed building, which will tower over the unpretentious two-story row houses across from it. Despite angry opposition from the neighborhood’s city council representative, the university manages to muscle through the permits required to begin construction, <a href=\"https://www.baltimorebrew.com/2026/01/09/despite-protests-poetry-and-a-cease-and-desist-letter-hopkins-cuts-down-city-trees-for-ai-institute/\">chopping down</a> a row of mature red oak trees to make way. Two weeks later, as if by coincidence, thirteen officers and attorneys from the university make a <a href=\"https://baltimorebrew.com/2026/01/29/campaign-dollars-what-a-difference-eight-years-makes-for-baltimores-three-top-electeds/#comments\">set of coordinated donations</a> to the mayor’s campaign account.</p><p>Soon, the new AI building will loom over the glassy Agora Institute, which will by then, he expects, be busily saving democracy. He thinks that if a student had put this detail into a short story—AI casting democracy into its shadow—a writing instructor would have cut it. Surely the writer could arrange this majestic Potemkin campus with more subtlety.</p><p>The history professor is bewildered by the frenzied pace of all this faculty hiring and construction. To him, it resembles a VC-funded startup jumping on a tech fad, or maybe just surplus capital looking for outlets. Evidently university executives too want to move fast and break things—even if those things are special JHU bricks.</p><p>To make way for the hiring spree, the president and dean of engineering dismantled the campus’s “Academic Council,” a faculty-led body that, since the university’s founding, had overseen appointments and promotions and helped past presidents make strategic decisions. They said the process moved too slowly to vet the wave of new appointments efficiently.</p><p>Faculty didn’t say much as the president stormed this last bastion of shared governance on campus. Underwritten by a donation, salaries were going up and teaching loads down. If anyone worried that Hopkins was following states like Texas and Indiana in its allergy to faculty governance, they kept those concerns to themselves.</p><p>The interim director of the new AI institute didn’t seem concerned. “AI will be the lifting tide that will lift everything in and around Hopkins,” he jovially <a href=\"https://www.thebanner.com/economy/real-estate/johns-hopkins-ai-center-remington-BBTNQ5GP25C4HMFZ5Y32HORCCE/\">told</a> a local reporter, suggesting that Baltimore’s Inner Harbor be renamed “AI Harbor.”</p><p>The history professor is less sanguine. He wonders if it’s a good idea to buy up all these new faculty right at the peak of the AI bubble, even as the guardrails to hiring are torn down. $500 million doesn’t seem like much—not when tech giants <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/31/technology/ai-researchers-nba-stars.html\">offer</a> pay packages in the nine figures, with AI investments <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2025/09/07/what-if-the-ai-stockmarket-blows-up\">estimated</a> to reach $2.9 trillion over the next three years alone.</p><p>With its commitment running under one-fiftieth of one percent of that amount, Hopkins hardly seems likely to “play a lead role” in the field, as the engineering school’s dean has <a href=\"https://hub.jhu.edu/2023/08/03/johns-hopkins-data-science-artificial-intelligence-institute/\">gushed</a>. The professor also wonders who will pay for the expensive new faculty, given that most of this latest donation—like all the others—will surely go to the new half-million-square-foot metastasis on the edge of campus. The university is making extravagant long-term commitments, betting on revenue streams that may disappear in the next market crash. Fiduciary responsibility!</p><p>With a little luck, the sesquicentennial celebrations will be over by then. Perhaps the president will have retired—no doubt with a generous deferred compensation package granted by a grateful board. It’ll all be someone else’s problem.</p><p>Will the new AI building have a nice atrium, at least?</p><p>“We believe Hopkins has the single best university president of this generation,” the former chair of the university’s board of trustees <a href=\"https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2023/04/high-executive-compensation-and-lack-of-shared-governance-raises-concerns\">once</a> blurted out, when asked by students why the president earned so much. In the last five years, the trustees have paid the university’s president over $18 million for his strategic vision, a sum that doesn’t even include the many millions he has earned from his service on the boards of <a href=\"https://www.chronicle.com/article/this-president-has-board-seats-at-companies-his-university-does-business-with-is-that-a-problem\">companies that do business with the university</a>.</p><p>Walled off by the president’s abundant staff from alternative perspectives, the trustees probably do believe he’s the best. Maybe the president even hired some expensive compensation consultants to tell them so! Of course, by private equity standards, his compensation is low. Fiduciary responsibility and all.</p><p>Support to train new PhD students, meanwhile, is collapsing. Departments across the School of Arts &amp; Sciences have seen huge cuts in their graduate programs. University officials insist the students are to blame for their temerity in organizing a union and negotiating salaries in the mid-five figures.</p><p>The deficit created by those raises <a href=\"https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2024/10/is-johns-hopkins-abandoning-its-founding-mission\">amounts to</a> approximately $12 million, but no one—in a university that has lavished billions on new construction—can seem to find the money.</p><p>He wonders who will train the next generation of scholars if America’s First Research University won’t anymore. Hopkins isn’t alone; many of the country’s other universities are doing the same. Maybe the leaders of our nation’s wealthiest universities can’t think a generation ahead anymore, beholden as they are to board members who think in terms of the next quarter. Or maybe they have simply given up on the future of an industry that now relies mostly on underpaid gig labor to teach students.</p><p>Or maybe they figure AI will do it all before long.</p><p>The history professor sometimes thinks about Thorstein Veblen and wonders what the great sociologist would have made of Johns Hopkins University on its sesquicentennial. Most famous for his writing on “conspicuous consumption,” Veblen also wrote about university governance, condemning university boards more than a century before the Mark Rowans and Bill Ackmans of the world existed.</p><p>“An aimless survival from the days of clerical rule,” Veblen called university trustees. As American universities began to focus on research, boards “ceased to exercise any function other than a bootless meddling with academic matters which they do not understand.”</p><p>In Veblen’s Gilded Age, “business success” was, “by common consent, and quite uncritically, taken to be conclusive evidence of wisdom even in matters that have no relation to business affairs. … Full of the same naive faith that business success ‘answereth all things,’ the businessmen into whose hands this trust falls are content to accept the responsibility and confident to exercise full discretion in these matters with which they have no special familiarity.”</p><p>“Nothing new under the sun,” says the good book. Then again, Thorstein never saw these beautiful atriums.&nbsp;<img src=\"https://www.publicbooks.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/logo-icon.jpg\" alt=\"End of content\"></p>",

But they less often discuss the humble bus – which moves more people than rail in the <a href=\"https://www.apta.com/wp-content/uploads/2024-Q3-Ridership-APTA.pdf\">US</a>, the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/w/edn-20230918-1\">EU</a>, and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_in_England#:~:text=Light%20rail%20continues%20to%20grow,rail%20passenger%20journeys%20in%20England.\">UK</a> – and whose ridership has <a href=\"https://www.railwayage.com/passenger/apta-releases-ridership-trends-report/\">bounced back more quickly</a> after Covid than rail.</p><p>The problem with buses is that they are slow. For example, buses in New York City and San Francisco crawl along at a paltry <a href=\"https://ibo.nyc.ny.us/iboreports/speeding-up-slowly-a-review-of-initiatives-to-improve-bus-speeds-in-new-york-city-february-2025.pdf\">eight miles per hour</a>, only about double walking speeds <a href=\"https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/67419/10.1177_0022022199030002003.pdf;jsessionid=C156DA82566BA0EC57D918841C663BCF?sequence=2\">in the fastest countries</a>. There are lots of ways to speed up buses, including bus lanes and busways, congestion pricing, transit-priority signals, and all-door boarding. But one of the most powerful solutions requires no new infrastructure or controversial charges and has minimal cost: optimizing where buses stop.&nbsp;</p><a href=\"https://worksinprogress.co/print\"><img src=\"https://worksinprogress.co/wip-image/uploads/2026/01/WIP-Cover-i22-v2.png\"><div><div><p>Subscribe for $100 to receive six beautiful issues per year.</p></div></div></a><p>Buses in some cities, particularly those in the US, stop far more frequently than those in continental Europe. Frequent stopping makes service slower, less reliable, and more expensive to operate. This makes buses less competitive with other modes, reducing ridership. This is why, despite having fewer bus stops, European buses have a <a href=\"https://nhts.ornl.gov/person-trips\">higher share</a> of total trips than American ones.</p><p>Bus stop balancing involves strategically increasing the distance between stops from 700–800 feet (roughly 210–240 meters; there are 3.2 feet in a meter), common in older American cities or <a href=\"https://www.michalpaszkiewicz.co.uk/blog/busdistributions/index.html\">in London</a>, to 1,300 feet, closer to the typical spacing in Western Europe, such as in <a href=\"https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/10110/chapter/8\">Hanover, Germany</a>. Unlike many transit improvements, stop balancing can be implemented quickly, cheaply, and independently by transit agencies. By removing signs and updating schedules, transit agencies can deliver faster service, better reliability, and more service with the same resources.&nbsp;</p><h2>American bus stops are too close together, driving low bus ridership</h2><p>American bus stops are often significantly closer together than European ones. The <a href=\"https://findingspress.org/article/27373-distributions-of-bus-stop-spacings-in-the-united-states\">mean stop spacing</a> in the United States is around 313 meters, which is about five stops per mile. However, in older, larger American cities, stops are placed even closer. In Chicago, Philadelphia, and San Francisco, the mean spacing drops down to 223 meters, 214 meters, and 248 meters respectively, meaning as many as eight stops per mile. By contrast, in Europe it’s more common to see <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3141/1735-04\">spacings of 300 to 450 meters</a>, roughly four stops per mile. An additional 500 feet takes between 1.5 and 2.5 minutes to walk at the <a href=\"https://www.nike.com/hr/a/how-long-does-it-take-to-walk-a-mile\">average</a> pace of 2.5 to 4 miles per hour.</p><p>Frequent stopping is part of a strategy that maximizes coverage – giving everyone some access to the bus – even at the expense of overall ridership, which is largely a function of how useful the bus is relative to other transport options. In England, where 28 percent of <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/annual-bus-statistics-year-ending-march-2024/annual-bus-statistics-year-ending-march-2024\">all bus passengers</a> are on concessionary fares for age or disability, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is supposed to have said, ‘If a man finds himself a passenger on a bus having attained the age of 26, he can count himself a failure in life’. This pattern, of only those without good alternative options riding the bus, is especially pronounced in the US. But close stop spacing creates problems.</p><p>Close stop spacing slows buses down. When a bus stops, it loses time as passengers get on and off the bus (dwell time). The bus also needs to decelerate and accelerate; it may need to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-floor_bus#:~:text=Low%20floors%20can,nearly%20level%20entry.\">kneel</a> (hydraulically lower itself to the floor and back up again to let strollers, wheelchairs, and mobility vehicles on); it may need to leave traffic and return into traffic; and it may miss a light cycle (non-dwell time). Buses spend about <a href=\"https://transitcenter.org/publication/bus-stop-balancing/\">20 percent of their time stopping then starting again</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Slow buses make transit less competitive with driving and reduce the number of places riders can get to in a given amount of time, making the network less useful.&nbsp;</p><p>Labor is transit agencies’ largest cost. For example, <a href=\"https://www.wmata.com/initiatives/budget/upload/FINAL-FY2026-Proposed-Budget-REMEDIATED.pdf\">close to 70 percent</a> of the 2026 operating budget of Washington DC’s transit system will go toward labor and associated fringe benefits and overhead. Drivers are paid by the hour. Thus, slow buses increase the cost of running services, reducing the amount of service that agencies can run.</p><p>Close stop spacing also creates lower quality bus stops. In the US, the sheer number of bus stops means that agencies can’t invest meaningfully in each one. This results in many stops being ‘little more <a href=\"https://transitcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Sorry_To_Superb.pdf\">than a pole with a sign</a>’, lacking basic amenities like shelters, benches, or real-time arrival information. Uneven and cracked sidewalks and a lack of shelter or seating present a particular challenge for <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9771957/\">elderly</a> and <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10812606/\">disabled</a><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214140517309246\">riders</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>By contrast, a bus stop in a French city like Marseille will have shelters and seating by default. Higher quality stops in the city also include real time arrival information, better lighting for safety, level boarding platforms, curb extensions that prevent illegal parking at bus stops, and improved pedestrian infrastructure leading to the stops. Marseille is not a particularly wealthy French city, but because it has wider stop spacing and fewer stops, it can invest more money into each one.</p><h2>Stop balancing addresses these issues and more</h2><p>Many of the solutions to these problems require money – running more buses, improving stop amenities, or upgrading signals – or the political will to take away street space for busways and transit lanes. But stop balancing can have a meaningful impact on these issues for a fraction of the price.</p><p>Bus stop balancing saves riders’ time. Riders save between <a href=\"https://tram.mcgill.ca/Research/Publications/Bus_stop_consolidation_Montreal.pdf\">12 and 24 seconds</a> per stop removed. San Francisco saw a 4.4 to 14 percent <a href=\"https://transitcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/BusStopBalancing_Final_061719_Pages-1.pdf\">increase in travel speeds</a> (depending on the trip) by decreasing spacing from six stops per mile to two and a half. Vancouver’s transit operator ran a <a href=\"https://www.translink.ca/-/media/translink/documents/plans-and-projects/bus-projects/bus-stop-balancing/bus_stop_balancing_line_2.pdf\">stop-balancing pilot</a> that removed a quarter of stops and saved passengers five minutes on average and ten minutes on the busiest trips. Portland saw a six percent increase in bus speeds from a project which increased average stop spacing by just 90 feet.</p><p>Limited stop services – aggressive forms of stop consolidation, effectively express buses – can see even more impressive savings. Los Angeles saw <a href=\"https://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/tcrp/tcrp90v1_cs/LosAngeles.pdf\">operating speeds increase</a> by 29 percent and ridership by 33 percent on its Wilshire/Whittier Metro Rapid corridor. Washington DC pursued a limited stop service on its Georgia Avenue Line that increased speeds by 22 percent in the base and 26 percent in the peak. Colombia’s Bus Rapid Transit, based on this idea, is famous worldwide.</p><p>Because stop balancing speeds up buses it can actually increase the access of the transit network.</p><p>Access may be thought of in terms of the number of access points to the system, for example the number of bus stops or metro stations. But planners also think about access in terms of where the <a href=\"https://humantransit.org/2021/03/basics-access-or-the-wall-around-your-life.html\">system can take you</a>. This idea can be visualized as isochrones – shape maps that show the distance one can travel in a set time. By speeding buses up, stop balancing actually increases the number of destinations reachable within a given timeframe.</p><p>Stop balancing need not even reduce the number of access points much. Many North American bus stops have overlapping ‘walksheds’ (the areas within walkable distance of them) and are competing with each other. The combination of many stops and a street grid means that many riders have two or more stops that they can use, so that closing one only requires a marginally longer walk to the next.&nbsp;</p><p>A <a href=\"https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/papers/z316q174q\">McGill study</a> found that even substantial stop consolidation only reduced system coverage by one percent. A <a href=\"https://rip.trb.org/View/1231735\">different study</a> modeled a stop balancing proposal for San Luis Obispo, and found that even a 44 percent reduction in stops would have only a 13 percent reduction in coverage area. New York’s transit authority increased the distance between stops on a local route from ten to seven stops per mile (a 42 percent increase in distance between stops) but <a href=\"https://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/tcrp/tsyn10.pdf\">estimated</a> that the average walking distance went up by only 12 percent.</p><p>Buses that move more quickly can traverse their routes more times per day. That means that achieving the same frequency requires fewer drivers as the speed of the journey goes up. Because labor is the largest expense of running a service, faster buses are cheaper to run.</p><p>You can determine the peak number of vehicles (and therefore the number of operators on a route) by dividing the time needed for a full round trip (including the layover) by the desired interval between every bus.</p><p>Layover varies by operating company but is usually a fifth of round trip travel time, subject to a minimum for short routes (something like ten minutes).&nbsp;</p><p>These savings can be reinvested to improve service frequency on those routes or elsewhere in the system. Or they can prevent a bus service from having to reduce frequency when facing budget cuts.</p><p>Beyond speed, stop balancing improves reliability. Each potential stopping point introduces uncertainty. When stops are closer together, this uncertainty multiplies by spreading passengers out between locations, making it difficult for agencies to provide accurate schedules.</p><p>Vancouver found that stop balancing improved the <a href=\"https://www.translink.ca/-/media/translink/documents/plans-and-projects/bus-projects/bus-stop-balancing/bus_stop_balancing_line_2.pdf\">reliability of Line 2</a>, especially on the slowest trips. This helps passengers plan their journeys and agencies maintain more accurate schedules, reducing the need for excess recovery time at the end of routes. If agencies want to maximize the benefit of stop balancing on reliability, they can incorporate passenger boarding variability into their stop consolidation program, as McGill University did in <a href=\"https://tram.mcgill.ca/Research/Publications/Bus_stop_consolidation_Montreal.pdf\">their proposal</a> for Montreal’s Bus Network.</p><p>For passengers, improved reliability may be even more <a href=\"https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/3393/2/Public_Transport_Values_of_Time_se\">valuable than speed</a>. Studies show that waiting time feels <a href=\"https://tram.mcgill.ca/Research/Publications/Bus_Stop_consoildation.pdf\">two to three times longer to passengers</a> than in-vehicle time, and unpredictable waits feel longer still. By making bus arrival times more predictable, stop balancing directly addresses one of the most frustrating aspects of bus travel. Operators tend to favor these changes as well, describing stop balancing as helpful for staying on <a href=\"https://escholarship.org/uc/item/4dd8h1vs\">schedule</a>.</p><p>With fewer stops per mile, European agencies can create high-quality waiting environments that are prominently displayed on transit maps similar to rail stations. This enhances the visibility and permanence of the bus network, potentially supporting development along transit corridors. With stop balancing, North American agencies could do the same.</p><p>Bus stop balancing is a rare example of a transit reform that is at once fast, cheap, and effective. Fewer, better-placed stops can improve the speed and reliability of buses, while freeing up resources to improve the stops that remain. In practice, that can mean the difference between a service people tolerate and one they’re happy to use.</p>",

I was working on a small product and thought, \"hey, why not?\" The app was a small browser, and the .online TLD just made sense in my head.</p><p>After a tiny $0.20 to cover ICANN fees, and hooking it up to Cloudflare and GitHub, I was up and running. Or so I thought.</p><p>Poking around traffic data for an unrelated domain many weeks after the purchase, I noticed there were zero visitors to the site in the last 48 hours. Loading it up led to the dreaded, all red, full page \"This is an unsafe site\" notice on both Firefox and Chrome. The site had a link to the App Store, some screenshots (no gore or violence or anything of that sort), and a few lines of text about the app, nothing else that could possibly cause this. [1]</p><p>Clicking through the disclaimers to load the actual site to check if it had been defaced, I was greeted with a \"site not found\" error. Uh oh.</p><p>After checking that Cloudflare was still activated and the CF Worker was pointing to the domain, I went to the registrar first. Namecheap is not the picture of reliability, so it seemed like a good place to start. The domain showed up fine on my account with the right expiration date.

The scenarios involved intense international standoffs, including border disputes, competition for scarce resources and existential threats to regime survival.</p><p>The AIs were given an escalation ladder, allowing them to choose actions ranging from diplomatic protests and complete surrender to full strategic nuclear war. The AI models played 21 games, taking 329 turns in total, and produced around 780,000 words describing the reasoning behind their decisions.</p><p>In 95 per cent of the simulated games, at least one tactical nuclear weapon was deployed by the AI models. “The nuclear taboo doesn’t seem to be as powerful for machines [as] for humans,” says Payne.</p><p>What’s more, no model ever chose to fully accommodate an opponent or surrender, regardless of how badly they were losing. At best, the models opted to temporarily reduce their level of violence. They also made mistakes in the fog of war: accidents happened in 86 per cent of the conflicts, with an action escalating higher than the AI intended to, based on its reasoning.</p><section><div><div><div><p>The best of New Scientist, including long-reads, culture, podcasts and news, each week.</p></div></div></div></section><p>“From a nuclear-risk perspective, the findings are unsettling,” says James Johnson at the University of Aberdeen, UK.&nbsp; He worries that, in contrast to the measured response by most humans to such a high-stakes decision, AI bots can amp up each others’ responses with potentially catastrophic consequences.</p><p>This matters because AI is already being tested in war gaming by countries across the world. “Major powers are already using AI in war gaming, but it remains uncertain to what extent they are incorporating AI decision support into actual military decision-making processes,” says <a href=\"https://sgs.princeton.edu/team/tong-zhao\">Tong Zhao</a> at Princeton University.</p><p>Zhao believes that, as standard, countries will be reticent to incorporate AI into their decision making regarding nuclear weapons. That is something Payne agrees with. “I don’t think anybody realistically is turning over the keys to the nuclear silos to machines and leaving the decision to them,” he says.</p><p>But there are ways it could happen. “Under scenarios involving extremely compressed timelines, military planners may face stronger incentives to rely on AI,” says Zhao.</p><p>He wonders whether the idea that the AI models lack the human fear of pressing a big red button is the only factor in why they are so trigger happy. “It is possible the issue goes beyond the absence of emotion,” he says. “More fundamentally, AI models may not understand ‘stakes’ as humans perceive them.”</p><p>What that means for mutually assured destruction, the principle that no one leader would unleash a volley of nuclear weapons against an opponent because they would respond in kind, killing everyone, is uncertain, says Johnson.</p><p>When one AI model deployed tactical nuclear weapons, the opposing AI only de-escalated the situation 18 per cent of the time. “AI may strengthen deterrence by making threats more credible,” he says. “AI won’t decide nuclear war, but it may shape the perceptions and timelines that determine whether leaders believe they have one.”</p><p>OpenAI, Anthropic and Google, the companies behind the three AI models used in this study, didn’t respond to ’s request for comment.</p>",

The move would also help the ministry avoid the expense of managing outdated Windows 10 systems, which will lose official support in October. </p><p> LibreOffice, developed by the Berlin-based non-profit organization The Document Foundation, is available for Windows, macOS, and is the default office suite on many Linux systems. The suite includes tools for word processing, spreadsheets, presentations, vector graphics, databases, and formula editing. Stage said that the ministry could revert to Microsoft products if the transition proves too complex. </p><p> Microsoft had not responded to Recorded Future News' request for comment as of Friday morning, Eastern U.S. time. </p><p> The ministry’s decision <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/next/2025/06/12/two-city-governments-in-denmark-are-moving-away-from-microsoft-amid-trump-and-us-big-tech-\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">follows</a> similar moves by Denmark’s two largest municipalities, Copenhagen and Aarhus, which previously announced plans to abandon Microsoft software, citing financial concerns, market dominance and political tensions with Washington. Proponents refer to the process as moving toward “digital sovereignty.” </p><p> Henrik Appel Espersen, chair of Copenhagen’s audit committee, told Politiken the move was driven by cost concerns and Microsoft’s strong grip on the market. He also cited tensions between the U.S. and Denmark during <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/denmark-united-states-military-bases-greenland-749f68105ff6452ebfeb7ab2cbc282b7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Donald Trump’s presidency</a>, which sparked debate about data protection and reducing reliance on foreign technology. </p><p> The shift comes amid a wider European trend toward digital independence. This week, the German state of Schleswig-Holstein <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250613-we-re-done-with-teams-german-state-hits-uninstall-on-microsoft\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">said</a> that local government agencies will abandon Microsoft Office tools such as Word and Excel in favor of LibreOffice, while Open-Xchange will replace Microsoft Outlook for email and calendar functions. The state plans to complete the shift by migrating to the Linux operating system in the coming years. </p><p> Schleswig-Holstein first <a href=\"https://www.schleswig-holstein.de/DE/landesregierung/ministerien-behoerden/I/Presse/PI/2024/CdS/240403_cds_it-arbeitsplatz.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">announced</a> its decision to abandon Microsoft last April, saying it would be “the first state to introduce a digitally sovereign IT workplace.” “Independent, sustainable, secure: Schleswig-Holstein will be a digital pioneer region,” the state’s Minister-President said at the time. </p>",

Moon</a>.\n            </p><p>\n              We wanted to create an LLM game benchmark that put this generation of frontier LLMs' superpower, \n              coding, on full display. Ten years ago, a team released a game called <a href=\"https://github.com/screeps/screeps\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Screeps</a>. It was described \n              as an \"MMO RTS sandbox for programmers.\" In Screeps, human players write javascript strategies \n              that get executed in the game's environment. Players gain resources, lose territory, and have \n              units wiped out. It's a traditional RTS, but controlled entirely through code. \n            </p><p>\n              The Screeps paradigm, writing code and having it execute in a real-time game environment, is well suited \n              for an LLM benchmark. Drawing on a version of the Screeps open source API, LLM Skirmish pits \n              LLMs head-to-head in a series of 1v1 real-time strategy games.\n            </p></section><section><p>\n              In LLM Skirmish, each player begins with a \"spawn\" (a building that can create units), one \n              military unit, and three economic units. The objective of each LLM Skirmish match is to \n              eliminate your opponent's spawn. If a player is not eliminated within 2,000 game frames \n              (each player is allowed up to one second of runtime computation per frame), the game ends \n              and the victor is determined based on score.\n            </p></section><section><p>\n              Every LLM Skirmish tournament consists of five rounds. In each round, each LLM is asked to \n              write a script implementing its strategy. For all rounds after the first, each LLM can see \n              the results of all its matches from the previous round and use that information to make \n              changes to the script it submits for the next round. In every round, every player plays all \n              other players once. This means there are 10 matches per round and 50 matches per tournament.\n            </p></section><section><p>\n              LLM Skirmish was conducted using <a href=\"https://opencode.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OpenCode</a>, \n              an open source general purpose agentic coding harness. OpenCode was selected because it was not \n              designed for any of the evaluated models and is fully open source to aid in replicability.\n            </p><p>\n              Each LLM agent runs in an isolated Docker container with OpenCode providing the coding environment. \n              The orchestrator coordinates the tournament by sending prompts to each agent, which then uses \n              OpenCode's tools (file editing, shell commands, etc.) to write and submit their game scripts.\n            </p><p>\n              At the start of each round, agents receive \n              <a href=\"https://github.com/llmskirmish/skirmish/blob/main/prompts/OBJECTIVE.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OBJECTIVE.md</a> \n              (the game rules, API documentation, and instructions for writing a game script) and \n              <a href=\"https://github.com/llmskirmish/skirmish/blob/main/prompts/NEXT_ROUND.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NEXT_ROUND.md</a> \n              (instructions for reviewing match logs from the previous round, rounds 2-5 only). \n              Agents are also provided with <a href=\"https://github.com/llmskirmish/skirmish/tree/main/example_strategies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">two example strategies</a> as reference.\n            </p><p>\n              After each agent creates their strategy, the orchestrator validates the script. If validation fails, the agent \n              receives the error message and has up to 3 attempts to fix the issue before the round proceeds.\n            </p></section><section><p>\n              LLM Skirmish tests in-context learning, as each tournament lasts five rounds and models are \n              able to alter strategies between rounds. One would hypothesize that if a model is successfully \n              learning in context, scripts written after seeing previous results (as in rounds 2–5) would be \n              of higher quality compared to scripts written in round 1.\n            </p><p>\n              Across all tournaments, each model submits 25 scripts for a total of 250 matches. In a tournament, \n              we consider each model to be a player. If we treat each script as a player and have all scripts \n              play against each other, we can simulate 7,750 matches to get a robust per-round average win rate \n              (a proxy for script quality).\n            </p><div><div><h3>Script Round vs Performance</h3></div></div><p>\n              We can see that four of the five models evaluated have notable increases in average win rate \n              between round 1 and round 5 (Claude Opus 4.5 +20%, GLM 4.7 +16%, GPT 5.2 +7%, Grok 4.1 Fast +6%).\n            </p><p>\n              Gemini 3 Pro's performance presents an anomaly. Its round 1 average win rate was 70% (higher \n              than all four other evaluated models), while its round 2-5 average win rate was 15% (lower than \n              all four other evaluated models). Gemini 3 Pro's round 1 scripts are approximately four times \n              shorter than those of top-performing models Claude 4.5 Opus and GPT 5.2. A qualitative review of \n              Gemini 3 Pro's scripts suggests it had success with simplistic strategies in round 1. In rounds \n              2-5, compared to the other four models evaluated, Gemini 3 Pro most aggressively populated its \n              context with previous round results before submitting its script for that round, suggesting that \n              context rot was a notable contributor to the performance variance. Whether this context rot reflects \n              other models being better at planning tool use than Gemini 3 Pro, or whether OpenCode is a \n              uniquely inhospitable harness for Gemini 3 Pro, is worth investigating further in future versions \n              of LLM Skirmish.\n            </p></section><section><p>\n              API costs vary significantly across models. The chart below plots each model's \n              average cost per round against its ELO rating. Claude Opus 4.5 achieved the highest \n              ELO (1778) but at the highest cost ($4.12/round). GPT 5.2 delivers nearly 1.7x more \n              ELO per dollar than Claude Opus 4.5.\n            </p></section>",

I have lots of them. Going for walks with them every day and trying to get them to perform neat tricks.\nHowever, sometimes they  and they don’t do the tricks we want them to do. This bad behaviour often comes from  from the environment around us. After all, our dogs can perform best when they are  on their task, . That’s when they really shine ✨🐶✨.</p><p>When working with Claude Code, having an eye on your context window is a must.\nSeeing those context windows fill up pretty quickly, you start to realize this needs to be optimized so you can have longer/better sessions (with less  a.k.a. context rot). Then a brick hits you in the face when it dawns on you that all of our tools are dumping crazy amounts of non-relevant context into  thereby polluting your context windows. Let’s illustrate this with a very specific use case.</p><p>We have a Typescript monorepo which uses <a href=\"https://turborepo.dev/\">turbo</a> for build management. It works fine. However, it used to dump all of its build output to <em>for each individual package</em>. Here is the  dump of a single  command (package names replaced):</p><p>The total number of  of this build output is  (roughly 750 tokens). All completely irrelevant for an LLM ( the build passes, but I’ll come back to this). The turbo-output contains 3 different sections which you want to stuff into a black hole:</p><ol><li>the build output for each package</li></ol><p>So you start to optimize…</p><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>// turbo.json\n{\n    \"tasks\": {\n        \"build\": {\n            \"outputLogs\": \"errors-only\", ...\n        }, ...\n    }\n}\n</code></pre><p>That will take care of all the build output being stripped away in the image above (#3)\nThat ugly  block needs to go as well. You dig through the options and find out you can set <code>TURBO_NO_UPDATE_NOTIFIER=1</code> environment variable. Good, but where do we set it? You remember Claude Code got you covered because you can set environment variables in the  file so these are scoped nicely for the Agent sessions. You end up with:</p><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>// .claude/settings.json\n{\n    \"env\": {\n        \"TURBO_NO_UPDATE_NOTIFIER\": \"1\"\n    },\n    ...\n}\n</code></pre><p>Great, we were able to eliminate that update-block (#1), but how do we get rid of those 44 package names (#2)? Surely <a href=\"https://github.com/vercel/turborepo/discussions/11279\">SOMEONE must have asked this same question before</a>? Unfortunately no luck here. For now, it keeps dumping irrelevant  data into your context windows…</p><p>But wait! YourBestFriend (Claude) got your back!

      "content": "<div><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">Anthropic, the wildly successful AI company that has cast itself as the most safety-conscious of the top research labs, is dropping the central pledge of its flagship safety policy, company officials tell TIME.</p><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">In 2023, Anthropic committed to never train an AI system unless it could guarantee in advance that the company’s safety measures were adequate. For years, its leaders <a href=\"https://time.com/collections/time100-companies-2024/6980000/anthropic-2/\">touted</a> that promise—the central pillar of their Responsible Scaling Policy (RSP)—as evidence that they are a responsible company that would withstand market incentives to rush to develop a potentially dangerous technology.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">But in recent months the company decided to radically overhaul the RSP. That decision included scrapping the promise to not release AI models if Anthropic can’t guarantee proper risk mitigations in advance. </p><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">“We felt that it wouldn't actually help anyone for us to stop training AI models,” Anthropic’s chief science officer Jared Kaplan told TIME in an exclusive interview. “We didn't really feel, with the rapid advance of AI, that it made sense for us to make unilateral commitments … if competitors are blazing ahead.”</p><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">The new version of the policy, which TIME reviewed, includes commitments to be more transparent about the safety risks of AI, including making additional disclosures about how Anthropic’s own models fare in safety testing. It commits to matching or surpassing the safety efforts of competitors. And it promises to “delay” Anthropic’s AI development if leaders both consider Anthropic to be leader of the AI race and think the risks of catastrophe to be significant.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">But overall, the change to the RSP leaves Anthropic far less constrained by its own safety policies, which previously categorically barred it from training models above a certain level if appropriate safety measures weren’t already in place.</p><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">The change comes as Anthropic, previously considered to be behind OpenAI in the AI race, rides the high of a string of technological and commercial successes. Its Claude models, especially the software-writing tool Claude Code, have won legions of devoted fans. In February, Anthropic raised $30 billion in new investments, valuing it at some $380 billion, and reported that its annualized revenue was growing at a rate of 10x per year. The company’s core business model of selling direct to businesses is seen by many investors as more credible than OpenAI’s main strategy of monetizing a vast consumer user base.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">Kaplan, the Anthropic executive and co-founder, denied the company’s decision to change course was a capitulation to market incentives as the race for superintelligence accelerates. He framed it instead as a pragmatic response to emerging political and scientific realities. “I don’t think we’re making any kind of U-turn,” Kaplan says.</p></div><div><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\"><strong>When Anthropic introduced</strong> the RSP in 2023, Kaplan says, the company hoped it would encourage rivals to adopt similar measures. (No rivals made quite as overt a promise to pause AI development, but many published lengthy reports detailing their plans to mitigate risk, which Kaplan chalks up as Anthropic exerting a good influence on the industry.) Executives also hoped the approach might eventually serve as a blueprint for binding national regulations or even international treaties, Kaplan claims. </p><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">But those regulations never materialized. Instead, the Trump Administration has endorsed a let-it-rip attitude to AI development, even going so far as to attempt to nullify state regulations. No federal AI law is on the horizon. And while a global governance framework may have seemed possible in 2023, three years later <a href=\"https://time.com/7379949/india-ai-impact-summit-us-china-middle-powers/\">it has become clear</a> that door has closed. Meanwhile, competition for AI supremacy—between companies but also between nations—has only intensified.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">To make matters worse, the science of AI evaluations has proven more complicated than Anthropic expected when it first crafted the RSP. The arrival of powerful new models meant that, in 2025, Anthropic announced it could not rule out the possibility of these models facilitating a bio-terrorist attack. But while they couldn’t rule it out, they also lacked strong scientific evidence that models  pose that kind of danger, which made it difficult to convince governments and rivals of what they saw as the need to act carefully. What the company had previously imagined might look like a bright red line was instead coming into focus as a fuzzy gradient.&nbsp;</p><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">For nearly a year, Anthropic executives discussed ways to reshape their flagship safety policy to match this new environment, Kaplan says. One point they kept coming back to was their founding premise: the idea that to do proper AI safety research, they had to build models at the frontier of capability—even though doing so might accelerate the arrival of the dangers they feared.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">In February, according to Kaplan, Amodei decided that keeping the company from training new models while competitors raced ahead would be helpful to nobody. “If one AI developer paused development to implement safety measures while others moved forward training and deploying AI systems without strong mitigations, that could result in a world that is less safe,” the new version of the RSP, approved unanimously by Amodei and Anthropic’s board, states in its introduction. “The developers with the weakest protections would set the pace, and responsible developers would lose their ability to do safety research.”</p></div><div><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\"><strong>Chris Painter, the director</strong> of policy at METR, a nonprofit focused on evaluating AI models for risky behavior, reviewed an early draft of the policy with Anthropic’s permission. He says the change is understandable — but also a bearish signal for the world’s ability to navigate potential AI catastrophes. The change to the RSP shows Anthropic “believes it needs to shift into triage mode with its safety plans, because methods to assess and mitigate risk are not keeping up with the pace of capabilities,” Painter tells TIME. “This is more evidence that society is not prepared for the potential catastrophic risks posed by AI.”</p></div><div><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">Anthropic argues the retooled RSP is designed to keep the biggest benefits of the old one. For example, by constraining itself from releasing new models, Anthropic’s original RSP also incentivized it to quickly build safety mitigations. (Because otherwise the company would be unable to sell its AI to customers.) Anthropic says it believes it can maintain that incentive. The new policy commits the company to regularly release what it calls “Frontier Safety Roadmaps”: documents laying out a list of detailed goals for future safety measures it hopes to build.</p><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">“We hope to create a forcing function for work that would otherwise be challenging to appropriately prioritize and resource, as it requires collaboration (and in some cases sacrifices) from multiple parts of the company and can be at cross-purposes with immediate competitive and commercial priorities,” the new RSP states.</p><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">Anthropic says it will also commit to publishing so-called “Risk Reports” every three to six months. The reports, the company says, will “explain how capabilities, threat models (the specific ways that models might pose threats), and active risk mitigations fit together, and provide an assessment of the overall level of risk.” These documents will be more in-depth than the reports the company already publishes, a spokesperson tells TIME.</p></div><div><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">“I like the emphasis on transparent risk reporting and publicly verifiable safety roadmaps,” says Painter, the METR policy official. But he said he was “concerned” that moving away from binary thresholds under the previous RSP, by which the arrival of a certain capability could act as a tripwire to temporarily halt Anthropic’s AI development, might enable a “frog-boiling” effect, where danger slowly ramps up without a single moment that sets off alarms.&nbsp;</p><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">Asked whether Anthropic was caving to market pressure, Kaplan argued that, in fact, Anthropic was making a renewed commitment to developing AI safely. “If all of our competitors are transparently doing the right thing when it comes to catastrophic risk, we are committed to doing as well or better,” he said. “But we don't think it makes sense for us to stop engaging with AI research, AI safety, and most likely lose relevance as an innovator who understands the frontier of the technology, in a scenario where others are going ahead and we're not actually contributing any additional risk to the ecosystem.”</p></div>",

Hegseth gave Dario Amodei, the Anthropic CEO, until the end of the day on Friday to agree to the department’s terms or face penalties, <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2026/02/24/anthropic-pentagon-claude-hegseth-dario\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Axios </a>reported.</p><p>Anthropic, which presents itself as the most <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/jan/27/wake-up-to-the-risks-of-ai-they-are-almost-here-anthropic-boss-warns\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">safety-forward</a> of the leading AI companies, has been mired in weeks of disagreement with the Pentagon over how the military is allowed to use its large language model, Claude. US defense officials have pushed for unfettered access to Claude’s capabilities, while Anthropic has <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/woke-ai-spat-escalates-between-pentagon-and-anthropic-433b7c5c\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">reportedly resisted</a> allowing its product to be used for mass surveillance or autonomous weapons systems that can use AI to kill people without human input. The Department of Defense (DoD) has integrated Claude into its operations, but has threatened to sever the relationship over what its top brass perceives as roadblocks erected by Anthropic.</p><p>At stake in the negotiations is whether the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/artificialintelligenceai\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">AI</a> industry will push back against government demand for the military use of their products, something that has long been controversial among researchers and ethical AI advocates. Defense officials have already <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2026/02/16/anthropic-defense-department-relationship-hegseth\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">threatened punitive measures</a> against Anthropic if it does not comply, including canceling a huge contract with the company and designating it a “supply chain risk”.</p><p>The DoD <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/14/us-military-xai-deal-elon-musk\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">struck deals with several major</a> AI firms including Anthropic, Google and OpenAI in July last year, offering them contracts worth up to $200m. Until this week, however, Anthropic’s Claude product was the only model permitted for use in the military’s classified systems. The DoD <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2026/02/23/ai-defense-department-deal-musk-xai-grok\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">signed a deal on Monday</a> that allowed the use in classified systems by military personnel of Elon Musk’s xAI chatbot, which has faced recent backlash over producing sexualized images of children.</p><p>Both xAI and OpenAI have agreed to the government’s terms on the uses of their AI, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2026/02/22/pentagon-anthropic-ai-dispute/\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">according</a> to he Washington Post, with a defense official stating that OpenAI had allowed its model to be used for “all lawful purposes”. OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment on their agreement with the government.</p><p>The meeting between Anthropic and the Pentagon is taking place a month after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-military\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\">US military</a> reportedly used Claude to assist in its capture of the Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro. There has been a widespread push from the Trump administration to integrate AI into the military, while Donald Trump has repeatedly vowed that the US will win a global AI arms race to dominate the technology.</p><p>Emil Michael, the Pentagon’s chief technology officer and a former Uber executive, has publicly campaigned for Anthropic to “cross the Rubicon” and agree to the government’s terms.</p><p>“I think if someone wants to make money from the government, from the US Department of War, those guardrails ought to be tuned for our use cases – so long as they’re lawful,” Michael told Defense Scoop last week.</p><p>Anthropic’s Amodei has meanwhile long spoken out in favor of greater regulation on AI, while his company has backed a political action committee advocating for stronger safeguards over artificial intelligence. Amodei opposed Trump during the 2024 US presidential campaign and Anthropic has hired several former Biden staffers, which <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/woke-ai-spat-escalates-between-pentagon-and-anthropic-433b7c5c\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">the Wall Street Journal reported</a> was a contributing factor in a pro-Trump venture capital firm backing out of investing in Anthropic earlier this year.</p><p>The Pentagon has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/jul/14/ais-oppenheimer-moment-autonomous-weapons-enter-the-battlefield\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">poured billions of dollars in recent years</a> into pursuing AI-enabled technologies ranging from unmanned aerial drones to automated targeting systems. The advancement of these technologies has accelerated ethical questions around how much decision-making power to cede to AI when it comes to lethal force. These debates are no longer theoretical, with fighting in Ukraine featuring <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/31/magazine/ukraine-ai-drones-war-russia.html\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">deadly semiautonomous drones</a> that can operate without human control.</p>",

      "content": "<h2 dir=\"ltr\">The fastest reasoning LLM, powered by diffusion</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">Today, we're introducing Mercury 2 — the world's fastest reasoning language model, built to make production AI feel instant.</p><h3 dir=\"ltr\">Why speed matters more now</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Production AI isn't one prompt and one answer anymore. It's loops: agents, retrieval pipelines, and extraction jobs running in the background at volume. In loops, latency doesn’t show up once. It compounds across every step, every user, every retry.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Yet current LLMs still share the same bottleneck: autoregressive, sequential decoding. One token at a time, left to right.</p><h3 dir=\"ltr\">A new foundation: Diffusion for real-time reasoning</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Mercury 2 doesn't decode sequentially. It generates responses through parallel refinement, producing multiple tokens simultaneously and converging over a small number of steps. Less typewriter, more editor revising a full draft at once. The result: &gt;5x faster generation with a fundamentally different speed curve.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">That speed advantage also changes the reasoning trade-off. Today, higher intelligence means more test-time compute — longer chains, more samples, more retries — bought at the direct expense of latency and cost. Diffusion-based reasoning gets you reasoning-grade quality inside real-time latency budgets.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Mercury 2 shifts the quality-speed curve for production deployments:</p><ul dir=\"auto\"><li data-preset-tag=\"p\"><p> 1,009 tokens/sec on NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs</p></li><li data-preset-tag=\"p\"><p> $0.25/1M input tokens · $0.75/1M output tokens</p></li><li data-preset-tag=\"p\"><p>: competitive with leading speed-optimized models</p></li><li data-preset-tag=\"p\"><p>: tunable reasoning · 128K context · native tool use · schema-aligned JSON output</p></li></ul><img alt=\"\" width=\"973\" height=\"391\" src=\"https://framerusercontent.com/images/KUQ2ijMteh6pTFCieisdOx9s.png\" srcset=\"https://framerusercontent.com/images/KUQ2ijMteh6pTFCieisdOx9s.png?scale-down-to=512&amp;width=1947&amp;height=783 512w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/KUQ2ijMteh6pTFCieisdOx9s.png?scale-down-to=1024&amp;width=1947&amp;height=783 1024w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/KUQ2ijMteh6pTFCieisdOx9s.png?width=1947&amp;height=783 1947w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1024px) 100vw, (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023.98px) 100vw, (max-width: 767.98px) 100vw\"><img alt=\"\" width=\"1246\" height=\"598\" src=\"https://framerusercontent.com/images/vUhManfsMjNnhb8We1IfhRGbfr8.png\" srcset=\"https://framerusercontent.com/images/vUhManfsMjNnhb8We1IfhRGbfr8.png?scale-down-to=512&amp;width=2493&amp;height=1197 512w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/vUhManfsMjNnhb8We1IfhRGbfr8.png?scale-down-to=1024&amp;width=2493&amp;height=1197 1024w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/vUhManfsMjNnhb8We1IfhRGbfr8.png?scale-down-to=2048&amp;width=2493&amp;height=1197 2048w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/vUhManfsMjNnhb8We1IfhRGbfr8.png?width=2493&amp;height=1197 2493w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1024px) 100vw, (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023.98px) 100vw, (max-width: 767.98px) 100vw\"><p dir=\"auto\">We optimize for speed users actually feel: responsiveness in the moments users experience - p95 latency under high concurrency, consistent turn-to-turn behavior, and stable throughput when systems get busy.</p><div data-width=\"fill\"><div><div data-framer-name=\"Variant 1\"><div data-framer-component-type=\"RichTextContainer\"><p dir=\"auto\">“Inception’s Mercury 2 demonstrates what’s possible when new model architecture meets NVIDIA AI infrastructure.

The hep-th arxiv apocalypse is not here yet.</em></p><p>For a while now I’ve been speculating about what would happen when AI agents started being able to write papers indistinguishable in quality from those that have been typical of the sad state of hep-th for quite a while.  Sabine Hossenfelder today has <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvgaZ_myFE4\">AI Is Bringing “The End of Theory”</a>, in which she gives her cynical take that the past system of grant-holding PIs using grad students/postdocs to produce lots of mediocre papers with the PI’s name on them is about to change dramatically.  Once AI agents can produce mediocre papers much more quickly than the grad students/postdocs, then anyone can play and we’ll get flooded by such papers from not just those PIs, but everyone else.</p><p>I decided to take a look at the arXiv hep-th submissions, and quickly generated the following numbers, by simple searches using\nhttps://arxiv.org/search/advanced<p>\nto find all hep-th submissions in various date ranges. </p></p><p>For 12/1 to 12/31 the numbers were\n2022: 634\n2024: 780</p><p>For 1/1 to 2/1\n2022:583\n2024:626\n2026:1137</p><p>For 2/1 to 2/15\n2022:299\n2024:271\n2026:581</p><p>From this very limited data it looks like submission numbers in the last couple months have nearly doubled with respect to the stable numbers of previous years.</p><p>I thought about spending more time I don’t have lookng into this, then realized “this is a job for AI!”.  Surely an AI agent could do a lot better job than me in gathering such data, figuring out things like whether you can recognize the AI agent papers or not, and writing up a detailed analysis. I’m still resisting learning how to use AI agents, so someone else will have to do this.</p><p>One of my main problems with the comments here has been that it’s increasingly hard to tell the difference between human and AI generated ones. In this case, maybe the AI generated ones would be better than those from meatspace.  So, unless you have something really substantive (like an explanation for why these numbers don’t mean what it looks like they mean, or know what the arXiv is doing about this) please resist commenting.  I’ll moderate comments for things like irrelevance and hallucinations, but won’t delete comments just because they are non-human.</p>",

      "content": "<p><sub><i>*This post was updated at 12:35 pm PT to fix a typo in the build time benchmarks.</i></sub></p><p>Last week, one engineer and an AI model rebuilt the most popular front-end framework from scratch. The result, <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/vinext\"></a> (pronounced \"vee-next\"), is a drop-in replacement for Next.js, built on <a href=\"https://vite.dev/\"></a>, that deploys to Cloudflare Workers with a single command. In early benchmarks, it builds production apps up to 4x faster and produces client bundles up to 57% smaller. And we already have customers running it in production.&nbsp;</p><p>The whole thing cost about $1,100 in tokens.</p><div><h2>The Next.js deployment problem</h2><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/vinext/#the-next-js-deployment-problem\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a></div><p><a href=\"https://nextjs.org/\"></a> is the most popular React framework. Millions of developers use it. It powers a huge chunk of the production web, and for good reason. The developer experience is top-notch.</p><p>But Next.js has a deployment problem when used in the broader serverless ecosystem. The tooling is entirely bespoke: Next.js has invested heavily in Turbopack but if you want to deploy it to Cloudflare, Netlify, or AWS Lambda, you have to take that build output and reshape it into something the target platform can actually run.</p><p>If you’re thinking: “Isn’t that what OpenNext does?”, you are correct.&nbsp;</p><p>That is indeed the problem <a href=\"https://opennext.js.org/\"></a> was built to solve. And a lot of engineering effort has gone into OpenNext from multiple providers, including us at Cloudflare. It works, but quickly runs into limitations and becomes a game of whack-a-mole.&nbsp;</p><p>Building on top of Next.js output as a foundation has proven to be a difficult and fragile approach. Because OpenNext has to reverse-engineer Next.js's build output, this results in unpredictable changes between versions that take a lot of work to correct.&nbsp;</p><p>Next.js has been working on a first-class adapters API, and we've been collaborating with them on it. It's still an early effort but even with adapters, you're still building on the bespoke Turbopack toolchain. And adapters only cover build and deploy. During development, next dev runs exclusively in Node.js with no way to plug in a different runtime. If your application uses platform-specific APIs like Durable Objects, KV, or AI bindings, you can't test that code in dev without workarounds.</p><p>What if instead of adapting Next.js output, we reimplemented the Next.js API surface on <a href=\"https://vite.dev/\"></a> directly? Vite is the build tool used by most of the front-end ecosystem outside of Next.js, powering frameworks like Astro, SvelteKit, Nuxt, and Remix. A clean reimplementation, not merely a wrapper or adapter. We honestly didn't think it would work. But it’s 2026, and the cost of building software has completely changed.</p><p>We got a lot further than we expected.</p><p>Replace  with  in your scripts and everything else stays the same. Your existing , , and  work as-is.</p><pre><code>vinext dev          # Development server with HMR\nvinext build        # Production build\nvinext deploy       # Build and deploy to Cloudflare Workers</code></pre><p>This is not a wrapper around Next.js and Turbopack output. It's an alternative implementation of the API surface: routing, server rendering, React Server Components, server actions, caching, middleware. All of it built on top of Vite as a plugin. Most importantly Vite output runs on any platform thanks to the <a href=\"https://vite.dev/guide/api-environment\"></a>.</p><p>Early benchmarks are promising. We compared vinext against Next.js 16 using a shared 33-route App Router application.\n\nBoth frameworks are doing the same work: compiling, bundling, and preparing server-rendered routes. We disabled TypeScript type checking and ESLint in Next.js's build (Vite doesn't run these during builds), and used force-dynamic so Next.js doesn't spend extra time pre-rendering static routes, which would unfairly slow down its numbers. The goal was to measure only bundler and compilation speed, nothing else. Benchmarks run on GitHub CI on every merge to main. </p><div><table><tbody><tr><td></td></tr><tr></tr><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p><b>Client bundle size (gzipped):</b></p><div><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table></div><p>These benchmarks measure compilation and bundling speed, not production serving performance. The test fixture is a single 33-route app, not a representative sample of all production applications. We expect these numbers to evolve as three projects continue to develop. The <a href=\"https://benchmarks.vinext.workers.dev\"><u>full methodology and historical results</u></a> are public. Take them as directional, not definitive.</p><p>The direction is encouraging, though. Vite's architecture, and especially <a href=\"https://rolldown.rs/\"></a> (the Rust-based bundler coming in Vite 8), has structural advantages for build performance that show up clearly here.</p><div><h2>Deploying to Cloudflare Workers</h2><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/vinext/#deploying-to-cloudflare-workers\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a></div><p>vinext is built with Cloudflare Workers as the first deployment target. A single command takes you from source code to a running Worker:</p><p>This handles everything: builds the application, auto-generates the Worker configuration, and deploys. Both the App Router and Pages Router work on Workers, with full client-side hydration, interactive components, client-side navigation, React state.</p><p>For production caching, vinext includes a Cloudflare KV cache handler that gives you ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) out of the box:</p><pre><code>import { KVCacheHandler } from \"vinext/cloudflare\";\nimport { setCacheHandler } from \"next/cache\";\n\nsetCacheHandler(new KVCacheHandler(env.MY_KV_NAMESPACE));</code></pre><p><a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv/\"></a> is a good default for most applications, but the caching layer is designed to be pluggable. That setCacheHandler call means you can swap in whatever backend makes sense. <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/\"></a> might be a better fit for apps with large cached payloads or different access patterns. We're also working on improvements to our Cache API that should provide a strong caching layer with less configuration. The goal is flexibility: pick the caching strategy that fits your app.</p><p>Live examples running right now:</p><p>We also have <a href=\"https://next-agents.threepointone.workers.dev/\"></a> of Cloudflare Agents running in a Next.js app, without the need for workarounds like <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/api/#getplatformproxy\"></a>, since the entire app now runs in workerd, during both dev and deploy phases. This means being able to use Durable Objects, AI bindings, and every other Cloudflare-specific service without compromise. <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/vinext-agents-example\"></a></p><div><h2>Frameworks are a team sport</h2><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/vinext/#frameworks-are-a-team-sport\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a></div><p>The current deployment target is Cloudflare Workers, but that's a small part of the picture. Something like 95% of vinext is pure Vite. The routing, the module shims, the SSR pipeline, the RSC integration: none of it is Cloudflare-specific.</p><p>Cloudflare is looking to work with other hosting providers about adopting this toolchain for their customers (the lift is minimal — we got a proof-of-concept working on <a href=\"https://vinext-on-vercel.vercel.app/\"></a> in less than 30 minutes!). This is an open-source project, and for its long term success, we believe it’s important we work with partners across the ecosystem to ensure ongoing investment. PRs from other platforms are welcome. If you're interested in adding a deployment target, <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/vinext/issues\"></a> or reach out.</p><p>We want to be clear: vinext is experimental. It's not even one week old, and it has not yet been battle-tested with any meaningful traffic at scale. If you're evaluating it for a production application, proceed with appropriate caution.</p><p>That said, the test suite is extensive: over 1,700 Vitest tests and 380 Playwright E2E tests, including tests ported directly from the Next.js test suite and OpenNext's Cloudflare conformance suite. We’ve verified it against the Next.js App Router Playground. Coverage sits at 94% of the Next.js 16 API surface.\n\nEarly results from real-world customers are encouraging. We've been working with <a href=\"https://ndstudio.gov/\"></a>, a team that's aiming to modernize every government interface, on one of their beta sites, <a href=\"https://www.cio.gov/\"></a>. They're already running vinext in production, with meaningful improvements in build times and bundle sizes.</p><div><h2>What about pre-rendering?</h2><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/vinext/#what-about-pre-rendering\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a></div><p>vinext already supports Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) out of the box. After the first request to any page, it's cached and revalidated in the background, just like Next.js. That part works today.</p><p>vinext does not yet support static pre-rendering at build time. In Next.js, pages without dynamic data get rendered during  and served as static HTML. If you have dynamic routes, you use  to enumerate which pages to build ahead of time. vinext doesn't do that… yet.</p><p>This was an intentional design decision for launch. It's  <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/vinext/issues/9\">on the roadmap</a>, but if your site is 100% prebuilt HTML with static content, you probably won't see much benefit from vinext today. That said, if one engineer can spend 1,100 in tokens and rebuild Next.js, you can probably spend $10 and migrate to a Vite-based framework designed specifically for static content, like <a href=\"https://astro.build/\">Astro</a> (which <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/astro-joins-cloudflare/\">also deploys to Cloudflare Workers</a>).</p><p>For sites that aren't purely static, though, we think we can do something better than pre-rendering everything at build time.</p><div><h2>Introducing Traffic-aware Pre-Rendering</h2><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/vinext/#introducing-traffic-aware-pre-rendering\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a></div><p>Next.js pre-renders every page listed in  during the build. A site with 10,000 product pages means 10,000 renders at build time, even though 99% of those pages may never receive a request. Builds scale linearly with page count. This is why large Next.js sites end up with 30-minute builds.</p><p>So we built <b>Traffic-aware Pre-Rendering</b> (TPR). It's experimental today, and we plan to make it the default once we have more real-world testing behind it.</p><p>The idea is simple. Cloudflare is already the reverse proxy for your site. We have your traffic data. We know which pages actually get visited. So instead of pre-rendering everything or pre-rendering nothing, vinext queries Cloudflare's zone analytics at deploy time and pre-renders only the pages that matter.</p><pre><code>vinext deploy --experimental-tpr\n\n  Building...\n  Build complete (4.2s)\n\n  TPR (experimental): Analyzing traffic for my-store.com (last 24h)\n  TPR: 12,847 unique paths — 184 pages cover 90% of traffic\n  TPR: Pre-rendering 184 pages...\n  TPR: Pre-rendered 184 pages in 8.3s → KV cache\n\n  Deploying to Cloudflare Workers...\n</code></pre><p>For a site with 100,000 product pages, the power law means 90% of traffic usually goes to 50 to 200 pages. Those get pre-rendered in seconds. Everything else falls back to on-demand SSR and gets cached via ISR after the first request. Every new deploy refreshes the set based on current traffic patterns. Pages that go viral get picked up automatically. All of this works without  and without coupling your build to your production database.</p><div><h2>Taking on the Next.js challenge, but this time with AI</h2><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/vinext/#taking-on-the-next-js-challenge-but-this-time-with-ai\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a></div><p>A project like this would normally take a team of engineers months, if not years. Several teams at various companies have attempted it, and the scope is just enormous. We tried once at Cloudflare! Two routers, 33+ module shims, server rendering pipelines, RSC streaming, file-system routing, middleware, caching, static export. There's a reason nobody has pulled it off.</p><p>This time we did it in under a week. One engineer (technically engineering manager) directing AI.</p><p>The first commit landed on February 13. By the end of that same evening, both the Pages Router and App Router had basic SSR working, along with middleware, server actions, and streaming. By the next afternoon, <a href=\"https://app-router-playground.vinext.workers.dev\"></a> was rendering 10 of 11 routes. By day three,  was shipping apps to Cloudflare Workers with full client hydration. The rest of the week was hardening: fixing edge cases, expanding the test suite, bringing API coverage to 94%.</p><p>What changed from those earlier attempts? AI got better. Way better.</p><div><h2>Why this problem is made for AI</h2><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/vinext/#why-this-problem-is-made-for-ai\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a></div><p>Not every project would go this way. This one did because a few things happened to line up at the right time.</p><p><b>Next.js is well-specified.</b> It has extensive documentation, a massive user base, and years of Stack Overflow answers and tutorials. The API surface is all over the training data. When you ask Claude to implement  or explain how  works, it doesn't hallucinate. It knows how Next works.</p><p><b>Next.js has an elaborate test suite.</b> The <a href=\"https://github.com/vercel/next.js\"></a> contains thousands of E2E tests covering every feature and edge case. We ported tests directly from their suite (you can see the attribution in the code). This gave us a specification we could verify against mechanically.</p><p><b>Vite is an excellent foundation.</b><a href=\"https://vite.dev/\"></a> handles the hard parts of front-end tooling: fast HMR, native ESM, a clean plugin API, production bundling. We didn't have to build a bundler. We just had to teach it to speak Next.js. <a href=\"https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-rsc\"></a> is still early, but it gave us React Server Components support without having to build an RSC implementation from scratch.</p><p> We don't think this would have been possible even a few months ago. Earlier models couldn't sustain coherence across a codebase this size. New models can hold the full architecture in context, reason about how modules interact, and produce correct code often enough to keep momentum going. At times, I saw it go into Next, Vite, and React internals to figure out a bug. The state-of-the-art models are impressive, and they seem to keep getting better.</p><p>All of those things had to be true at the same time. Well-documented target API, comprehensive test suite, solid build tool underneath, and a model that could actually handle the complexity. Take any one of them away and this doesn't work nearly as well.</p><p>Almost every line of code in vinext was written by AI. But here's the thing that matters more: every line passes the same quality gates you'd expect from human-written code. The project has 1,700+ Vitest tests, 380 Playwright E2E tests, full TypeScript type checking via tsgo, and linting via oxlint. Continuous integration runs all of it on every pull request. Establishing a set of good guardrails is critical to making AI productive in a codebase.</p><p>The process started with a plan. I spent a couple of hours going back and forth with Claude in <a href=\"https://opencode.ai\"></a> to define the architecture: what to build, in what order, which abstractions to use. That plan became the north star. From there, the workflow was straightforward:</p><ol><li><p>Define a task (\"implement the  shim with usePathname, , \").</p></li><li><p>Let the AI write the implementation and tests.</p></li><li><p>If tests pass, merge. If not, give the AI the error output and let it iterate.</p></li></ol><p>We wired up AI agents for code review too. When a PR was opened, an agent reviewed it. When review comments came back, another agent addressed them. The feedback loop was mostly automated. </p><p>It didn't work perfectly every time. There were PRs that were just wrong. The AI would confidently implement something that seemed right but didn't match actual Next.js behavior. I had to course-correct regularly. Architecture decisions, prioritization, knowing when the AI was headed down a dead end: that was all me. When you give AI good direction, good context, and good guardrails, it can be very productive. But the human still has to steer.</p><p>For browser-level testing, I used <a href=\"https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser\"></a> to verify actual rendered output, client-side navigation, and hydration behavior. Unit tests miss a lot of subtle browser issues. This caught them.</p><p>Over the course of the project, we ran over 800 sessions in OpenCode. Total cost: roughly $1,100 in Claude API tokens.</p><div><h2>What this means for software</h2><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/vinext/#what-this-means-for-software\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a></div><p>Why do we have so many layers in the stack? This project forced me to think deeply about this question. And to consider how AI impacts the answer.</p><p>Most abstractions in software exist because humans need help. We couldn't hold the whole system in our heads, so we built layers to manage the complexity for us. Each layer made the next person's job easier. That's how you end up with frameworks on top of frameworks, wrapper libraries, thousands of lines of glue code.</p><p>AI doesn't have the same limitation. It can hold the whole system in context and just write the code. It doesn't need an intermediate framework to stay organized. It just needs a spec and a foundation to build on.</p><p>It's not clear yet which abstractions are truly foundational and which ones were just crutches for human cognition. That line is going to shift a lot over the next few years. But vinext is a data point. We took an API contract, a build tool, and an AI model, and the AI wrote everything in between. No intermediate framework needed. We think this pattern will repeat across a lot of software. The layers we've built up over the years aren't all going to make it.</p><p>Thanks to the Vite team. <a href=\"https://vite.dev/\"></a> is the foundation this whole thing stands on. <a href=\"https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-rsc\"></a> is still early days, but it gave me RSC support without having to build that from scratch, which would have been a dealbreaker. The Vite maintainers were responsive and helpful as I pushed the plugin into territory it hadn't been tested in before.</p><p>We also want to acknowledge the <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/\"></a> team. They've spent years building a framework that raised the bar for what React development could look like. The fact that their API surface is so well-documented and their test suite so comprehensive is a big part of what made this project possible. vinext wouldn't exist without the standard they set.</p><p>vinext includes an <a href=\"https://agentskills.io\"></a> that handles migration for you. It works with Claude Code, OpenCode, Cursor, Codex, and dozens of other AI coding tools. Install it, open your Next.js project, and tell the AI to migrate:</p><pre><code>npx skills add cloudflare/vinext</code></pre><p>Then open your Next.js project in any supported tool and say:</p><pre><code>migrate this project to vinext</code></pre><p>The skill handles compatibility checking, dependency installation, config generation, and dev server startup. It knows what vinext supports and will flag anything that needs manual attention.</p><p>Or if you prefer doing it by hand:</p><pre><code>npx vinext init    # Migrate an existing Next.js project\nnpx vinext dev     # Start the dev server\nnpx vinext deploy  # Ship to Cloudflare Workers</code></pre>",

      "content": "<p>We spent July through November of 2024 training our own Image-Video VAE — fighting through months of NaNs, mysterious splotches, and co-training instability in the pursuit of better reconstruction quality, which (as it turns out) isn't as important as we thought.</p><p>While we ended up using Wan 2.1's VAE for our most recent <a href=\"https://www.linum.ai/field-notes/launch-linum-v2\">text-to-video model</a> (more on that later), we still think there's a lot to learn from the process of building a VAE given how important they are to latent diffusion models.</p><p>Today, we're releasing our Image-Video VAE and digging into the gory details: how we built it, what broke along the way, and how we're approaching our next VAE in 2026.</p><p>As of today, the best generative image and video models rely on diffusion to iteratively transform random Gaussian noise into samples. These models either produce tokens one at a time or all at once in parallel. Either way, transformers are the backbone. So, we're paying the cost of attention, which scales quadratically with sequence length.</p><p>That gets expensive fast. Take a 720p, 5-second video at 24 FPS:</p><p>110M tokens for a short clip is absurd.</p><p><mark>To make the problem tractable for the diffusion transformer, we need to compress images and videos into a smaller, continuous latent space</mark>. That's where VAEs come into play.</p><p>An autoencoder compresses an input  into a smaller representation  through an encoder, then tries to reconstruct the original from  through a decoder. The bottleneck forces the model to compress effectively and learn what actually matters about the input.</p><p>A Variational Autoencoder (VAE) adds one twist: instead of encoding each input to a single point , the encoder outputs the parameters of a probability distribution over .</p><p>In practice, we shove a data sample  through the encoder to get a mean and standard deviation for each latent dimension. This defines a Multivariate Gaussian, from which we sample  and push it through the decoder to get our reconstruction .</p><p>To train a VAE, we minimize the following loss:</p><p>: The KL term pushes the encoder's latent distributions towards a simple, sampleable distribution (i.e., unit normal). Typically, we set the KL weight to near-zero (1e-6). We don't care about sampling from the latent space; we just want a smooth, continuous compression. This makes our VAE essentially a very lightly regularized autoencoder.</p><p>: The reconstruction term is negative log-likelihood — in our case, an L1-style loss with a learned confidence parameter.</p><p> and : VAEs tend to produce blurry reconstructions if you only optimize KL and reconstruction losses. To fix this, we <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09841\">staple on two additional terms</a>. Perceptual loss runs both the original and the reconstruction through a pretrained VGG network and minimizes the difference in their hidden representations. If two images  similar, they should have similar features even if the exact pixels don't match. Adversarial loss is borrowed from GANs to force details into the reconstructions. We train a discriminator to tell real images from reconstructions, and the VAE tries to fool it.</p><p>When training text-to-video models, you first need to pretrain the model on image generation. The model needs to understand nouns (people, places, things) before it can understand verbs (actions, motions, camera movements). Since our VAE needs to handle both images and videos, our loss function becomes the sum of image and video losses:</p><h2>Building a baseline – a working video VAE [1 week]</h2><p>In Fall 2024, there were no good open-source Video VAEs (let alone Image-Video ones), so we started with the simpler problem – video only. We used a traditional CNN Encoder/Decoder style architecture, swapping Conv2Ds with Conv3Ds.</p><div><div>Click any block to inspect parameters and tensor shapes</div></div><p>FLUX-1 used 8x spatial downsampling (i.e., 3 × 256 × 256 image to C × 32 × 32 latent), but we didn't know what would be optimal for video. So, we started off conservatively and used a 4x spatial downsample and 4x temporal downsample.</p><p>It worked out of the box (encouraging, given we'd never trained a VAE before), but it was way too little compression to be useful. At 4x compression, we were unable to fit a single 360p, 1-second video clip in memory without OOM-ing on an 80 GB H100.</p><p>We traced super-linear memory growth to the  in the Encoder and Decoder. There were two obvious fixes: downsample more before hitting the  or train with FSDP. Since 8x spatial downsampling clearly worked in FLUX-1, we opted to push compression harder and ran a few experiments:</p><div><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Unusable — insufficient compression at higher resolutions</td></tr><tr><td>Unusable — bad reconstructions</td></tr><tr><td>Unusable — bad reconstructions</td></tr><tr><td>Usable — rare artifacts at 180p, typically high-motion</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Effective Compression Rate = Height Downsample × Width Downsample × Time Downsample × (3 RGB channels / 16 latent channels)</p></div><div><div>Adaptive tokenization is the future</div><div><p>Right now, latent size is mechanically tied to input resolution, not content complexity. Ideally, our compression would take into account the complexity of the video itself when determining the embedding size. For example, a video of a placid lake contains less information than a video of a boxing match. It doesn't make sense that they have the same latent size, even if the videos have the same size and duration.</p></div></div><h2>Co-training on image and video [3 months]</h2><p>Getting a working baseline typically takes a lot longer, so we were pretty stoked to see so much progress in just one week. And then (as always), we hit a wall …</p><h3>Handling 1-frame (image) and k-frames (video)</h3><p>To handle single-frame images, we padded each image into a 4-frame \"static video\", which the temporal downsampling reduced back to a single latent frame by the bottleneck. Out of the gate, the video reconstructions looked fine but the image reconstructions were unusable.</p><p>Our first hunch was that our \"static video\" approach to image reconstruction might be unstable, so we re-trained the network on just images. That worked just as well as the video-only VAE, so we started digging into the loss function to debug why co-training was leading to worse reconstructions.</p><h3>Death by summation – accidentally washing out our image signal</h3><p>Our reconstruction loss summed over all dimensions () then divided by our batch size ():</p><p>With this formulation, loss magnitude scales linearly with tensor size. <mark>That's a huge problem, because images and videos have very different sizes.</mark></p><p>A 180p, 2-second video at 24 FPS is . A 256×256 image (repeated 4 times for our static video trick) is . The video contributes ~10x more to the loss — not because it matters more, just because it's bigger. As a result, we're essentially making the optimizer blind to images altogether.</p><p>The naive fix (mean per sample) normalizes this away:</p><p><mark>But now, the gradient per pixel is inversely proportional to tensor size. A single bad pixel in the 256×256 image drives ~10x more gradient than the same bad pixel in the 180p video.</mark> This places way too much emphasis on picture-perfect image reconstruction.</p><p>To combat this problem, we kept the original sum-based loss but normalized it relative to a fixed reference shape, :</p><p>This kept loss magnitude consistent across resolutions without distorting per-pixel gradients and allowed us to explicitly re-weight the importance of different resolutions and modalities.</p><p>Naturally, we tried equal weight for images and videos, but that NaN-ed pretty quickly. When we backed off to lower image weights like 0.25, we were still NaN-ing ...</p><h3>Co-training instability (AKA NaN Hell)</h3><p>When your network is unstable, the first thing you do is look at the magnitudes (L2-Norms) of the activations and gradients. Our VAEs were obviously exploding, so we added Group Norms everywhere. This stabilized early training, but we still hit exploding gradients deep into training.</p><p>Our first thought was that the model was struggling to distinguish between the \"static videos\" and real ones, so we should provide an explicit signal that it was dealing with two different modalities.</p><p>To tackle this issue, we introduced <a href=\"https://distill.pub/2018/feature-wise-transformations/\">FiLM (Feature-wise Linear Modulation) layers</a> throughout the autoencoder. We took the hidden representations from the CNNs () and modulated them with a shift () and scale (), conditioned on an image/video identity embedding ():</p><p>Scale parameters would hover around 0 for the early training stages, and as soon as they became non-zero (i.e. started driving signal from the image vs. video differentiation), we would run into exploding gradients and NaN. The FiLM layers didn't help, so we axed them from the network.</p><p>Since this more \"principled\" architecture fix didn't work, we ran towards training stabilization \"hacks\", introducing our own variant of adaptive gradient clipping (AGC) from <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06171\">Brock et al. (2021)</a>. Rather than clipping to a fixed threshold, AGC tracks the ratio of gradient norm to weight norm per parameter using an exponential moving average and clips any channel whose ratio exceeds the learned threshold. This stabilized training, but we started seeing discolored splotches in our reconstructions.</p><p>The authors of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14477\">LiteVAE (Sadat et al. 2024)</a> ran into a similar problem, with black spots appearing in their image reconstructions. Their solution was to swap Group Norm + CNN blocks with a Self-Modulating Convolution (SMC) operation.</p><p>Instead of normalizing output activations, SMC normalizes the convolution weights. Each weight is scaled by a learned per-input-channel parameter  that controls how much each input channel contributes to the output. Then the scaled weights are divided by their L2 norm, so that the CNN doesn't blow up the output activations.</p><p>Empirically, Group Norms force pixel-space-decoding-models to over-emphasize certain pieces of information through a small number of pixels. If there is a particular channel within a group that has outsized magnitude, Group Norm over-emphasizes this channel while nuking the signal in all the other channels within the group.</p><p>SMC is fundamentally more expressive. It allows the network to modulate each channel independently, while preventing activation growth. This allows the model to have more flexibility in how it propagates the higher magnitude signals, helping us avoid the spots.</p><p>By adapting SMC for Conv3Ds, we were able to get rid of the splotches in our 180p video reconstructions, but the black dots re-appeared when we started scaling to 360p and 720p videos. To pinpoint the origin of these new spots, we instrumented hooks in the forward pass of our VAE, plotted the L2 norms of each pixel-activation at each layer, and manually reviewed all the plots to find the layer where the spots first showed up.</p><p>The culprit was the  in the Encoder's Mid Block. We tried dropping Group Norms from the Encoder and Decoder Mid Blocks, but that was wildly unstable, so we replaced them with a lighter form of normalization, Pixel Norms.</p><div><div><p>Right after we solved this problem for ourselves, Meta published their <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13720\">MovieGen paper</a>. In it, they describe the exact same problem, but they overcame it by slapping another term onto their VAE loss that penalized outlier values in their network's activations. Truth be told, we have no clue how well Meta's solution works, since they never released their models. But broadly speaking, there are definitely other solutions to this spot problem.</p></div></div><h2>Training across resolutions [2 weeks]</h2><p>3 months in, we had a working VAE, but the final 720p checkpoint catastrophically forgot how to reconstruct lower resolution images and videos. We need the VAE to work reasonably well across all resolutions, since we train the diffusion model across resolutions. So, our fix was to change the VAE's curriculum.</p><p>Instead of moving sequentially from 180p → 360p → 720p, we kept training on lower resolutions while introducing higher resolutions. Then, we ran a hyperparameter sweep to identify the optimal loss weights for the different resolutions, landing on a final cocktail of 180p at ~1.1 loss-weight, 360p at 0.1, and 720p at 0.01.</p><h2>If it works, why switch to the Wan 2.1 VAE?</h2><p>When training diffusion models, you embed your dataset once with your VAE offline. This way you don't have to incur the embedding cost every time you run a diffusion model experiment.</p><p>When Wan 2.1's VAE dropped in February 2025, we had only embedded a subset of our dataset, so we held a bakeoff. It performed just as well as ours, but it was smaller and faster since it doesn't compute full spatio-temporal attention. So, we decided to ditch our own VAE and save $ on embedding our large dataset.</p><h2>Better reconstruction ≠ better generation</h2><p>When we built our VAE, we obsessed over pixel-perfect reconstructions. We spent weeks sweating over the ~10% of samples our model struggled with.</p><p><mark>Looking back, we should have just filtered out these samples from the dataset and moved on.</mark> We know that sounds counterintuitive.</p><p><em>Shouldn't you be robust to edge cases?</em>  Yes – but not when the edge cases are low-quality samples:</p><p>The most difficult images tend to be heavily pixelated. Faces are blocky and smeared; trees and foliage look like flat blobs of green, devoid of any details in the branches and leaves; and on and on. These artifacts are telltale signs of aggressive JPEG compression.</p><p>Compression artifacts are harder to reconstruct than real detail — because they're just noise. When you push the VAE to perfectly reconstruct them anyway, you contort your latent space to capture this detail. <mark>In other words, overanchor to reconstruction quality, and you're just training your VAE to regurgitate noise.</mark>.</p><p>This is why co-training across resolutions was so unstable for us. The model had baked its understanding of noise into its representations at 180p and then had to completely re-shape its latent space when we introduced higher resolution data.</p><p>This poses a subtler issue for downstream diffusion models.</p><p>Intuitively, you'd think that if a diffusion model sees the world through the VAE's latent space, a sharper lens should allow it to pick up patterns more easily and generate crisper samples. Turns out, that's not the case.</p><p><mark>In the 18 months since we trained our VAE, researchers have consistently found that VAEs with higher quality reconstructions may produce worse diffusion models.</mark> For example, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01423\">Yao et al. (2025)</a> improved the rFID of their VAE on ImageNet from 0.49 to 0.18 but the downstream diffusion model's gFID tanked from 20.3 to 45.8.</p><p>By blindly optimizing reconstruction loss in your VAE, you're overfitting to noise (compression or otherwise) and hurting the model's chance to disentangle your data into a semantically, meaningful space. You're \"compressing\" your data to make the attention calculation tractable, but in doing so you're making it harder for the diffusion model to learn visual concepts.</p><p><em>So, how do we create a \"learnable\" latent space?</em> Right now, there seem to be two answers –</p><ol><li><strong>Regularize the VAE, so it learns a more semantically meaningful latent space.</strong></li><li><strong>Skip the VAE altogether and just train the diffusion model in pixel-space.</strong></li></ol><p>Option #1 is in vogue right now. The original idea comes from <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06940\">REPA (Yu et al. 2024)</a>, where the authors found that they could accelerate diffusion model training by aligning the generative model's hidden states to those of a pre-trained vision encoder like DINO. Since then, there has been follow-up work by <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10483\">Leng et al. (2025)</a>, which demonstrates that you can induce a more learnable latent space within the VAE by un-freezing the encoder and backpropagating the diffusion model's alignment loss into it. End-to-end training with a VAE is impractical for text-to-image and text-to-video models, but we could achieve similar results by re-training the VAE itself with an alignment loss in the mix (e.g. <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01423\">VA-VAE</a>) or scaling up the VAE to directly learn these self-supervised representations, like in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13687\">VTP</a>. With this \"alignment regularization\" in place, we should be able to push better reconstructions without sacrificing learnability altogether.</p><p>Option #2 is hot off the presses and might be a peek into the future. In <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13720\">JIT</a>, the authors show that we can get a diffusion model to learn the compression itself without a VAE whatsoever with a few small tweaks to the typical flow-matching learning objective (more on this in another post). The downstream generations are still  than the best aligned-VAE samples … but give it a few months of follow-up work. Our in-house hunch is that JIT is overfitting to noise, though not nearly as much as our VAE. Perhaps, by having JIT explicitly learn semantic representations like those in DINO it'll be able to leapfrog existing approaches and make it easier for all of us to train diffusion models.</p>",

      "content": "<p>New data from the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) confirms that Tesla registered just 8,075 vehicles across the EU, EFTA, and UK in January 2026, a 17% decline from the same month last year. </p><p>The drop is particularly damaging because January 2025 was already a weak month for Tesla, during the production transition to the refreshed Model Y. The broader battery-electric vehicle market, meanwhile, grew 13.9%, making Tesla’s collapse increasingly difficult to explain away as a timing issue.</p><h2>BEV market grows despite Tesla dragging it down</h2><p>Across the EU, EFTA, and UK, 189,062 battery-electric cars were registered in January 2026, up from 165,930 a year ago — a 13.9% increase. BEV market share in the EU reached 19.3%, up from 14.9% in January 2025, according to ACEA data. </p><p>France (+52.1%), Germany (+23.8%), and Denmark (+52.7%) drove much of the growth, while the overall car market contracted 3.5%.</p><p>The growth looks even stronger when you strip out Tesla’s numbers. Without Tesla, BEV registrations across the EU, EFTA, and UK were up 15.9% year-over-year — 180,987 units in January 2026 versus 156,197 a year earlier. </p><p>Tesla is not just failing to contribute to the EV transition in Europe; it is actively dragging down the growth rate.</p><p>BYD, in contrast, registered 18,242 vehicles in January 2026, <a href=\"https://electrek.co/2026/01/27/tesla-fared-worse-than-any-automaker-in-eu-in-2025-even-as-evs-outsold-petrol/\">surging 165% year-over-year</a> and more than doubling Tesla’s volume in the region. The Chinese automaker now holds a 1.9% market share in the EU+EFTA+UK, compared to Tesla’s 0.8%.</p><h2>Tesla’s problem runs deeper than the Model Y refresh</h2><p>In Q1 2025, Tesla’s European sales <a href=\"https://electrek.co/2026/01/06/tesla-full-2025-data-europe-total-bloodbath/\">collapsed roughly 37% year-over-year</a>, and the company and its supporters blamed the production changeover to the refreshed Model Y “Juniper.” January 2025 was supposed to be the trough, a temporary dip caused by the transition between the old and new model.</p><p>That excuse no longer holds. January 2026 represents a full year after the Model Y refresh launched. The new model is in full production, widely available across Europe, and has been on the market for months. Tesla’s registrations still fell 17% compared to what were already considered terrible numbers.</p><p>In the EU specifically, Tesla registered 7,187 vehicles in January 2026 versus 7,305 a year ago, a small 1.6% decline. The steeper 17% drop in the EU+EFTA+UK figure is driven by EFTA markets, particularly Norway, where total new car registrations <a href=\"https://electrek.co/2026/02/02/tesla-tsla-cant-find-bottom-europe-2026-brutal-decline/\">plunged 76.3%</a> due to the end of tax exemptions. Tesla, which historically dominated Norway’s EV market, is feeling the impact disproportionately.</p><h2>The rest of the market tells a different story</h2><p>While Tesla contracts, the broader European car market is shifting rapidly toward electrification. Petrol car registrations in the EU crashed 28.2% year-over-year, with France down 48.9% and Germany down 29.9%. Diesel continued its decline at -22.3%. The combined share of petrol and diesel fell to 30.1% in the EU, down from 39.5% in January 2025.</p><p>Plug-in hybrids also surged 32.2% across the EU+EFTA+UK, reaching 99,654 units. Italy (+134.2%) and Spain (+66.7%) led the charge. Hybrid-electric vehicles remain the most popular powertrain choice at 38.6% EU market share.</p><p>Among manufacturers, Stellantis grew 6.7% to 164,436 units across the EU+EFTA+UK, with Fiat up 24.6% and Opel/Vauxhall up 12.7%. Volkswagen Group declined 3.8% but still commanded a dominant 26.7% market share. Mercedes-Benz edged up 2.8%, while <a href=\"https://electrek.co/2025/04/24/ev-sales-are-surging-in-europe-except-for-tesla/\">BMW Group</a> fell 5.7%.</p><p>We thought Tesla’s January 2025 numbers in Europe were bad. At the time, the company was in the middle of a Model Y production transition, and we gave it the benefit of the doubt that numbers would recover once the refreshed model hit the market in volume. A year later, with the new Model Y widely available, Tesla’s European registrations are down another 17%. The problem is clearly not the Model Y refresh.</p><p>The European EV transition is accelerating, just not for Tesla. BYD registered more than twice as many vehicles as Tesla in January, and the gap is widening every month. </p><p>ompounding Tesla’s demand slump. </p><p>Tesla needs to find the bottom in Europe soon, or it risks becoming irrelevant in one of the world’s largest EV markets while competitors like BYD, Volkswagen, and Stellantis fill the void.</p><div><p><em>FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.</em><a href=\"https://electrek.co/about/#affiliate\">More.</a></p></div>",

You can start one or a few agents on the same problem, test, and review.</p><p>Emdash works over SSH so you can run agents where your code lives and keep the parallel workflow. You can assign tickets to agents, edit files manually, and review changes.</p><p>We also spent time making task startup fast. Each task can be created in a worktree, and creating worktrees on demand was taking 5s+ in some cases. We now keep a small reserve of worktrees in the background and let a new task claim one instantly. That brought task start time down to ~500–1000ms depending on the provider. We also spawn the shell directly and avoid loading the shell environments on startup.</p><p>We believe using the providers’ native CLIs is the right approach. It gives you the full capabilities of each agent, always. If a provider starts supporting plan mode, we don't have to add that first.</p><p>We support 21 coding agent CLIs today, including Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Droid, Amp, Codebuff, and more. We auto-detect what you have installed and we’re provider-agnostic by design. If there’s a provider you want that we don’t support yet, we can add it. We believe that in the future, some agents will be better suited for task X and others for task Y. Codex, Claude Code, and Gemini all have fans. We want to be agnostic and enable individuals and teams to freely switch between them.</p><p>Beyond orchestration, we try to pull most of the development loop into Emdash. You can review diffs, commit, open PRs, see CI/CD checks, and merge directly from Emdash once checks pass. When starting a task, you can pass issues from Linear, GitHub, and Jira to an agent. We also support convenience variables and lifecycle scripts so it’s easy to allocate ports and test changes.</p><p>Emdash is fully open-source and MIT-licensed.</p><p>Download for macOS, Linux or Windows (as of yesterday !), or install via Homebrew: brew install --cask emdash.</p><p>We’d love your feedback. How does your coding agent development setup look like, especially when working with multiple agents? We would want to learn more about it. Check out our repository here: <a href=\"https://github.com/generalaction/emdash\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/generalaction/emdash</a></p><p>We’ll be around in the comments — thanks!</p>",

      "content": "<pre tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"plaintext\"><code></code></pre><p>We, the undersigned organizations representing civil society, nonprofit institutions, and technology companies, write to express our strong opposition to Google’s announced policy requiring all Android app developers to register centrally with Google themselves in order to distribute applications outside of the Google Play Store, set to take effect worldwide in the coming months.</p><p>While we do recognize the importance of platform security and user safety, the Android platform already includes multiple security mechanisms that do not require central registration. Forcibly injecting an alien security model that runs counter to Android’s historic open nature threatens innovation, competition, privacy, and user freedom. We urge Google to withdraw this policy and work with the open-source and security communities on less restrictive alternatives.</p><p><strong>1. Gatekeeping Beyond Google’s Own Store</strong></p><p>Android has historically been characterized as an open platform where users and developers can operate independently of Google’s services. The proposed developer registration policy fundamentally alters that relationship by requiring developers who wish to distribute apps through alternative channels — their own websites, third-party app stores, enterprise distribution systems, or direct transfers — to first seek permission from Google through a mandatory verification process, which involves the agreement to Google’s terms and conditions, the payment of a fee, and the uploading of government-issued identification.</p><p>This extends Google’s gatekeeping authority beyond its own marketplace into distribution channels where it has no legitimate operational role. Developers who choose not to use Google’s services should not be forced to register with, and submit to the judgement of, Google. Centralizing the registration of all applications worldwide also gives Google newfound powers to completely disable any app it wants to, for any reason, for the entire Android ecosystem.</p><p><strong>2. Barriers to Entry and Innovation</strong></p><p>Mandatory registration creates friction and barriers to entry, particularly for:</p><ul><li>Individual developers and small teams with limited resources</li><li>Open-source projects that rely on volunteer contributors</li><li>Developers in regions with limited access to Google’s registration infrastructure</li><li>Privacy-focused developers who avoid&nbsp;surveillance ecosystems</li><li>Emergency response and humanitarian organizations requiring rapid deployment</li><li>Activists working on internet freedom in countries that unjustly criminalize that work</li><li>Developers in countries or regions where Google cannot allow them to sign up due to sanctions</li><li>Researchers and academics developing experimental applications</li><li>Internal enterprise and government applications never intended for broad public distribution</li></ul><p>Every additional bureaucratic hurdle reduces diversity in the software ecosystem and concentrates power in the hands of large established players who can more easily absorb such compliance costs.</p><p><strong>3. Privacy and Surveillance Concerns</strong></p><p>Requiring registration with Google creates a comprehensive database of all Android developers, regardless of whether or not they use Google’s services. This raises serious questions about:</p><ul><li>What personal information developers must provide</li><li>How this information will be stored, secured, and used</li><li>Whether this data could be subject to government requests or legal processes</li><li>To what extent developer activity is tracked across the ecosystem</li><li>What this means for developers working on privacy-preserving or politically sensitive applications</li></ul><p>Developers should have the right to create and distribute software without submitting to unnecessary surveillance or scrutiny.</p><p><strong>4. Arbitrary Enforcement and Account Termination Risks</strong></p><p>Google’s existing app review processes have been criticized for opaque decision-making, inconsistent enforcement, and limited appeal mechanisms. Extending this system to all Android certified devices creates risks of:</p><ul><li>Arbitrary rejection or suspension without clear justification</li><li>Automated systems making consequential decisions with insufficient human oversight</li><li>Developers losing their ability to distribute apps across all channels due to a single un-reviewable corporate decision</li><li>Political or competitive considerations influencing registration approvals</li><li>Disproportionate impact on marginalized communities and controversial but legal applications</li></ul><p>A single point of failure controlled by one corporation is antithetical to a healthy, competitive software ecosystem.</p><p><strong>5. Anticompetitive Implications</strong></p><p>This requirement allows Google to collect intelligence on all Android development activity, including:</p><ul><li>Which apps are being developed and by whom</li><li>Alternative distribution strategies and business models</li><li>Competitive threats to Google’s own services</li><li>Market trends and user preferences outside of Google’s ecosystem</li></ul><p>This information asymmetry provides Google with significant competitive advantages, allows it to preempt, copy, and undermine competing products and services, and may open many questions about antitrust.</p><p>Regulatory authorities worldwide, including the European Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice, and competition authorities in multiple jurisdictions, have increasingly scrutinized dominant platforms’ ability to preference their own services and restrict competition, demanding more openness and interoperability. We additionally note growing concerns around regulatory intervention increasing mass surveillance, impeding software freedom, open internet and device neutrality.</p><p>We urge Google to find alternative ways to comply with regulatory obligations by promoting models that respect Android’s open nature without increasing gatekeeper control over the platform.</p><h2>Existing Measures Are Sufficient</h2><p>The Android platform already includes multiple security mechanisms that do not require central registration:</p><ul><li>Operating system-level security features, application sandboxing, and permission systems</li><li>User warnings for applications that are directly installed (or “sideloaded”)</li><li>Google Play Protect (which users can choose to enable or disable)</li><li>Developer signing certificates that establish software provenance</li></ul><p>No evidence has been presented that these safeguards are insufficient to continue to protect Android users as they have for the entire seventeen years of Android’s existence. If Google’s concern is genuinely about security rather than control, it should invest in improving these existing mechanisms rather than creating new bottlenecks and centralizing control.</p><ol><li>&nbsp;the mandatory developer registration requirement for third-party distribution.</li><li><strong>Engage in transparent dialogue</strong>&nbsp;with civil society, developers, and regulators about Android security improvements that respect openness and competition.</li><li><strong>Commit to platform neutrality</strong>&nbsp;by ensuring that Android remains a genuinely open platform where Google’s role as platform provider does not conflict with its commercial interests.</li></ol><p>Over the years, Android has evolved into a critical piece of technological infrastructure that serves hundreds of governments, millions of businesses, and billions of citizens around the world. Unilaterally consolidating and centralizing the power to approve software into the hands of a single unaccountable corporation is antithetical to the principles of free speech, an affront to free software, an insurmountable barrier to competition, and a threat to digital sovereignty everywhere.</p><p>We implore Google to reverse course, end the developer verification program, and to begin working collaboratively with the broader community to advance security objectives without sacrificing the open principles upon which Android was built. The strength of the Android ecosystem has historically been its openness, and Google must work towards restoring its role as a faithful steward of that trust.</p>",

      "content": "<p>For the past few weeks I’ve been teaching my 9-pound cavapoo Momo (cavalier king charles spaniel and toy poodle) to vibe code games. The key to making this work is telling Claude Code that a genius game designer who only speaks in cryptic riddles is giving it instructions, add strong guardrails, and build plenty of tools for automated feedback. The results have surpassed my expectations. Below I walk through all the pieces and how they came together.</p><p>If you’d rather skip ahead, all the <a href=\"https://www.calebleak.com/posts/dog-game/#links\">links</a> are at the bottom, including a full game she made and a video of her making it.</p><p>Back in December I was working on a small game prototype in Godot. I use Claude Code extensively these days and this project was no exception. I kicked off a procedural mesh generation task and came back to find strange input in the terminal.</p><img src=\"https://www.calebleak.com/blog/dog-game/momo-terminal-input.webp\" data-full-src=\"/blog/dog-game/momo-terminal-input.png\" alt=\"Momo's terminal input\"><p>My first thought was “did I get hit by one of the recent NPM supply chain attacks?” Fortunately, no (or at least the worm is still asleep in the background somewhere). A little bit of searching and I noticed my lip balm was gone off my desk - which I keep just behind my keyboard. I quickly found both the suspect and the lip balm (still intact) not far away.</p><p>At the time, I thought this was funny, took a screenshot, and moved on. Fast forward a few weeks, and I found myself with a lot of time on my hands. On January 13th, I woke up to the news that Meta had <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/12/technology/meta-layoffs-reality-labs.html\">another round of layoffs</a> and my role specifically as a research engineer had been eliminated.</p><p>Since the layoff, I’ve had plenty of time with friends and family. In recounting the anecdote of Momo typing away on my keyboard, I began to wonder “what would happen if she actually submitted that input to Claude? Could I make it do something meaningful?”. I decided to find out. Here’s what that looked like.</p><p>Momo types on a Bluetooth keyboard proxied through a Raspberry Pi 5. Keystrokes travel across the network to <a href=\"https://github.com/cleak/DogKeyboard\">DogKeyboard</a>, a small Rust app that filters out special keys and forwards the rest to Claude Code. When Momo has typed enough, DogKeyboard triggers a smart pet feeder to dispense treats. A chime tells her when Claude is ready for more input.</p><img src=\"https://www.calebleak.com/blog/dog-game/Architecture_01_light.webp\" data-full-src=\"/blog/dog-game/Architecture_01_light.svg\" alt=\"Architecture diagram\"><img src=\"https://www.calebleak.com/blog/dog-game/Architecture_01_dark.webp\" data-full-src=\"/blog/dog-game/Architecture_01_dark.svg\" alt=\"Architecture diagram\"><p>There are some other details I’m glossing over, but that’s the high level overview. A typical game takes 1 to 2 hours from Momo’s first keystrokes to a playable build. All the games are made in <a href=\"https://godotengine.org/\">Godot</a> 4.6, with 100% of the game logic in C#.</p><p>It’s easy to submit random text to Claude Code, but it doesn’t do much.</p><pre tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"plaintext\"><code></code></pre><p>Of course this can be worked around by telling Claude that there  meaning here. After a lot of iteration, I found this opening to work well:</p><blockquote><p>Hello! I am an <strong>eccentric video game designer</strong> (a very creative one) who communicates in an unusual way. Sometimes I’ll mash the keyboard or type nonsense like “skfjhsd#$%” – but ! They are  full of genius game ideas (even if it’s hard to see).</p><p> You are a <strong>brilliant AI game developer</strong> who can understand my cryptic language. No matter what odd or nonsensical input I provide, you will <strong>interpret it as a meaningful instruction or idea for our video game</strong>. You will then  based on that interpretation.</p></blockquote><p>It goes on for quite a bit (you can read the <a href=\"https://github.com/cleak/quasar-saz/blob/master/CLAUDE.md#user-input\">full prompt here</a>), but that’s the core of it. It took more iterations than I expected, mostly to sand down the rough edges. Sometimes the game wouldn’t have sound. Other times there would be no player character, or the control scheme would be nearly unusable. After adding a checklist of minimum requirements - working audio, WASD or arrow key controls, at least one enemy or obstacle, a visible player character - the results got a lot better:</p><pre tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"plaintext\"><code></code></pre><p>With this, things started to fly. The results weren’t perfect, but they were promising. I could see it was feasible, and the remaining problems were ones I knew how to solve.</p><p>To go from “hey that could work” to a real, repeatable system, I needed a few things:</p><ol><li>A reliable keyboard for Momo.</li><li>A way to route input to Claude Code. Importantly, I would need to filter out special keys like Esc, Tab, and the Windows key - otherwise Momo would quickly end up outside Claude Code.</li><li>A way to automatically reward Momo for her work. Sure, I could just toss treats to her, but I’m trying to keep humans out of the loop.</li><li>More robust verification tools. Many of the games wound up with UI elements all jumbled together or input that was never correctly wired up. Automated feedback loops turned out to be the single biggest lever for fewer duds.</li></ol><p>I experimented with Rust/<a href=\"https://bevy.org/\">Bevy</a> and Unity before settling on Godot. Bevy’s animations and visuals weren’t as crisp, and Claude struggled with its coordinate conventions - likely a combination of less training data and Bevy leaving many core features, like physics, to the community. Unity was a constant struggle to keep the MCP bridge between Claude and the editor healthy. It frequently hung, and I never figured out how to get Claude Code to read the scene hierarchy from the editor. Godot’s text-based scene format turned out to be a huge advantage - Claude can read and edit  files directly.</p><img src=\"https://www.calebleak.com/blog/dog-game/MomoCropped_01.webp\" data-full-src=\"/blog/dog-game/MomoCropped_01.jpg\" alt=\"Momo with a keyboard\"><p>Plugging a keyboard directly into my Windows machine and letting a dog type away seemed like a bad idea. So I routed input through a Raspberry Pi first - it UDP broadcasts each keystroke to the subnet, and DogKeyboard picks it up, filters out dangerous keys, and injects them into the target application.</p><p>For the keyboard itself, I wanted something low profile and durable. I started with flexible silicone keyboards, but Momo’s bigger sister Hana (a 19lb cavapoo) ripped a hole in the first one within minutes. Mounting was another problem - nothing sticks to silicone. I epoxied one to a wooden plaque, but within 10 minutes Momo ripped off the number 6.</p><p>I was seriously considering a $400 <a href=\"https://www.storm-interface.com/2230-series-us-format.html\">vandal proof metal keyboard</a> designed for kiosks when I decided to give Logitech’s Pebble Keys 2 a try. It worked. Momo loved it, VHB tape held it in place (unlike the previous silicone keyboard), and Bluetooth meant no cable to chew on.</p><h3>Automatically Rewarding Momo</h3><p>Motivating Momo is easy - she’ll do anything for the right food reward. So what I really needed was a dispenser with an API, small serving sizes, and the ability to use my own treats (both dogs have sensitive stomachs).</p><p>I landed on Aqara’s C1 Smart Pet Feeder, controlled over Zigbee. Even its smallest serving is too large for a 9-pound dog, so I preloaded each compartment with a few treats and skipped the hopper. This limits it to about 6 servings before refilling, but that’s plenty for Momo to make a game.</p><p>Zigbee on Windows was a no go - after hours of driver and firmware issues I moved the adapter to the Pi, where it worked immediately. The final flow: DogKeyboard SSHs into the Pi and runs a script that sends two Zigbee commands:</p><pre tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"json\"><code></code></pre><p>As the number of almost-there games mounted, the need for real feedback to Claude Code became clear. It already had unit tests and logs, but those weren’t enough. The games would build and run but have invisible players, broken UI, or input that was never wired up. Claude had no way to know. It needed to be able to see and play its own games.</p><p>The first tool was straightforward: a simple Python script to take screenshots of the running game. Claude could launch the game, screenshot it, and see whether the title screen actually rendered or was just a black window.</p><p>The second tool was more interesting. I gave Claude a way to send sequences of input to running game instances - things like “left for 3 seconds, pause for 2 seconds, right for one frame, fire”. It could then take screenshots and decide whether to send followup commands. This turned Claude into its own QA tester.</p><p>These tools didn’t need any refinement - they just worked. And the way Claude used them surprised me. While testing one game, I watched it play through all 6 stages just to verify that the final boss fight worked correctly. When it found a problem - a health bar that wasn’t updating - it went back to the code, fixed it, relaunched, and played through again to confirm.</p><p>I also pulled in a few other tools from other projects I’ve made:</p><ul><li> Claude sometimes reuses node IDs or generates broken resource references in Godot’s  files. These cause cryptic errors at runtime. Since adding a linter that catches these before the game launches, I haven’t seen a single mangled scene file.</li><li> Validates custom shaders and gives specific errors back to Claude, rather than the vague “shader failed to compile” that Godot provides.</li><li> A small helper to get keyboard/controller input wired in correctly. Claude can edit Godot’s project files directly to add new input actions, but it sometimes gets the format wrong and the error messages are unhelpful.</li></ul><p>All of these are open sourced, and I’d encourage you to try them for yourself - even without a dog.</p><p>The DogKeyboard app ended up handling a lot more than just routing keystrokes. A few details worth mentioning:</p><img src=\"https://www.calebleak.com/blog/dog-game/DogKeyboard_02.webp\" data-full-src=\"/blog/dog-game/DogKeyboard_02.png\" alt=\"DogKeyboard app screenshot\"><p>It monitors Claude Code using <a href=\"https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks\">Hooks</a> and plays a chime sound when Claude goes idle - that’s Momo’s cue to type. When Claude is idle and Momo has entered at least 16 characters, it auto-submits by pressing Enter. When Claude is , it backspaces any extra input in case Momo gets eager and periodically dismisses Plan Mode prompts (Claude’s “review before acting” step) that would otherwise block progress.</p><p>For the video recording, it runs a lightweight webserver that overlays keystrokes as they’re pressed. I added a configurable delay so that if the video feed is lagged, the overlay doesn’t show keystrokes before Momo appears to type them.</p><img src=\"https://www.calebleak.com/blog/dog-game/HanaAndMomo_01.webp\" data-full-src=\"/blog/dog-game/HanaAndMomo_01.jpg\" alt=\"Hana and Momo\"><p>The first decision was which dog to train. Hana (on the right) is twice Momo’s size but far more trainable - she’s the smartest pet I’ve had. Before turning 1, she figured out how to jump, grab a door handle, and open any door in the house just by observing.</p><p>I expected the dogs would walk across the keyboard, stepping on keys as they go. That’s what Momo did when she stole my lip balm. Since Hana is tall enough to just step over a keyboard, Momo seemed like the better candidate. As it turned out, both dogs learned to tap and swipe their paws along the keyboard rather than step on it - but Momo learned a little faster in this case, and typed a little gentler, so Momo it was.</p><p>The training process took about 2 weeks, with somewhat inconsistent sessions. My goal was 10 minutes, twice a day. I started by scattering high-value treats (freeze-dried salmon) on the keyboard to build the association: this thing is fun and gives good food.</p><p>Momo was frustrated at first. She knew the keyboard was involved but didn’t know how. She would lie on it, bark at it, and try anything she could think of. At some point she tried swiping her paw across it. I played a chime sound and heavily rewarded her. After a few iterations, the association clicked and she started attacking the keyboard with vigor any chance she had.</p><p>The next step was to automate the rewards. I filled up the food dispenser with treats (4 servings at a time so I could control the quantity), waited for her swipe at the keyboard, and then I ran a script to play the chime and dispense a serving of treats. After a few sessions of this I increased the difficulty - not just one swipe, but three swipes before the treats came.</p><p>Simultaneously, I decreased the treat value to keep her healthy. First a mix of mid-value treats with an occasional high-value one, and eventually just kibble with an occasional mid-value treat. She still loved it and was healthier for it.</p><p>Eventually I automated the whole thing with the DogKeyboard app and let it run. It required at least 16 characters per serving of treats, and was supposed to only dispense once per idle period of Claude Code. But bugs crept in during testing - a couple of times it dispensed multiple servings in a row. Unfortunately, Momo picked up on this and now keeps mashing the keyboard hoping for a second immediate serving. The only way to pull her away is to offer higher-value treats elsewhere, which is what I do after she’s put in her input for a game.</p><p>Here’s a small sample of the games Momo made. Every game shown here is playable - these aren’t mock-ups. It’s nowhere near comprehensive, but represents the variety she created. As the tools and prompts improved, the games got noticeably better. There was also a noticeable bump in quality when Opus 4.6 dropped - Claude became more likely to create custom shaders and other visual effects.</p><p>One recurring issue: I kept getting games with basic glowing neon 3D shapes and couldn’t get any other style. Frustrated, I asked Claude why. It told me this was the signature style of the project - Claude’s external memory file had latched onto it and kept reinforcing it. Wiping  (Claude Code’s persistent project notes) before every new game fixed this and gave much more varied results.</p><p>. One of Momo’s earliest games - though more of an experience than a game. Every key on the keyboard plays a different tone.</p><img src=\"https://www.calebleak.com/blog/dog-game/DjSmirk_01.webp\" data-full-src=\"/blog/dog-game/DjSmirk_01.png\" alt=\"DJ Smirk screenshot\"><p>.

As of writing, this is Momo’s most recent game. You play as Zara, wielding a cosmic saz (a long-necked stringed instrument) to fight corrupted sound. There are 6 stages + a boss fight. It’s fun to play for a couple rounds, has good visuals, and dynamic audio.</p><img src=\"https://www.calebleak.com/blog/dog-game/QuasarSaz_01.webp\" data-full-src=\"/blog/dog-game/QuasarSaz_01.png\" alt=\"Quasar Saz screenshot\"><p>When Momo first stepped on my keyboard back in December, it was just a funny accident. A few weeks later, jobless and looking for a project, I decided to see how far that accident could go. The answer was a lot further than I expected.</p><p>The technical pieces - keyboard routing, treat dispenser, prompt engineering, feedback tools - were all solvable engineering problems. What surprised me was how little of the final result depended on Momo typing anything meaningful. The magic isn’t in the input. It’s in the system around it. A well-crafted prompt, strong guardrails, automated verification, and good tools can turn genuine nonsense into a playable game.</p><p>If there’s a takeaway beyond the spectacle, it’s this: the bottleneck in AI-assisted development isn’t the quality of your ideas - it’s the quality of your feedback loops. The games got dramatically better not when I improved the prompt, but when I gave Claude the ability to screenshot its own work, play-test its own levels, and lint its own scene files. The same tools that let a dog’s keyboard mashing produce a working game will make your own intentional work with AI significantly better.</p><p>Momo isn’t secretly a game designer. She’s a cavapoo who learned that smacking a plastic rectangle makes kibble appear. A year ago, the gap between that and software engineering felt enormous. Now it feels small and shrinks each day.</p><p>If you want to try any of this yourself - whether with a dog, a cat, or just your own random keyboard mashing - everything is open source in the links below.</p><p> — Tools, prompts, and source for developing the game</p><p> — Keystroke routing, treat dispensing, and other bits</p>",

      "content": "<p>KeePass has long been the gold standard and darling of the tech world, earned through its unrelenting commitment to security, stability, and data sovereignty. However, the XML format which the KDBX file format has been predicated on since 2007 has become a persistent friction point for developers and users in the adoption of modern security and convenience features.</p><p>Let us first start by explaining what a KDBX (4.1) file actually .  Barring the technicalities, a KDBX file is an encrypted &amp; authenticated gzipped XML file which contains the typical fields you may expect of a password manager. Attachments are stored as binary data (the old KDBX 3 format used to base64 encode the files), while custom icons are stored as base64 strings within the XML file. Important to note is that every time a KDBX file is updated, no matter how small the edit was, the entire file gets rewritten. The entire file is also loaded into memory. Perhaps the most relevant part of the spec to this post are the  and  references, which, respectively, are the user-facing custom attributes, and non-user-facing plugin or app data.</p><p>The primary issue is that new features cannot be added natively to the XML tree without causing breaking changes for older clients or third-party clients which have not adopted the change yet. This has led to significant problems implementing new standards that were solved ad hoc, in a backward compatible manner using the custom attributes.</p><p>Prior to any KeePass client supporting TOTP, third-party KeePass Proper plugins implemented the feature by adding a TOTP entry to the custom attributes. The problem was that different plugins used different field names and stored the generation parameters differently, making them mutually incompatible. Certain mobile clients then began to include support for the most common plugins’ TOTP format. Then, KeePassXC implemented it into the main client, opting for a standard otp URI that was interoperable with most standalone authenticator apps. Like the plugins, this  field was stored in the attributes. When KeePass Proper came around to implementing TOTP support natively, Dominik Reichl, the founder, disliked the URI format due to parsing and UX issues. This caused another discontinuity, where KeePass Proper used  while the community forks and plugins mostly used the previously described otpauth format.</p><p>Passkey support is another example where complex data was shoehorned into the custom attributes rather than being treated as a first class citizen. StrongBox was the first client to implement passkey support and actively collaborated with KeePassXC to ensure compatibility for KeePassXC’s future release. However, there was a brief period of incompatibility between the two programs, which was promptly resolved. Passkeys litter the user-facing attributes with five different entries, which makes it difficult to select entries which actually matter to the user.</p><p>Further adding to the clutter, some mobile clients add attributes which associate app IDs to entries for autofill. Here is a particularly egregious entry I have which best demonstrates this issue:</p><p>The first three security question attributes are the only ones that are mine!</p><p>The lead developer of KeePassXC summarizes the whole issue well:</p><blockquote><p>I am trying to avoid implementing a multitude of “minor” interim solutions. That creates significant code bloat with exceptions and workarounds depending on which version of the standard you are on. The myriad of plugins made for KeePass over the years demonstrates why this is not a good thing. They all made their own unique standards.</p></blockquote><p>Modern security features should never need to get in the user’s way, and should never have the potential for a user to be locked out of reading it simply because their mobile client understands  while their desktop client understands . In practice, the different clients just support both, but this is an undue technical burden which could be solved with explicit and special support in the schema to begin with.</p><p>As mentioned, KDBX files keep all custom icons as base64 in the XML file. This causes a roughly 33% jump in file size per icon. It also massively increases memory usage and decreases access and save speed, especially on mobile, since everything needs to be loaded into memory. Further, since the whole file is rewritten on every edit, there can be problems if the program crashes or power halts mid save. Also, the chance of irrecoverable corruption on network shares or cloud services is high, which is why several KeePass clients offer alternate saving methods which involve backup files.</p><p>Although I quite agree with Dominik on general encrypted file storage being far out of scope for a password manager, I have noticed that many KeePass users report using the database as an all-purpose secrets manager. Users attach unoptimized passport, ID, and all sorts of important scans to their password database all the time. Paired with custom icons for every entry, the most dire cases involve horrific databases which have bloomed to 500+MiB. I recognize that this is a severe outlier, but many users have databases that fall in the range of 10-100MiB (Just a few PDF attachments can get you in this range), which is well in the realm of super slow mobile unlocking, and getting OOM errors during autofill events.</p><p>Just to emphasize that I have no horse in this specific race; my personal database sits at around 50KiB. However, I still believe that users should be able to conveniently store a set of various secrets in their password database rather than have to use a variety of encryption tools which are often not as user or mobile friendly as the KeePass ecosystems.</p><p>Dominik Reichl has maintained this format and its iterations for <em>longer than I have been alive</em>. So everything I say should be taken with a grain of salt and with utter respect to his efforts. I sincerely appreciate the immense focus on conservatism and compatibility in many of his quite wise considerations.</p><p>However, this attitude is fundamentally at odds with being able to expand the features of the format to better accommodate modern use cases and development practices. To quote a KeePassXC maintainer in response to Dominik bumping the minor version with small changes from the wider discussion:</p><blockquote><p>I’d be happy if we could somehow sketch out what a KDBX 4.1 and/or 5 should look like together. I don’t want to add too much bureaucracy to the process, but Dominik just picking or rejecting things and informing us about it, seems kinda one-way (no offence in any way, I appreciate the communication)</p></blockquote><p>The somewhat interconnected shadow schema that has developed across the various forks is just not sustainable. It has led to a various matrix of incompatibilities that could have otherwise been avoided if the entire format had been developed together. KeePassXC by far has the most users and is under the most active development. If we were to combine the four popular mobile clients in this count, they far outweigh the userbase of the original KeePass. This is to say that it is unfair and impractical for the vast majority of users within the KeePass ecosystem to be unilaterally subject to the original program’s decisions regarding the file format. It also leads to a first mover advantage, where whichever major client implements some sort of feature that their users request, that features namespace then has to be accounted for in the other clients.</p><p>In cloud native platforms like BitWarden, these issues are non-existent, as the company can arbitrarily change their schema completely transparently to its users. With a local first ecosystem like KeePass, you cannot just update every user’s file at once. A modern, open democratic spec is a necessary step for continued practical development.</p><h2>Why SQLite with SQLCipher is the Right Answer</h2><p>A final breaking refactor to SQLite has the potential to solve all three major problems. Let’s go in order.</p><ol><li><p>Devising a new schema based on SQLite would allow for current features that are being jerry-rigged into the attributes to have their own real place in the database, rather than clogging the user-facing fields. It also ensures that if in the future, some weird authentication method were to come out, no breaking changes would be needed. You simply would add a table to accommodate it, and old clients would simply not support the feature and just load the database without it. Of course, a warning would be shown to the user if somehow their database uses new features on an old client. Devising it together would allow for all the weird program specific fields to be scrapped in favor of a unified location for things like app associations and autofill histories. This would be the codification of the years of “interim features” and fixes piled on by the forks.</p></li><li><p>An SQLite based store is one of the most tested and optimal formats for document and application storage. The creator of SQLite writes extensively on the matter, so I will not cover all the benefits, just the specific ones that address the problems I brought up. Database sizes could get dramatically smaller due to icons being stored as blobs. Memory usage would significantly drop for larger databases, as SQLite does not need to load the entire file into memory during opens or saves. This allows for better use of the KDBX file as a personal catch-all secrets manager for those who use it as such.</p><p>Many file sharing tools, sync tools, and some cloud platforms (Dropbox for instance) support delta syncs with block-level delta compression. For example, if you were to change a word in a text file, you need not reupload the entire file, just the small part that changed. This is not possible with a flat encrypted blob like a KDBX file. However, with SQLCipher, since all pages are encrypted, changing one password only changes its page. So rather than risking sync issues uploading your 20MiB KDBX file on every minor change, you can upload just the 4KiB or so comprising that data. This holds true even with SQLCipher’s encrypted pages. Additional benefits include:</p><ul><li>There exist far more tools to recover an SQLite database than there are to recover a KDBX database.</li><li>Easier merges via  and row level merges rather than entire file conflicts.</li><li>Easier developer experience through implementing complex searches via SQL queries rather than re-implementing entry search across every client.</li></ul><p>Just like the crab is the ultimate form of crustacean life, a relational backend is the natural optimum for complex password management, and SQLite even more so for local management. The developers of the SQLCipher themselves created <a href=\"https://www.zetetic.net/codebook/\">CodeBook</a>, which is a password manager based on SQLCipher, showing their immense trust in it as a storage format. Enpass is another such example. It just works.</p></li><li><p>A switch this big is a major chance to fix the governance structure and align it more with a democratic consortium than a benevolent-dictator-for-life style of project management. This would also probably warrant a new file extension to signal how incompatible this change is, perhaps ?</p></li><li><p>So many quality of life features can be added where the old schema disallowed it. Things like a granular global history and versioning, more complex group relations, etc. Long requested features such as specific entry types for payment cards, or anything else that does not neatly fit into the username and password paradigm. Keeping my credit card number in the password field with several attributes is just not satisfying. Other password managers (BitWarden, CodeBook) have no problem implementing features like this. In fact, CodeBook supports completely arbitrary templates and does not place on restrictions on how the user organizes their data. Some KeePass client developers have even hinted at the fact that SQLite would be able to do a lot of what they want!</p></li></ol><h2>Anticipated Rebuttals and their Refutations</h2><ol><li><p>The transaction safety and rollback features of SQLite are against the one-file philosophy of KeePass. To which I respond: The auxiliary files (WAL, SHM, etc) are not necessary to retain the robust transactions and safety of the file. You can easily  on every save or set <code>PRAGMA journal_mode = DELETE;</code> or use one of the many other ways to operate the database as a single file and be on your way. You can also just use a rollback journal, which does create a temporary file which is deleted right after the transaction (pretty similar to the existing save features in clients, but does not duplicate the entire database). Also, many KeePass clients inherently keep around one or more backup files to avoid corruption issues while saving.</p></li><li><p>Backwards compatibility. Look, there are people still using KDB files. There are people still using Excel workbooks. God forbid, there are people using Post-It notes. The reality is, the majority of users want modern features. An SQLite based format facilitates this better than the kdbx format, and only requires a one time hurdle for long-term format stability after. This is not dissimilar to the jump from KDB to KDBX (which yielded far less benefit for a breaking change). The migration process would also be frictionless for users, it is a simple data map between two heavily structured format.</p></li><li><p>Preservation and Human Readability. Ultimately, both formats in their end state are generally encrypted blobs. This state is not human readable at all. The formats must be opened in plain text, which is severely discouraged except in the case of a quick export. I have nothing against keeping an XML export format, as it is probably easier for other random password managers to parse and is more readable in a text file than an SQLite dump. SQLite is also recognized for its long term preservation value by the Library of Congress.</p></li><li><p>Users have the freedom to open the DB in insecure views that don’t protect the memory space like DB Browser for SQLite. I don’t consider this a huge issue, as users can also export their plaintext KDBX file to CSV or XML and view it just fine. Users also routinely do dumb things like using a poor master password or lack backups. What the user does with their file is ultimately up to them.</p></li><li><p>Adding a SQL engine is too heavy of a dependency. I heavily disagree, there are so many apps that do far less than any KeePass client which use sqlite. The contacts app on your phone that does absolutely nothing but shows, adds, and deletes contacts (analogous to a primitive password store) bundles SQLite. It is also one of the most audited and mission critical pieces of software on the planet, with 100% branch test coverage. Used in the field (well, mostly in the sky) by NASA, AirBus, and everyone else you could imagine.</p></li><li><p>Metadata leakage. There should not be a substantial difference between the flat KDBX file and an encrypted SQLCipher database in terms of forensic analysis. SQLCipher uses fixed page sizes, so file size growth is less linear than a KDBX file. If it is good enough for Signal and the previous password managers I mentioned, it is probably good enough for KeePass. Also, I would like to mention that Pass; the Unix password manager and its derivatives overtly leak data about how many entries you have and to which service they belong (No shade though, I understand the arguments). A SQLCipher implementation would never come close to that level of information leakage, and yet Pass is considered completely fine.</p></li></ol><p>KeePassXC is already the de facto leader of the space, I urge the developers to focus their efforts on declaring the spec and including the major mobile developers in the discussion from start to finish. There seems to have been an attempt  to develop a new spec on the KeePassXC GitHub organization that has not seen an update in 8 years!</p><p>As for users, if the arguments persuaded you, voice your support in the relevant public development forums and channels.</p><p>My cursory (lol, get it?) understanding may be incorrect. Please feel free to call out any technical assumptions or errors I may have made!</p><p>Also, before anyone beats me to it:</p><h2>Discussion on Hacker News</h2>",

      "content": "<p>In 1978, for my 10th birthday, I went to Disneyland and got to ride a new roller coaster called . It figuratively and literally took my breath away. I loved every second of it and that night, I couldn't fall asleep; I just kept thinking about how exhilarating it was. Then, a wild thought suddenly hit me: <em>Why isn't there a roller coaster that goes upside down?</em></p><p>At first, I was like that's crazy, it can't work. But then I remembered , the ride with a round room that spun so fast I stuck to the wall. If that worked, why not a loop on a roller coaster? I thought that would feel and be like the same thing. I was convinced!</p><p>I finally fell asleep dreaming of my roller coaster, full of twists, turns, and loops.</p><p>A few days later, I told my best friend Daschle. He was older, knew everything, and lived next door. \"Buddy,\" he said, \"I've got exciting but crushing news. Your idea works.\"</p><p>\"Yep. I saw it. They're building one at Magic Mountain. It's called the Revolution. Sorry, Buddy.\"</p><p>But I wasn't crushed, I was thrilled! What I knew could work was really happening.</p><p>\"How many loops does it have?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Ha! Mine has four. It's called the ! It's gonna be way better!\"</p><p>That night I taped six sheets of paper together and drew my blueprints in colored markers. As you can see from the photo it was glorious!</p><img src=\"https://wordglyph.xyz/Quadrupuler-Blueprints.jpg\" alt=\"The Quadrupuler roller coaster blueprints drawn in marker\"><p>Look closely, I didn't label those coaster hills in feet or meters, no sir, I used building \"story's\" for height, and the speed at each section in miles per hour. I'm 10. I'm serious here.</p><p>With guiding blueprints, it was time to build the model.</p><p>I got a Styrofoam board and balsa wood. Cutting and gluing each tiny cross tie was slow, and with all my homework, I could only work on weekends. So I calculated how many inches I could finish in a week. The answer turned out to be something like 5 months! After that I considered just giving up because I realized that I was only 120 months old and this was going to take 5% of my life! Plus, I still hadn't figured out how to make the loops, balsa wood doesn't bend like that. But I told myself: . That became my motto.</p><p>When I got to the first loop, I had to stop and think. What in the world could I make the loop out of? A lot of 10-year-old brain power went into imagining what simple material I could use. Then one morning, I had it: heat plastic strips over the stovetop flame and bend them as they cooled. The key? Don't burn the house down.</p><p>I'd learned that the hard way a year earlier, when Daschle convinced me we should recreate the movie , with a cardboard box under his house... and real fire. It got out of control so fast, the flames started hitting the wood floor joists! Thankfully, we were able to smother it with the damp dirt down there. So yeah, wild card Daschle was not invited over for my plastic fire bending experiment.</p><p>I don't remember where the plastic came from, but I do remember holding the strip with pliers over the flame. The first piece melted so fast and started burning with thick black smoke that it scared me. I yanked it back and coughed. That's when I made an amendment to the safety plan: don't kill yourself with whatever these horrible smelly fumes were! I got a fan, opened the back door, and all the kitchen windows before trying again. Eventually, I figured out the perfect distance and timing with the heat.</p><p>When I laid that final track piece, I was so excited, so proud! I took the model outside for better lighting and snapped Polaroids. I needed it captured instantly. Here's a photo of the Polaroid with my 10-year-old penmanship.</p><img src=\"https://wordglyph.xyz/Quadrupuler-Model.jpg\" alt=\"Polaroid photo of the balsa wood roller coaster model\"><p>What was the next thought that immediately popped into my head?</p><p>This masterpiece is ready to be sold to Disneyland! And I wrote my letter. I don't have the original of that. But I remember it went something like this:</p><div><p>My name is Kevin Glikmann. I am 10 years old. Enclosed are Polaroids of a roller coaster model I made called the Quadrupuler. It has four loops! I think you should make it!</p></div><p>Suddenly, my chore of checking the mail after school became a heart-pounding ritual. I was nervous, hopeful, excited. Sometimes I opened the mailbox slowly, peeking in. Sometimes I pretended it was just a normal day. Other times, I yanked it open and grabbed the mail fast, trying anything to calm my nerves.</p><p>Daschle said, \"No way they'll respond. It's Disneyland, Buddy, they get a million letters a day.\"</p><p>Weeks turned into months, and I started to think he was right. Then one day, I opened the mailbox.</p><p>My name on it. My head was screaming, \"This is it! I never get mail!\"</p><p>In the corner: </p><p>HOLY SMOKES! What's WED Enterprises? I started bouncing up and down. I started shaking. I ran into the house, ran straight to my room, tore open the envelope, and read:</p><div><p>Your recent letter was directed to my office here at WED Enterprises. WED (Walter Elias Disney) is the design and \"Imagineering\" branch of Walt Disney Productions. As such, we are responsible for the creation of all shows, attractions and outdoor entertainment for both Disneyland and Walt Disney World.</p><p>Thank you for showing us your \"Quadrupuler\" roller coaster - it looks like quite an adventure! As you may know Kevin, we are creating a new rollercoaster type attraction for Disneyland's Frontierland. Known as Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, this thrilling adventure will carry passengers on a high speed journey through the gold rush days of the old west. Big Thunder is scheduled to open later this year.</p><p>Thank you Kevin, for your interest in Walt Disney Productions.</p><p>Tom FitzgeraldConcepts &amp; Communications</p></div><p>Here is a photo of the original letter:</p><img src=\"https://wordglyph.xyz/Quadrupuler-Disney-Letter.jpg\" alt=\"Original 1979 Letter from WED Enterprises\"><p>You would think that this letter would have ended my inventing spirit. That I would have gotten bitter and declared to the world, \"No more will I invent for that mouse or anyone else!\"</p><p>But no! Instead I was elated. I read it over and over. It said, <em>\"It looks like quite an adventure!\"</em> Disneyland liked it! I couldn't believe it.</p><p>Looking back, those words from Tom Fitzgerald didn't just validate my idea, they launched my 10-year-old self-esteem into orbit! (Tom Fitzgerald went on to become one of the most influential Imagineers in Disney history. According to his bio, he started in 1979. I got this letter in April 1979 which means this must have been one of his first tasks as a new Imagineer employee. lol! I wonder if he would remember?)</p><p>A couple years later, the Rubik's Cube came out. I was obsessed. It took me weeks to solve, and once I did, my first thought was: <em>What if it could turn on the angle?</em> So I introduced Mr. Rubik's Cube to my bandsaw, redesigned the core, and built a very rough prototype.</p><img src=\"https://wordglyph.xyz/Rubik-Cube-Diagonally.jpg\" alt=\"Modified Rubik's Cube prototype\"><p>I sent it to Ideal Toy Company, but they rejected it straight away, they don't accept unsolicited ideas. But that didn't matter. They didn't understand that I had a letter from Disney Imagineering telling me my ideas are good!</p><p>That ten-year-old inventor is still alive in me, and still doesn't understand rejection. Over the decades, I've invented several patented board games that were shopped around but never sold.</p><p>But I'm convinced the early validation from the Disney letter gave me a kind of bulletproof resilience.</p><p>Today, I work in one of the most rejection-heavy industries there is, acting. To me, inventing and acting are deeply connected: both are about discovery, and both feed my inventing spirit. Successes are rare, but when they come, the joy lasts forever.</p><p>So I keep auditioning, and I keep inventing.</p><p>And sometimes, when frustration creeps in, wondering why I'm not further along, or why things aren't working out, that 10-year-old boy appears. He reminds me of what we believed back then, and what still guides me now- just keep going, one piece at a time.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Israeli soldiers fired nearly a thousand bullets during the massacre of 15 Palestinian aid workers in southern Gaza on March 23, 2025—with at least eight shots fired at point blank range—according to a joint investigation by the independent research groups Earshot and Forensic Architecture. The report, based on eyewitness testimony and audio and visual analysis, shows that a number of aid workers were executed and that at least one was shot from as close as one meter away.</p><p>In Tel al-Sultan that day, Israel killed eight aid workers with the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS), six from Palestinian Civil Defense, and a UN relief agency staffer. It immediately triggered international condemnation and was described as “one of the darkest moments” of the war by PRCS.</p><p>The Israeli military was forced to change its story about the ambush several times, following the discovery of the bodies in a mass grave, along with their flattened vehicles, and the emergence of video and audio recordings taken by the aid workers. An internal military inquiry ultimately did not recommend any criminal action against the army units responsible for the incident.</p><p>The report by Earshot and Forensic Architecture reconstructs, minute by minute, how the massacre unfolded. Using video and audio recordings from the incident, open-source images and videos, satellite imagery, social media posts, and other materials, as well as in-depth interviews with two survivors of the attack, the groups were able to digitally reconstruct the scene and events surrounding the massacre.</p><p>The investigation’s findings include:</p><ul><li><p>Israeli soldiers ambushed and subjected Palestinian aid workers to a near continuous assault for over two hours even though the soldiers never came under fire.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>At least 910 gunshots were documented across three video and audio recordings of the attack. The vast majority of these gunshots, at least 844, were fired over just five minutes and 30 seconds.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>At least 93% of the gunshots recorded in the first minutes of the attack were fired directly towards the emergency vehicles and aid workers by Israeli soldiers. During this time, at least five shooters fired simultaneously. Witness testimonies suggest as many as 30 soldiers were present in the area.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Israeli soldiers were initially positioned on an elevated sandbank by the road, with no obstructions limiting their line of sight. The emergency lights and markings of the victims’ vehicles would have been clearly visible to the soldiers at the time of the attacks.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Israeli soldiers first maintained fixed firing positions from the elevated sandbank, then walked toward the aid workers while continuing to shoot. Upon reaching the aid workers, the soldiers moved between them and the vehicles and executed some of the aid workers at point blank range, as close as one meter away.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>In the immediate aftermath of the attack, the Israeli military conducted extensive earthworks at the site. In the days and weeks that followed, the area was further transformed by the Israeli military’s construction of the “Morag Corridor,” a security zone splitting the southern Gaza Strip, and the erection of an aid distribution site operated by the Israeli- and U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.</p></li></ul><p>“This seems to be a very well documented case using a number of forms of credible evidence that are cross referenced,” Katherine Gallagher, a senior staff attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights, told Drop Site after reviewing a detailed summary of the investigation. “It presents a very compelling case, and honestly, a very devastating one.”</p><p>The Israeli military did not respond to specific inquiries from Drop Site and instead pointed to the findings of an internal investigation published on April 20 that found “the incident occurred in a hostile and dangerous combat zone, under a widespread threat to the operating troops.” It also “found no evidence to support claims of execution,” which it called “blood libels and false accusations against IDF soldiers.”</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://content.forensic-architecture.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Israeli-Executions-of-Palestinian-Aid-Workers.pdf\" rel=\"\">here</a></strong></p><p>On March 23, 2025 at 3:52 a.m., PRCS dispatched two ambulances from two different areas to the scene of an Israeli airstrike in Al-Hashashin, an area near Rafah. Israel had resumed its scorched earth bombing campaign on Gaza a few days earlier after abandoning the January 2025 ceasefire agreement.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.dropsitenews.com/p/red-crescent-massacre-gaza-israel\" rel=\"\">Munther Abed</a></p><p>After the shooting stopped, Israeli soldiers approached the ambulance and dragged Abed out of the car, beat him, and detained him at a nearby pit. Sometime later, two Palestinian civilians—a father and son from the Bardawil family—were also detained and brought to the pit. The Israeli soldiers then took the three detainees to an elevated area behind a tall concrete structure some 38 to 48 meters southeast of the ambulance, where an additional group of Israeli soldiers were positioned.</p><p>By 4:35 a.m., the second ambulance, having completed its mission in Al-Hashashin, was dispatched to search for the first ambulance, which had lost contact with PRCS headquarters at 3:55 a.m. The second ambulance was joined by two more PRCS ambulances, one belonging to Civil Defense, and a Civil Defense fire truck. The five-vehicle rescue convoy arrived at the scene of the attack of the first ambulance shortly after 5:00 a.m. All vehicles were clearly marked and had their emergency lights turned on.</p><p>A PRCS worker in one of the ambulances, Refaat Radwan, began filming on his phone as they drove to the site. His recovered videos as well as recordings of phone calls by two other aid workers at the scene to PRCS dispatch provided crucial evidence of the massacre. Forensic Architecture and Earshot’s analysis of the recordings corroborated eyewitness testimony on the positions and movements of the Israeli soldiers throughout the attack.</p><p>At 5:09 a.m., as the aid workers parked and approached the first ambulance by foot, Israeli soldiers positioned on the elevated sandbank opened fire. A digital reconstruction of the scene shows that the soldiers would have had an uninterrupted view of the arrival of the convoy. Abed, who was being detained at gunpoint on the elevated sandbank, testified that the soldiers were kneeling and aiming their weapons at the convoy as it approached.</p><h6>Locations of all emergency vehicles at the incident site at 5:10 a.m. relative to Munther Abed and the Israeli soldiers who detained him. From their position, the soldiers would have been able to clearly see the convoy’s arrival with their emergency lights on. (Forensic Architecture, 2026).</h6><h6>Echolocation of Israeli soldiers approaching the aid workers during the final 1 minute and 30 seconds. (Earshot, 2026).</h6><p>At approximately 5:13 a.m., PRCS aid worker Ashraf Abu Libda called the group’s headquarters. The recording, which overlaps Radwan’s video, provided additional details. In this recording, Earshot found that at least eight gunshots were fired from positions between the emergency vehicles. One of the gunshots captured on Abu Libda’s phone call was fired from a range of one to four meters from him. The gunshots coincide with the last time Abu Libda’s voice is heard on the call, suggesting these are the gunshots that killed him.</p><h6>Echolocation of Israeli soldiers as close as 1 to 4 meters from aid workers and most likely close-range execution. (Earshot, 2026).</h6><p>“The reconstruction was jointly achieved with the two survivors of the incident, with an immersive spatial model they could walk through and amend. Together with spatial and audio analysis we established the position of the soldiers on an elevated ground with an unobstructed line of sight to the emergency vehicles. The soldiers could clearly see the aid workers, shot at them continuously and deliberately from this position and then approached to execute them one by one at close range,” Samaneh Moafi, assistant director of research at Forensic Architecture, told Drop Site. “Locating the massacre within the evolution of Israel’s campaign in Gaza shows that it was not an isolated incident but part of the genocide.”</p><p>Earshot used echolocation to analyze the audio on the recordings in order to arrive at precise estimates of the shooters’ locations. Echolocation is the process of locating the source of a sound based on an analysis of the sound’s echoes and the environment in which the sound travels. The Israeli military destroyed and cleared so many buildings in the Tel Al-Sultan area where the ambush of the aid workers took place that very few structures remained. This destruction actually strengthened Earshot’s ability to determine the positions and movements of Israeli soldiers, based on identifying the surfaces responsible for clearly distinguishable gunshot echoes. Rather than having multiple buildings reflecting the sound waves, there were only a few standing walls and the emergency vehicles themselves.</p><p>The analysis of the video and audio corroborated Al-Nasasra’s eyewitness testimony that Israeli soldiers “came down [from the sandbank], got close to [the aid workers] and shot them from close range,” and “were walking between [the aid workers] and shooting.”</p><p>“Earshot forensically analyzed over 900 gunshots fired at aid workers. It took one whole year of careful listening to reconstruct an auditory picture of what happened that dark night,” Lawrence Abu Hamdan, the director of Earshot, told Drop Site. “I am so proud that our work has corroborated the survivors’ testimony, establishing their brave accounts as accurate and reliable documentation of what occurred that day. Yet, it is the echoes of this event that continue to haunt us: the destruction and clearing of Tel al-Sultan left only three structures standing at this crime scene. While the few echoes reflecting off these buildings brought light to this crime, they have also revealed a scale of erasure of life beyond this one event.”</p><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/02/evidence-execution-style-killings-palestinian-workers-israeli-forces-doctor-says\" rel=\"\">Guardian</a></p><p>More than two hours after the initial attack, a clearly marked UN vehicle, a Toyota Hilux, passed by the site. Israeli soldiers fired on the vehicle, killing the driver. The UN lost contact with the vehicle at 6:00 a.m. A second UN vehicle, a minibus, arrived in the area minutes later and was brought to a stop by gunfire a little over 200 meters away. The driver was able to escape.</p><p>Between 6:55 and 7:13 a.m., Al-Nasasra made a phone call to PRCS headquarters that captured at least 42 additional gunshots and the sound of vehicle movement. The recording also captured the sound of an explosion the investigation identified as the firing of an Israeli-made Spike LR guided missile.</p><p>Following the ambush, Israeli forces crushed all eight vehicles using heavy machinery and attempted to bury them under the sand.</p><p>The body of Anwar al-Attar was found near the ambush site on March 27, and the bodies of the other 14 aid workers, all wearing identifying uniforms or volunteer vests of their respective organizations, were found in a mass grave near the site on March 30.</p><p>The 15 aid workers killed were: Mustafa Khafaja, Ezz El-Din Shaat, Saleh Muammar, Refaat Radwan, Muhammad Bahloul, Ashraf Abu Libda, Muhammad al-Hila, and Raed al-Sharif with PRCS. Zuhair Abdul Hamid al-Farra, Samir Yahya al-Bahapsa, Ibrahim Nabil al-Maghari, Fouad Ibrahim al-Jamal, Youssef Rassem Khalifa, and Anwar al-Attar with Civil Defense. Kamal Mohammed Shahtout with UNRWA.</p><p>One of the survivors, Abed, was released hours after the ambush. The other survivor, Asaad, was held in Israeli custody without charge for 37 days, tortured, and interrogated in relation to the incident at the Sde Teiman detention camp, a notorious Israeli prison camp in the Negev desert, before being released on April 29.</p><p>Jonathan Whittall, a senior UN official in Palestine between 2022 and 2025, was one of team members on the ground when the mass grave was discovered on March 30 and provided evidence to Forensic Architecture and Earshot for their investigation. “Following our discovery of the mass grave, the narrative from Israeli forces shifted multiple times; we were fed several versions of a blatant lie,” Whittall told Drop Site. “The men we retrieved on Eid last year were medics. We found them in their uniforms, ready to save lives, only to be killed by Israeli forces fully aware of their protected status.” Whittall, who is now executive Director of KEYS Initiative, a political affairs and strategic advisory organization, has also contributed reporting to Drop Site News. </p><p>“This illustrates an abhorrent disregard for international law,” he continued, “where any Palestinian in an Israeli-designated evacuation zone is targeted regardless of their civilian status. It highlights the total lack of accountability under which these forces operate. International governments continue to arm and trade with a leadership accused of genocide, whose soldiers massacred medics and buried them in a grave marked by the siren light of the ambulance they destroyed.”</p><p>In the aftermath of the massacre, the Israeli military provided several conflicting versions of events to justify the killings. On March 28, after the discovery of al-Attar’s body, the Israeli military admitted that its soldiers had fired on “ambulances and fire trucks.” Three days later, after the remaining bodies were discovered in a mass grave, the Israeli military claimed that “several uncoordinated vehicles were identified advancing suspiciously toward IDF troops without headlights or emergency signals.”</p><p>After footage from Radwan’s phone was first published by the New York Times a few days later, the Israeli military backtracked on its claims that the vehicles did not have emergency signals on when Israeli troops opened fire, saying the statement was inaccurate.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.idf.il/en/mini-sites/idf-press-releases-israel-at-war/april-25-pr/summary-of-the-examination-into-the-incident-involving-rescue-teams-and-vehicles-in-the-gaza-strip/\" rel=\"\">inquiry</a></p><p>The Israeli military said troops from the Golani reconnaissance battalion were involved in the attack. However, it said soldiers did not engage in “indiscriminate fire” during the incident, but that they opened fire on what they believed to be a “tangible threat” amid what the military called an “operational misunderstanding.” It blamed the attacks on “poor night visibility” and maintained the incident had unfolded in a “hostile and dangerous combat zone, under a widespread threat to the operating troops.” Six of the fifteen Palestinians killed, the military said, “were identified in a retrospective examination as Hamas terrorists,” but provided no evidence to support the claim.</p><p>“On the specific question of Israel justifying the attack on clearly marked medical personnel because of suspicions of membership in groups or links to groups or terrorism—because there is an affirmative duty to respect and protect medical personnel, you don’t shoot first, you protect first,” Gallagher told Drop Site. “But what this investigation reveals is that there was a shoot first policy, and that is unlawful under international law.”</p><p>As for the burial of the bodies in a mass grave, the Israeli military said in its report “it was decided to gather and cover the bodies to prevent further harm and clear the vehicles from the route in preparation for civilian evacuation. The body removal and vehicle crushing were carried out by field commanders.” It concluded, “removing the bodies was reasonable under the circumstances, but the decision to crush the vehicles was wrong. In general, there was no attempt to conceal the event.”</p><p>As a result of the investigation, the commanding officer of the 14th Brigade received a letter of reprimand for “his overall responsibility for the incident,” while the deputy commander of the Golani reconnaissance battalion involved in the incident was “dismissed from his position due to his responsibilities as the field commander and for providing an incomplete and inaccurate report during the debrief.”</p><p>The inquiry did not recommend any criminal action be taken against the military units responsible for the incident. The Palestine Red Crescent Society, Civil Defense, and the UN humanitarian agency in Gaza all rejected the Israeli military report.</p><p>“Attacks on medical personnel and those who are identified as medical personnel are patently unlawful under international law, and there is an affirmative obligation to protect medical personnel in the context of armed conflict. So the very first thing is that there’s a breach of that very clear and time honored principle of international humanitarian law,” Gallagher said. “When you zoom out and look at this in the context of the way the Israeli assault has been carried out over many months and years in Gaza and we see that there is a pattern and practice of attacks on medical personnel—similar to journalists and other groups that are explicitly and uniquely protected as classes of civilians in international humanitarian law—it raises even more questions and deep concern about the lack of accountability, because what we know is that impunity breeds repetition.”</p><p>Gallagher, who previously worked at the UN’s International Criminal Court for the former Yugoslavia, said that a legal analysis of the massacre would find serious violations of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. “When you’re talking about grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions, in particular war crimes, you have obligations, not just the possibility, but obligations, to open investigations,” Gallagher said.</p><p>Satellite imagery from the morning of the ambush shows that extensive earthworks were carried out at the incident site. The images reveal the construction of an earth berm approximately 220 meters north of the ambush location and another roughly 410 meters to the south. These two positions later functioned as checkpoints, restricting access and controlling passage along an evacuation route established that morning by the Israeli military leading toward the coastal Al-Mawasi area.</p><h6>The earthworks that began shortly after the attack were used in the construction of a Gaza Humanitarian Foundation “aid distribution” site, at which civilians were targeted and shot at. (Forensic Architecture, 2026).</h6><p>“On that same site of the mass grave, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation established a distribution point where desperate people were gunned down trying to access food,” Whittall told Drop Site. “Now, the U.S, under the so-called Board of Peace, plans to build a ‘New Rafah’ over this crime scene. Without meaningful accountability, ‘New Rafah’ will be a monument to impunity.”</p>",

This will prevent any in-app notifications encouraging users to try out AI features, as well as remove any previously downloaded AI models from the device. For those who wish to maintain some AI functionalities, a selective blocking option is available, enabling users to retain useful features like on-device translations while avoiding cloud-based services.</p><p>Beyond the AI kill switch, Firefox 148 offers users more control over remote updates, allowing them to opt out while still minimizing data collection. Users can set these preferences under <em>Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Settings &gt; Firefox Data Collection</em>.</p><p>The update also focuses on enhancing core web platform capabilities, including the integration of the  and  to combat cross-site scripting (XSS) issues.

      "content": "<p> is a working CSS-only x86 CPU/emulator/computer. Yes, the  CSS. No JavaScript required.</p><p>What you're seeing above is a <a href=\"https://github.com/rebane2001/x86CSS/blob/mane/c/main.c\">C program</a> that was compiled using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection\">GCC</a> into native <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8086\">8086</a> machine code being executed fully within CSS.</p><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h3>Is CSS a programming language?</h3><p>Do you really need to ask at this point?</p><p>I plan on writing a blog post that explains how this works as well as many of the tricks used. Bookmark <a href=\"https://lyra.horse/blog/\">my blog</a> or add it to your RSS reader.</p><h3>Surely you still need a little bit of JavaScript?</h3><p>There is a script tag on this site, which is there to provide a clock to the CSS - but this is only there to make the entire thing a bit faster and more stable. The CSS also has a JS-less clock implementation, so if you disable scripts on this site, it will still run. <b>JavaScript is not required.</b></p><p>My CSS clock uses an animation combined with style container queries, which means you don't need to interact with anything for the program to run, but it also means its a bit slower and less stable as a result. A hover-based clock, such as the one in <a href=\"https://dev.to/janeori/expert-css-the-cpu-hack-4ddj\">Jane Ori's CPU Hack</a>, is fast and stable, but requires you to hold your mouse on the screen, <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32622021\">which some people claim</a> does not count as turing complete for whatever reason, so I wanted this demo to be fully functional with zero user input.</p><h3>But you still need HTML, right?</h3><p>Not really... well, kind of?</p><p>This entire CPU runs in just CSS and doesn't require any HTML code, but there is no way to load the CSS without a &lt;style&gt; tag, so that much is required. In Firefox <a href=\"https://lyra.horse/fun/tic-tac-nohtml/\">it is possible</a> to load CSS with no HTML, but atm this demo only works in Chromium-based browsers.</p><h3>Why does it only work in Chrome?</h3><p>This project uses a few CSS features, such as <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Values/if\">if() statements</a>, <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/At-rules/@container#container_style_queries\">style queries</a>, and custom <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/At-rules/@function\">@functions</a>, that are not available in all browsers. At this time, it's only compatible with Chromium-based browsers, but hopefully that'll change at some point since the features used are in the CSS spec. I usually make sure to target Firefox in the projects I make, but it's just not realistic for me with this one.</p><h3>What preprocessor do you use?</h3><p>I straight up just write CSS! The CSS in <a href=\"https://github.com/rebane2001/x86css/blob/mane/base_template.html\">base_template.html</a> is handwritten in Sublime Text, but for the more repetitive parts of the code I wrote a <a href=\"https://github.com/rebane2001/x86css/blob/mane/build_css.py\">python script</a>.</p><h3>What ai/model/llm do you use?</h3><p> I don't think you can build a project like this with an llm.</p><p>Not really, you can get way better performance by writing code in CSS directly rather than emulating an entire archaic CPU architecture.</p><p>It is fun though, and computers are made for art and fun!</p><h3>Can I write/run my own programs?</h3><p>Yes, but you'll have to compile them yourself. See below.</p><p>No, not in its current state.</p><h3>Have you figured out how to center a div?</h3><h3>You were so preoccupied with whether or not you could that you didn't stop to think if you should</h3><p>idk why everybody keeps saying that, obviously i thought about whether i should first and came to the conclusion that it would be fun and cool asf to do it</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86\">x86</a> is the CPU architecture most computers these days run on. Heavily simplified, this demo runs the same machine code in CSS that your computer does in its processor. To be fair, modern x86 is 64bit and has a bunch of useful extensions, so it's not quite the same - this here is the original 16bit x86 that ran on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8086\">8086</a>.</p><p>This project implements most of the x86 architecture, but not literally every single instruction and quirk, because a lot of it is unnecessary and not worth adding.</p><p>The way I approached this project was by writing programs I wanted to run in C, compiling them in GCC with various levels of optimization, and then implementing every instruction I needed. This way I know I have everything I need implemented.</p><p>There is some behaviour that's wrong, and some things are missing (e.g. setting the CF/OF flag bits). That's okay.</p><p>You can run your own software in this emulator!</p><p>If you have 8086 assembly ready to go, clone my repo, and put the assembly in a file called . Then, put the address of the _start() function in  as a number. Once that's set, you can just run  with Python3 (no dependencies required!) and the output will be in .</p><p>If you want to write C code, you can do so using <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/tkchia/build-ia16\">gcc-ia16</a> (you can build it yourself or install it from the <a href=\"https://launchpad.net/~tkchia/+archive/ubuntu/build-ia16/\">PPA</a>). The  script does the build with the correct flags and also makes the  files. Don't forget to run  after! This building setup works on both Linux and WSL1/2 (I haven't tried on macOS).</p><p>By default there is 0x600 bytes (1.5kB) of memory, but this can be increased in the  file as necessary. The program gets loaded at memory address 0x100. There's some custom I/O addresses for you to be able to interface with the program.</p><p>Here's an example program:</p><pre><code>static const char STR_4BYTES[] = \"hell\";\nstatic const char STR_8BYTES[] = \"o world!\";\n\nvoid (*writeChar1)(char);\nvoid (*writeChar4)(const char[4]);\nvoid (*writeChar8)(const char[8]);\nchar (*readInput)(void);\n\nint _start(void) {\n  // Set up custom stuff\n  writeChar1 = (void*)(0x2000);\n  writeChar4 = (void*)(0x2002);\n  writeChar8 = (void*)(0x2004);\n  readInput = (void*)(0x2006);\n  int* SHOW_KEYBOARD = (int*)(0x2100);\n\n  // Write a single byte to screen\n  writeChar1(0x0a);\n  // Write 4 bytes from pointer to screen\n  writeChar4(STR_4BYTES);\n  // Write 8 bytes from pointer to screen\n  writeChar8(STR_8BYTES);\n  // Write a character from custom charset\n  writeChar1(0x80);\n\n  while (1) {\n    // Show numeric keyboard\n    *SHOW_KEYBOARD = 1;\n    // Read keyboard input\n    char input = readInput();\n    if (!input) continue;\n    *SHOW_KEYBOARD = 0;\n    // Echo input\n    writeChar1(input);\n    break;\n  }\n\n  while (1) {\n    // Show alphanumeric keyboard\n    *SHOW_KEYBOARD = 2;\n    char input = readInput();\n    if (!input) continue;\n    *SHOW_KEYBOARD = 0;\n    writeChar1(input);\n    break;\n  }\n\n  return 1337;\n}</code></pre>",

      "content": "<p>If you eat food, you’re already in this story.</p><p>John Deere is still trying to kill the Right to Repair, but Iowa farmers are pushing hard to retake their rights. On February 18, the Iowa House Agriculture Committee advanced a fix, <a href=\"https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ga=91&amp;ba=HSB751\">HSB 751</a>, by an 18-5 vote. That’s a big margin, and it puts the bill on a very real path forward in one of the country’s largest agricultural producers, a state that <a href=\"https://data.ers.usda.gov/reports.aspx?ID=4058\">accounts for about a fifth of US agricultural receipts</a>.</p><h2><strong>Why Do We Need Agricultural Right to Repair?</strong></h2><p>Why should you care if you don’t own a tractor? Because when a combine goes down in the middle of harvest, it means fewer acres cut before the rain hits. It means grain that doesn’t get hauled on time. We like to imagine the food supply as a smooth conveyor belt. In reality it’s tight timing, thin margins, and a lot of heavy machinery that increasingly runs on proprietary software.</p><p>A modern combine can be mechanically fine and still be effectively broken, because the owner can’t access the diagnostic tools and software needed to complete the repair. The part might be sitting right there, but the “key” to make it work lives behind a dealer login. Agricultural Right to Repair aims to hand the keys back to farmers so they can get food back on our tables.</p><p>Colorado was the first state to put that principle into law. In 2023 it <a href=\"https://www.ifixit.com/News/73291/colorado-approves-first-ever-agricultural-right-to-repair-bill?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">passed the first-ever agricultural Right to Repair bill</a> in the US. The law requires manufacturers like Deere to provide access to the same kinds of manuals, diagnostic tools, software, and parts that dealers use, on fair terms.</p><p>And yet, even after Colorado, Deere has fought the spirit of Right to Repair. They concede a little, keep the high-leverage stuff gated, and call it a solution. Our advocacy partners at <a href=\"https://pirg.org/resources/john-deere-and-right-to-repair-over-the-years/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">PIRG have covered the full play-by-play</a>. Deere keeps promising “full repair access” and then kicking the can down the road. In order to hold their feet to the fire, we need to pass repair laws in more places.</p><h2><strong>Farmers Just Want to Be Able to Fix Their $500k Machines</strong></h2><p>Why is this an increasing problem? Software has created a specific gap in farmers’ abilities.</p><p>Deere equipment relies on proprietary diagnostic software, and dealers use a special tool that is more capable than what the farmers have. That dealer-grade access includes deeper diagnostics, part calibrations, software updates, and specialty tests and resets. Farmers, meanwhile, have been a more limited tool that can be useful, but often stops short of the capabilities they need to complete the repair.</p><p><a href=\"https://pirg.org/arizona/resources/deere-in-the-headlights-ii-2/\">PIRG’s </a> reporting has consistently pointed out that the gap isn’t just information. It’s missing capability, and the result is downtime. During harvest, downtime is a ticking clock.</p><p>Iowans are rolling up their sleeves. Chair Rep. Derek Wulf, a farmer himself, framed it plainly: farmers are problem-solvers. They fix things. The bill is about making solutions possible in a world where “broken” increasingly means “software-locked,” not “physically shattered.”</p><p>The committee adopted a Wulf amendment aimed at dealer concerns about pricing mechanisms. The bill’s basic structure is “fair and reasonable” access, with parity to authorized repair providers and caps tied to MSRP. The amendment reportedly removed “at cost” language on parts to win dealer neutrality. That’s a familiar legislative trade, and it doesn’t change what’s at stake.</p><p>Next up: The bill goes to the House floor. We think it’s got a good chance of passing.</p><p><strong>Deere’s Allies Are Stepping Back</strong></p><p>In Iowa politics, that matters. If those groups actively oppose a bill, it usually dies. When they decline to fight it, the bill has oxygen. Neutral is not the same thing as supportive, but it does suggest the reflex to line up behind manufacturer control is weaker than it used to be.</p><p>That matters because Deere’s standard strategy depends on using stand-ins to block progress. If the blockers stay out of the game, Deere’s flimsy arguments have to stand on their own.</p><h2><strong>We Can’t Let Deere Run From This One</strong></h2><p>This bill has a good chance of making it all the way through.&nbsp; That’s fantastic. If you buy a half-million-dollar machine, you should not need corporate permission to keep it running. Deere has made “permission” part of the product.</p>",

You can select an example, then click on any highlighted chunk of the output. The panel below will update to show:</p><ol><li><strong>Input Feature attribution:</strong> which tokens in the input prompt strongly influenced that chunk.</li><li> the ranked list of concepts, both tone (e.g. analytical, ) and content (e.g. Genetic alteration methodologies), that the model routed through to produce that chunk.</li><li><strong>Training data attribution:</strong> how the concepts in that chunk distribute across training sources (ArXiv, Wikipedia, FLAN, etc.), showing where in the training data the model’s knowledge originates.</li></ol><p>Steerling is built on a <a href=\"https://www.guidelabs.ai/post/block-causal-diffusion-language-model/\">causal discrete diffusion model</a> backbone, which lets us steer generation across multi-token tokens rather than only at the next-token.\nThe key design choice is decomposing the model’s embeddings into three explicit pathways: ~33K supervised “known” concepts, ~100K “discovered” concepts the model learns on its own, and a residual that captures whatever remains.</p><p>We then constrain the model with training loss functions that ensure the model routes signal through concepts without a fundamental tradeoff with performance.\nThe concepts feed into logits through a linear path, every prediction decomposes exactly into per-concept contributions, and we can edit those contributions at inference time without retraining.\nFor the full architecture, training objectives, and scaling analysis, see <a href=\"https://www.guidelabs.ai/post/scaling-interpretable-models-8b/\">Scaling Interpretable Models to 8B</a>.</p><img src=\"https://www.guidelabs.ai/images/embedding_decomposition.apng\" alt=\"Diagram showing Steerling's embedding decomposition into known concepts, discovered concepts, and residual\" width=\"2200\" height=\"900\"><p>Despite being trained on significantly fewer compute than comparable models, Steerling-8B achieves competitive performance across standard benchmarks. The figure below shows average performance (across 7 benchmarks) versus approximate training FLOPs on a log scale, with vertical lines marking multiples of Steerling’s compute budget.</p><figure><figcaption><p>Steerling outperforms both LLaMA2-7B and Deepseek-7B on overall average despite using fewer FLOPs, and remains within range of models trained with 2–10× more compute.</p></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><p>Steerling performance across various benchmarks ranging from general purpose question answering to those focused on reasoning and math.</p></figcaption></figure><p>In the <a href=\"https://www.guidelabs.ai/post/scaling-interpretable-models-8b/\">previous update</a>, we shared several ways that assess how interpretable a model’s representations are.\nHere we provide another metric that gives insight into the model’s use of its concepts. On a held-out validation set, over 84% of token-level contribution comes from the concept module: the model is not just using the residual to make its predictions.\nThis matters for control: if the model’s predictions genuinely flow through concepts, then editing those concepts at inference time actually changes what the model does rather than nudging a side channel while the real work happens elsewhere.</p><figure><figcaption><p>Token level logit distribution of Steerling-8B’s activations on a held-out validation set. Over 84% of token-level contribution comes from the concept module.</p></figcaption></figure><p>A useful check is what happens when we remove the residual pathway. On several LM Harness tasks, dropping the residual has only a small effect, which suggests the model’s predictive signal is largely routed through concepts rather than hidden “everything-else” channels.</p><figure><figcaption><p>Change in model performance across a variety of benchmarks with and without the model’s residual portion. This indicates that the model mostly relies on concepts, both supervised or discovered, for its outputs.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Finally, Steerling can  in text with  on a held-out validation dataset.</p><p>In the coming weeks, we’ll be releasing deep dives on each of these capabilities:</p><ul><li>: precise control via intervention;</li><li>: what did Steerling learn that we didn’t teach it? We’ll open up the discovered concept space and show structure that surprised us.</li><li><strong>Alignment without fine-tuning</strong>: replace thousands of safety training examples with a handful of concept-level interventions.</li><li><strong>Memorization &amp; training data valuation</strong>: trace any generation back to the training data that produced it, and assign value to individual data sources.</li><li><strong>The case for inherent interpretability</strong>: what do you gain when interpretability is designed in from the start, and what do you miss when it’s bolted on after the fact?</li></ul><p>We’ll cover each of these in detail in upcoming posts, with quantitative evaluations and deployment-oriented case studies.</p>",

I chose them because they have something to say, and because metal demands honesty.”</p><p>This, reads the statement, is not a “novelty album”. Tune in for “massive guitars, cinematic arrangements”, and for “sharp turns, dark humor, raw emotion, and moments of unexpected beauty”; this, dear reader, is life itself.</p><p aria-hidden=\"true\">Shatner got the inspiration for the project after collaborating with former <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.guitarworld.com/artists/guitarists/chris-poland-on-megadeth-killing-is-my-business\" data-url=\"https://www.guitarworld.com/artists/guitarists/chris-poland-on-megadeth-killing-is-my-business\" data-hl-processed=\"none\" data-mrf-recirculation=\"inline-link\" data-before-rewrite-localise=\"https://www.guitarworld.com/artists/guitarists/chris-poland-on-megadeth-killing-is-my-business\">Megadeth guitarist Chris Poland</a>, delivering a spoken word intro Barry Clayton for the new album from Nuclear Messiah, .</p><p>“When Nuclear Messiah came to life, something clicked,” says Shatner. “It wasn’t just a track – it was a doorway. It made me want to go all the way in, bring in the best metal players I could find, and create something fearless.”</p><p aria-hidden=\"true\">No names have been officially attached just yet, but part of the inspiration for the project was the guitar <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.guitarworld.com/tag/zakk-wylde\" data-auto-tag-linker=\"true\" data-url=\"https://www.guitarworld.com/tag/zakk-wylde\" data-hl-processed=\"none\" data-mrf-recirculation=\"inline-link\" data-before-rewrite-localise=\"https://www.guitarworld.com/tag/zakk-wylde\">Zakk Wylde</a> personally gifted the  star – a gesture Shatner describes as unexpected and deeply motivating. That makes the former Ozzy guitarist a shoo-in for the record. Ditto, Chris Poland; we’d bet his legato will be dripping all over at least one of these tracks.</p><p>As for the rest? Well, it’s from a roster of 35 quote/unquote metal icons, each hand-picked by Shatner – as though he has summoned the best and the brightest from <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.metal-archives.com/\" target=\"_blank\" data-url=\"https://www.metal-archives.com/\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer-when-downgrade\" data-hl-processed=\"none\" data-mrf-recirculation=\"inline-link\">The Metal Archives</a> and lined them up in a carpark, Shatner beatifically gliding along on a Segway, pausing only to tap the chosen ones on the shoulder.</p><p>Shatner says there will be some choice covers of <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.guitarworld.com/tag/black-sabbath\" data-auto-tag-linker=\"true\" data-url=\"https://www.guitarworld.com/tag/black-sabbath\" data-hl-processed=\"none\" data-mrf-recirculation=\"inline-link\" data-before-rewrite-localise=\"https://www.guitarworld.com/tag/black-sabbath\">Black Sabbath</a>, Judas Priest and <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.guitarworld.com/tag/iron-maiden\" data-auto-tag-linker=\"true\" data-url=\"https://www.guitarworld.com/tag/iron-maiden\" data-hl-processed=\"none\" data-mrf-recirculation=\"inline-link\" data-before-rewrite-localise=\"https://www.guitarworld.com/tag/iron-maiden\">Iron Maiden</a> standards, but there will be all-original material, too. He knows what he is doing with these all-star collaborations.</p><p>In the past he has worked with a diverse cast of players, with 2004’s  featuring the likes of Henry Rollins, <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.guitarworld.com/tag/adrian-belew\" data-auto-tag-linker=\"true\" data-url=\"https://www.guitarworld.com/tag/adrian-belew\" data-hl-processed=\"none\" data-mrf-recirculation=\"inline-link\" data-before-rewrite-localise=\"https://www.guitarworld.com/tag/adrian-belew\">Adrian Belew</a>, Brad Paisley, the wonderful Aimee Mann and more – including his collab with Pulp on . Paisley returned for 2021’s , joining Joe Walsh and Robert Randolph in the studio.</p><p>So, we wait with bated breath. We’ll bring you more details on this Shatner-fronted metal project as soon as they arrive.</p><p>To paraphrase the original ‘Metal Warriors’: Klingons and Romulans leave the hall, heavy metal or no metal at all!</p>",

      "content": "<p>In my post from 2026-02-11, I committed myself towards helping work\non coreboot + libreboot with the goal of porting it to the X270. It’s\nless than a month later and I have done it. My X270 is a 20HM model and\nthis means that it is a Kaby Lake CPU (and chipset), not Skylake.</p><p>I started by dumping the BIOS image from the X270, initially for two\nreasons (although there are more):</p><ul><li>to have a backup in case anything went wrong</li><li>to obtain the Intel Management Engine section to produce deltas for\n<a href=\"https://codeberg.org/libreboot/deguard\">deguard</a></li></ul><p>Remaining reasons that are important later are:</p><ul><li>the GbE section of the BIOS is necessary for ethernet</li><li>the IFD (Intel Flash Descriptor) is necessary for producing a\nfinished image</li></ul><p>I set up pico-serprog on an RP2040-zero, which I found builds for\nfrom the Libreboot project website. This, in combination with\n is what I used to dump and write to the SPI flash\nfor the X270.</p><p>It turns out, in the process of attempting to clip onto the laptop, I\nknocked off a capacitor.</p><p>I didn’t know what capacitor, either, because trying to resolder it\nin place, it pinged off of my tweezers  to never be\nseen again.</p><p>I used silkscreen markings and referenced a schematic (which I\nobtained for the purpose of fixing this missing capacitor to begin with)\nto find the area of the board I had likely damaged. The marking “PJ304”\ncame in helpful.</p><p>By checking what pin on the chip below the tweezers went to the leads\non the capacitor that had been accidentally ripped off and the\nneighbouring capacitors, it was possible to determine these capacitors\nwere put in parallel between ground and a particular pin of the chip,\nallowing me to narrow it down to the above.</p><p>Digikey, then, comes in clutch at like C$10 for 10 capacitors and\nnext day shipping.</p><p>I wanted to make sure that I had something valid so I checked the\nstring content of the flash.</p><p>Sure, seems coherent. I then examined the file with ifdtool, using\nthe dump switch.</p><p>From here, I followed the instructions in the deguard README,\nproducing <a href=\"https://codeberg.org/kittywitch/deguard/commit/24479dca9a9fd0030f8a911486837fafbdf1af17\">this\ncommit</a> in the process. You can use a patched version of the Intel\nManagement Engine to produce the deltas and this was something prior\nthat was unclear to me, and an interpretation another friend of mine\nhad. It isn’t the case that it has to also be vulnerable, at all!</p><p>These regions being extracted separately is quite important, the\nflash descriptor and GbE are both very necessary to produce a final\nimage that functions. I had also tried to figure out how deguard worked\nbeing applied to the donor image, to understand the whole system\nbetter.</p><h3><a href=\"https://dork.dev/posts/2026-02-20-ported-coreboot/#differences-between-the-x270-and-x280---part-1\">§</a> Differences\nbetween the X270 and X280 - part 1</h3><p>Now, I knew the X280 and X270 differed by two things, initially:</p><ul><li>The X270 lacks Thunderbolt (TBT).</li><li>The X280 has some form of soldered RAM, the X270 has a single SODIMM\nslot.</li></ul><p>We will see some problems later, but initially, basing my work off of\nthe X280 variant, I made changes to it where I disabled the\nThunderbolt-related pins (while regarding the official Intel\ndocumentation for the generation of chipset; for example one of the TBT\npins was thermal management for my machine, so it was fine to set the\npin to NONE instead of something more complicated.</p><p>I was seeing things lining up on the GPIO pins (gpio.h), aside from\nthe Thunderbolt controller related pins.</p><p>I did notice during this experience, referencing between the X280 and\nX270 schematics that the MEC1653 was something the X270 had, but the\nX280 had the MEC1663. This meant that WWAN_DISABLE was one of the only\nlines coming off of the Wireless section of the MEC1663 on the X280, but\nthere were more lines on the X270 than that. This is unrelated, I just\nthought it was neat that there were so many different versions of the\nMEC16xx, lots of derivatives? They all seem well supported by the same\nMEC1653 driver in coreboot.</p><p>I got something to build and then I decided to go to bed for the\nnight.</p><p>The next day, I went with my wife to pick up my capacitors (I had\nmissed them the day prior, whoops).</p><h3><a href=\"https://dork.dev/posts/2026-02-20-ported-coreboot/#why-cant-my-board-boot-off-of-nvme-uh-oh.\">§</a> Why can’t my board\nboot off of NVMe? Uh oh.</h3><p>Wow, a suspiciously shitty looking capacitor. To be fair, that is\n0.8x1.6mm? It’s pretty small. (This was not the only time this capacitor\nfell off, I had to fix it again afterwards at least 8 attempts of\nflashing later.)</p><p>I had something that would actually get to payloads, but when I would\nselect the NVMe NS 1 it would very, very quickly fail out. When I went\nback to the SeaBIOS menu, I noticed the NVMe NS 1 option then missing.\nBooting into a LiveUSB, I discovered I had neither the WiFi card or the\nNVMe present in .</p><p>I had posted in #libreboot on liberachat a little earlier that I had\nthe X270 booting, however I realized pretty quickly after that it was\nnot all sunshine and rainbows.</p><p>After a while of talking about the X270 and potential need for\nupstreaming now, I started speaking about the issue and Leah Rowe,\nfounder of Libreboot (and CanoeBoot and Minifree Ltd) worked with me on\nattempting to diagnose and fix the problem, producing several ROMs for\nme given that I potentially may have done things incorrectly. In the\nend, even with a mostly intact (albeit HAP-bit and Deguarded) Intel\nManagement Engine, it was likely not anything to do with the IME like I\nwas theorizing (I had read an issue for the t470s about being careful\nwith me_cleaner and how truncation caused problems with NVMe and WiFi\ndropouts. I have to assume this was actually something that could’ve\nbeen mitigated with ).</p><p>I’m very thankful for the patience shown towards me, to be frank.\n^^;</p><h3><a href=\"https://dork.dev/posts/2026-02-20-ported-coreboot/#differences-between-the-x270-and-x280---part-2\">§</a> Differences\nbetween the X270 and X280 - part 2</h3><p>I was pretty upset by this point, but I woke up to give it a try the\nnext day. At this point, we had figured that the problem was likely to\ndo with PCIe allocations and perhaps the overridetree.cb?</p><p>Looking into this and the schematic later in the day together with my\nwife, I ended up noticing that CLKREQ4 on the X280 schematic led\nnowhere. On the X270, the WLAN card had two CLKOUT and CLKREQ\nconnections. Looking deeper into this, there was a table showing the\nseparation of the WiGig and WiFi card into two separate PCIe devices\ndespite being contained within the one card. Going down this route, I\nfigured that using CLKREQ1 for WiFi was incorrect and that CLKREQ2 was\nthe appropriate one. Given this, it also made the rest of the CLKREQ\nselections then further by one, too.</p><p>Adjusting for this and regarding the WWAN allocation within the\nschematic, I made a new build with these adjustments and flashed it. I\nwas greeted with… a working GRUB.</p><p>Guix booted and I was able to read  from within\nGuix System, showing the Libreboot console log. Wireless (albeit,\nproprietary) worked! NVMe worked!</p><p>I am starting to upstream my changes:</p><p>For the X270 in particular, I got an ath9k wireless dongle so I\nshould now be able to move to linux-libre on my Guix install. I’d like\nto build it into the laptop if possible in the future through some means\nand I’ll see about doing that, honestly?</p><p>I can’t recommend <a href=\"https://libreboot.org/\">libreboot</a>\nenough, or even <a href=\"https://osresearch.net/\">heads</a> if libreboot\nisn’t your speed. A big thanks to Leah Rowe for their assistance and the\nwork they have done for libreboot over the years.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Meta, Amazon, Google, OpenAI, and other tech companies spent billions last year investing in AI. They’re expected to spend even more, roughly $700 billion, this year on dozens of new data centers to train and run their advanced models.</p><p>This spending frenzy has kept Wall Street buzzing and fueled a narrative that all this investment is helping prop up and even grow the U.S. economy.</p><p>President Donald Trump has cited that argument as a reason the industry should not face state-level regulations.</p><p>“Investment in AI is helping to make the U.S. Economy the ‘HOTTEST’ in the World — But overregulation by the States is threatening to undermine this Growth Engine,” Trump wrote in a <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115572931492563128\">post</a> on Truth Social in November. “We MUST have one Federal Standard instead of a patchwork of 50 State Regulatory Regimes.”</p><p>Some prominent economists have also given credibility to this story with their analysis. Jason Furman, a Harvard economics professor, said in a <a href=\"https://x.com/jasonfurman/status/1971995367202775284\">post</a> on X that investments in information processing equipment and software accounted for 92% of GDP growth in the first half of the year. Meanwhile, economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis similarly estimated that AI-related investments <a href=\"https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2026/jan/tracking-ai-contribution-gdp-growth\">made up 39% of GDP growth</a> in the third quarter of 2025.</p><p>But now some Wall Street analysts are starting to rethink this narrative.</p><p>“It was a very intuitive story,” Joseph Briggs, a Goldman Sachs analyst, told <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2026/02/23/ai-economic-growth-gdp-mirage/\">The Washington Post</a> on Monday. “That maybe prevented or limited the need to actually dig deeper into what was happening.”</p><p>Briggs’ colleague, Goldman Sachs Chief Economist Jan Hatzius, said in an interview with the Atlantic Council that AI investment spending has had “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZHN0-ZNe_4\">basically zero</a>” contribution to the U.S. GDP growth in 2025.</p><p>“We don’t actually view AI investment as strongly growth positive,” said Hatzius. “I think there’s a lot of misreporting, actually, of the impact AI investment had on U.S. GDP growth in 2025, and it’s much smaller than is often perceived.”</p><p>Hatzius said one major reason is that much of the equipment powering AI is imported. While U.S. companies are spending billions, importing chips and hardware offsets those investments in GDP calculations.</p><p>“A lot of the AI investment that we’re seeing in the U.S. adds to Taiwanese GDP, and it adds to Korean GDP but not really that much to U.S. GDP,” he said.</p><p>On top of that, there is currently no reliable way to accurately measure how AI use among businesses and consumers contributes to economic growth.</p><p>So far, many business leaders say AI hasn’t significantly improved productivity.</p><p>A recent <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w34836\">survey</a> of nearly 6,000 executives in the U.S., Europe, and Australia found that despite 70% of firms actively using AI, about 80% reported no impact on employment or productivity.</p>",

      "content": "<p>LLMs don’t—and can’t—do everything. What they do is very impressive—and useful. It’s broad. And in many ways it’s human-like. But it’s not precise. And in the end it’s not about deep computation. </p><p>So how can we supplement LLM foundation models? We need a foundation tool: a tool that’s broad and general and does what LLMs themselves don’t: provides deep computation and precise knowledge. </p><p>And, conveniently enough, that’s exactly what I’ve been building for the past 40 years! My goal with <a href=\"https://www.wolfram.com/language/\">Wolfram Language</a> has always been to make everything we can about the world computable. To bring together in a coherent and unified way the algorithms, the methods and the data to do precise computation whenever it’s possible. It’s been a huge undertaking, but I think it’s fair to say it’s been a <a href=\"https://www.wolfram.com/\">hugely successful one</a>—that’s fueled countless discoveries and inventions (<a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/all-by-date/\">including my own</a>) across a remarkable range of areas of science, technology and beyond.</p><p>But now it’s not just humans who can take advantage of this technology; it’s AIs—and in particular LLMs—as well. LLM foundation models are powerful. But LLM foundation models with our foundation tool are even more so. And with the maturing of LLMs we’re finally now in a position to provide to LLMs access to Wolfram tech in a standard, general way.</p><p>It is, I believe, an important moment of convergence. My concept over the decades has been to build very broad and general technology—which is now a perfect fit for the breadth of LLM foundation models. LLMs can call specific specialized tools, and that will be useful for plenty of specific specialized purposes. But what Wolfram Language uniquely represents is a general tool—with general access to the great power that precise computation and knowledge bring. </p><p>But there’s actually also much more. I designed Wolfram Language from the beginning to be a powerful medium not only for doing computation but also for <a href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/05/what-weve-built-is-a-computational-language-and-thats-very-important\">representing and thinking about things computationally</a>. I’d always assumed I was doing this for humans. But it now turns out that AIs need the same things—and that Wolfram Language provides the perfect medium for AIs to “think” and “reason” computationally.</p><p>There’s another point as well. In its effort to make as much as possible computable, Wolfram Language not only has an immense amount inside, but also provides a uniquely unified hub for <a href=\"https://www.wolfram.com/compatibility-and-connectivity/\">connecting to other systems and services</a>. And that’s part of why it’s now possible to make such an effective connection between LLM foundation models and the foundation tool that is the Wolfram Language.</p><p>Would LLMs even in the end need tools at all? Or—despite the fundamental issues that seemed at least to me scientifically rather clear right from the start—would LLMs somehow magically find a way to do deep computation themselves? Or to guarantee to get precise, reliable results? And even if LLMs were going to use tools, how would that process be engineered, and what would the deployment model for it be?</p><p>Three years have now passed, and much has clarified. The core capabilities of LLMs have come into better focus (even though there’s a lot we still don’t know scientifically about them). And it’s become much clearer that—at least for the modalities LLMs currently address—most of the growth in their practical value is going to have to do with how they are harnessed and connected. And this understanding highlights more than ever the broad importance of providing LLMs with the foundation tool that our technology represents.</p><p>And the good news is that there are now streamlined ways to do this—using protocols and methods that have emerged around LLMs, and using new technology that we’ve developed. The tighter the integration between foundation models and our foundation tool, the more powerful the combination will be. Ultimately it’ll be a story of aligning the pre-training and core engineering of LLMs with our foundation tool. But an approach that’s immediately and broadly applicable today—and for which we’re releasing several new products—is based on what we call computation-augmented generation, or CAG. </p><p>The key idea of CAG is to inject in real time capabilities from our foundation tool into the stream of content that LLMs generate. In traditional retrieval-augmented generation, or RAG, one is injecting content that has been retrieved from existing documents. CAG is like an infinite extension of RAG, in which an infinite amount of content can be generated on the fly—using computation—to feed to an LLM. Internally, CAG is a somewhat complex piece of technology that has taken a long time for us to develop. But in its deployment it’s something that we’ve made easy to integrate into existing LLM-related systems and workflows. And today we’re launching it, so that going forward any LLM system—and LLM foundation model—can count on being able to access our foundation tool, and being able to supplement their capabilities with the superpower of precise, deep computation and knowledge. </p><p>Today we’re launching <a href=\"https://www.wolfram.com/artificial-intelligence/foundation-tool/\">three primary methods</a> for accessing our Foundation Tool, all based on computation-augmented generation (CAG), and all leveraging our rather huge software engineering technology stack.</p><p><img src=\"https://content.wolfram.com/sites/43/2026/02/icon-mcp-service.png\" alt=\"MCP Service\" title=\"MCP Service\">Immediately call our Foundation Tool from within any MCP-compatible LLM-based system.

      "content": "<p>My old 2016 MacBook Pro has been collecting dust in a cabinet for some time now. The laptop suffers from a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/flexgate-macbook-pro-display-issue/\">“flexgate” problem</a>, and I don’t have any practical use for it. For quite some time, I’ve been thinking about repurposing it as a guinea pig, to play with FreeBSD — an OS that I’d aspired to play with for a long while, but had never had a real reason to.</p><p>During the recent holiday season, right after FreeBSD 15 release, I’ve finally found time to set the laptop up. Doing that I didn’t plan, or even think, this may turn into a story about AI coding.</p><p>2016 MacBook Pro models use Broadcom BCM4350 Wi-Fi chip and FreeBSD doesn’t support it natively. To have a working Wi-Fi, a typical suggestion on FreeBSD forums, is to run wifibox — a tiny Linux VM, with the PCI Wi-Fi device in pass through, that allows Linux to manage the device through its brcmfmac driver.</p><p>Brcmfmac is a Linux driver (ISC licence) for set of FullMAC chips from Broadcom. The driver offloads the processing jobs, like 802.11 frame movement, WPA encryption and decryption, etc, to the firmware, which is running inside the chip. Meanwhile, the driver and the OS do high-level management work (ref <a href=\"https://wireless.docs.kernel.org/en/latest/en/users/drivers/brcm80211.html\">Broadcom brcmfmac(PCIe) in Linux Wireless documentation</a>).</p><p>Say we want to build a native FreeBSD kernel module for BCM4350. In theory, the separation of jobs between the firmware and the driver sounds perfect. The “management” part of work is what FreeBSD already does for other Wi-Fi devices it supports. What’s left is to port some amount of existing “glue code” from the specifics of Linux to FreeBSD. If we ignore a lot of details, the problem doesn’t sound too complicated, right?</p><p>A level-zero idea, when one hears about “porting a bunch of existing code from A to B”, in 2026 is, of course, to use AI. So that was what I tried.</p><p>I cloned the brcmfmac subtree from Linux, and asked Claude Code to make it work for FreeBSD. FreeBSD already has drivers that work through LinuxKPI — compatibility layer for running Linux kernel drivers. So I specifically pointed Claude at the iwlwifi driver (a softmac driver for Intel wireless network card), asking “do as they did it”. And, at first, this even looked like this can work — Claude told me so.</p><p>The module, indeed, compiled, but it didn’t do anything. Because, of course: the VM, where we tested the module, didn’t even have the hardware. After I set the PCI device into the VM, and attempted to load the driver against the chip, the challenges started to pop up immediately. The kernel paniced, and after Claude fixed the panics, it discovered that “module didn’t do anything”. Claude honestly tried to sift through the code, adding more and more  wrappers here and there. It complained about missing features in LinuxKPI. The module kept causing panics, and the agent kept building FreeBSD-specific shims and callbacks, while warning me that this project will be very complicated and messy.</p><p>After a number of sessions, the diff, produced by the agent, stared to look significantly larger than what I’d hoped it will be. Even worse, the driver didn’t look even close to be working. This was right around time when Armin Ronacher posted about his experience <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ANQ1IYsFM2s?si=GP6oVkBN-5_hmIFM\">building a game from scratch with Claude Opus and PI agent</a>.</p><p>Besides the part that working in <a href=\"https://pi.dev\">Pi coding agent</a> feels more productive, than in Claude Code, the video got me thinking that my approach to the task was too straightforward. The code of brcmfmac driver is moderately large. The driver supports several generations of Wi-Fi adaptors, different capabilities, etc. But my immediate task was very narrow: one chip, only PCI, only Wi-Fi client.</p><p>Instead of continuing with the code, I spawned a fresh Pi session, and asked the agent to write a detailed specification of how the brcmfmac driver works, with the focus on BCM4350 Wi-Fi chip. I explicitly set the audience for the specification to be readers, who are tasked with implementing the specification in a clean-room environment. I asked the agent to explain how things work “to the bits”. I added some high-level details for how I wanted the specification to be laid out, and let the agent go brrrr.</p><p>After a couple of rounds, the agent produced me a “book of 11 chapters”, that honestly looked like a fine specification</p><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>% ls --tree spec/  \nspec  \n├── 00-overview.md  \n├── 01-data-structures.md  \n├── 02-bus-layer.md  \n├── 03-protocol-layer.md  \n├── 04-firmware-interface.md  \n├── 05-event-handling.md  \n├── 06-cfg80211-operations.md  \n├── 07-initialization.md  \n├── 08-data-path.md  \n├── 09-firmware-commands.md  \n└── 10-structures-reference.md  \n</code></pre><p>Of course, one can’t just trust what AI has written.</p><p>To proofread the spec I spawned a clean Pi sessions, and — for fun — asked Codex model, to read the specification, and flag any places, where the text isn’t aligned with the driver’s code (<em>“Source code is the ground truth. The spec needs to be verified, and updated with any missing or wrong details”</em>). The agent followed through and found several places to fix, and also proposed multiple improvements.</p><p>Of course, one can’t just trust what AI has written, even if this was in a proofreading session.</p><p>To double-proofread the fixes I spawned another clean Pi sessions, asking Opus model to verify if what was proposed was aligned with how it works in the code of the driver.</p><blockquote><p>As a procrastination exercise, I tried this loop with a couple of coding models: Opus 4.5, Opus 4.6, Codex 5.2, Gemini 3 Pro preview. So far my experience was that Gemini hallucinated the most. This was quite sad, given that the model itself isn’t too bad for simple coding tasks, and it is free for a limited use.</p></blockquote><p>Having a written specification should have (in theory) explained how a driver’s code interacts with the firmware.</p><p>I started a fresh project, with nothing but the mentioned “spec”, and prompted the Pi agent, that we were building a brand new FreeBSD driver for BCM4350 chip. I pointed the agent to the specification, and asked it to ask me back about any important decisions we must make, and details we must outline, before jumping into “slopping the code”. The agent came back with questions and decision points, like “Will the driver live in the kernels source-tree?”, “Will we write the code in C?”, “Will we rely on LinuxKPI?”, “What are our high-level milestones?”, etc. One influential bit, that turned fairly productive moving forward, was that I asked the agent to document all these decision points in the project’s docs, and to explicitly referenced to these decision docs in the project’s AGENTS.md.</p><p>It’s worth saying that, just like in any real project, not all decisions stayed to the end. For example,</p><p>Initially I asked the agent to build the driver using  and . My naive thinking was that, given the spec was written after looking at Linux driver’s code, it might be simpler for the agent, than building the on top of the native primitives. After a couple of sessions, it didn’t look like this was the case. I asked the agent to drop LinuxKPI from the code, and to refactor everything. The agent did it in one go, and updated the decision document.</p><p>With specification, docs and a plan, the workflow process turned into a “boring routine”. The agent had SSH access to both the build host, and a testing VM, that had been running with the Wi-Fi PCI device passed from the host. It methodically crunched through the backlog of its own milestones, iterating over the code, building and testing the module. Every time a milestone or a portion was finished, I asked the agent to record the progress to the docs. Occasionally, an iteration of the code crashed or hanged the VM. When this happened, before fixing the problem, I asked — in a forked Pi’s session — to summarize, investigate and record the problem for agent’s future-self.</p><p>After many low-involved sessions, I got a working FreeBSD kernel module for the BCM4350 Wi-Fi chip. The module supports Wi-Fi network scanning, 2.4GHz/5GHz connectivity, WPA/WPA2 authentication.</p><p>The source code is in repository <a href=\"https://github.com/narqo/freebsd-brcmfmac\">github.com/narqo/freebsd-brcmfmac</a>. I didn’t write any piece of code there. There are several known issues, which I will task the agent to resolve, eventually. Meanwhile, I advise against using it for anything beyond a studying exercise.</p><p>Hacker News spawned an <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47129361\">existential discussion</a> following this note, where comments are clustering around several points:</p><ol><li>Is the driver’s code licensed accurately?</li></ol><p>Really, this isn’t the battle I choose to participate in. If there is an explanation for how to properly license this type of code artefact, I can follow through.</p><p>The agent didn’t put any license for me, by default. Choosing a license was yet another decision, that is <a href=\"https://github.com/narqo/freebsd-brcmfmac/blob/be9b49c1bf9425966cedd97bf7952f6d9b6ed988/docs/01-decisions.md#license\">documented</a> for the agent to follow, in the future iterations. Today, the code in freebsd-brcmfmac uses ISC license, because this is what the original code of brcmfmac Linux driver uses (e.g. see <a href=\"https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/7dff99b354601dd01829e1511711846e04340a69/drivers/net/wireless/broadcom/brcm80211/brcmfmac/common.c\">torvalds/linux/../brcmfmac/common.c</a>).</p><ol start=\"2\"><li>Is there a value here when the driver “isn’t done” yet?</li></ol><p>In software engineering, there aren’t many things that are “done”. We produce code. Others find bugs, security vulnerabilities, corner cases, and so on. We iterate. AI coding hasn’t changed these fundamentals — not by 2026, at least. Agents speeded up the part of producing code, just like other toolings have been speeding up the process of collaborating, finding bugs, etc.</p><p>Is there “value” in the driver today? Probably not. Is there “value” in my outdated and broken MacBook? Not much. Was it insightful for me to walk the journey from “claude can’t just take the code and port it” to “agent needs to plan, record, iterate in order to progress” (<em>and doing that didn’t mean that I had to write a ton of markdown essays myself</em>)? Yes.</p>",

      "content": "<p>The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD) <a href=\"https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/modern-monitoring-civil-liberties-advocates-raise-concerns-about-metro-license-plate-cameras-3228273/\">quietly entered an agreement</a> in 2023 with Flock Security, an automated license plate reader company that uses cameras to collect vehicle information and cross-reference it with police databases.&nbsp;</p><p>But unlike many of the other police departments around the country that use the cameras in their police work, Metro funds the project with donor money funneled into a private foundation. It’s an arrangement that allows Metro to avoid soliciting public comment on the surveillance technology, which critics worry could be co-opted to track undocumented immigrants, political dissidents and abortion seekers, among others.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s a short circuit of the democratic process,” Jay Stanley, a Washington D.C.-based lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) who works on how technology can infringe on individual privacy and civil liberties, said in an interview with .</p><p>Although taxpayer dollars fund Flock cameras in other jurisdictions, most of the cameras in the Las Vegas area have been bought with money from the <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/357050910\">Horowitz Family Foundation</a>, a philanthropy group connected to the Las Vegas-based venture capitalist Ben Horowitz, co-founder of the firm <a href=\"https://a16z.com/\">Andreessen Horowitz</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The Horowitz Family Foundation did not respond to a request for comment at the time of publication.&nbsp;</p><p>Metro told that it operates approximately 200 Flock license plate reader cameras on city or county infrastructure and it shares its Flock data with hundreds of state and local law enforcement agencies throughout the country.</p><p>Since late 2023, Las Vegas police have made more than 23,000 searches of vehicles, according to the website <a href=\"https://haveibeenflocked.com/pd/3988-las-vegas-metro-nv-pd/audit?sort=date_desc\">Have I Been Flocked</a>, which compiles public audit logs of Flock data.&nbsp;</p><p>As the cameras were not bought with public funds, Metro does not have to hold meetings with the public to comment on the technology, something experts say leaves citizens without any input on the policing method.&nbsp;</p><p>In other cities, Stanley said Flock is often brought up and discussed during city council meetings or other public forums. It’s not required to be on public meeting agendas in the Las Vegas area.</p><p>“Police departments serve the community and are supposed to make life in the community better. Does the community want this technology imposed on it?” Stanley said.&nbsp;</p><p>Though Horowitz’s foundation donated additional funds for Flock cameras in October, it was not brought up at the Clark County Commission meeting that month, nor was their use discussed anytime in 2025, according to commission meeting minutes.&nbsp;</p><p>Some municipalities in Clark County, such as the City of Las Vegas, have license plate reader policies that includes <a href=\"https://transparency.flocksafety.com/city-of-las-vegas-nv-department-of-public-safety\">a public Flock policy</a> with a dashboard on how many license plates Flock picked up (about 185,000 in the past month in the city), how many cameras were in use (22 in Las Vegas), and how many searches had been done on a monthly basis (five in the past 30 days). In comparison, Metro’s policy is not publicly available online, though  obtained a copy through a public records request.&nbsp;</p><p>Flock’s most recent contract with Metro, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/27346023-mou-w-flock-safety-3-3/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/27346023-mou-w-flock-safety-3-3/\">signed in 2023</a>, stipulates that the company retains all rights in any recordings or data provided by the service and that Flock can use any of the data for “any purpose” at the company’s discretion. The agreement also says that Flock recordings are not stored for longer than 30 days.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/27346024-6560-automated-license-plate-reader-alpr-3-1/\">Metro policy says</a> that department members will not seek or retain license plate reader information about individuals or an organization based solely on their citizenship, social views, race or other classifications protected by law. The policy states that retained license plate reader data does not include specific identification of individuals. Misuse of the data will result in disciplinary action up to termination, according to the policy.&nbsp;</p><p>But for many, including a former officer who spoke to  on the condition of anonymity for fear of professional repercussions, such policies are not enough.&nbsp;</p><p>The former Metro officer said his major concern was not the technology itself, but the fact that there was little transparency on how the technology was being used or what the department’s policy was on Flock usage.&nbsp;</p><p>“If you look around the country where license plate readers are being used, there’s some kind of public meeting, there’s some kind of public process,” the officer said. “What’s happening here is on a very large scale — they’re putting out surveillance technology — and there’s no public disclosure.”&nbsp;</p><p>The Horowitz Foundation donation in October included a software subscription to Flock’s Nova feature, which allows officers to easily access private license plate information alongside <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2025/09/03/ai-startup-flock-thinks-it-can-eliminate-all-crime-in-america/\">other personal data</a>, such as Social Security numbers, credit scores, property and occupancy information, as well as <a href=\"https://www.flocksafety.com/products/flock-nova\">emails or social media handles</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Athar Haseebullah, the executive director of the ACLU of Nevada, said that Flock not only poses a heightened risk for immigrants, but anyone engaged in actions that are found to be politically defiant. He pointed to a case in Texas where police <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/police-said-they-surveilled-woman-who-had-an-abortion-for-her-safety-court-records-show-they-considered-charging-her-with-a-crime/\">conducted a nationwide search</a> using Flock technology for a woman who self-induced an abortion.&nbsp;</p><p>“This could be ripe for abuse by ICE (Immigrations and Customs Enforcement), but it could also be ripe for abuse by other government entities,” Haseebullah said. In 2025, the ACLU pushed back against <a href=\"https://www.leg.state.nv.us/App/NELIS/REL/83rd2025/Bill/12749/Overview\">a measure</a> that would allow local jurisdictions to use automated traffic cameras to crack down on speeding and red-light crossings, although the bill was never voted on.&nbsp;</p><p>However, though Flock might not want to partner with ICE, it has little choice — Flock is obligated to fulfill subpoenas from ICE and can’t refuse a legal warrant, Andrew Ferguson, an attorney and a professor researching tech and police surveillance at <a href=\"https://www.law.gwu.edu/andrew-guthrie-ferguson\">George Washington University</a>, said.&nbsp;</p><p>Flock’s surveillance cameras are meant to catch crime, though experts say it could deter certain behaviors if citizens are aware they are being watched.&nbsp;</p><p>“There’s a chilling effect knowing that your government is essentially tracking you wherever you go,” Ferguson said. “It might be even more chilling if you put cameras in sensitive places, like a medical clinic, or a Gambler’s Anonymous meeting, or a church.”&nbsp;</p><p>In a city such as Las Vegas, known for drinking, gambling and a hearty party culture, surveillance is the last thing people are interested in, according to Ferguson.&nbsp;</p><p>“Things are happening in Vegas that are not going to stay in Vegas,” Ferguson said. “They’re going to be broadcast through Flock.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Public private partnerships&nbsp;</strong></p><p>As recently as October of last year, the Horowitz Family Foundation donated almost $1.9 million for Flock license plate readers and another $2.47 million for supporting software for Flock machines, according to the minutes of an <a href=\"https://www.lvmpd.com/home/showpublisheddocument/7789/639046588630570000\">LVMPD fiscal affairs committee meeting</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Because the donations aren’t coming directly to Metro, but to the nonprofit LVMPD foundation, also known as “Friends of Metro,” any discussions on the cameras’ use aren’t subject to Nevada's <a href=\"https://www.leg.state.nv.us/nrs/NRS-241.html#NRS241Sec015\">open meeting laws</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The license plate readers and their supporting software are not the only gift that the Horowitz Family Foundation, led by Ben Horowitz’s wife, Felicia Horowitz, has donated to Las Vegas police. The foundation has also gifted drones, as well as Tesla Cybertrucks, to the agency.</p><p>Proponents have billed the gifts as morale boosters for police that help the agency stay on the cutting edge without tapping into limited taxpayer dollars. Critics, such as the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Southern Nevada, <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-11-03/nations-largest-fleet-of-police-cybertrucks-to-patrol-las-vegas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">have suggested</a> that the Cybertrucks show that Metro is “prioritizing corporate giveaways.”</p><p>Felicia Horowitz said she is focused on “creating the best community in America” in Las Vegas, according to <a href=\"https://keepmemoryalive.org/about-us/board-leadership/felicia-horowitz/\">her bio from a local nonprofit organization</a> that she sits on the board of. Part of that is combating crime and keeping citizens safe. In a  article, Felicia Horowitz emphasized how crime and weak policing had hurt Black communities across the country.&nbsp;</p><p>“The new policies — defund the police, don’t prosecute crime — are destroying the communities where I grew up,” Felicia Horowitz, who is Black, told the  in 2024. Felicia Horowitz was raised in Los Angeles and the Horowitzes relocated to Las Vegas around 2021 and 2022 after decades in California.&nbsp;</p><p>So far, the foundation has not publicly commented on whether it will continue donating money for Flock services. Some experts think the donations might be a strategy called “<a href=\"https://www.salesforce.com/blog/penetration-pricing/\">penetration pricing</a>,” where a company gives free or reduced products or services in order to hook consumers before charging them.&nbsp;</p><p>“There’s no question that there’s a financial interest in them proving that the Flock technology works in Las Vegas so that they can sell it to other places,” said Ferguson.</p><p>The former police officer said he was concerned about taxpayers having to cough up funds to continue Flock services if the Horowitz money ran dry.&nbsp;</p><p>“Once you start relying on a certain type of policing, it’s going to be hard to switch over, and then who will foot the bill?” the officer said.</p>",

      "content": "<p><strong>The car wash test is the simplest AI reasoning benchmark that nearly every model fails, including Claude Sonnet 4.5, GPT-5.1, Llama, and Mistral.</strong></p><p>The question is simple: <em>\"I want to wash my car. The car wash is 50 meters away. Should I walk or drive?\"</em></p><p>Obviously, you need to drive. The car needs to be at the car wash.</p><p>The question has been making the rounds online as a simple logic test, the kind any human gets instantly, but most AI models don't. We decided to run it properly: 53 models through <a href=\"https://opper.ai/llm-gateway\">Opper's LLM gateway</a>, no system prompt, forced choice between \"drive\" or \"walk\" with a reasoning field. First once per model, then 10 times each to test consistency.</p><h2>Part 1: The Single-Run Test — 42 Out of 53 AI Models Said \"Walk\"</h2><p>On a single call, only 11 out of 53 models got it right. 42 said walk.</p><p><strong>The models that passed the car wash test:</strong></p><ul></ul><p>Across entire model families, only one model per provider got it right: Opus 4.6 for Anthropic, GPT-5 for OpenAI. All Llama and Mistral models failed.</p><p>The wrong answers were all the same: <em>\"50 meters is a short distance, walking is more efficient, saves fuel, better for the environment.\"</em> Correct reasoning about the wrong problem. The models fixate on the distance and completely miss that the car itself needs to get to the car wash.</p><p>The funniest part: Perplexity's Sonar and Sonar Pro got the right answer for completely wrong reasons. They cited EPA studies and argued that walking burns calories which requires food production energy, making walking more polluting than driving 50 meters. Right answer, insane reasoning.</p><h3>Single-Run Results by Model Family</h3><table><tbody><tr></tr><tr><td>Gemini 3 models nailed it, all 2.x failed except Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite</td></tr><tr><td>Grok-4 yes, non-reasoning variant no</td></tr><tr><td>Right answer, wrong reasons</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Part 2: The 10-Run Consistency Test — Can AI Models Reason Reliably?</h2><p>Getting it right once is easy. But can they do it reliably? We reran every model 10 times, 530 API calls total.</p><p>The results got worse. Of the 11 models that passed the single-run test, only 5 could do it consistently.</p><h3>10/10 — The Only Reliable AI Models (5 Models)</h3><p><strong>Claude Opus 4.6, Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite, Gemini 3 Flash, Gemini 3 Pro, Grok-4</strong></p><p>These are the only models that answered correctly every single time across 10 runs.</p><h3>8/10 — Close, But Still Fails 20% of the Time (2 Models)</h3><p><strong>GLM-5, Grok-4-1 Reasoning</strong></p><p>Both get it right most of the time. But in production, an 80% success rate on basic reasoning means 1 in 5 API calls returns the wrong answer.</p><h3>7/10 — GPT-5 Fails 3 Out of 10 Times</h3><p>OpenAI's flagship model fails this 30% of the time. When it gets it right, the reasoning is concise: <em>\"You need the car at the car wash to wash it, so drive the short 50 meters.\"</em> When it gets it wrong, it writes about fuel efficiency.</p><h3>6/10 or Below — Coin Flip or Worse (12 Models)</h3><table><tbody><tr></tr></tbody></table><h3>0/10 — Never Got It Right (33 Models)</h3><p>All Claude models except Opus 4.6, all Llama, all Mistral, GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, GPT-5-mini, GPT-5-nano, GPT-5.1, GPT-5.2, Grok-3, Grok-4-1 non-reasoning, Sonar, Sonar Reasoning Pro, DeepSeek v3.1, Kimi K2 Instruct.</p><h2>What Changed Between One Run and Ten: The Fluke Problem</h2><p>Some models that looked correct on the first try turned out to be flukes.</p><p> went from correct to 0/10. It still writes the same 200-word essay about food production energy chains and EPA studies in every single run, it just flips the conclusion to \"walk\" every time now. Same reasoning, opposite answer.</p><p> went from correct to a perfect 5/5 tie. Literally cannot decide.</p><p> went from correct to 4/10. When it says \"drive,\" it's because of calorie-emission math, not because the car needs to be there.</p><p>And one model went the other direction:  went from wrong on the single run to 6/10. It was unlucky the first time. Still not reliable, but the capability is clearly in the weights.</p><h2>Part 3: The Human Baseline — 10,000 People, Same Question</h2><p>The most common pushback on the car wash test: \"Humans would fail this too.\"</p><p>Fair point. We didn't have data either way. So we partnered with <a href=\"https://www.rapidata.ai\">Rapidata</a> to find out. They ran the exact same question with the same forced choice between \"drive\" and \"walk,\" no additional context, past 10,000 real people through their human feedback platform.</p><p>Turns out GPT-5 (7/10) answered about as reliably as the average human (71.5%) in this test. Humans still outperform most AI models with this question, but to be fair I expected a far higher \"drive\" rate.</p><p>That 71.5% is still a higher success rate than 48 out of 53 models tested. Only the five 10/10 models and the two 8/10 models outperform the average human. Everything below GPT-5 performs worse than 10,000 people given two buttons and no time to think.</p><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasoncorkill\">Jason Corkill</a> and the Rapidata team for making this happen on short notice.</p><h2>Notable Reasoning Across 530 Runs</h2><p>530 runs produce a lot of reasoning text. Some highlights:</p><p> on one of its correct runs: <em>\"Walking would require physically pushing or carrying the car, which is impractical and impossible.\"</em> Probably the best articulation of the actual problem from any model.</p><p> wrote: <em>\"The only scenario where driving might make sense is if you need to drive the car into the car wash anyway for an automatic wash\"</em> and then picked walk. It saw the answer and rejected it.</p><p> suggested you should <em>\"walk to the car wash, then drive your car through the wash.\"</em> The car is at home.</p><p> when it gets it right: <em>\"You want to wash your car. The car needs to be at the car wash for this to happen. Therefore, you must drive it there, regardless of the short distance.\"</em> When it gets it wrong: <em>\"50 meters is a very short distance that would take less than a minute to walk.\"</em> Same model, same prompt.</p><h2>Why This Matters: The AI Reliability Problem in Production</h2><p>This is a trivial question. There's one correct answer and the reasoning to get there takes one step: the car needs to be at the car wash, so you drive.</p><p>Out of 53 models, only 5 can do this reliably. 15 more can sometimes get there but unpredictably. The remaining 33 never get it right.</p><p>The pattern across 530 API calls shows three tiers of failure:</p><p><strong>Models that never get it right (33/53):</strong> These models have learned \"short distance = walk\" as a heuristic and can't override it with contextual reasoning. The correct answer isn't accessible to them.</p><p><strong>Models that sometimes get it right (15/53):</strong> The capability exists but competes with the distance heuristic. On any given call, either path might win. This is the most dangerous category for production AI. The model passes during evaluation and then fails unpredictably in deployment. <a href=\"https://opper.ai/task-completion\">Picking the right model</a> isn't enough on its own.</p><p><strong>Models that always get it right (5/53):</strong> The contextual reasoning consistently overrides the heuristic.</p><p>This is a toy problem with one logical step. Real-world AI applications involve chains of reasoning far more complex than this. If 90% of models can't reliably handle \"the car needs to be at the car wash,\" how do they handle actual business logic, multi-step workflows, or ambiguous edge cases in production?</p><h2>What Context Engineering Can Do About This</h2><p>The car wash test is a zero-context problem by design. No system prompt, no examples, just a raw question. That's what makes it useful as a benchmark. But the failure mode is telling: models don't fail because they lack the capability. They fail because the heuristic (\"short distance = walk\") wins over the reasoning (\"the car needs to be there\").</p><p><a href=\"https://opper.ai/context-engineering\">Context engineering</a> is one way to shift that balance. When you provide a model with structured examples, domain patterns, and relevant context at inference time, you give it information that can help override generic heuristics with task-specific reasoning.</p><p>We've seen this in practice. In a <a href=\"https://opper.ai/blog/reducing-costs-with-opper-context\">separate experiment</a>, we took a small open-weight model that failed an agent-building task and added curated examples through Opper's context features. It matched the output quality of a frontier model at 98.6% lower cost, without changing the model itself.</p><p>The car wash problem is simple enough that the top 5 models solve it without help. But most production tasks aren't that clean. They involve ambiguity, domain knowledge, and constraints that aren't obvious from the prompt alone. For those, the gap between \"sometimes gets it right\" and \"always gets it right\" is often a context problem.</p><p>All 53 models were tested through  using the same prompt: <em>\"I want to wash my car. The car wash is 50 meters away. Should I walk or drive?\"</em> No system prompt. Forced choice between \"drive\" and \"walk\" with a reasoning field. The single-run test was one call per model. The 10-run retest was 10 identical calls per model (530 total), no cache / memory. Every call was <strong>traced and logged through Opper</strong>, so we could inspect each model's reasoning.</p><p>The human baseline was collected through <a href=\"https://www.rapidata.ai\">Rapidata</a>, using the same question and forced choice format across 10,000 participants.</p><p>Full data from every run is available for download:</p>",

      "content": "<p>The biggest challenge in adopting agentic engineering practices is getting comfortable with the consequences of the fact that <em>writing code is cheap now</em>.</p><p>Code has always been expensive. Producing a few hundred lines of clean, tested code takes most software developers a full day or more. Many of our engineering habits, at both the macro and micro level, are built around this core constraint.</p><p>At the macro level we spend a great deal of time designing, estimating and planning out projects, to ensure that our expensive coding time is spent as efficiently as possible. Product feature ideas are evaluated in terms of how much value they can provide <em>in exchange for that time</em> - a feature needs to earn its development costs many times over to be worthwhile!</p><p>At the micro level we make hundreds of decisions a day predicated on available time and anticipated tradeoffs. Should I refactor that function to be slightly more elegant if it adds an extra hour of coding time? How about writing documentation? Is it worth adding a test for this edge case? Can I justify building a debug interface for this?</p><p>Coding agents dramatically drop the cost of typing code into the computer, which disrupts  of our existing personal and organizational intuitions about which trade-offs make sense.</p><p>The ability to run parallel agents makes this even harder to evaluate, since one human engineer can now be implementing, refactoring, testing and documenting code in multiple places at the same time.</p><h2>Good code still has a cost</h2><p>Delivering new code has dropped in price to almost free... but delivering  code remains significantly more expensive than that.</p><p>Here's what I mean by \"good code\":</p><ul><li>The code works. It does what it's meant to do, without bugs.</li><li>We . We've taken steps to confirm to ourselves and to others that the code is fit for purpose.</li><li>It solves the right problem.</li><li>It handles error cases gracefully and predictably: it doesn't just consider the happy path. Errors should provide enough information to help future maintainers understand what went wrong.</li><li>It’s simple and minimal - it does only what’s needed, in a way that both humans and machines can understand now and maintain in the future.</li><li>It's protected by tests. The tests show that it works now and act as a regression suite to avoid it quietly breaking in the future.</li><li>It's documented at an appropriate level, and that documentation reflects the current state of the system - if the code changes an existing behavior the existing documentation needs to be updated to match.</li><li>The design affords future changes. It's important to maintain <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it\">YAGNI</a> - code with added complexity to anticipate future changes that may never come is often bad code - but it's also important not to write code that makes future changes much harder than they should be.</li><li>All of the other relevant \"ilities\" - accessibility, testability, reliability, security, maintainability, observability, scalability, usability - the non-functional quality measures that are appropriate for the particular class of software being developed.</li></ul><p>Coding agent tools can help with most of this, but there is still a substantial burden on the developer driving those tools to ensure that the produced code is good code for the subset of good that's needed for the current project.</p><h2>We need to build new habits</h2><p>The challenge is to develop new personal and organizational habits that respond to the affordances and opportunities of agentic engineering. </p><p>These best practices are still being figured out across our industry. I'm still figuring them out myself.</p><p>For now I think the best we can do is to second guess ourselves: any time our instinct says \"don't build that, it's not worth the time\" fire off a prompt anyway, in an asynchronous agent session where the worst that can happen is you check ten minutes later and find that it wasn't worth the tokens.</p>",

Traditional dictionaries skip almost all such phrases, because they contain spaces. Merriam-Webster and Oxford cover about 3%.\n            </p><p>\n                I got interested in this because I make word games—and wanted to understand which phrases carry enough  to count as vocabulary, and why dictionaries trained us to think they don’t.\n            </p><p>\n                Here’s a slider. Look at expressions at different familiarity levels. Gold words are missing from traditional dictionaries:\n            </p><p>\n                What I’m interested in are the phrases that carry more weight than their parts—the ones that are . The obscure end of this slider is definitely —LLM artifacts, jargon fragments, Wiktionary debris. “I love you” isn’t opaque, but it’s tight enough to put on a tile. Where you draw the line is up to you.\n            </p><p>\n                Crowd-sourced Wiktionary has 16 times more headwords than Merriam-Webster’s already hefty tabletop book. Yet even Wiktionary leaves gaps.\n            </p><p>\n                When dictionaries were planned and created, lexicographers focused on the building blocks of language—and overwhelmingly preferred individual words. Even the technical term is clinical: “multi-word expressions” (MWEs)—as if they’re a deviation from the norm. </p><div><div>Coverage drops as you go deeper</div></div><p>Merriam-Webster (green) covers just  of the top 10,000 MWEs, dropping to  by 100K. Adding Wiktionary (yellow) brings coverage to 75%, but even that drops to .</p><p>\n                A few selected, non-obvious expressions (called “opaque compounds”) would be included if they seemed interesting enough. And dictionary pages were not wasted on self-evident combinations. But what was lost?\n            </p><ul><li><strong>Obvious meaning—often missing from dictionaries:</strong> hospital bills, smooth skin, angry person, exit door</li><li><strong>Unpredictable meaning—usually in dictionaries:</strong> fat chance, melting pot, guilt trip, cold feet</li></ul><p>\n                Language is a vast combinatorial space. English has roughly 325K nouns, 60K verbs, and 85K adjectives. Multiply across grammatical patterns and you get about  possible two-word combinations.\n            </p><p>\n                Most are nonsense—“purple Wednesday,” “angry furniture.” But roughly 15% are plausible: “wooden chair,” “morning coffee.” That’s still 30 billion sensible pairs.\n            </p><p>\n                What interests me is that within those billions, some combinations have  into something more—expressions that carry conceptual weight beyond their parts. “Hot dog” isn’t just a warm canine. “Red tape” isn’t about colored adhesive.</p><p>I asked Claude to brainstorm candidates (explained below). It returned 774K MWEs. These are some of the types, and how often they appeared in Merriam-Webster (19,641 of 89,128 headwords), Oxford American (15,488 of 72,495 headwords), and Wiktionary (232,454 of 1.44 million English entries). In each graph below, the left side is more familiar, the right more obscure:\n            </p><p>\n                Print dictionaries barely cover these expressions: Merriam-Webster has just , Oxford has . Even combined, they cover only . Wiktionary does better at .\n            </p><p><strong>Estimating the 250B &gt; 30B funnel:</strong> These numbers above the table are illustrative—no absolute counts exist. From 500K single-word terms, we sampled and classified parts of speech, including inflected forms and rare terms: ~325K nouns, 60K verbs, 85K adjectives (roughly twice WordNet’s counts). We multiplied across grammatical patterns. To estimate how many “make sense,” we randomly paired words: noun+noun 12% sensible, adjective+noun 64%, verb+noun 40%. The 30 billion is a weighted estimate.\n            </p><p>\n                The opaque compounds and phrasal verbs get the best coverage in Wiktionary. The named entities (proper nouns) are mostly encyclopedic topics—so they’re in Wikipedia. The technical terms drift into jargon as they get more obscure, but jargon isn’t useful for word games because too few players know it.\n            </p><p>\n                But see all the gold at the top of those little graphs for “transparent” and “semi-opaque”? That’s a deep reservoir of real MWEs—and we’ve been conditioned by dictionaries not to expect it. The old guard dictionaries, colored above in dark blue and dark green, overwhelmingly ignore them.\n            </p><p>\n                Here are examples of are cousins of other words that  get lexicalized.\n            </p><p>\n                But even among the transparent—some are more  than others. “Yellow pear” is just describing. “Boiling water” names a thing—what linguists call the —a hazard, a cooking stage, . The difference? One could have been a word.\n            </p><p>\n                Should English have created a word for severe pain, other than the more emotionally tinged “agony” or “anguish”? I don’t know. But “severe pain” is tight enough to be a useful token in a word game. It names a thing.\n            </p><p>\n                This analysis is about timeless words, not trivia. So I excluded 133K named entities—proper nouns like “New York City,” “Albert Einstein,” and “World War II.” Named entities are well-covered by Wikipedia, as are 47% of “technical” MWEs (“Parkinson’s disease”).\n            </p><p>\n                Scrabble famously excludes proper nouns. Crossword puzzles embrace them. Choosing how many proper nouns to include in a word game is tangled with cultural assumptions. Easy trivia is pointless, and hard trivia is alienating. Should all U.S. presidents be fair game? What about K-pop stars? British monarchs? Nobel laureates? The “right” answer depends on your audience, and that’s a design question, not a linguistic one.\n            </p></section><section><p>\n                The opacity distinction isn’t the only interesting one. MWEs vary in origin and character too—some are technical, some metaphorical, some named after people, some freshly coined. Here’s how they break down:\n            </p></section><section><h2>The words that aren’t words</h2><p>\n                The line between “word” and “phrase” is fuzzier than dictionaries suggest. Words tend to carry more conceptual weight—but not always. Some words probably didn’t need to be coined; some phrases deserve more credit than they get. English is full of two- and three-word phrases that function as single semantic units—effectively “words”—but because they’re not fused into one orthographic word, they’re invisible to dictionaries and underappreciated as vocabulary. “Kindergarteners” is in the dictionary, but not “middle schoolers.” Newer professions—“car salesman,” “vacuum salesman,” “balloon seller”—are two words, but ancient professions might have a one-worder: jeweler, florist, fishmonger, tobacconist, stationer, mercer.\n            </p><p>\n                German and Norwegian don’t “remove the space”—their compounds never had one.  and  are single grammatical structures from the start, and adding spaces would change the meaning or break the grammar. Norwegian takes this so seriously it has a word for the error:  (separate-writing error). The space matters:  means “smokefree,” but  means “smoke freely.”  is a teacher of Norwegian;  is a Norwegian teacher. Not all compounds make it into the dictionary—there’s a near-unbounded set of possible ones, just as in English. But the ones that are loaded enough do. Norwegian even puts two-word compounds in the dictionary when they earn it— (black hole) has a space but gets an entry, because the meaning isn’t obvious from the parts. English has the opposite problem: the phrase-to-compound pipeline ( → ? not yet) is slow, arbitrary, and not necessarily tied to meaning.            </p><p>\n                Other languages sometimes have tidy one-worders for things English can only describe. Spanish carves up time with precision English lacks:  for the pre-dawn hours,  for late afternoon waning into evening. The mid-day nap was so compelling we adopted the  into English.\n            </p><p>\n                But, concise one-word equivalents appear only among the top 2k most familiar MWEs—and even then, rarely. It’s as if languages collectively decided these concepts weren’t worth crystallizing into single words.\n            </p><p>\n                Exceptions exist—Norwegian  for the euphoria of falling in love, Danish  for candlelit contentment, Portuguese  for longing. But these are famous precisely because they’re rare. Beyond the top tier of familiarity, the well runs dry everywhere. No language has a single word for “parking lot frustration” or “Sunday evening dread.” Generally, if English describes it with a phrase, so does everyone else.\n            </p></section><section><div><div><a href=\"https://www.sketchengine.eu\">Sketch Engine</a> — a workhorse of modern lexicography.

The probes work because Claude only produces a phrase as a category member if it thinks of it as a unit. Ask for marquee terms and you get “now playing.” Ask for cooking hazards and you get “boiling water.”\n            </p></section><section><p>\n                When an English speaker says “Saturday night,” they’re not computing “the night portion of the day called Saturday.” They’re invoking a concept—end of the work week, social time, a feeling. The phrase  the word for that concept.\n            </p><p>\n                For word games, this is a reorientation. There’s a vast space of MWEs that could be playable—sitting alongside single words. Letter counts still matter, so long MWEs don’t have much role in gameplay (unless it’s Wheel of Fortune)—but “paper towel” fits anywhere “discombobulate” does. The constraint was never length. It was our dictionary-shaped sense of what counts.\n            </p><p>\n                It made me think about words differently. Not where the next space shows up—but whether something is .\n            </p></section>",

      "content": "<p>Righty-ho, I’m back from Rust Nation, and busily horrifying my teenage daughter with my (admittedly atrocious) attempts at doing an English accent. It was a great trip with a lot of good conversations and some interesting observations. I am going to try to blog about some of them, starting with some thoughts spurred by Jon Seager’s closing keynote, “Rust Adoption At Scale with Ubuntu”.</p><h2>There are many chasms out there</h2><p>The answer, of course, is <em>it depends on who you ask</em>. Within Amazon, where I have the closest view, the answer is that we are “most of the way across”: Rust is squarely established as the right way to build at-scale data planes or resource-aware agents and it is increasingly seen as the right choice for low-level code in devices and robotics as well – but there remains a lingering perception that Rust is useful for “those fancy pants developers at S3” (or wherever) but a bit overkill for more average development.</p><p>On the other hand, within the realm of Safety Critical Software, as Pete LeVasseur wrote in a <a href=\"https://blog.rust-lang.org/2026/01/14/what-does-it-take-to-ship-rust-in-safety-critical/\">recent rust-lang blog post</a>, Rust is still scrabbling for a foothold. There are a number of successful products but most of the industry is in a “wait and see” mode, letting the early adopters pave the path.</p><h2>“Crossing the chasm” means finding “reference customers”</h2><p>The big idea that I at least took away from reading <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossing_the_Chasm\">Crossing the Chasm</a> and other references on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_adoption_life_cycle\">technology adoption life cycle</a> is the need for “reference customers”. When you first start out with something new, you are looking for pioneers and early adopters that are drawn to new things:</p><blockquote><p>What an early adopter is buying [..] is some kind of . By being the first to implement this change in the industry, the early adopters expect to get a jump on the competition. – from </p></blockquote><p>But as your technology matures, you have to convince people with a lower and lower tolerance for risk:</p><blockquote><p>The early majority want to buy a  for existing operations. They are looking to minimize discontinuity with the old ways. They want evolution, not revolution. – from </p></blockquote><p>So what is  to people to try something new? The answer is seeing that others like them have succeeded.</p><p>You can see this at play in both the Amazon example and the Safety Critical Software example. Clearly seeing Rust used for network services doesn’t mean it’s ready to be used in your car’s steering column. And even within network services, seeing a group like S3 succeed with Rust may convince other groups building at-scale services to try Rust, but doesn’t necessarily persuade a team to use Rust for their next CRUD service. And frankly, it shouldn’t! They are likely to hit obstacles.</p><h2>Ubuntu is helping Rust “cross the (user-land linux) chasm”</h2><p>All of this was on my mind as I watched the keynote by Jon Seager, the VP of Engineering at Canonical, which is the company behind Ubuntu. Similar to Lars Bergstrom’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrrH2lcl9ew\">epic keynote from year’s past</a> on Rust adoption within Google, Jon laid out a pitch for why Canonical is adopting Rust that was at once  and yet .</p><p>“Visionary and yet deeply practical” is pretty much the textbook description of what we need to cross from  to . We need folks who care first and foremost about delivering the right results, but are open to new ideas that might help them do that better; folks who can stand on both sides of the chasm at once.</p><p>Jon described how Canonical focuses their own development on a small set of languages: Python, C/C++, and Go, and how they had recently brought in Rust and were using it as the language of choice for new <a href=\"https://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2025/03/10/rust-2025-intro/\">foundational efforts</a>, replacing C, C++, and (some uses of) Python.</p><h2>Ubuntu is building the bridge across the chasm</h2><p>Jon talked about how he sees it as part of Ubuntu’s job to “pay it forward” by supporting the construction of memory-safe foundational utilities. Jon meant support both in terms of finances – Canonical is sponsoring the <a href=\"https://trifectatech.org/\">Trifecta Tech Foundation’s</a> to develop <a href=\"https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/sudo-rs\">sudo-rs</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/pendulum-project/ntpd-rs\">ntpd-rs</a> and sponsoring the <a href=\"https://github.com/uutils/\">uutils org’s</a> work on <a href=\"https://uutils.github.io/coreutils/\">coreutils</a> – and in terms of reputation. Ubuntu can take on the risk of doing something new, prove that it works, and then let others benefit.</p><p>Remember how the Crossing the Chasm book described early majority people? They are “looking to minimize discontinuity with the old ways”. And what better way to do that than to have drop-in utilities that fit within their existing workflows.</p><h2>The challenge for Rust: listening to these new adopters</h2><p>With new adoption comes new perspectives. On Thursday night I was at dinner organized by Ernest Kissiedu. Jon Seager was there along with some other Rust adopters from various industries, as were a few others from the Rust Foundation and the open-source project.</p><p>Ernest asked them to give us their unvarnished takes on Rust. Jon made the provocative comment that we needed to revisit our policy around having a small standard library. He’s not the first to say something like that, it’s something we’ve been hearing for years and years – and I think he’s right! Though I don’t think the answer is just to ship a big standard library. In fact, it’s kind of a perfect lead-in to (what I hope will be) my next blog post, which is about a project I call “battery packs”.</p><h2>To grow, you have to change</h2><p>The broader point though is that shifting from targeting “pioneers” and “early adopters” to targeting “early majority” sometimes involves some uncomfortable changes:</p><blockquote><p>Transition between any two adoption segments is normally excruciatingly awkward because you must adopt new strategies just at the time you have become most comfortable with the old ones. [..] The situation can be further complicated if the high-tech company, fresh from its marketing success with visionaries, neglects to change its sales pitch. [..] <strong>The company may be saying “state-of-the-art” when the pragmatist wants to hear “industry standard”.</strong> – Crossing the Chasm (emphasis mine)</p></blockquote><p>Not everybody will remember it, but in 2016 there was a proposal called <a href=\"https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/proposal-the-rust-platform/3745\">the Rust Platform</a>. The idea was to bring in some crates and bless them as a kind of “extended standard library”. People  it. After all, they said, why not just add dependencies to your ? It’s easy enough. And to be honest, they were right – at least at the time.</p><p>I think the Rust Platform is a good example of something that was a poor fit for early adopters, who want the newest thing and don’t mind finding the best crates, but which could be a  fit for the Early Majority.</p><p>Anyway, I’m not here to argue for one thing or another in this post, but more for the concept that we have to be open to adapting our learned wisdom to new circumstances. In the past, we were trying to bootstrap Rust into the industry’s consciousness – and we have succeeded.</p><p>The task before us now is different: <strong>we need to make Rust the best option not just in terms of “what it ” but in terms of “what it ”</strong> – and sometimes those are in tension.</p><h2>Another challenge for Rust: turning adoption into investment</h2><p>Later in the dinner, the talk turned, as it often does, to money. Growing Rust adoption also comes with growing needs placed on the Rust project and its ecosystem. How can we connect the dots? This has been a big item on my mind, and I realize in writing this paragraph how many blog posts I have yet to write on the topic, but let me lay out a few interesting points that came up over this dinner and at other recent points.</p><h2>Investment can mean contribution, particularly for open-source orgs</h2><p>First, there are more ways to offer support than $$. For Canonical specifically, as they are an open-source organization through-and-through, what I would most want is to build stronger relationships between our organizations. With the Rust for Linux developers, early on Rust maintainers were prioritizing and fixing bugs on behalf of RfL devs, but more and more, RfL devs are fixing things themselves, with Rust maintainers serving as mentors. This is awesome!</p><p>Second, there’s an interesting trend about $$ that I’ve seen crop up in a few places. We often think of companies investing in the open-source dependencies that they rely upon. But there’s an entirely different source of funding, and one that might be even easier to tap, which is to look at companies that are  Rust but haven’t adopted it yet.</p><p>For those “would be” adopters, there are often  in the org who are trying to make the case for Rust adoption – these individuals are early adopters, people with a vision for how things could be, but they are trying to sell to their early majority company. And to do that, they often have a list of “table stakes” features that need to be supported; what’s more, they often have access to some budget to make these things happen.</p><p>This came up when I was talking to Alexandru Radovici, the Foundation’s Silver Member Directory, who said that many safety critical companies have money they’d like to spend to close various gaps in Rust, but they don’t know how to spend it. Jon’s investments in Trifecta Tech and the uutils org have the same character: he is looking to close the gaps that block Ubuntu from using Rust more.</p><p>Well, first of all, you should watch Jon’s talk. “Brilliant”, as the Brits have it.</p><p>But my other big thought is that this is a crucial time for Rust. We are clearly transitioning in a number of areas from visionaries and early adopters towards that pragmatic majority, and we need to be mindful that doing so may require us to change some of the way that we’ve always done things. I liked this paragraph from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossing_the_Chasm\">Crossing the Chasm</a>:</p><blockquote><p>To market successfully to pragmatists, one does not have to be one – just understand their values and work to serve them. To look more closely into these values, if the goal of visionaries is to take a quantum leap forward, the goal of pragmatists is to make a percentage improvement–incremental, measurable, predictable progress. [..] To market to pragmatists, you must be patient. You need to be conversant with the issues that dominate their particular business. You need to show up at the industry-specific conferences and trade shows they attend.</p></blockquote><p>Re-reading <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossing_the_Chasm\">Crossing the Chasm</a> as part of writing this blog post has really helped me square where Rust is – for the most part, I think we are still crossing the chasm, but we are well on our way. I think what we see is a consistent trend now where we have Rust  who fit the “visionary” profile of early adopters successfully advocating for Rust within companies that fit the pragmatist, early majority profile.</p><h3>Open source can be a great enabler to cross the chasm…</h3><p>It strikes me that open-source is just an amazing platform for doing this kind of marketing. Unlike a company, we don’t have to do everything ourselves. We have to leverage the fact that <em>open source helps those who help themselves</em> – find those visionary folks in industries that could really benefit from Rust, bring them into the Rust orbit, and then (most important!)  to adapt Rust to their needs.</p><h3>…but only if we don’t get too “middle school” about it</h3><p>This last part may sound obvious, but it’s harder than it sounds. When you’re embedded in open source, it seems like a friendly place where everyone is welcome. But the reality is that it can be a place full of cliques and “oral traditions” that “everybody knows”. People coming with an idea can get shutdown for using the wrong word. They can readily mistake the, um, “impassioned” comments from a random contributor (or perhaps just a troll…) for the official word from project leadership. It only takes one rude response to turn somebody away.</p><h3>What Rust needs most is empathy</h3><p>So what will ultimately help Rust the most to succeed? <a href=\"https://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2023/09/27/empathy-in-open-source/\">Empathy in Open Source</a>. Let’s get out there, find out where Rust can help people, and make it happen. Exciting times!</p>",

      "content": "<p><strong>We designed FDM-1, a foundation model for computer use.</strong> FDM-1 is trained on videos from a portion of our 11-million-hour screen recording dataset, which we labeled using an inverse dynamics model that we trained. Our video encoder can compress almost 2 hours of 30 FPS video in only 1M tokens. FDM-1 is the first model with the long-context training needed to become a coworker for CAD, finance, engineering, and eventually ML research, and it consistently improves with scale. It trains and infers directly on video instead of screenshots and can learn unsupervised from the entirety of the internet.</p><p>Before today, the recipe for building a computer use agent was to finetune a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision-language_model\">vision-language model (VLM)</a> on contractor-annotated screenshots of computer use, then build reinforcement learning environments to learn each specific downstream task. Agents trained this way are unable to act on more than a few seconds of context, process high-framerate video, do long-horizon tasks, or scale to competent agents.</p><p>Moreover, training these VLMs requires contractor-labeled annotations. These are expensive, so current computer action datasets are tiny: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15221\">the largest open dataset</a> is less than 20 hours of 30 FPS video. Meanwhile, millions of hours of film editing, coding livestreams, video game playthroughs, and more have accumulated on the internet over the past two decades. Building a general computer agent requires an internet-scale video corpus, just as building GPT-3 required an internet-scale text corpus. FDM-1 is the first model that can train at this scale.</p><p><em>Here are some demos of our model doing CAD, driving a car, and fuzzing a website!</em></p><div><figure data-fig-number=\"1\"><figcaption>: \nFDM-1 extrudes faces on an n-gon to make a gear in Blender.

We forked openpilot’s “joystick mode” to control the vehicle and built a website for remote steering via arrow keys. The website displays live video feeds alongside steering angle, brake, and acceleration data. The model executes turns and corrects back to straight-line steering around the block. Fine-tuning FDM-1 substantially outperforms initializing from scratch on our self-driving task.</div></div></div></figcaption></figure><figure data-fig-number=\"3\"><figcaption>: \nFDM-1 is uniquely good at fuzzing.

Fuzzing cannot be done with random walks or key presses because they do not sufficiently emulate the actions a human would take.</p><p>We demonstrate this in a toy environment where we use our forking VM infrastructure to explore as many unique states as possible in a banking app, forking when a meaningfully new state has been explored. The model finds a bug where the “Submit Wire Transfer” button is clickable right after a wire transfer has already been completed, which allows the account’s balance to go negative.</p></div></div></div></figcaption></figure></div><p>To train on all this video, you need to label it with actions like key presses and mouse movements. Prior literature has explored automatically labeling data: in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01954\">Behavior Cloning from Observation</a>, the researchers taught an “inverse dynamics model” (IDM) to label what action was taken between before states and after states in various simulated environments. IDM-labeling is possible for computer use datasets because mouse movement and typing actions are often easily inferable from the screen: if a “K” shows up, you can be reasonably confident the “K” key was pressed. \n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11795\">OpenAI’s Video PreTraining (VPT) paper</a> was the first to apply this method at scale, bootstrapping a Minecraft-specific IDM on a small amount of contractor data to create a competent Minecraft agent with six seconds of context.\n\n\n\n</p><p>VPT’s architecture was able to learn complex behaviors, something still inaccessible to VLM-based approaches. Unlike VPT, however, complex design, finance, and general computer use require not just six seconds, but minutes to hours of context.</p><p>The missing piece is a video encoder. VLMs burn a million tokens to understand just one minute of 30 FPS computer data. Our video encoder encodes nearly 2 hours of video in the same number of tokens—that’s 50x more token-efficient than the previous state-of-the-art and 100x more token-efficient than OpenAI’s encoder. <strong>These improvements in context length and dataset size mean we can finally pretrain on enough video to scale computer action models.</strong></p><p>Our training recipe consists of three stages (see <a href=\"https://si.inc/posts/fdm1/#fig-recipe\" data-fig=\"recipe\">Figure </a>). First, we train an IDM on 40,000 hours of contractor-labeled screen recordings. Second, we use the IDM to label our 11-million-hour video corpus. Finally, we use the IDM-labeled videos to autoregressively train a “forward dynamics model” (FDM) on next action prediction. The FDM’s output token space consists of key presses and mouse movement deltas, expressive enough to model any action taken on a computer.</p><p>Videos of the real world and bodies of text both have relatively uniform information densities throughout, and both can be compressed into a latent representation without losing much semantic content. \n\n\n\n Screen recordings are different because information density can vary rapidly. There is a massive information difference between moving a cursor across a blank screen and scrolling through pages of dense text. Existing approaches with fixed-size embedding spaces inevitably trade off between semantic detail and compression ratio.</p><p>We created a model without this tradeoff by training our video encoder on a masked compression objective.\n\n\n\n This unsupervised training enables our encoder to produce information-dense features at a high compression rate. Because our training is unsupervised, we use tasks like inverse dynamics, action prediction, frame reconstruction, and random text transcription to measure the abilities of our encoder.</p><p>Comparing our video encoder to a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_transformer\">ViT</a>, we observe ~100x faster convergence during training (<a href=\"https://si.inc/posts/fdm1/#fig-transcription\" data-fig=\"transcription\">Figure </a>).</p><p>Our encoder achieves a state-of-the-art compression ratio of video frames to tokens, as shown in <a href=\"https://si.inc/posts/fdm1/#fig-context-table\" data-fig=\"context-table\">Figure </a>. Our video context unlocks long-horizon workflows such as CAD, while still maintaining the ability to read text with high fidelity.</p><figure data-fig-number=\"7\"><div><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table></div><figcaption>: \nHow much video we can fit in certain context windows. \n\n\n\n</figcaption></figure><p>In order to train on orders of magnitude more labeled data than contractors can provide, we need to automatically label our internet-scale dataset with predicted computer actions—mouse movements, key presses, etcetera. We created an IDM to predict high-quality labels, letting us achieve similar efficiency when training on arbitrary videos as when training on human-gathered ground-truth data.</p><p>Labeling video is fundamentally non-causal—you can’t label a Cmd+C until you see the resulting pasted sequence.\n\n\n\n To train a non-causal, generative model, we adopted a masked diffusion architecture.\n\n\n\n</p><p>Our <a href=\"https://s-sahoo.com/mdlm\">masked diffusion</a> method predicts actions conditioned on all frames simultaneously with masked action tokens. During inference, we feed frames interleaved with mask tokens and have the model predict log probabilities for each masked position. We then select the top-k highest-confidence predictions, unmask those tokens, and repeat until the full sequence is labeled.</p><p>This way, we can engineer the model to spend baseline effort on high probability actions (by labeling them first) and more effort on ambiguous ones, leading to more accurate labels. This non-causal approach was also more data efficient, overfitting significantly more slowly than causal models. In later sections we show that our IDM achieves near parity with ground-truth contractor data.</p><p>The FDM predicts the next action given the prior frames and actions (<a href=\"https://si.inc/posts/fdm1/#fig-forward-dynamics\" data-fig=\"forward-dynamics\">Figure </a>).\n\n\n\n Unlike VLM-based approaches, our FDM operates directly on video and action tokens—no chain-of-thought reasoning, byte-pair encoding, or tool use.\n\n\n\n This keeps inference low-latency and allows modeling a multitude of tasks that current designs cannot capture—e.g. scrolling, 3D modelling, gameplay. We trained FDM-1 with no language model transfer.</p><p>To comprehensively model computer action, we need to tokenize key presses, mouse movements, and scroll events into discrete bins. Key presses and scrolls are easy: we tokenize each key press, key release, and scroll event individually.</p><p>Mouse movements are harder to tokenize because the mouse can move any number of pixels per frame—this state space is too large and inefficient to effectively train on. To reduce the state space and use tokens more uniformly, we exponentially bin (<a href=\"https://si.inc/posts/fdm1/#fig-exponential-binning\" data-fig=\"exponential-binning\">Figure </a>) the mouse movements. The mouse delta per frame is split into X and Y components. Then, each component is normalized relative to the screen’s width and height before being placed into one of 49 exponentially-sized bins.</p><p>This way, small, frequent movements are tokenized into finer bins and large, infrequent movements into coarser ones. We also train our FDM to predict the next click position alongside every mouse movement token, which helps produce accurate trajectories.</p><p>Evaluating an action model requires testing it many times in many live environments. We built eval infrastructure that drives over 1M rollouts per hour across 80,000 forking virtual machines. Each VM is a minimal Ubuntu desktop environment with 1 vCPU and 8GB of RAM; a single H100 can control 42 of these in parallel.</p><p>Forking lets us capture a full memory snapshot of an OS state and replicate it onto a fresh VM without corrupting the base environment. This allows us to reuse a single evaluation starting state across thousands of rollouts, effectively leveraging test-time-compute.</p><p>Our VM infrastructure is also optimized for low latency. This is important so the model is in distribution during inference because it wasn’t exposed to latency during training—the model has never seen lag before. We mitigate latency through a variety of methods: colocating the GPUs and VMs in the same cloud region, using cumulative sequence length packing, tuning a low-latency VNC configuration, and writing custom Rust bindings for device input. The combination of these optimizations lets us achieve a round trip screen capture to action latency of 11ms.</p><p>We use this infrastructure to sample trends on our internal eval suite when comparing training recipes (<a href=\"https://si.inc/posts/fdm1/#fig-evals\" data-fig=\"evals\">Figure </a>). Here we compare ground-truth contractor data with IDM-labeled data to both determine the quality of the IDM dataset and characterize scaling trends when increasing run sizes.</p><p>The IDM-labeled data outperforms our contractor dataset in general mouse movement and action capabilities (as seen in , , and  above). For typing and verbal understanding, the model improves on the IDM-labeled data, but more slowly than on contractor datasets. We believe this is caused by noise introduced by the IDM. In the future, we will consider using a mix of IDM and contractor data when scaling up the model.</p><p>Our model successfully and scalably infers human behavior on complex tasks like object segmentation and 3D manipulation. We also demonstrate that training on computer use generalizes to the real world significantly more easily than a model without such training. In our self-driving tests, the model is able to use a web interface to navigate turns around a block in San Francisco after finetuning on less than 1 hour of collected data. FDM-1 starts with 50% accuracy on key press prediction (a choice between no action, move left, or move right <a href=\"https://si.inc/posts/fdm1/#fig-self-driving-chart\" data-fig=\"self-driving-chart\">Figure </a>), significantly higher than the baseline model with only our video encoder (and no internet video pretraining). Our model also achieves steeper scaling trends compared to the baseline. We expect to achieve zero shot performance on such tasks in the future.</p><p>Computer action used to be fundamentally data-constrained, expensive, and unscalable. We unlocked both <strong>multi-hour 30 FPS video contexts</strong> and the ability to <strong>train on 11 million hours of data</strong>. This brings computer action from a data-constrained regime to a compute-constrained one.</p><p>We believe artificial general intelligence will be created within our lifetimes, and likely within the next decade. Our recent work closes the gap on self-directing, competent computer use agents, but there are still a lot of technical problems to be solved before aligned general learners can exist. Standard Intelligence exists to solve these problems.</p><p>We’re a small team based in San Francisco. If you’re excited about our work, we’d love to hear from you at <a href=\"https://si.inc/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e591808488a5968ccb8c8b86\"></a>.</p><p><em>Thanks to Mohit Agarwal, Carlo Agostinelli, Robert Avery, Cheru Berhanu, Trevor Chow, Luke Drago, Ryan Kaufman, Rudolf Laine, Jinglin Li, Lexi Mattick, Ulisse Mini, Rio Popper, Jannik Schilling, Armando Shashoua, Aidan Smith, Koko Xsu, and Sally Zhu.</em></p>",

When used appropriately and with awareness of their\nshortcomings, these can often provide significant benefits to\nCS practitioners and are thus worth developing working knowledge of.\nSince AI is a cross-functional enabling technology, there is not a\nstandalone AI lecture; we’ve instead folded the use of the latest\napplicable AI tools and techniques into each lecture directly.</p><p>You can view lecture videos on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyzOVJj3bHQunmnnTXrNbZnBaCA-ieK4L\">YouTube</a>.</p><p>You can discuss the course in the <a href=\"https://ossu.dev/#community\">OSSU Discord</a> (use  like you would use Piazza, and  to chat with the class/instructors).</p><p>We’ve also shared this class beyond MIT in the hopes that others may\nbenefit from these resources.

      "content": "<p>Hey HN! Lev and Justin here, authors of PgDog (<a href=\"https://pgdog.dev/\">https://pgdog.dev/</a>), a connection pooler, load balancer and database sharder for PostgreSQL. If you build apps with a lot of traffic, you know the first thing to break is the database. We are solving this with a network proxy that works without requiring application code changes or database migrations.</p><p>The most important update: we are in production. Sharding is used a lot, with direct-to-shard  queries (one shard per query) working pretty much all the time. Cross-shard (or multi-database) queries are still a work in progress, but we are making headway.</p><p>Aggregate functions like count(), min(), max(), avg(), stddev() and variance() are working, without refactoring the app. PgDog calculates the aggregate in-transit, while transparently rewriting queries to fetch any missing info. For example, multi-database average calculation requires a total count of rows to calculate the original sum. PgDog will add count() to the query, if it’s not there already, and remove it from the rows sent to the app.</p><p>Sorting and grouping works, including DISTINCT, if the columns(s) are referenced in the result. Over 10 data types are supported, like, timestamp(tz), all integers, varchar, etc.</p><p>Cross-shard writes, including schema changes (CREATE/DROP/ALTER), are now atomic and synchronized between all shards with two-phase commit. PgDog keeps track of the transaction state internally and will rollback the transaction if the first phase fails. You don’t need to monkeypatch your ORM to use this: PgDog will intercept the COMMIT statement and execute PREPARE TRANSACTION and COMMIT PREPARED instead.</p><p>Omnisharded tables, a.k.a replicated or mirrored (identical on all shards), support atomic reads and writes. That’s important because most databases can’t be completely sharded and will have some common data on all databases that has to be kept in-sync.</p><p>Multi-tuple inserts, e.g., INSERT INTO table_x VALUES ($1, $2), ($3, $4), are split by our query rewriter and distributed to their respective shards automatically. They are used by ORMs like Prisma, Sequelize, and others, so those now work without code changes too.</p><p>Sharding keys can be mutated. PgDog will intercept and rewrite the update statement into 3 queries, SELECT, INSERT, and DELETE, moving the row between shards. If you’re using Citus (for everyone else, Citus is a Postgres extension for sharding databases), this might be worth a look.</p><p>If you’re like us and prefer integers to UUIDs for your primary keys, we built a cross-shard unique sequence, directly inside PgDog. It uses the system clock (and a couple other inputs), can be called like a Postgres function, and will automatically inject values into queries, so ORMs like ActiveRecord will continue to work out of the box. It’s monotonically increasing, just like a real Postgres sequence, and can generate up to 4 million numbers per second with a range of 69.73 years, so no need to migrate to UUIDv7 just yet.</p><pre><code>    INSERT INTO my_table (id, created_at) VALUES (pgdog.unique_id(), now());\n</code></pre>\nResharding is now built-in. We can move gigabytes of tables per second, by parallelizing logical replication streams across replicas. This is really cool! Last time we tried this at Instacart, it took over two weeks to move 10 TB between two machines. Now, we can do this in just a few hours, in big part thanks to the work of the core team that added support for logical replication slots to streaming replicas in Postgres 16.<p>Sharding hardly works without a good load balancer. PgDog can monitor replicas and move write traffic to a promoted primary during a failover. This works with managed Postgres, like RDS (incl. Aurora), Azure Pg, GCP Cloud SQL, etc., because it just polls each instance with “SELECT pg_is_in_recovery()”. Primary election is not supported yet, so if you’re self-hosting with Patroni, you should keep it around for now, but you don’t need to run HAProxy in front of the DBs anymore.</p><p>The load balancer is getting pretty smart and can handle edge cases like SELECT FOR UPDATE and CTEs with INSERT/UPDATE statements, but if you still prefer to handle your read/write separation in code, you can do that too with manual routing. This works by giving PgDog a hint at runtime: a connection parameter (-c pgdog.role=primary), SET statement, or a query comment. If you have multiple connection pools in your app, you can replace them with just one connection to PgDog instead. For multi-threaded Python/Ruby/Go apps, this helps by reducing memory usage, I/O and context switching overhead.</p><p>Speaking of connection pooling, PgDog can automatically rollback unfinished transactions and drain and re-sync partially sent queries, all in an effort to preserve connections to the database. If you’ve seen Postgres go to 100% CPU because of a connection storm caused by an application crash, this might be for you. Draining connections works by receiving and discarding rows from abandoned queries and sending the Sync message via the Postgres wire protocol, which clears the query context and returns the connection to a normal state.</p><p>PgDog is open source and welcomes contributions and feedback in any form. As always, all features are configurable and can be turned off/on, so should you choose to give it a try, you can do so at your own pace. Our docs (<a href=\"https://docs.pgdog.dev\">https://docs.pgdog.dev</a>) should help too.</p><p>Thanks for reading and happy hacking!</p>",

      "url": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/age-verification",

      "content": "<p>In cases when regulators demand real enforcement rather than symbolic rules, platforms run into a basic technical problem. The only way to prove that someone is old enough to use a site is to collect <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/personal-data\">personal data</a> about who they are. And the only way to prove that you checked is to keep the data indefinitely. Age-restriction laws push platforms toward intrusive verification systems that often directly conflict with modern data-privacy law.</p><p>This is the age-verification trap. Strong enforcement of age rules undermines <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/data-privacy\">data privacy</a>.</p><h2>How Does Age Enforcement Actually Work?</h2><p>Most age-restriction laws follow a familiar pattern. They set a minimum age and require platforms to take “reasonable steps” or “effective measures” to prevent underage access. What these laws rarely spell out is how platforms are supposed to tell who is actually over the line. At the technical level, companies have only two tools.</p><p>The first is identity-based verification. Companies ask users to upload a government ID, link a digital identity, or provide documents that prove their age. Yet in many jurisdictions, 16-year-olds do not have IDs. In others, IDs exist but are not digital, not widely held, or not trustworthy. Storing copies of identity documents also creates security and misuse risks.</p><p>The second option is inference. Platforms try to guess age based on behavior, device signals, or biometric analysis, most commonly facial age estimation from <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/selfies\">selfies</a> or videos. This avoids formal ID collection, but it replaces certainty with probability and error.</p><p>In practice, companies combine both. Self-declared ages are backed by inference systems. When confidence drops, or regulators ask for proof of effort, inference escalates to ID checks. What starts as a light-touch checkpoint turns into layered verification that follows users over time.</p><h2>What Are Platforms Doing Now?</h2><p>This pattern is already visible on major platforms.</p><p><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/meta\">Meta</a> has deployed facial age estimation on <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/instagram\">Instagram</a> in multiple markets, using video-selfie checks through third-party partners. When the system flags users as possibly underaged, it prompts them to record a short selfie video. An AI system estimates their age and, if it decides they are under the threshold, restricts or locks the account. Appeals often trigger additional checks, and misclassifications are common.</p><p>TikTok has confirmed that it also scans public videos to infer users’ ages. <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/google\">Google</a> and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/youtube\">YouTube</a> rely heavily on behavioral signals tied to viewing history and account activity to infer age, then ask for government ID or a credit card when the system is unsure. A credit card functions as a proxy for adulthood, even though it says nothing about who is actually using the account. The <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/roblox\">Roblox</a> games site, which recently <a href=\"https://about.roblox.com/newsroom/2026/01/roblox-age-checks-required-to-chat\" target=\"_blank\">launched a new age-estimate system</a>, is already suffering from users selling child-aged accounts to adult predators seeking entry to age-restricted areas, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/robloxs-ai-powered-age-verification-is-a-complete-mess/\" target=\"_blank\"> reports</a>.</p><p>For a typical user, age is no longer a one-time declaration. It becomes a recurring test. A new phone, a change in behavior, or a false signal can trigger another check. Passing once does not end the process.</p><h2>How Do Age-Verification Systems Fail?</h2><p>These systems fail in predictable ways.</p><p>False positives are common. Platforms identify as minors adults with youthful faces, or adults who are sharing family devices, or have otherwise unusual usage. They lock accounts, sometimes for days. False negatives also persist. Teenagers learn quickly how to evade checks by borrowing IDs, cycling accounts, or using VPNs.</p><p>The appeal process itself creates new privacy risks. Platforms must store biometric data, ID images, and verification logs long enough to defend their decisions to regulators. So if an adult who is tired of submitting selfies to verify their age finally uploads an ID, the system must now secure that stored ID. Each retained record becomes a potential breach target.</p><p>Scale that experience across millions of users, and you bake the privacy risk into how platforms work.</p><h2>Is Age Verification Compatible With Privacy Law?</h2><p>This is where emerging age-restriction policy collides with existing privacy law.</p><p>Modern data-protection regimes all rest on similar ideas: Collect only what you need, use it only for a defined purpose, and keep it only as long as necessary.</p><p>Age enforcement undermines all three.</p><p>To prove they are following age-verification rules, platforms must log verification attempts, retain evidence, and monitor users over time. When regulators or courts ask whether a platform took reasonable steps, “We collected less data” is rarely persuasive. For companies, defending themselves against accusations of neglecting to properly verify age supersedes defending themselves against accusations of inappropriate <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/data-collection\">data collection</a>.</p><p>It is not an explicit choice by voters or policymakers, but instead a reaction to enforcement pressure and how companies perceive their litigation risk.</p><p>Outside wealthy democracies, the trade-off is even starker.</p><p>Brazil’s Statute of Child-rearing and Adolescents (ECA in Portuguese) imposes strong child-protection duties online, while its data-protection law restricts data collection and processing. Now providers operating in <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/brazil\">Brazil</a> must adopt effective age-verification mechanisms and can no longer rely on self-declaration alone for high-risk services. Yet they also face uneven identity infrastructure and widespread device sharing. To compensate, they rely more heavily on facial estimation and third-party verification vendors.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/nigeria\">Nigeria</a> many users lack formal IDs. Digital service providers fill the gap with behavioral analysis, biometric inference, and offshore verification services, often with limited oversight. Audit logs grow, data flows expand, and the practical ability of users to understand or contest how companies infer their age shrinks accordingly. Where identity systems are weak, companies do not protect privacy. They bypass it.</p><p>The paradox is clear. In countries with less administrative capacity, age enforcement often produces more surveillance, not less, because inference fills the void of missing documents.</p><h2>How Do Enforcement Priorities Change Expectations?</h2><p>Some policymakers assume that vague standards preserve flexibility. In the U.K., then–Digital Secretary Michelle Donelan, <a href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukia/2025/3/pdfs/ukia_20250003_en.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">argued</a> in 2023 that requiring certain online safety outcomes without specifying the means would avoid mandating particular technologies. Experience suggests the opposite.</p><p>When disputes reach regulators or courts, the question is simple: Can minors still access the platform easily? If the answer is yes, authorities tell companies to do more. Over time, “reasonable steps” become more invasive.</p><p>Repeated facial scans, escalating ID checks, and long-term logging become the norm. Platforms that collect less data start to look reckless by comparison. Privacy-preserving designs lose out to defensible ones.</p><p>This pattern is familiar, including online sales-tax enforcement. After courts settled that large platforms had an obligation to collect and remit sales taxes, companies began continuous tracking and storage of transaction destinations and customer location signals. That tracking is not abusive, but once enforcement requires proof over time, companies build systems to log, retain, and correlate more data. Age verification is moving the same way. What begins as a one-time check becomes an ongoing evidentiary system, with pressure to monitor, retain, and justify user-level data.</p><h2>The Choice We Are Avoiding</h2><p>None of this is an argument against protecting children online. It is an argument against pretending there is no trade-off.</p><p>Some observers present <a href=\"https://www.newamerica.org/oti/briefs/exploring-privacy-preserving-age-verification/\" target=\"_blank\">privacy-preserving age proofs</a> involving a third party, such as the government, as a solution, but they inherit the same structural flaw: Many users who are legally old enough to use a platform do not have government ID. In countries where the minimum age for social media is lower than the age at which ID is issued, platforms face a choice between excluding lawful users and monitoring everyone. Right now, companies are making that choice quietly, after building systems and normalizing behavior that protects them from the greater legal risks. Age-restriction laws are not just about kids and screens. They are reshaping how identity, privacy, and access work on the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/internet\">Internet</a> for everyone.</p><p>The age-verification trap is not a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/glitch\">glitch</a>. It is what you get when regulators treat age enforcement as mandatory and privacy as optional.</p>",

      "content": "<p>We’ve been searching for a memory-safe programming language to replace C++ in Ladybird for a while now. We previously explored Swift, but the C++ interop never quite got there, and platform support outside the Apple ecosystem was limited. Rust is a different story. The ecosystem is far more mature for systems programming, and many of our contributors already know the language. Going forward, we are rewriting parts of Ladybird in Rust.</p><p>When we originally evaluated Rust back in 2024, we rejected it because it’s not great at C++ style OOP. The web platform object model inherits a lot of 1990s OOP flavor, with garbage collection, deep inheritance hierarchies, and so on. Rust’s ownership model is not a natural fit for that.</p><p>But after another year of treading water, it’s time to make the pragmatic choice. Rust has the ecosystem and the safety guarantees we need. Both Firefox and Chromium have already begun introducing Rust into their codebases, and we think it’s the right choice for Ladybird too.</p><p>Our first target was , Ladybird’s JavaScript engine. The lexer, parser, AST, and bytecode generator are relatively self-contained and have extensive test coverage through <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/test262\">test262</a>, which made them a natural starting point.</p><p>I used <a href=\"https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code\">Claude Code</a> and <a href=\"https://openai.com/codex/\">Codex</a> for the translation. This was human-directed, not autonomous code generation. I decided what to port, in what order, and what the Rust code should look like. It was hundreds of small prompts, steering the agents where things needed to go. After the initial translation, I ran multiple passes of adversarial review, asking different models to analyze the code for mistakes and bad patterns.</p><p>The requirement from the start was byte-for-byte identical output from both pipelines. The result was about 25,000 lines of Rust, and the entire port took about two weeks. The same work would have taken me multiple months to do by hand. We’ve verified that every AST produced by the Rust parser is identical to the C++ one, and all bytecode generated by the Rust compiler is identical to the C++ compiler’s output. Zero regressions across the board:</p><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Ladybird regression tests</td></tr></tbody></table><p>No performance regressions on any of the JS benchmarks we track either.</p><p>Beyond the test suites, I’ve done extensive testing by browsing the web in a lockstep mode where both the C++ and Rust pipelines run simultaneously, verifying that output is identical for every piece of JavaScript that flows through them.</p><p>If you look at <a href=\"https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/8104\">the code</a>, you’ll notice it has a strong “translated from C++” vibe. That’s because it  translated from C++. The top priority for this first pass is compatibility with our C++ pipeline. The Rust code intentionally mimics things like the C++ register allocation patterns so that the two compilers produce identical bytecode. Correctness is a close second. We know the result isn’t idiomatic Rust, and there’s a lot that can be simplified once we’re comfortable retiring the C++ pipeline. That cleanup will come in time.</p><p>This is not becoming the main focus of the project. We will continue developing the engine in C++, and porting subsystems to Rust will be a sidetrack that runs for a long time. New Rust code will coexist with existing C++ through well-defined interop boundaries.</p><p>We want to be deliberate about which parts get ported and in what order, so the porting effort is managed by the core team. Please coordinate with us before starting any porting work so nobody wastes their time on something we can’t merge.</p><p>I know this will be a controversial move, but I believe it’s the right decision for Ladybird’s future. :^)</p>",

This post is public so feel free to share it.</p></div></div><p>The stated reason for the retractions was that: “review of this submission was overseen, and the final decision was made, by the Editor Brian Lucey, despite his role as a co-author of the manuscript. This compromised the editorial process and breached the journal’s policies.”</p><p>In plain terms, Lucey was serving as editor while approving his own papers. The result was a complete bypass of  peer review—an abuse of editorial authority that functioned as a citation-cartel scheme.</p><p>Apparently this was an open secret in the profession for many years, with EJMR comments going back 5+ years explicitly calling him out as a cheater: </p><p><em>International Review of Financial Analysis</em><em>International Review of Economics &amp; Finance</em><em> Financial Management, &amp; Energy Finance.</em></p><p><em>Journal of Economic Surveys. </em></p><p>I emailed Wiley, and they provided me with this statement:</p><blockquote><p><em>We are aware of these concerns and have investigated Prof. Lucey’s activity on Journal of Economic Surveys. Our research integrity team did not find any concerns regarding conflict of interest or mishandling of papers, nor has Prof. Lucey published any papers in the journal since he joined the editorial team as a co-editor in 2024. We expect full commitment and adherence to our editorial practices and standards, and we will be monitoring the situation to ensure that there is no improper handling of papers at the journal.</em></p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://www.econjobrumors.com/topic/brian-lucey-remains-eic-journal-of-econ-surveys-so-i-emailed-wiley\" rel=\"\">one EMJR user wrote</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.elsevier.com/subject/finance/journals-ecosystem\" rel=\"\">Finance Journals Ecosystem</a></p><p><a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5056074\" rel=\"\">it might facilitate citation stacking</a></p><p>I emailed the anonymous “Theophilos Nomos” who wrote this paper,  but they did not respond to my email.</p><p>Multiple publications by Vigne and Lucey are flagged on PubPeer.</p><p>This example neatly illustrates how their co-authorship trading scheme operated:</p><p>It describes a draft uploaded to SSRN with three authors:</p><p>After submitting that draft to the Elsevier finance ecosystem, that draft was scrubbed from SSRN, and in the final published version, an additional author  (Samuel Vigne) was added as a new author, with an “equal contribution” statement.

In this model, a small, tightly linked group funnels an enormous volume of papers into the same handful of journals, then systematically stuffs those papers with citations to one another.

The disclaimer at the top of the document Lucey provided reads, “In no way is this meant to suggest any ethical or other breaches. It is a list of persons who occupied a EiC or similar role in the Journal mentioned at the same time as a paper in which they were an author or coautho[r].”)</em></p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://www.thorstenbeck.com/blog-start-page/\" rel=\"\"> in a blog post</a></p><blockquote><p>This incident raises an important question: is this common practice across academic journals? And are there rules for editors publishing in ‘their’ journals? As I was editor across three journals for a total of 11 years, I can certainly speak to this (and clearly say NO).</p><p>I don’t have formal confirmation but I have been told by several independent sources that ultimately even Elsevier realised that this editor was seriously damaging the reputation of the journal, appointing a second editor and then easing out the ‘doubtful’ editor from his responsibilities.</p></blockquote><p>The fallout from the Lucey–Vigne era extends far beyond a handful of retracted PDFs. What it exposes is a structural weakness in how academic “excellence” is manufactured, measured, and monetized. By presiding over a coordinated cluster of journals, a small group of editors effectively gained the ability to print their own academic currency. </p><p><strong>Elsevier’s internal metrics (Impact Factors) directly benefitted from this behavior. </strong></p><p>This is the “paper mill” reimagined for the elite: not a basement operation in a third-world nation, but a polished, corporate-mandated factory within the halls o the world’s most powerful publisher. This is the natural result of a corporate mandate to maximize profits by bundling journals into monopoly-priced packages, forcing universities to pay for the very “prestige” that Elsevier’s own staff helped to dilute. As one EJMR commenter noted, “The tragedy isn’t that they cheated; it’s that the system was designed to let them thrive for a decade before anyone bothered to look at the data.” </p><p>The question now is whether Trinity College Dublin will fire Lucey.</p><p>They did not respond to my inquiry. </p><p><a href=\"https://retractionwatch.com/2024/12/12/bribery-offers-from-china-rattle-journal-editors-are-they-being-scammed/\" rel=\"\">offered $1,500</a></p><p><a href=\"https://richardtol.substack.com/p/crime-pays\" rel=\"\">wrote</a></p><p><a href=\"https://substack.com/profile/103077435-muhammad-ali-nasir?utm_source=substack-feed-item\" rel=\"\">Muhammad Ali Nasir</a></p><p>This raises a multi-million-euro question: given their documented corruption, are the various “educational consultancies” and special-purpose vehicles operated by Brian Lucey and Samuel Vigne used to circulate ecosystem funds, conference fees, or “consultancy” payouts from authors seeking a shortcut to publication?</p><p>One anonymous economist says:</p><blockquote><p>Here is a hypothetical outline of how such a cash-flow scheme could function.</p><p>“Hello [unknown, distant institutions], we offer consulting services: €€€ for excellent advice on how to publish in top-tier finance journals. Our advice yields results.”</p><p>Money flows into companies.</p><p>Papers flow into journals.</p></blockquote><p>Another anonymous economist says:</p><blockquote><p>I’m not going to provide details on how to corruptly have a paper published. I’m just going to speculate on what could be going on in a situation like this. It could be based on “consultancy fees” for advice on publishing that you or your institution pay to one of those companies. They give some advice, including what papers to cite, etc, and if you follow their advice you are likely to be published in one of their journals. This could be attractive for researchers and institutions in, e.g., China and the Middle East.</p></blockquote><p>Another anonymous economics professor I spoke to told me:</p><blockquote><p>Universities in East and West Asia pay cash bonuses for publications. Some authors hire a broker (many advertise openly on Facebook), other authors contact the editor directly. The cash bonus is shared between the author, broker, and editor.</p><p>Besides selling papers, they also sell special issues, which allow the guest editors to do what they want.</p><p>And they sell positions on the editorial board, which are important for promotion to the next academic rank.</p><p>Some payments are in cash, others in kind. </p><p>Finally, they organize conferences. Registration fees more than cover the costs of putting on a conference. The conference name suggests it is organized by a society, but it really is Lucey who pockets the profits.</p></blockquote><p>Brian Lucey and Samuel Vigne operate four private companies in Ireland and the UK classified under “other education,” likely functioning as consultancies or special-purpose vehicles for academic or policy work.</p><p>The existence of these consultancies warrants investigation into potential conflicts of interest and financial misconduct.</p><div data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.chrisbrunet.com/p/elsevier-shuts-down-its-finance-journal?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;}\" data-component-name=\"CaptionedButtonToDOM\"><div><p>Thanks for reading Chris Brunet!

      "content": "<div><p>In a private exchange with priests of the Diocese of Rome on Thursday, Pope Leo XIV responded to four questions, advising them on prayer, study, and priestly fraternity.</p><p>The off-camera moment took place after Leo gave <a href=\"https://www.ewtnnews.com/vatican/pope-encourages-young-priests-in-crisis-to-share-their-fatigue\">a public speech</a> to the priests, inviting them to “rekindle the fire” of their ministry.</p><p>“The first priest to speak was a young man who asked the pope how the Gospel can be embodied in the world of young people,” according to a priest present at the Feb. 19 meeting in the Vatican’s Paul VI Hall.</p><p>The priest told ACI Stampa, the Italian-language sister service of EWTN News, that Leo’s answer to this question was: “First of all, what is needed is the witness of the priest; and then, when meeting young people, they must broaden their horizons to reach as many young people as possible. For this, it is necessary to rediscover the value of communion.”</p><p>Responding to a second question, the pope recommended knowing well “the community in which one lives and works. It is necessary to know the reality well. To love your community, you must know it. Therefore, a real shared effort is needed to understand it better and thus face together all the challenges that arise.”</p><p>“The pope also invited us to use our brains more and not artificial intelligence [AI] to prepare homilies, as he now sees and hears happening,” the priest said. “And here the pope made a strong recommendation regarding prayer: We priests must pray — remain with the Lord, that is — not reduce everything to the breviary or to a few brief moments of prayer, but truly learn again to listen to the Lord.”</p><p>The third question was more reflective: Today, as priests, we are unable to rejoice in the success of another fellow priest.</p><p>The pope responded that “we are all human, but we should set a good example, especially the example of priestly fraternity.”</p><p>He dwelt at length on how to cultivate priestly friendship. The pope also reminded them to continue studying. “It must be ongoing study; we must always stay up to date. But the fundamental thing is to cultivate priestly friendship, priestly fraternity,” the priest from Rome said.</p><p>The final question concerned elderly priests and their loneliness. According to the priest, Leo’s response “reaffirmed the need for fraternity, for the joy of being together. We must give thanks, truly live gratitude for the fact of being priests, from the day of our ordination every single day, and thank God for this great gift, and live the priesthood with gratitude. And here, a great deal of humility is also required.”</p><p>“Personally, I was happy,” the priest concluded. “We greatly appreciated the pope for a very, very concrete speech.”</p><p><em>This story <a href=\"https://www.acistampa.com/story/33897/lincontro-tra-papa-leone-xiv-e-i-sacerdoti-romani-oltre-al-discorso-un-dialogo-sincero-e-aperto\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">was first published</a> by ACI Stampa, the Italian-language sister service of EWTN News.
