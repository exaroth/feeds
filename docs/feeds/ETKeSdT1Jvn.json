Constructed in the early 15th century as the hidden heart of imperial power, it was a city within a city — sealed off from the world, governed by rigid ritual, political intrigue, and absolute authority.</p><p>How did a daring coup bring this colossal complex into existence? What was daily life really like behind its towering walls? And, how did it endure revolution, the rise and fall of dynasties, and catastrophe to become a symbol of China itself? Dan travels to the heart of Beijing to reveal its extraordinary story.&nbsp;</p><p>Produced by Mariana Des Forges and edited by Dougal Patmore</p>",

We'll dive into a real incident in a live Kubernetes environment with a Jenkins deployment, where the audience will see the AI agent in action, and how I prompt the agent to triage the incident, decide on the next steps, and act on it. Attendees will see how teams are cutting incident response time by utilizing Skyflo and it's human-in-the-loop approach.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\n    Learn how I cut down incident response time by 50% at Storylane by using an AI copilot\n    See how to use an AI copilot to speed up your Kubernetes, Argo, Helm, and Jenkins workflows\n    Understand the human-in-the-loop architecture of Skyflo and behind the scenes of how it works\n\n\nLive Demo Plan (70% time):\n1) Trigger a deployment on Jenkins using Skyflo\n2) Wait for the agent to report back with the status of the deployment\n3) The pipeline will succeed, but the deployment in Kubernetes will fail\n4) The agent will go through a process of discovery to find the root cause of the issue\n5) The agent will decide on the next steps and act on it\n\nUnder-the-Hood (30% time):\n\n    Brief Architecture Tour: How LangGraph and MCP are used to power the Skyflo agent\n    Custom MCP Server: kubectl/helm/argo/jenkins with typed parameters and validation\n    Streaming over SSE: Live events over Redis pub/sub and server-sent events over MCP\n\n---\n\nFull schedule, including slides and other resources:\nhttps://pretalx.devconf.info/devconf-in-2026/schedule/</article>",

      "content": "<p>Greg Jenner is joined in twentieth-century America by Dr Hannah Thuraisingam Robbins and comedian Desiree Burch to learn all about singer and Hollywood actress Lena Horne. Born into a middle class Black family in New York, a young Lena Horne soon followed in the footsteps of her actress mother and made her début at the famous Cotton Club aged only 16. After making her name as a singer and performer – and following the end of her tumultuous first marriage – Horne transferred to the west coast and bagged a Hollywood contract with MGM. There, she appeared in a number of classic films, including Stormy Weather and Cabin in the Sky. Over the next several years, she would also perform for the troops in the Second World War, fall in love with and marry a white composer and arranger, undertake an international tour, and become one of the most popular nightclub performers of the post-war era. But the racism of segregation-era America would also shape and limit the career of the woman known as ‘the first Black pin-up girl’, eventually leading her to the civil rights movement and Black activism in the 1960s. This episode traces Lena’s journey from young dancer to Hollywood star and renowned vocalist, along the way exploring her connections with figures including Billie Holliday and Martin Luther King Jr., and the injustice she spent so much of her career fighting against. \n \nIf you’re a fan of the history of cinema, mid-century America, and Black cultural icons, you’ll love our episode on Lena Horne.\n \nIf you want more musical icons with Desiree Burch, listen to our episodes on Paul Robeson, Josephine Baker, and Broadway Musicals. And for more film history, check out our episodes on the history of Bollywood and Sarah Bernhardt. \n \nYou’re Dead To Me is the comedy podcast that takes history seriously. Every episode, Greg Jenner brings together the best names in history and comedy to learn and laugh about the past.\n \nHosted by: Greg Jenner\nResearch by: Rosalyn Sklar\nWritten by: Dr Emmie Rose Price-Goodfellow, Dr Emma Nagouse, and Greg Jenner\nProduced by: Dr Emmie Rose Price-Goodfellow and Greg Jenner\nAudio Producer: Steve Hankey\nProduction Coordinator: Gill Huggett\nSenior Producer: Dr Emma Nagouse\nExecutive Editor: Philip Sellars</p>",

      "content": "<article>Title: Lost in Silence: Understanding When Screen Readers Don’t Speak Up\n\nSpeaker(s): Ayushi Midha, Aishwarya Urne\n\n---\nIn the world of digital accessibility, silence is seldom neutral. For users of screen readers, a missing announcement can mean confusion, distrust, or exclusion—yet the issue often remains invisible to most developers and designers. In this talk, we’ll explore how the absence of spoken feedback impacts accessibility, trust, and user experience, particularly for people navigating dynamic web interfaces. Drawing on real-world examples and practical scenarios, we’ll examine the root causes of “silent failures” (such as missing ARIA live regions, improper roles, stale live-region content) and discuss how seemingly minor markup decisions ripple into major accessibility barriers. Attendees will walk away with a clear framework for diagnosing and remedying these silent gaps: from audit strategies and end-user testing through to implementable code patterns, best practices for dynamic announcements, and how to integrate these into your UI/component library workflow. Whether you’re working in React, Web Components, or template-driven apps, you’ll gain actionable insights to ensure your components announce properly, your users feel heard, and your silent UI becomes truly inclusive.\n\n**Key take-aways:**\n\nWhy missing announcements matter: the user-experience impact beyond visual cues\n\nCommon pitfalls in dynamic content, live regions, and state changes\n\nA developer-friendly approach to audit, test, and fix announcement gaps\n\nHow to bake these practices into your component library or design system (for example, your team’s work with PatternFly and a custom theme)\n\nTips for collaboration between developers, UX designers, and accessibility testers to maintain accessibility as your product evolves\n---\n\nFull schedule, including slides and other resources:\nhttps://pretalx.devconf.info/devconf-in-2026/schedule/</article>",

While ArgoCD excels in managing applications within a single Kubernetes cluster, deploying and managing workloads across a fleet of clusters can introduce complexity. This session introduces the ArgoCD Agent, a powerful component designed to simplify and secure multi-cluster GitOps workflows. Modern enterprises run multiple clusters to balance compliance, resilience, and team autonomy across global operations. Attendees will learn what the ArgoCD Agent is, how it addresses challenges in a distributed environment, why it was developed, how it solves the scaling problem and see a live demonstration of it in action. If you manage more than one Kubernetes cluster and use ArgoCD, this talk is for you.\n\n---\n\nFull schedule, including slides and other resources:\nhttps://pretalx.devconf.info/devconf-in-2026/schedule/</article>",
