      "content": "<p>Greg Jenner is joined in medieval England by Professor Marion Turner and comedian Mike Wozniak to learn all about Geoffrey Chaucer, author of the Canterbury Tales. Since the fifteenth century, Chaucer has been referred to as the father of English literature. He was one of the first authors to champion the use of Middle English for poetry instead of Latin, and after the invention of the printing press, his works became the foundation of the English literary canon – long before Shakespeare ever put quill to parchment. But Chaucer’s life was as extraordinary as his legacy, living as he did through the Black Death, the Hundred Years’ War between England and France, and the Peasants’ Revolt. In this episode, Greg and his guests explore Chaucer’s dramatic biography: growing up the son of a wine merchant in fourteenth-century London, his work for the royal court and long career as a medieval civil servant, his relationship with John of Gaunt through his mistress Katherine Swynford, and his travels throughout Europe. They also examine the poets that influenced him – including Petrarch, Bocaccio and Dante – and take a deep dive into the famous Canterbury Tales.   \n \nIf you’re a fan of medieval literature, historical courtroom dramas, and the tumult of fourteenth-century England, you’ll love our episode on Geoffrey Chaucer.\n \nIf you want more literary history with Mike Wozniak, listen to our episodes on Charles Dickens at Christmas and the Legends of King Arthur. And for more fourteenth-century lives, check out our episode on medieval Muslim traveller Ibn Battuta. \n \nYou’re Dead To Me is the comedy podcast that takes history seriously. Every episode, Greg Jenner brings together the best names in history and comedy to learn and laugh about the past.\n \nHosted by: Greg Jenner\nResearch by: Rosalyn Sklar\nWritten by: Dr Emmie Rose Price-Goodfellow, Dr Emma Nagouse, and Greg Jenner\nProduced by: Dr Emmie Rose Price-Goodfellow and Greg Jenner\nAudio Producer: Steve Hankey\nProduction Coordinator: Gill Huggett\nSenior Producer: Dr Emma Nagouse\nExecutive Editor: Philip Sellars</p>",

We'll dive into a real incident in a live Kubernetes environment with a Jenkins deployment, where the audience will see the AI agent in action, and how I prompt the agent to triage the incident, decide on the next steps, and act on it. Attendees will see how teams are cutting incident response time by utilizing Skyflo and it's human-in-the-loop approach.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\n    Learn how I cut down incident response time by 50% at Storylane by using an AI copilot\n    See how to use an AI copilot to speed up your Kubernetes, Argo, Helm, and Jenkins workflows\n    Understand the human-in-the-loop architecture of Skyflo and behind the scenes of how it works\n\n\nLive Demo Plan (70% time):\n1) Trigger a deployment on Jenkins using Skyflo\n2) Wait for the agent to report back with the status of the deployment\n3) The pipeline will succeed, but the deployment in Kubernetes will fail\n4) The agent will go through a process of discovery to find the root cause of the issue\n5) The agent will decide on the next steps and act on it\n\nUnder-the-Hood (30% time):\n\n    Brief Architecture Tour: How LangGraph and MCP are used to power the Skyflo agent\n    Custom MCP Server: kubectl/helm/argo/jenkins with typed parameters and validation\n    Streaming over SSE: Live events over Redis pub/sub and server-sent events over MCP\n\n---\n\nFull schedule, including slides and other resources:\nhttps://pretalx.devconf.info/devconf-in-2026/schedule/</article>",

      "content": "<p>Greg Jenner is joined in twentieth-century America by Dr Hannah Thuraisingam Robbins and comedian Desiree Burch to learn all about singer and Hollywood actress Lena Horne. Born into a middle class Black family in New York, a young Lena Horne soon followed in the footsteps of her actress mother and made her début at the famous Cotton Club aged only 16. After making her name as a singer and performer – and following the end of her tumultuous first marriage – Horne transferred to the west coast and bagged a Hollywood contract with MGM. There, she appeared in a number of classic films, including Stormy Weather and Cabin in the Sky. Over the next several years, she would also perform for the troops in the Second World War, fall in love with and marry a white composer and arranger, undertake an international tour, and become one of the most popular nightclub performers of the post-war era. But the racism of segregation-era America would also shape and limit the career of the woman known as ‘the first Black pin-up girl’, eventually leading her to the civil rights movement and Black activism in the 1960s. This episode traces Lena’s journey from young dancer to Hollywood star and renowned vocalist, along the way exploring her connections with figures including Billie Holliday and Martin Luther King Jr., and the injustice she spent so much of her career fighting against. \n \nIf you’re a fan of the history of cinema, mid-century America, and Black cultural icons, you’ll love our episode on Lena Horne.\n \nIf you want more musical icons with Desiree Burch, listen to our episodes on Paul Robeson, Josephine Baker, and Broadway Musicals. And for more film history, check out our episodes on the history of Bollywood and Sarah Bernhardt. \n \nYou’re Dead To Me is the comedy podcast that takes history seriously. Every episode, Greg Jenner brings together the best names in history and comedy to learn and laugh about the past.\n \nHosted by: Greg Jenner\nResearch by: Rosalyn Sklar\nWritten by: Dr Emmie Rose Price-Goodfellow, Dr Emma Nagouse, and Greg Jenner\nProduced by: Dr Emmie Rose Price-Goodfellow and Greg Jenner\nAudio Producer: Steve Hankey\nProduction Coordinator: Gill Huggett\nSenior Producer: Dr Emma Nagouse\nExecutive Editor: Philip Sellars</p>",

      "content": "<p>China’s Great Firewall is often spoken about but is rarely understood. It is one of the most sophisticated and opaque censorship systems on the planet, and it shapes how over a billion people interact with the global internet, influences the design of privacy and proxy tools worldwide, and continues to evolve in ways that challenge researchers, developers, and policymakers alike.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jackson-sippe/\">Jackson Sippe</a> is a PhD researcher at the University of Colorado Boulder whose work focuses on uncovering how national-scale censorship systems operate. Jackson recently helped lead a groundbreaking study analyzing a previously undocumented GFW technique that quietly broke fully encrypted proxy protocols across China for more than a year.</p><p>In this episode, Jackson joins Gregor Vand to discuss how the Great Firewall works at a technical level, the 2021–2023 blocking event, the popcount-based detection algorithm his team reverse-engineered, the cat-and-mouse ecosystem of censorship circumvention, and what these findings mean for the future of the open internet.</p>",
