She is famous now for saying \"let them eat cake\", for her love of fashion, and her supposedly extravagant spending at a time when ordinary people in France were going hungry.

Tools like npm and Yarn have long been the core of the JavaScript ecosystem, enabling developers to install, update, and share code with ease. But as projects grow larger and the ecosystem more complex, this older infrastructure is beginning to show its limits with performance bottlenecks, dependency conflicts, and growing concerns around supply chain security.</p><p><a href=\"https://x.com/darcy\">Darcy Clarke</a> and <a href=\"https://x.com/ruyadorno\">Ruy Adorno</a> are veterans of this ecosystem.

Now they’re building vlt, a new package manager and registry that rethinks performance, security, and developer experience from the ground up.</p><p>In this episode, Darcy and Ruy join Josh Goldberg to discuss how vlt works, why they believe package management needs a server-side reboot, what lessons they’ve drawn from npm’s evolution, and how features like declarative querying, self-hosted registries, and real-time security scanning could reshape how developers build and share JavaScript in the years ahead.</p><div><p>Josh Goldberg is an independent full time open source developer in the TypeScript ecosystem. He works on projects that help developers write better TypeScript more easily, most notably on typescript-eslint: the tooling that enables ESLint and Prettier to run on TypeScript code. Josh regularly contributes to open source projects in the ecosystem such as ESLint and TypeScript. Josh is a Microsoft MVP for developer technologies and the author of the acclaimed <a href=\"https://www.learningtypescript.com/\">Learning TypeScript</a> (O’Reilly), a cherished resource for any developer seeking to learn TypeScript without any prior experience outside of JavaScript. Josh regularly presents talks and workshops at bootcamps, conferences, and meetups to share knowledge on TypeScript, static analysis, open source, and general frontend and web development.</p></div>",

This talk introduces an approach to AI infrastructure optimization through universal resource management that reshapes applications to run efficiently on any available hardware—CPUs, GPUs, or accelerators.We explore how code reshaping technology can unlock the untapped potential of enterprise computing infrastructure, enabling organizations to serve 2-3x more workloads while dramatically reducing dependency on scarce GPU resources. The presentation demonstrates why CPUs often outperform GPUs for memory-intensive AI workloads, offering superior cost-effectiveness and immediate availability without architectural complexity.// BioWilder Lopes is a second-time founder, developer, and research engineer focused on building practical infrastructure for developers. He is currently building Ogre.run, an AI agent designed to solve code reproducibility.Ogre enables developers to package source code into fully reproducible environments in seconds. Unlike traditional tools that require extensive manual setup, Ogre uses AI to analyze codebases and automatically generate the artifacts needed to make code run reliably on any machine. The result is faster development workflows and applications that work out of the box, anywhere.// Related LinksWebsite: <a href=\"https://ogre.run\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferer\">https://ogre.run</a><a href=\"https://lopes.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferer\">https://lopes.ai</a><a href=\"https://substack.com/@wilderlopes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferer\">https://substack.com/@wilderlopes</a><a href=\"https://youtu.be/YCWkUub5x8c?si=7RPKqRhu0Uf9LTql\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferer\">https://youtu.be/YCWkUub5x8c?si=7RPKqRhu0Uf9LTql</a></p>",

In 218 BCE, the Second Punic War began between the two powers, with the Carthaginian army led by a man named Hannibal Barca. Famously, Hannibal took his forces – including a contingent of war elephants – over the Alps and into Italy, finally marching on Rome itself. But eventually the Carthaginians were beaten back, and Hannibal ended his days in exile. In this episode we explore his epic life, from his childhood in Spain, to his tactical brilliance as a general, to his post-war career as a reformist politician.</p><p>This is a radio edit of the original podcast episode.
