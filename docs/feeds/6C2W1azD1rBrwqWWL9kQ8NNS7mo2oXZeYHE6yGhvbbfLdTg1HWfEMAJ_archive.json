      "content": "<img src=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/09/g7uethpbiaazzaq-1765283237391.jpeg\"><p>Within the hallways of the sinister sanatorium where Resident Evil Requiem’s opening hours take place lies some of the most frightening encounters I’ve experienced in the series to date. With my headphones on and the lights off, the ninth mainline adventure in Capcom’s longrunning survival horror saga forced me to endure moments so palpably tense and prolonged I discovered muscles to clench that I didn’t previously know I had. Yet hours later I was no longer holding my breath, but holding my fist in the air instead, as I gleefully mowed down masses of undead meatsacks like it was D-Day in <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/movies/world-war-z\">World War Z</a>. In an effort to please both survival horror stalwarts and action-horror advocates, Resident Evil Requiem runs the gore-soaked gamut from anxiety-inducing chills to trigger-happy thrills. The result is yet another supremely hair-raising horror story, despite the fact its most potent scares have all been delivered by the time it arrives at its more gloriously gung-ho second half.  </p><p>Not unlike 2023’s <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/games/alan-wake-ii\">Alan Wake II</a>, Resident Evil Requiem initially focuses on a young FBI agent, in this case series newcomer Grace Ashcroft (Angela Sant'Albano), a fresh-faced analyst who’s sent to investigate a series of mysterious deaths among the survivors of Raccoon City, several decades after the 1998 outbreak. Grace’s flashlight-lit forensic search through the grimy insides of a shuttered hotel is ultimately short-lived, however, since she’s soon ensnared by Victor Gideon (Antony Byrne), Requiem’s main antagonist whose menacing air, disgustingly disfigured face, and greasy goggles make him seem like some sort of steampunk Emperor Palpatine. Victor traps Grace in the Rhodes Hill Chronic Care Center, a Spencer Mansion-style labyrinth of locked doors crawling with all manner of flesh-eating freaks, but thankfully help is on the way in the form of uber stylish series veteran, Leon S. Kennedy (Nick Apostolides). </p><p>Survival horror’s preeminent himbo has clearly seen better days – the strange bruising on his skin suggests he’s battling some sort of affliction potentially related to T-Virus exposure, while the shiny new Porsche he’s driving implies he’s also not immune to a midlife crisis. But it’s Grace who is the standout here. Resident Evil characters have historically exhibited an exaggeratedly campy quality that’s injected a large dose of goofiness amidst the gore, but for my money this inexperienced FBI agent is by far the most relatably human heroine the series has ever had. Her evolution from being perpetually on the brink of a panic attack to becoming self-assured enough to fight back made for a journey that I found as captivating as it was consistently creepy. </p><p>Requiem allows us to alternate control between Grace and Leon at specific story junctions over the course of its roughly 10-hour campaign, but it’s the former whose predominately stealth-based sections are undoubtedly the most fear-inducing. Underpowered and under constant threat from twisted stalker ghouls that are liable to descend from the rafters at any moment, Grace’s efforts to escape from the terrors of Victor’s hospital is a wonderfully stressful slab of unrelenting survival horror. There’s precious little ammo to find, a miserly number of inventory slots to manage, and Grace moves at such a slow speed that it makes timing your careful crouch-walk to avoid a prowling pack of zombies an exercise in pinpoint pathmaking, especially if you don’t have a rare breakable bottle to toss in order to create a distraction. All the while you have to puzzle through a stimulating series of body part-based riddles and elaborately locked doors, never really knowing when you’re going to turn a corner and come face to flabby face with a grotesquely girthy golem that’s urgently squeezing its way down the hallway towards you.</p><p>I spent so much time trying to steer clear of the numerous considerable threats, that on the occasions Grace was forced into a confrontation the results really rattled me. When played in the default, claustrophobic first-person perspective, her guns feel genuinely startling to fire and the impact of every precious pistol shot is immense. Bullets tear the festering flesh off zombie faces leaving eyeballs to dangle from their stems, and blood spatter paints the walls and persists even when you backtrack through the area later on. </p><p>The gallons of gore that covers the floor isn’t just there for spectacle, mind you, since Grace is equipped with a handy blood collector that allows her to syringe up the infected plasma pooling around zombie corpses, and combine it with other pieces of scrap to craft invaluable items like medkits and single-use hemolytic injectors. The latter can be jammed into the spine of an undead monster caught unaware, causing their entire body to swell up and explode in the most gloriously blood-soaked manner of stealth-kill possible, but you can also use it to effectively dispose of a body you’ve downed previously. I found that to be a smart move in areas that I knew I’d be revisiting, since Requiem’s zombies also have a terrifying tendency to reanimate and mutate when you least expect them to. (Seriously, these guys reform and come back more often than The Eagles.)   </p><section data-transform=\"quoteBox\">On the occasions Grace was forced into a confrontation the results really rattled me.</section><p>Grace’s quest only grows more intense as it takes her through the suffocating shadows of the hospital’s basement and beyond, but moving through Requiem’s danger-filled surroundings at a snail’s pace didn’t just keep my nerves on edge, it allowed me to observe and appreciate the efforts that Capcom has put into enhancing the eerie behaviour of its undead army. These are no longer the groaning, foot-dragging mouth-breathers encountered during the original Raccoon City outbreak, instead they retain traces of humanity that somehow makes them seem far more unsettling than the more animalistic werewolves in <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-village\">Resident Evil Village</a>. Like the ones that idly flick light switches on and off like bored toddlers, or the others that wander around muttering and laughing to themselves before suddenly collapsing to their knees to hungrily feast on the corpse of one of their former friends. </p><p>While Grace’s plight is a desperate and deliberate crawl that had me second-guessing every shadow, the ominous sounds of silence are shattered by the roar of ferocious ultraviolence when you switch control to Leon for what are initially brief, tension-breaking bursts, as everyone’s favourite ex-RCPD recruit attempts a not-so-subtle rescue mission. These levels default to a third-person view to really show off the slaughter, and within minutes of his arrival I’d slipped comfortably back into Resident Evil 4 mode, nailing headshots and ending the undead with effortless execution moves. To my surprise, however, Requiem quickly pushed the insanity meter beyond <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-4\">Resident Evil 4</a> into <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/games/dead-rising\">Dead Rising</a> levels of delirium by allowing Leon to actually wield a chainsaw to carve through the zombie crowds. Leon’s sections are up-tempo and gruesome to a degree that left me giddy, and almost every major zombie Leon dispatches is met with a delightfully deadpanned dad joke.</p><p>Where Grace must use the scarce amounts of scrap in her surroundings to make her own rapidly destructible knives, Leon is toting a powerful hatchet that can be easily maintained with an everlasting flint. While Grace has to carefully count each round in her small handful of handguns, Leon enjoys an extensive bevy of teeth-rattling boomsticks from beefy shotguns to head-splitting sniper rifles. Plus, if Leon gets bored of his own weapons he can use someone else’s – after killing a zombie who drops a fire axe or lead pipe, he has the option to smoothly scoop it up and launch it at another enemy nearby, which is every bit as slick and satisfying as the similar sword-flinging feature of last year’s <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-yotei\">Ghost of Yotei</a>. That’s not to mention that instead of having to painstakingly harvest blood samples to craft with, Leon is rewarded with a special currency for every kill that can be conveniently cashed in at a de facto ATM for artillery to buy useful weapon upgrades, extra ammo, and even body armour. </p><p>Simply put, there's no off position on Leon’s arse-kicking switch – his gunplay is John Wick-slick and bloodier than ever before – and in addition to his surging slaughter of zombie hordes it’s also within Leon’s levels that the bulk of Requiem’s appropriately epic boss encounters take place. There are plenty of colossal clashes to be found here, from brand new behemoths to brilliantly reimagined threats from previous Resident Evil stories, and there isn’t a single Del Lago-sized dud among them. I particularly loved how the hulking nasty faced inside a cramped chapel midway through the story subverted my expectations of how a Resident Evil boss fight should play out. Sure, being tasked with blasting the glowing weak points that cover a marauding monster’s torso is nothing new. That is, until you realise that while piercing each swollen blister does inflict damage to the beast, it also spews streams of infection onto the zombie underlings around him, instantly mutating them into brawnier forms of backup for you to contend with. Leon may be armed to the teeth, but that doesn’t mean Requiem doesn’t still find creative ways to ramp up the challenge.</p><p>As much as I love Leon, though, I do wonder if perhaps his sections become a bit too dominant once Requiem settles into a more action-oriented groove in its second half, as the story moves beyond the grounds of Rhodes Hill and deep into what remains of Raccoon City. Let me be clear, Resident Evil 4 is my personal favourite instalment in the series, so it certainly gave me a great deal of pleasure to once again wield a military grade arsenal and pull-off skull-shattering finishing moves as the series’ hunkiest mutant murderer. There’s also plenty of variety in the violence, from a full-throttle highway chase sequence to heavy artillery strikes that seem straight out of a <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty\">Call of Duty</a> campaign. But after playing almost exclusively as Leon through a roughly five-hour stretch towards Requiem’s conclusion, I did find myself yearning for a few more tastes of Grace’s superbly nerve-shredding stealth sections as a more regular change-up from Leon’s comparatively scare-free carnage.</p><section data-transform=\"quoteBox\">There's no off position on Leon’s arse-kicking switch.</section><p>That desire was eventually gratified to some extent by a terrifyingly taut late-game tip-toe through a facility crawling with some truly menacing monsters returning from the series’ past, but given that the story ended soon afterwards my overriding impression of Requiem was that it was very much a game of two halves. The former predominately a slow and steady scare-a-thon, and the latter largely a run-and-gun splatterfest. I very much enjoyed both flavours in their own right; I just wish for the sake of its pacing that they’d been blended together a touch more over the full course of the journey. Instead, Requiem is a bit like ordering a whiskey and Coke and having it served in two separate glasses instead of being mixed into one. </p><p>To be fair, Grace’s absence from a significant stretch of Requiem is justified within the context of its story, and overall it’s a tale that gripped me harder than a zombie nurse gnawing on my neck. There are a number of blindsiding twists that cast new light on the origins of the Umbrella Corporation and the ambitions of its founder, along with an excellent mix of zombie-riddled locations both fresh and familiar to puzzle and pummel your way through, and plenty of vital notes to collect along the way. Some of these memos are crucial to understanding the intriguing mystery behind Grace’s abduction and the truth about her past, while others are just genuinely funny gags to help ease the tension. After encountering a specific zombie type in one medical wing that was obnoxiously singing at the top of her lungs, I got a good laugh out of uncovering a doctor’s report that had diagnosed her with ‘Main Character Syndrome’, for example. </p><p>There’s also one particularly iconic location that Leon explores that I’m reluctant to spoil here (although it has been teased in pre-release trailers), which is jam-packed with fun Easter Eggs that made it a real treat to revisit as someone who’s been enjoying Resident Evil adventures ever since the T-Virus made its first outbreak on a black-bottomed CD for the original PlayStation. </p>",

While watching “Heart of the Undead,” this actually made me ponder something for a moment – and forgive how morbid this is… what if the child of Spear and Mira who we saw in the final moments of Season 2 the baby Mira is currently carrying? After all, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/96zF_ZtgOcc?si=kmz2Tyxn0jc9klbw\"></a> has already undone the death of Spear which occurred in that episode, so what’s to keep him and his team from diverting from what we think we know about the rest of what’s to come as well?</p><p>But no, that’s not what’s going on here, and soon enough the medicine woman, after examining Mira, smiles at Fang and the little villager kid: The baby will be OK, and so will Mira. (I mean, come on. Sure, Primal is the type of show where in its pilot episode it killed both of our main characters’ children, but having Mira lose the unborn baby would be a step too far… uh, right?)</p><p>Anyway, after that tense opening, what this episode is really about is Spear’s realization that he has become a monster… or at least a monster in the eyes of most everyone around him, even his former best friend, Fang. This leads him on a <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/guillermo-del-toro-frankenstein-review-netflix\"></a>-ian journey – villagers with torches chasing him out of town, spontaneous moments of literal self-reflection in a mirror of water, and eventually, apparent if transient death. The thing about the Frankenstein monster, as we all know – and now about Spear as well, it seems – is that these guys just don’t die that easily.</p><section data-transform=\"quoteBox\">The thing about the Frankenstein monster – and now about Spear as well, it seems – is that these guys just don’t die that easily.</section><p>Except, Mira and Fang don’t know that, and by episode’s end they think Spear is truly gone again, down that waterfall. They have no reason to think that the connecting river and waterways have taken his unconscious body into some kind of volcanic hellscape, where skulls adorn spears and a weird-AF-looking man-creature awaits him. Why would they ever think that!</p><p><strong>Questions and Notes From Anachronistic History</strong></p><ul><li>Funny how the villager who’s most afraid – sweat rolling down his face, eyes watering – is the one to make the first move and impale Spear.

Maybe Mira will also be the key to Fang finally accepting Spear again?</li><li>That’s a messed up snippet of a flashback that we got to the zombified sauropod dying in lava from Season 1’s “Plague of Madness.” There but for the grace of God, Spear…</li><li>Blue and Red Jr. don’t get a ton to do this week, other than be cute and hilarious and ever-loyal to Spear.

      "content": "<p>With stylish colors, a comfortable shape, and clicky mechanical buttons, the Horipad Turbo offers a dependable wired Pro Controller alternative for the Switch 2. It still comes with the limitations that come from being a wired controller, but it gets the job done for most use cases and costs significantly less than Nintendo's first-party offering. And with some nice features, like a switch <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pc-controller\">for PC gaming</a> and remappable buttons, it brings some useful stuff to the table – even if it just misses out on being one of the <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-2-controllers\">best Switch 2 controllers</a> available.</p><h2>Thumstick Placement and Comfort</h2><p>The Horipad Turbo follows in Hori’s tradition of dependable budget options for Nintendo’s flagship consoles, this time in pastel colors. Using a standard offset stick alignment, the controller feels comfortable in-hand during long sessions, except for one strange issue: the left thumbstick. To borrow some baseball terms, it’s high and outside. Placed just shy of the edge of the controller, it feels misaligned. Not quite uncomfortable to use, but it’s teetering on the edge.</p><p>When I hold the controller with my fingers on the bumpers and triggers, my thumb hits my hand when tilting the stick all the way to the left. This problem goes away depending on how I hold it, but its placement is frustratingly close to the edge regardless. And while the sticks don’t appear elevated, this placement makes the stick feel oddly high profile. This all makes stick-heavy gameplay less comfortable than most other options on the table, though it shouldn’t be a deal-breaker for anyone with smaller hands. The sticks roll around in their sockets with the kind of plasticky click you’d expect from a budget option, but they don’t necessarily feel bad. </p><a href=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/19/20260218-124114-1771498902194.jpg\"><img src=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/19/20260218-124114-1771498902194.jpg\" title=\"Photo of the controller with a hand holding its left side. The left stick feels a little out of position.\"></a><p>Left stick aside, the controller offers a pretty standard feel and layout. Its face buttons feel pretty comparable to those found on the first-party <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-review\">Switch 2 Pro Controller</a>, though the Horipad’s are smaller and more rounded. The triggers and bumpers are equally similar to the first-party Pro Controller, with low-profile triggers that press quickly with a satisfying click and beefy, comfortable bumpers that collapse with satisfying tension.</p><p>The d-pad is solid, though nothing groundbreaking. After running it through my usual Tetromino-dropping tests, I can confidently say that it’s fine. Each prong is a little narrower than I’d like, and the button gate in each direction feels too soft for my taste. Thankfully, it’s on a separate, raised plane from the rest of the controller, making the prong width issue relatively harmless during intense games of <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/games/tetris-99\">Tetris 99</a>. Unfortunately, that softness makes it easy to misinput in faster games like <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/games/street-fighter-6\">Street Fighter 6</a>.</p><p>I tend not to use back paddle buttons, but the Horipad 2’s have proven an exception to the rule. They’re bigger than most and press with just the right gate, giving a balance between an easy press, thanks to their size, without being too easy to press accidentally. </p><a href=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/19/20260218-124046-1771498902194.jpg\"><img src=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/19/20260218-124046-1771498902194.jpg\" title=\"The back of the controller, showing its buttons.\"></a><p>Being a budget, wired controller, the Horipad sacrifices some of the bells and whistles found in first-party and other premium offerings, like Amiibo support and motion controls. I was disappointed to find that it also ditches the 3.5mm audio jack, though. This feature seems like it should be standard in any controller featuring the <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-finally-implements-a-real-normal-voice-chat-feature-with-its-new-c-button\">new ‘C’ button</a>, as the Horipad Turbo does. This absence feels especially odd considering Hori’s seemingly close relationship with Nintendo and the emphasis on the ‘C’ button with the Switch 2. </p><p>One thing I love about this wired option, though, is its cable. Clocking in at nearly 10ft, it’s almost as good as a wireless controller for my purposes. Granted, I live in a mid-size apartment and spend most of my time within 7 feet or so of my TV, so your mileage may vary!</p><p><em>Charlie is a freelance contributor for IGN.

New episodes drop weekly on Fridays.</em></p><p>Three years ago, Legendary’s “Monsterverse” expanded into the streaming realm with Apple TV’s big-budget series <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/monarch-legacy-of-monsters-review-apple-tv\"><u>Monarch: Legacy of Monsters</u></a> and immediately raised the bar for the franchise’s storytelling with its human characters. Structurally, the series is an ambitious, multi-generational saga with a heaping helping of cranky <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/the-konggodzilla-monsterverse-every-major-monster\"></a> adding an extra layer of drama. Episodes flipped back and forth in time between the creation of the monster-studying org Monarch in the ’50s by Dr. Keiko Miura (Mari Yamamoto), her husband Dr. Billy Randa (Anders Holm), and their best friend Lieutenant Lee Shaw (Wyatt Russell), and the events of 2015, a year after the infamous <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/11/godzilla-review\"></a> when Godzilla first appeared to the modern world. And that continues into Season 2, as the Randa family in 2017 wrestle with the complicated consequences of Keiko’s retrieval from the <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/monarch-legacy-of-monsters-godzilla-monsterverse-brambleboar-axis-mundi\"></a> realm… and what inadvertently tagged along for the ride. </p><p>While its complex ensemble of characters and the Monarch vs. APEX Cybernetics plots might require a refresher before starting Season 2, co-creator/showrunner Chris Black and his writers have successfully refined their past/present storytelling this season so that the Titan and character problems of today are directly tied to Monarch discoveries or personal issues from the past. And that overall means plots are a lot easier to follow this season. The Titans are also far more present in Season 2, with a mix of Kong, Godzilla and the original Titan X monster given generous screen time with feature-film-quality visual effects work. Indeed, this season looks . There were multiple times watching these 10 episodes that I genuinely lamented not being able to experience the scale of this season on a movie theater screen. It’s that impressive. </p><p>While Apple TV has embargoed the majority of this season’s plot points for pre-release reviews, what can be revealed is that Keiko takes point in the Season 2 storyline as her rescue from Axis Mundi makes her a woman out of time in 2017. While still discovering the effects of her years spent in Axis Mundi, Keiko gets to reunite with her grown son Hiroshi Randa (Takehiro Hira), meet her grandchildren Cate (Anna Sawai) and Kentaro (Ren Watabe), and be shocked by the growth of her once modest Monarch operation. </p><p>While the timeline of the series inches closer to the events of <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/05/30/godzilla-king-of-the-monsters-review\"><u>Godzilla: King of Monsters</u></a>, this season exploits a sweet spot of unexplored real estate between the feature films; it’s a previously unfilled gap where plausible Titan encounters let the show’s characters do plenty of consequential business within the mythology. Aside from Keiko, Cate is still struggling to find purpose, but she rallies around not abandoning Col. Lee Shaw (Kurt Russell) behind in Axis Mundi, which activates her loyalty and drive to rescue the man who brought their grandmother back. Kentaro gets closer to his previously errant father, Hiroshi. Corah/May’s (Kiersey Clemons) hacker skills come into play for a substantial arc that involves Monarch’s Tim (Joe Tippett), a character who comes into his own as he’s folded back into the story on a much grander scale. </p><section data-transform=\"quoteBox\">Pace-wise, the first half of the season moves like a rocket with plenty of Titan set pieces of note as well as major plot twists and turns in the present and past. </section><p>Meanwhile in the past, a 1957 Monarch research trip to Santo Soledad in South America with Keiko, Bill and Lee sets up the back story for the series’ first original Titan; the creature gets a meaningful story in keeping with the environmental subtext inherent to all of the franchise’s monsters. On the human side, the personal dynamics of the trio get infinitely more complicated, and that plays out through the entirety of the season in both time periods. Building on their already established chemistry in Season 1, Yamamoto, Holm and Wyatt Russell expand the depth of their character’s feelings and regrets in a way that makes the flashback segments feel vital and just as compelling as the present storylines. </p><p>Pace-wise, the first half of the season moves like a rocket with plenty of Titan set pieces of note as well as major plot twists and turns in the present and past. The back half slows down a bit until it introduces a clever device involving Axis Mundi that delivers poignant emotional turns that help close the season with unexpected resonance. In general, the cast rises to meet the complex material they’re provided with, which is why Monarch: Legacy of Monsters continues to shine as a franchise standout. Everyone in the ensemble gets something important to do with huge stakes at play. The only character who is sort of orphaned until the back end of the season is Kentaro, who gets stuck in a sullen rut that is enigmatic for plot purposes instead of feeling organic to his character. And his arc only stands out as less than satisfying because just about everyone else in the cast gets great material to move them forward in the season. </p><p>For those mostly interested in the Monsterverse mythology, you won’t be disappointed. There’s an abundance of tethers and connection points to the feature mythology, even <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/tv/skull-island-the-animated-series\"></a>, Netflix’s animated sequel to <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/02/kong-skull-island-review\"></a>. Even better for those dissatisfied with major organizations, plot points or tech inventions that felt rather nebulous in the movies, look for many of those dangling issues to be better defined in the series, which in turn will enhance future rewatches of the movie-verse.</p><p>If you liked <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/tv/monarch-legacy-of-the-monsters\"><u>Monarch: Legacy of Monsters Season 1</u></a>, there’s even more to love and appreciate about Season 2. Not to wholesale knock the major stars in the Monsterverse films, but the depth of this series’ characters, cast and storylines continues to run circles around what the features do. I pretty much go to the movies just for the Titans. Now, if I want great character work  monster moments, Monarch: Legacy of Monsters is my  go-to.</p>",

While its handles don’t add a  of extra grip, the overall package confers a phenomenal level of convenience and portability, while still protecting my as-of-yet unscathed Switch 2. And with small perks like game cartridge storage and a MagSafe ring, this could well be my new go-to <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-2-accessories\">Switch 2 accessory</a> for solo travel.</p><p>Keeping with Genki’s sleek, understated-but-stylish branding, the Force Field 2 encloses the Switch 2 with a pair of semi-transparent, dark-grey pieces. The back covers the Joy-Cons and the console itself, with small, rounded handles adding a pair of small grips to the console in handheld mode. And instead of attaching each grip to the Joy-Cons, this case attaches its Joy-Con covers to the back panel itself, with hinges that snap on and off of the controllers while they are attached to the tablet.</p><p>This setup makes disconnecting a Joy-Con 2 from the console easier and more convenient compared to detaching a grip that’s attached to each controller individually, which comes in handy for for tabletop and mouse mode play. Folding open each grip reveals yet another efficient design idea, with a game cartridge storage slot that cleverly utilizes each handle.</p><p>The back panel that anchors these folding grips to the console itself snaps on tightly to the tablet, hugging it tightly enough to slide into the official Switch 2 dock. It’s kind of a tight fit, but it shouldn’t scratch your screen or anything. It also leaves space for the Switch 2’s improved kickstand. But my favorite feature for the entire case – aside from the protection it offers, of course – is right above that kickstand slot.</p><p>The MagSafe ring situated in the middle of the back panel alone makes this case well worth the cost. The Switch 2’s battery life seriously kneecaps its portability; even if you’re not playing in one long session, it’s always a bummer to click on your Switch for some time-melting <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/games/balatro\">Balatro</a> on a short flight or train ride only to discover that you forgot to fully charge your console. Here’s where the MagSafe ring comes in: it allows you to attach a portable battery to your Switch without needing to tether yourself to a USB port or outlet.</p><p>Genki conveniently sells a slim, powerful portable charger (which also works wirelessly with devices like smartphones) that snaps onto this magnetic ring, and ships with a well-shaped, male-to-male USB-C cable with right-angled ends, letting you charge the console with minimal interference to your playtime. You can also use other MagSafe chargers. In addition to Genki’s portable charger, I’ve also used other MagSafe chargers, like one of Pitaka's Aramid Fiber power banks, with great results.  However, I needed to use a different USB-C connector, because its placement and design were made for Genki’s proprietary charger.</p><p>The other half of the case comes with considerably fewer bells and whistles, serving as a simple cover designed to protect the console, including its screen and controllers. It snaps to the console with the other half of the case attached, providing a smooth, rounded cover that envelops the console to sit flush with the rest of the case. It’s a smooth, sturdy, protective barrier that doesn’t offer the same suite of flashy features as the other half of the case, but doesn’t need to. It could use its space more efficiently, with more game cartridge storage in the space between the screen and case, though it’s by no means a dealbreaker.</p><p>The full case adds less than an inch to the Switch 2 in total, too, keeping everything slim and low-profile, making it easy to store and pack. Even with Genki’s roughly half-inch-thick portable charger on the console, it’s still pretty slim and easy to throw into your bag.</p><p><em>Charlie is a freelance contributor for IGN.

      "title": "Turtle Beach Afterglow Wave Review: A Wired Xbox Controller With Little Capacity to Excite",

      "content": "<img src=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/30/tbaw-6-1769791360610.JPG\"><p>If you’re looking for a cheap Xbox controller that goes a bit beyond the basics, the Turtle Beach Afterglow Wave might be tempting. Its $49 price tag is on the low side, yet it tacks on RGB lighting, remappable extra buttons and Hall Effect technology, like some of the <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/best-xbox-series-controller\">best Xbox controllers</a> on the market. But behind that initial interest, there's unfortunately little that distinguishes the Afterglow Wave. And though $49 is less than a first-party Xbox controller at MSRP, there are plenty of deals on Microsoft’s controller, and even more third-party alternatives that do more to set themselves apart.</p><h2>Turtle Beach Afterglow Wave – Design and Features</h2><p>The Turtle Beach Afterglow Wave is, by all accounts, a fairly standard wired Xbox controller at first glance. It has the same control layout, roughly the same size face buttons, and the Xbox button is prominently placed at the center of the controller in a style that stands out from the bold colors elsewhere. It doesn’t have the bulging shoulders of the Xbox controller though, instead sporting a flat profile along its front edge like the <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/powera-enhanced-wired-controller-for-xbox-series-xs-review?_gl=1*1voawcw*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTI0NjAwMjQ5Ni4xNzUzNjM0MDQ5*_ga_736S6FVMCL*czE3NTM2MzQwNDgkbzEkZzAkdDE3NTM2MzQwNDgkajYwJGwwJGgw*_ga_BBZCZLHBF6*czE3NTM2MzQwNDgkbzEkZzAkdDE3NTM2MzQwNDgkajYwJGwwJGgw\"><u>PowerA Enhanced controller</u></a>.</p><p>The Afterglow Wave also has a few extras to stand apart from that well-known first-party option. On its back, it includes trigger locks to shorten the analog trigger travel distance, providing three different levels. It also has two large paddle buttons for your middle or ring fingers that can be remapped to different inputs, giving you access to controls with fingers that would otherwise be doing nothing while gaming. There’s also a microphone mute switch on the face of the controller, while the d-pad has audio volume and chat mix settings baked in as secondary controls. </p><a href=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/30/tbaw-5-1769791360609.JPG\"><img src=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/30/tbaw-5-1769791360609.JPG\" title=\"undefined\"></a><p>Then there’s the eight-zone RGB lighting. The controller has three wavy lines running up each side and translucent rings around the joysticks. Both joysticks have a lighting zone and there are three more zones per side. Counterintuitively, the three lines on each side aren’t separate zones. Rather, the lines have a bottom, middle, and top lighting zone. How distinct each zone appears depends heavily on color, too. For instance, yellow gets washed out by blue quite easily. The side stripes look decent, but the joystick rings are lit from one corner, so whatever color you choose will only show partially, and some color from the sides zones will blend in.</p><p>Beyond all this, the controller is rather mundane. There’s little about the physical design of the controller that stands out. The handgrips have a wavy grid texture, but aren’t rubberized in any way. The joysticks have little texture either, aside from a raised rubber circle nestled inside the top of each.</p><h2>Turtle Beach Afterglow Wave – Software</h2><p>The Turtle Beach Afterglow Wave supports customization through one of Turtle Beach’s many software packages. In this case, it’s the PDP Control Hub, available in the Microsoft Store on PC or on Xbox. This provides plenty of customization for different elements of the controllers, though it’s not laid out sensibly or even explained all that well. </p><p>You can remap each control on the controller, for instance, but you do so by selecting each control from a drop-down menu and then choosing the new control from a second drop-down menu. This is horribly tedious compared to clicking on the control on the picture of the controller and then pressing the control you want on the plugged-in controller. The screen where you do the remapping also is separate from the screen that shows you all the remapping you’ve done.</p><p>You do get some surprising options, though. You can swap the roles of the joysticks and triggers. You can also introduce mic monitoring for a connected headset through the app. </p><p>There are a handful of RGB customization, with color selections and effects. The software also lets you save four separate lighting profiles. But on the note of profiles, the controller doesn’t let you create multiple profiles for all the other customizations, which is a huge letdown if you plan on playing lots of different types of games and like to tweak things for each. </p><h2>Turtle Beach Afterglow Wave – Gaming and Performance</h2><p>While it might have panache thanks to its RGB lighting, the Turtle Beach Afterglow Wave is otherwise fairly unremarkable when it comes to performance. Hall Effect triggers may be nice over the long haul, as they ought to remain accurate, but I’ve had little issue with normal analog triggers in the past. Joystick drift tends to be a more common issue that Hall Effect tech helps sort out, but Turtle Beach didn’t opt for Hall Effect thumbsticks. </p><p>There are a couple nods to performance with the two custom buttons on the underside of the controller and the adjustable trigger locks. A few years ago, that would have been a slightly exciting inclusion - but these features are now almost table stakes for all but the most basic third-party controllers. Turtle Beach is at least providing them rather cheaply, but that cost-cutting is unfortunately quite evident.</p><p>There's no other way to say it - the Turtle Beach Afterglow Wave just feels kind of cheap. Most of the buttons are quite basic, with no special switches underneath. I can mash away at them, and they do the job, but they feel just like stiff plastic, far from an upgrade over a stock Xbox controller. The d-pad lacks texture and also doesn’t have a very pronounced actuation, making it feel just that little bit more nebulous than I’d like from an input device. The texture of the thumbsticks is incredibly unsatisfying, lacking grip while simultaneously roughing up my fingertips.</p><a href=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/30/tbaw-1-1769791360609.JPG\"><img src=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/30/tbaw-1-1769791360609.JPG\" title=\"undefined\"></a><p>The rumble motors at least feel decent. Two provide heavy rumbles, while two more “impulse” motors provide more subtle high-frequency vibration. The rumble is strong enough that it’ll bounce the controller around on a table if you set it down during a game cutscene.</p><p>The shoulder buttons are perhaps the best feeling, next to the triggers, with a more clicky feel, but even they are a little off. They actually move like a little lever, so to hit them, you need to tap the outside edge. This makes for an inconsistent response depending on where you put your finger. And if you go up too far on the button, pressing will simply do nothing – not what you want. </p><p>And all of this functionality is coming over a wired connection. For $29, you can get a similarly competent 8BitDo Ultimate 2C controller with many of the same capabilities, plus wireless connectivity, Hall Effect joysticks and triggers, and cute colors – you just won’t get RGB lighting or official Xbox support.</p><p><em>Mark Knapp is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything electronics and gaming hardware.

Dunk’s low self-esteem, being smallfolk from Flea Bottom, makes him view himself as worth less than the highborn, even though if he’s learned anything this season it should be that knights and noble lords are full of crap. </p><p>Dunk’s guilt also stems from Baelor, like Ser Arlan of Pennytree before him, having shown him kindness and fighting for him. But Ser Lyonel Baratheon gives Dunk a reality check early on, pointing out that as a Targaryen prince, Baelor was supposed to be safe and it was himself and the other members of Dunk’s seven knights who were actually risking their lives for him. “And the gods don’t favor a fraud,” he adds.</p><p>While Ser Lyonel’s scenes – and a later scene with Raymun Fossoway and his honey trap new wife, Red – reintroduce some humor back into A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms, the season finale remains largely a dramatic tale as Dunk struggles with finding meaning in what transpired at Ashford and where to go next. Egg still wants to be Dunk’s squire, something even Egg’s dad Prince Maekar is willing to allow and have Dunk swear his sword to him. Dunk declines, saying he’s done with princes. Egg is disappointed in Dunk, doubting that he’s the knight he thought he was. Sometimes a kid knows just what to say to a grown-up to hit them where it hurts most.</p><section data-transform=\"quoteBox\">\"Dunk is now his own man and his own knight.</section><p>It’s not until Prince Daeron essentially broaches the subject of nature vs. nurture with Dunk, revealing that Aerion was a good kid once before he became a monster, that Dunk realizes he could perhaps have an influence on Egg to make sure he doesn’t end up being yet another Targaryen tyrant. If he’s to do this, though, he’ll do it on his terms, telling Maekar that Egg will learn as he did by living the life of the squire to a hedge knight. Maekar ain’t having it; royal pride and traditions demand that the Blood of the Dragon not live as a peasant. Or at least that’s his pretense. </p><p>Maekar actor Sam Spruell has his best moments of the season in this finale, revealing a wounded humanity within this father exasperated by his family. When Maekar sees Egg standing at Aerion’s bedside holding a dagger – what a great moment that was of Egg looking at his white hair growing back and not wanting to look like his cruel brother – he doesn’t respond with anger or punishment, but comfort and compassion, gently placing his hands on his youngest son’s shoulders. </p><p>He understands why Egg is doing what he’s doing at that moment and knows exactly who Aerion is. It’s an incredibly human scene and it’s all done without anyone saying a word, but it speaks volumes. As Maekar tells Dunk when he rejects his offer of taking Egg on the road, Egg is his last son. He can’t stomach anything bad happening to him. </p><p>Egg has other ideas. In the end, the impetuous scamp cons Dunk once again, running off to be Dunk’s squire by saying Maekar had given him his blessing (which we learn in the humorous end credits scene is not the case at all). Dunk and Egg are now free to wander the, ahem, Nine Kingdoms seeking adventure. And as symbolized by that bittersweet final image of the specter of Ser Arlan riding away from them, Dunk is now his own man and his own knight.</p><p>A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms Season 2 can’t arrive soon enough for me.</p>",

Movies, on the other hand, have been around for a lot longer than that, and so many of them have never been reviewed by IGN. So in the interest of remedying that, frankly, horrific oversight, here comes our first Flashback Review.</em></p><p><em>We’re starting with director Wes Craven’s genre-revitalizing, franchise-spawning, meta teen-slasher, </em><a href=\"https://www.ign.com/movies/scream-1996\"></a></p><p>Scream was released in 1996, making it 30 years old today, the age over which <a href=\"https://buttonmuseum.org/buttons/dont-trust-anyone-over-thirty\"><u>we’re supposed to stop trusting people</u></a>. As one of the most influential horror films of all time, with more ink spilled online about it than blood spilled on screen, it’s a strange thing for the movie to not have an official score here at IGN. As an exercise, it’s just as strange to go back and review a film with the kind of legacy Scream enjoys today. So, for at least this first part, I’m just going to pretend that it’s 1996.</p><p>Bill Clinton just won the election for his second term in office, Toni Braxton’s “Un-Break My Heart” is at the top of the charts and Wes Craven kind of needs a win. He’s coming off of Vampire in Brooklyn which was and, frankly always will be, considered a big ol’ flop. <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/movies/wes-cravens-new-nightmare\"></a> was just before that, and showed Craven’s willingness to break the fourth wall, or at minimum it showed an understanding that it needed to be broken. It’s telling that contemporary reviews of that film largely considered it a self-reflective breath of fresh air in a tired franchise. By and large in the mid ’90s, the bloom was to some degree off the horror movie rose.</p><p>So here comes Scream, a meta-commentary on the entire genre. It’s doing all the things we loved about slasher movies in the ’70s and ’80s and  making fun of them, but also it’s  the guy that made most of those tropes famous in the first place with films like <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/movies/the-last-house-on-the-left-1972/articles\"></a>, <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/movies/the-hills-have-eyes-1977\"></a> and, most iconically, <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/movies/a-nightmare-on-elm-street-1984\"><u>A Nightmare on Elm Street</u></a>. All this adds up to Scream having its cake and eating it too. And it all starts with 13 of the best opening minutes a horror fan could ask for.</p><p>There’s an argument to be made that puts the opening sequence of Scream up there with the best in film history, not just horror. It would have been a legendary short film if there hadn’t been a whole movie attached to the back of it. It all at once played the hits (preying on youthful fears of being home alone and getting a call from a stranger) and modernized the discourse (quizzing Drew Barrymore’s panicked Casey Becker with a gotcha question about Jason Voorhees’ mom).</p><p>The camera work is brilliant as well, floating around the house, subtly tilted and stalking Casey with a slow, controlled steadicam. It pushes into a close-up to punctuate the more frightened beats of her performance instead of always cutting to those close-ups. The edit is just as deliberate, patiently waiting for the right moment to attack, exactly like the actual killer is doing outside. Barrymore plays her fear with a bit of disbelief, her panic with a little anger, while Roger L. Jackson, as the voice on the phone, shifts gears from playful and sexy to deranged and dangerous as he toys with her.</p><section data-transform=\"quoteBox\">After being front and center in the marketing, that Drew Barrymore doesn’t make it out of the first scene is wild, but it’s just part of Craven and Williamson’s scheme. </section><p>After being front and center in the marketing, that Drew Barrymore doesn’t make it out of the first scene is wild, but it’s just part of Craven and writer Kevin Williamson’s scheme. This opening creates a world that both loves the same movies we do, while deftly crafting a thrilling environment where anybody could be killed next.</p><p>Being denied one of the most recognizable faces from the poster for the subsequent runtime, the rest of the film is carried by an ensemble. TV stars Neve Campbell and Courteney Cox head up a group of young actors with plenty to prove on the big screen, but David Arquette’s Deputy Dewey might be the key to the whole thing. While most of the cast capably play their roles as “best friend” or “red herring” or “geeky off-to-the-side guy,” Dewey is a meek older brother, in over his head as a police officer trying desperately to be taken seriously (you could even say he’s trying to play against type). In a movie where subversion of expectations is the whole point, Arquette’s fledgling lawman embodies that theme better than anybody else on screen.</p><p>He also speaks to the true and lasting brilliance of this movie, if I can flash-forward back to the present day. The balance of comedy, horror and self-awareness created by Craven and Williamson is Scream’s real gift to cinema. It gave us a film that’s a blast to watch, yes, but that formula hides all manner of sins in a way that keeps the movie from feeling dated. Cordless landline phones and Blockbuster videos are quintessentially ’90s, but they don’t make the movie any less relevant 30 years later. Now, had the filmmakers not doused Scream with a self-referential bucket of meta corn syrup, the movie would have fallen into the same traps that had the genre gasping for its last breaths in the mid-’90s, and been more dated than any number of VHS tapes or Tori Spelling references could manage.</p><p>There are dangling logic threads to pull on, like how did one of the two killers sneak into the principal’s office to murder Henry Winkler? Ditto for Ghostface suddenly appearing in a garage that we’ve seen every corner of. And how is at least one of them not covered in beer for the rest of the night after being hit in the face and crotch with full bottles at glass-shattering force? Why is that garage door opener so damn powerful, anyway!?</p><p>Most of these questions only arise in repeat viewings. It isn’t until you know the ending and watch it again that you might even ask things like that, nor would you even bother with those questions if you’re charmed by the rest of the film. Ghostface is behind that door because that’s an effective jumpscare for us, the audience, not because it makes any sort of logistical sense in the space and time of Woodsboro. But thanks to the simple fact that these tropes are spelled out and on the nose, Scream gets away with it because that’s precisely the thing it’s making fun of.</p><p>Perhaps the most obvious beneficiary of this is Skeet Ulrich’s Billy. As one half of the movie’s central romantic pair, we meet him as he sneaks into Sidney’s room to guilt her into having sex. He holds it against her throughout the film, gaslighting her in moments of real distress and ultimately manipulating her into sleeping with him by the end. The guy is a dirtbag and, with 30 years and who knows how many repeat viewings later, it’s a damn good thing he turned out to be the killer.</p><p>But the tone of Scream, the meta-awareness created by Craven and Williamson, is responsible for smoothing that part of the story over to the point that we still talk so lovingly about this movie. This plot would ultimately be pretty forgettable if Scream didn’t have “yeah, that’s what we’re making fun of” to fall back on.</p><p>In fact, the whodunnit aspect of the film is probably its weakest element. The red herrings get presented and tossed away right on schedule, characters get killed off in a predictable order (Drew Barrymore’s early exit notwithstanding) and all the tropes that ought to be in a thriller are dutifully present. Ultimately, one could argue that’s a feature, not a bug, and probably be right considering the way each of those tropes is undermined. However, the story of Sidney’s mom and infidelity and the anger a high school boy feels about it (and if you don’t remember what I’m talking about here, that’s exactly my point) is very much  what’s so iconic about the movie.</p><p>And that’s the idea behind doing these Flashback Reviews as well. How was the movie received in its original context and how much has time changed its perception? In Scream’s case, with six sequels and three seasons of a TV show out there still slashing, the Scream clones of the late ’90s hot-teen slasher spree, and an entire franchise built around the film’s spoof, it’s hard to understate the impact this movie has had on the zeitgeist. Where meta-slashers are concerned, they did it first and they did it best. Craven and Williamson may well have pulled the ladder up behind them after Scream.</p>",

Will you find the incredibly creative scenarios of Hitman or the insane level of polish and replayability of Dishonored? Nope. Instead Styx contents itself with simply being a reliable way for stealth fans to get their fix, and Styx: Blades of Greed is no exception. More often than not, the usual playbook of sneaking around, stealing and assassinating everything in sight, is as fun as it’s ever been, and this sequel makes some important tweaks, like removing weak multiplayer mechanics to refocus on a solo stealth experience and swapping smaller, mission-based maps for absolutely massive regions. But it’s also saddled with quite a few of the same issues it’s always had, finicky movement, performance issues, and an unremarkable story, which are as disappointing as they are completely expected.</p><p>Like its predecessor from 2017, Blades of Greed puts you in the leather boots of an elderly, grumpy goblin as you sneak into small spaces, stab humans, elves, and monsters in their soft places, and use an arsenal of gadgets and special abilities to overcome the fact that getting spotted will get you killed in two seconds flat. There are some modest additions, like a couple of new gadgets and abilities that let you do things like mind control NPCs from afar or use a grappling hook to close large gaps in a short period of time, but for the most part there’s very little that’s changed about the moment-to-moment gameplay. You’ll still find, for example, the ol’ reliable ability to turn yourself invisible for a short period of time, and will still find yourself hiding inside closets and barrels before popping out to slit the throat of some idiot guard. Good times. As ever, stealth is absolutely the star of the show, and Blades of Greed has the same high quality sneaking around that you’d hope it would.</p><p>The story in Styx has never been very good, and Blades of Greed lives up to those low expectations by having a completely forgettable story in spite of the fact that its protagonist is inherently interesting and unique. After developing a craving for magical abilities granted to you by quartz crystals found throughout the world, you begin a repetitive journey to, well, find more of it, and 90% of the campaign is just going from place-to-place stealing these glowing rocks to power yourself up with little in the way of plot in between those scavenger hunts. You meet some characters along the way, like a gadget-obsessed dwarf and an orc who becomes your spiritual guide, but they don’t get enough screen time to leave much of an impression and what they do get isn’t used effectively, with everyone spouting off explanations of telling you what you need to do next and little else. You’re unlikely to have come to the Styx series looking for an engaging story, but just in case you were hoping to be pleasantly surprised: I wouldn’t count on that.</p><p>Though the vast majority of Styx’s bones remain the same, one major change is that instead of treading (and sometimes retreading) through mission-specific levels, Blades of Greed lets you loose in three extremely large maps filled with both mandatory and optional areas to explore, pilfer, and fall to your death within. It’s a neat idea that allows for significantly more freedom over prior adventures, and it’s quite easy to become distracted and assassinate your way through an entire region before realizing you didn’t even really have any objective behind any of it, except that it’s just hard to see a guard walking by unaware and not take him down. These huge levels also allow you to express creativity in how you navigate the area and solve the problem of getting around when every 10 feet there’s someone who could kill you by breathing on you. When you’re staring at an objective that’s a mountain’s distance above you, you’ll need to just creep around and try things to figure out how to get there – maybe you’ll find a nice spot on the side of a tower to make daring leaps while avoiding the notice of guards along the way, or maybe you’ll find a quieter path via a sewer system that leads you to the same spot, but is infested with giant bugs that will swarm you if you get too close.</p><p>That can be a really interesting stealth challenge to figure out, but comes with some unique drawbacks as well. For one, it can be exhausting to have to cross such a massive area slowly sneaking along all the while, and if you try to just sprint past everything to get to the objective, you should be prepared to reload a whole bunch as you work through the trial and error process of doing so. That travel time feels significantly less focused and curated than the more linear model for level design as well, and oftentimes you’re kinda just half-assedly sneaking through ruins and across rooftops with no real obstacles along the way until you get to the place that the objective marker wants you to be, at which point things start to feel much more focused. In other words, it’s a whole lot of fat before you get to the meat of the main objectives. I actually spent the vast majority of the more than 20 hours it took me to beat Blades of Greed trying to figure out where exactly my next objective was and how to get there, rather than actually pulling off the heist in question.</p><p>The good news is that each of these maps is pretty awesome across the board. The Wall is an absurdly cool vertical labyrinth of concrete castles and rickety slums, Turquoise Dawn is a jungle of trees, swamps, and massive, deadly roaches swarming in dark areas, and the Akenash Ruins are a ruined, kingdom where everything floats in the air unnaturally and enemies are extremely weird monsters, like something out of Elden Ring. Each visit to these places throughout the story unlocks new areas to explore, though you’ll also do quite a bit of backtracking through areas you’ve already been, which is a bit of a drag. Still, these are some of the more interesting areas I’ve stalked the halls of in a stealth game and highlights the unique, strange, and magically-infused world that this curmudgeonly goblin calls home.</p><p>Though the huge amount of space these maps have can be pretty great to explore, they sometimes feel a bit too big for the much smaller objectives within them. The story’s main objectives are much smaller than a typical stealth mission, usually just requiring you to steal a key and open a locked door, or shut down a machine so you can reach your objective – miniature quests that usually only take a couple minutes to complete, if that. Once you’ve checked it off your list, you’re back to the mostly uneventful traveling stealth as you find a way to the next objective, often requiring you to backtrack through some of the same spots in the process, which is how I have spent the bulk of the adventure so far. On the bright side, this format means you’re basically just locked into a constant stream of pure, unadulterated stealth scenarios for hours on end as you work your way through each set of missions, and since that’s Blades of Greed’s strong suit, you’re getting exactly what the doctor ordered.</p><p>If you’re familiar with the shortcomings of the previous Styx games, then you’ll probably be less-than-stoked to hear that Blades of Greed doesn’t address most of these. Combat, which is a last resort, but sometimes required, is quite sloppy and overly simplistic, and moving around, especially jumping onto ledges and the like can be finicky at times and caused me to fall to my death or get caught out in the open dozens of times by this point. Worse than those though, are the usual performance issues and technical challenges, like NPCs becoming invisible while talking to them and frames dropping to horrifyingly low levels after extended play sessions. Framerate issues are actually a fair bit worse than I remember them being in previous games, presumably due to the significantly larger maps, and it can get pretty bad for long stretches when there’s a lot happening on screen. Most of these issues are sort of baked into Styx by this point, but it’s still worth shouting out that the bulk of this stuff has mostly gone unaddressed, seemingly.</p>",

      "content": "<img src=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/20/pk-1771621138965.png\"><p><em>Psycho Killer arrives in theaters on Friday, February 20. </em></p><p>Psycho Killer is a grim mess. In fact, it's the draggiest, sloppiest revenge-driven road trip serial killer mystery since... 1997's Switchback? It also might be the only revenge-driven road trip serial killer mystery since Switchback. Maybe these particular elements just shouldn't blend. </p><p>Psycho Killer invites you into the lumbering word of the \"Satanic Slasher,\" the latest hulking masked maniac to take a stab at becoming an insta-classic within the pantheon of horror hellions. He's tall, swole, has a voice like Mike Lanegan (RIP), and loves hacking, slashing, bludgeoning, shooting, and slurping (?) his way across the country in a quest to, as he writes in blood, \"open the gates.\" The massive James Preston Rogers holds court well as the Satanic one, and the character has a lot of promise, his face constantly obscured by long hair, hoods, sunglasses, or all three. Unfortunately, first-time feature director Gavin Polone mostly wastes this giant madman's potential, attempting scares that fall flat and staging bloodlettings that don't pop. </p><p>There's a one particular massacre scene that closes out a story chapter that should have landed so much bigger and better than it does. Yes, CG blood can be distracting, but that wasn't the issue here. It's the staging and framing. Instead of drawing us into the Slasher's size and might, the camera keeps a weird distance that diminishes his power. Going for oners that also utilize slo-mo only enhance flaws in effects and choreography. Come to think of it, most scenes in Psycho Killer feel like half-measures in need of a few extra tweaks. Palone, a successful TV (Curb Your Enthusiasm) and movie (Zombieland) producer, gives this an earnest shot but when your film is heavily advertised with \"from the writer of Se7en\" and the director then lacks David Fincher's command for composition, color, and pacing, the lack of experience will be glaring.</p><p>Barbarian's Georgina Campbell (who can also be seen <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/cold-storage-review-joe-keery-georgina-campbell\">in Cold Storage right now</a>) plays Jane Archer, a Kansas state trooper on an obsessive cross-country trek to stop the Satanic Slasher, having watched this lunatic murder her husband in front of her. Campbell is more than capable in the role, but Jane's story is thin and unsurprising. She's the one we're supposed to care about and root for, but every slice of her saga is plucked from boring cop stuff – from the needless opposition she faces to the lazy way she puts the puzzle together. </p><p>Jane starts with a few interesting complexities but the movie flattens her into a one-note tracker. By the end, she feels like a cardboard cutout. Psycho Killer heavily leans on news/radio reports and (a ton of) ADR for much of Jane's side of the story. Saw franchise editor/director Kevin Greutert is credited as an additional editor, possibly explaining attempts made to reshape the film in post, to give it some semblance of clarity and voice. The efforts are appreciated but, nonetheless, fruitless. </p><p>The film is set in 2007, where things like the internet collide with remnants like payphones, car cigarette lighters, newspaper classifieds (a '70s/'80s-feeling plot device), and encyclopedia volumes. The end result is a garbled era that only has to be that way because of the killer's specific plans, and that type of reverse engineering hurts the movie from the get-go. The Slasher goes out of his way to contact people using coded print ads, and do research via libary books, even though the world wide web is readily available. Maybe this is why Jane is able to run circles around the actual task force assigned to find this guy. Because they don't... do searches on the internet? </p><p>It's weird, but not surprising, that the Satanic Slasher feels like more of a layered personality when all is said and done. After all, Jane's just a typical \"dig two graves\" justice seeker. The Slasher has ideas. Preferences. Thirsts. And he also gets to meet up with a gaggle of fellow Satanists, headed by Malcolm McDowell, in a surprising second act stretch of the movie that contains its only offbeat charm and charisma. The Slasher, who basically represents all the human sacrifice Satanic Panic of the '80s rolled into a giant Undertaker-type behemoth, seeks help from some miscreants who just want to engage in drug-fueled orgies. It's a fun clash of ideologies and McDowell's scenes are the only lively, unexpected ones in the film.</p><p>With the marketing so focused on Se7en's screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker, Psycho Killer's wink-wink promise of a twisted project hamstrings its own efforts. Evoking Se7en also summons expectations of a subversive, swerve-y ending and Psycho Killer doesn't deliver anything close to being as paradigm-changing. The third act is wildly preposterous, though, if that's to be Walker's hallmark. It goes bigger than it needs to, but maybe if it had gone  people would be talking about this movie a decade from now. It's too bad Psycho Killer doesn't build up its (two?) characters enough for you to care whether the Slasher fulfills his grand scheme or not. </p>",

      "content": "<img src=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/28/paradise-thumb-1769638241379.jpg\"><p><em>This article contains spoilers for Paradise Season 1; Paradise Season 2 debuts on Hulu on February 23.</em></p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/paradise-season-1-review-hulu-james-marsden-sterling-k-brown-julianne-nicholson\">first season of Hulu’s Paradise</a> was extremely hard to talk about before it was released, particularly because the premiere episode’s big twist – that the show takes place entirely inside a suburban-style bunker under a mountain in Colorado after the apparent end of the world – was expressly forbidden from being mentioned in reviews. Well, the secret is out, and while there are plenty more twists and turns in Season 2 of the series – including a likely game changer in the finale (seven of the season’s eight episodes were provided to critics for review) – it’s a little easier to talk about this time around. With Season 2, Paradise continues to be one of the most propulsively binge-worthy dramas on TV.</p><p>To revisit Season 1 just a bit: After the murder of third term President Cal Bradford (James Marsden), Secret Service agent Xavier Collins (Sterling K. Brown) went down a conspiracy rabbit hole, unraveling some of the truth behind the bunker community of Paradise and how Samantha \"Sinatra\" Redmond (Julianne Nicholson), the billionaire behind its construction, was maybe not being so truthful about what went down outside its walls.</p><p>Specifically, after a bit of the ol’ insurrection led by Xavier, he discovered that not only are there people alive outside Paradise, his wife – who <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/paradises-seventh-episode-is-the-most-upsetting-episode-of-tv-youll-watch-all-year\"><u>he thought died the day a super-volcano exploded</u></a>, causing a tsunami to wreck most of the world – is alive as well, and living in Atlanta. There’s a lot more that happened as the show jumped backwards in time to show how we got here, as well as moving the conspiracy plot forward in the present, but the most important bit of info to know is that the season ended with Sinatra on life support, Xavier exiting the bunker via a small airplane to go find his wife, and Cal (ostensibly the third lead of the show) still very much dead, though often popping up via flashback to give ghostly advice.</p><p>With the dual secrets of the premise and how the world ended out of the way, we’re in literal and figurative uncharted territory in Season 2. Granted, showrunner Dan Fogelman has a fair amount of post-apocalyptic TV shows and movies to pull from, as well as mystery box/flashback-heavy shows like Lost, which he picks and chooses from liberally as we explore more of the world outside as well as how life continues inside Paradise. But what characterizes the new season more than anything is that while Fogelman lays in new mysteries and new sci-fi concepts to replace the ones tied with a bow in Season 1, he also leans straight into his comfort zone: emotionally charged character studies.</p><section data-transform=\"quoteBox\">Showrunner Dan Fogelman has a fair amount of post-apocalyptic TV shows and movies to pull from.</section><p>The thing is that Paradise is an odd note on Fogelman’s resumé. He hasn’t shied away from more fantastical concepts in the past; he wrote Cars, Tangled, and even a draft of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. Most of the time, however, he’s been known for more grounded human fare like: Crazy, Stupid, Love; the late, lamented TV show, Pitch; and, most notably, This Is Us.</p><p>Paradise Season 2 – at least in its first half – might as well be called This Is The Last Of Us without the fungal zombies. Yes, they’re in a post-apocalypse that’s been devastated by climate change – though the show rarely says those words – but everybody is so . We’ve been trained time and again by shows like The Last of Us and particularly The Walking Dead to expect that every time you encounter a new community, they might seem good at first, but it will turn out that they’re eating people, or they’re fascists, or they’re just not prepared to survive the circumstances of their particular apocalypse.</p><p>While Fogelman plays with that, he seems far less interested in what makes a world fall apart than what helps build it back up again. To that end, the majority of the season also takes the form of the more focused flashback episodes from Season 1. There, we got the full-on flashback episode of “The Day,” which revealed how the world fell in pulse-pounding real time. Paradise Season 2 isn’t quite on par with that high watermark episode, but instead channels the feeling of an extended sequence in the finale, where we met a construction worker helping build the bunker and followed him as he befriended his crew, discovered things weren’t quite right, tried to stop the bunker from being built, and ultimately failed.</p><p>Season 2 takes the feeling of that extended sequence and runs with it, almost becoming a Paradise anthology-style series where each episode is done in one, only lightly connecting to the episode that came before, and often keeping our main characters off-screen for episodes at a time. Part of that is utility, given we’re now following multiple characters in multiple locations versus the more focused locale of “just” Paradise in the first season. But another part of it is that it allows Fogelman the space to spend time emotionally with the characters, particularly new cast members like Shailene Woodley’s lost Graceland tour guide, and Thomas Doherty’s mysterious Link (yes, named after the Legend of Zelda character). We don’t know those folks yet the same way we know Xavier, Sinatra, and Cal, so while there might be some audience frustration about our Season 1 stars being in absentia for large chunks of episodes, when you’ve got good actors digging into meaty speeches and one-on-one scenes, you won’t really miss the folks you already know.</p><p>But don’t worry: Paradise falls back on a more conventional TV structure eventually. The level of restraint shown in the early part of the season is laudable, and particularly with Hulu dropping three episodes on premiere day, it should be less frustrating for fans of the series than if, say, you had to wait three to four weeks to find out what happened to Xavier, or what’s going on back in Paradise.</p><p>On that note, Sterling K. Brown continues to be the most ridiculously charming man on TV. While most of his arc falls under the heading of “I just want my wife back!” action heroes, and Brown’s chiseled muscles certainly make him convincing in the show’s infrequent but well-staged blockbuster action scenes, it’s Brown’s smile that makes viewers melt. Early on, there’s a swoon-worthy flashback to Xavier’s past that lets the actor flex all his rom-com muscles, and you will grin a goofy smile the entire time as Brown provides more raw romance power in a single scene than most movies can manage in their entire runtime. Other episodes let Brown flex his dramatic muscles as his hard-earned steely demeanor begins to melt thanks to Paradise’s Nice-pocalypse. And then other times, he just flexes his muscles, and when he does – hubba-hubba.</p><p>Nicholson also gets some substantial dramatic work this season, and though we may run out of rope eventually with the plotline that she’s been traumatized and motivated by the death of her son well before the end of the world, we haven’t gotten there yet. Nicholson is a master of the locked-up microexpression performance, and her sympathetic bad guy persona lets her play that to the hilt.</p><p>As for other members of the cast, Nicole Brydon Bloom continues to be a delight as the Wii-obsessed psycho secret service agent, Jane Driscoll; she bubbled in the background in Season 1, but the show knows what they’ve got with her unhinged performance and lets her freak flag fly in Season 2. And while he has less to do now that we know how he was murdered as well as his role in ending/saving the world, Marsden’s Cal is still incredibly engrossing in every flashback appearance. His folksy “I’m just a dumb, young guy who happens to be President” attitude belies a sharp judge of character, and an episode late in the season gives Marsden a stellar monologue. Cal may be back essentially because the show likes working with Marsden, but we  watching Marsden, so they get a pass here.</p><section data-transform=\"quoteBox\">It’s possible we could get something very timely, or we could end up diving completely into something less relatable and more fantastical.</section><p>If Paradise Season 2 excels when it’s working with dramatic, human scenes, it struggles a bit with the sci-fi elements, which become more outlandish and farther from reality in Season 2. While this was never an expressly political show despite opening with the murder of the President, the idea of billionaires abandoning Earth to a climate disaster they caused is very present in our reality. The second season moves further away from that with new sci-fi ideas that are far less based in reality and seem more focused on the longevity of the series than reflecting something happening outside our window. It’s unfortunate, because it moves the show from pressing sci-fi warning to something more akin to naive fantasy. Granted, naive fantasy is where Fogelman lives, even when his shows are ostensibly set in the real world versus some time in the near future. But depending on how the finale pans out – there are big secrets being held back – it’s possible we could get something very timely, or we could end up diving completely into something less relatable and more fantastical.</p><p>Even given that, and with some of the jankier decisions on the part of our characters later in the season – choosing niceness, all apologies to Fogelman, is not  the answer when the stakes are this high – Paradise remains engrossing pulp fun. There’s a lot resting on Brown’s prodigious muscles to keep this show going, but thanks to a game supporting cast and plenty of twists, turns, and flashbacks that will tug on your heartstrings, the Hulu hit may be  paradise, but it’ll keep you knocking on Heaven’s door, begging for more episodes.</p>",

The controller was also unique, with a layout that GameCube-first games could take full advantage of – and caused some headaches for ported multi-platform games even today. Enter <a href=\"https://retrofighters.com/our-collection/battlergc-pro/\"></a> and the wireless <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fighters-BattlerGC-GameCube-Controller-Gaming-Console/dp/B0DNHFLD2P\"></a>, a $65 gamepad that stays true to that iconic controller layout, while providing a more modern and familiar foundation. </p><p>This just might be the best way to play a variety of GameCube games on your Nintendo Switch or Switch 2, GameCube, Wii, or PC. And thanks to some of its improvements, it might even be a go-to for some non-GameCube games as well.</p><h2><strong>Retro Fighters BattlerGC Pro – Options and Design</strong></h2><p>The RetroFighters BattlerGC Pro is available in Purple (Indigo) and Black (Jet Black) colorways to match two of the original GameCube console variations, as well as Glacier, which is like a transparent Purple. In the box is the controller, GameCube controller port wireless dongle, USB-A wireless dongle, 5.8-foot USB-C to USB-A charging and data cable, a Retro Fighters BattlerGC Pro pin, and a Quick Start Instruction Manual. The wireless dongles match the controller.</p><p>The BattlerGC Pro is compatible out of the box with Nintendo GameCube (including Nintendo Game Boy Player), Switch, Switch 2, and Windows and Mac computer platforms, as well as Android and iOS devices if you use Bluetooth. Wii console owners need a model with GameCube controller ports, while Wii U owners need the Nintendo Wii U GameCube Controller Adapter (a popular option for Super Smash Bros. for Wii U), or an equivalent.</p><a href=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/13/02-2025-08-25-11-44-59-1770986170407.jpg\"><img src=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/13/02-2025-08-25-11-44-59-1770986170407.jpg\" title=\"null\"></a><p>There are three connectivity options: wireless dongle, Bluetooth, or USB wired. Both the GameCube and USB-A wireless dongles use 2.4GHz, with the latter working on Switch series consoles and PC, as do the Bluetooth and USB wired connections.</p><p>As expected, the BattlerGC Pro mimics the unique layout of the GameCube's left analog stick, d-pad, c-stick (right analog stick), large green A button, smaller red B button, and curved medium-sized grey Y and X buttons that flank the opposite side of the B button. The GameCube controller also has a Z button on the upper right of the controller, which the Battler GC Pro marks as an R Shoulder button, as well as L and R triggers, which are now ZL and ZR.</p><a href=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/13/03-2025-08-25-11-46-13-1770986170408.jpg\"><img src=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/13/03-2025-08-25-11-46-13-1770986170408.jpg\" title=\"null\"></a><p>Unique to the BattlerGC Pro is an left shoulder button above ZL, and programmable P1 and P2 buttons on the rear of the handles. Instead of the GameCube controller's single center start/pause button, the BattlerGC Pro has a home/pairing button that's flanked by a minus button on the left and a plus button on the right. Both the plus and left shoulder buttons on the BattlerGC Pro act the same as the start/pause button when functioning as a GameCube controller.</p><a href=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/13/04-2025-08-25-11-46-51-1770986170408.jpg\"><img src=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/13/04-2025-08-25-11-46-51-1770986170408.jpg\" title=\"null\"></a><p>At the top of the BattlerGC Pro, between the L and R buttons, is a Nintendo Switch-compatible screenshot button and the USB-C port. On the rear, between the P1 and P2 buttons, is a Bluetooth/2.4Ghz switch and reset/turn off button. The reset/turn off button needs to be pressed each time before you change wireless connection modes with the Bluetooth/2.4 GHz switch.</p><a href=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/13/05-2025-08-25-11-47-26-1770986170407.jpg\"><img src=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/13/05-2025-08-25-11-47-26-1770986170407.jpg\" title=\"undefined\"></a><p>Four vertical LEDs between the d-pad and c-stick indicate whether the controller is player one through four, or if it's in Xinput, Dinput, or GameCube modes, as well as Android, iOS, or Windows and Mac Bluetooth modes. When charging the controller, these lights also indicate charge status.</p><h2><strong>Retro Fighters BattlerGC Pro – Configuration and Performance</strong></h2><p>Although the controller is compatible with a range of platforms, the only way to update the firmware (using <a href=\"https://retrofighters.com/our-collection/battlergc-pro/\"><u>Retro Fighters' firmware update instructions</u></a>) is using a Windows PC over USB. Unfortunately, there's no way to check what firmware version your controller is on, so you just need to trust that the executable will do its job, as it provides only a simple confirmation pop-up at completion. I had no issues applying the update from my Windows 11 desktop, but I'd prefer a more descriptive process, as well as more ways to update, particularly given Switch 2 connectivity is gated behind a recent firmware update.</p><p>As of firmware V1.4, there's still no way to connect to Nintendo Switch 2 consoles outside of Bluetooth. USB-A wireless dongle and USB wired modes are promised for the future, but it's a bummer that the one modern platform officially authorized to play GameCube games is limited to Bluetooth.</p><p>Outside of the limitations previously indicated, I had no issues with using the BattlerGC Pro on a GameCube, Wii, Android tablet, or my PC. Since I don't personally have Nintendo's famous Wavebird Wireless Controller for my GameCube, this is easily my preferred way to play on that console, particularly since those classic controllers lack a rumble feature. I have always liked, and continue to like, the original GameCube wired controllers, but there's something special about sitting back wire-free from a console that I've become spoiled by.</p><a href=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/13/06-2025-11-09-19-46-54-1770986170408.jpg\"><img src=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/13/06-2025-11-09-19-46-54-1770986170408.jpg\" title=\"null\"></a><p>With all of that said, I suspect most purchasers of this controller, like me, will mostly want to use it with the Nintendo Switch 2. At the moment, there are only a handful of suitable games available as part of <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/wikis/nintendo-switch-2/Nintendo_Switch_Online_Service_and_List_of_Games\">Nintendo Switch Online</a>: Chibi-Robo!, F-Zero GX, Luigi's Mansion, Soul Calibur II, Super Mario Strikers, and The Legend of Zelda: The Windwaker.</p><p>Each of the games played great with the controller, with a few notable exceptions. Because analog triggers aren't supported over Bluetooth, Luigi's Mansion (with its analog suction power) and F-Zero GX (with its analog sharp turns) suffered. While <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Gamecube/comments/1ftffvv/list_of_game_cube_games_that_use_the_analog/\"><u>fewer than two dozen GameCube games</u></a> actually make use of analog triggers, there are some notable standouts, making a future firmware update all but essential. Right now, for full functionality on the Switch 2, the only alternative is to use something like the aforementioned Wii U GameCube Controller Adapter and the GameCube controller port wireless dongle, which also smooths out any compatibility quirks when using certain GameCube emulators on PC.</p><p>When it does work properly on the Switch 2, however, the BattlerGC Pro is a delight. In a game like The Legend of Zelda: The Windwaker, for instance, it's particularly handy that the controller legend in the upper right corner of the screen, from labels to colors, actually matches the controller held in my hand.</p><a href=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/13/07-2025-11-09-19-47-49-1770986170407.jpg\"><img src=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/13/07-2025-11-09-19-47-49-1770986170407.jpg\" title=\"undefined\"></a><p>Speaking of in-hand feel, Retro Fighters got it right. The grips mold perfectly to my palms and fingers, with my middle fingers perfectly positioned to use the programmable P1 and P2 buttons. Trigger placement and performance are also excellent thanks to Kailh switches, with a nice click when bottomed out.</p><p>Love it or hate it, the left analog stick is very similar to the GameCube controller's small left analog stick. It's slightly rubberized with an octagonal gate that has a weird feel if you're not accustomed to it. Thanks to magnetic Hall Effect sensors, travel is smooth, and it shouldn't experience stick drift. The tiny c-stick is similarly authentic, for better or worse, and another limiting factor for wider play, particularly with games that make heavy use of a right analog stick.</p><p>Outside of the shell and extra features, the biggest differentiator between the BattlerGC Pro and an original GameCube controller is the d-pad. The tiny plus-style d-ad on the GameCube controller had few fans, but I suspect the d-pad on the BattlerGC Pro will become a community favorite. I love its large size, precision, and feel, with a satisfying click at each position. Particularly for retro-style games, this d-pad is a winner and really adds to the value of the controller.</p><p>Battery life is unspectacular. You get around 10 hours or so from a 2.5-hour charge. As always, battery life varies depending upon usage and how often and how intensely rumble is used and set.</p><p><em>Bill Loguidice is a contributing freelancer for IGN specializing in video game and computer hardware and accessories.

It makes them one of the most flexible <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gaming-headset\">headphones</a> I've ever tried, and I'd be surprised if they don't start a trend. </p><p>They're packed with bonus features including spatial audio, head tracking, dual connection to your phone and PC, and they've even got a gaming mode to reduce latency (with admittedly mixed results). But while their audio is impressive in both modes, and their customization rich, their in-ear configuration is a letdown thanks to meagre active noise cancellation (ANC) and a below-par battery. Is it enough to ruin these $180/£180 buds?</p><h2><strong>Soundcore AeroFit 2 Pro: Comfortable, well-built earbuds</strong></h2><p>The thick anchor portion of the AeroFit 2 Pro buds hugs the bottom of your ear and I never felt like they'd fall off, even when I went running in the rain (which you can do thanks to the IP55 rating). The loop sat snugly on my ears without ever chafing or irritating me.</p><p>The case is a lot larger than most, but slim enough to sit in my pocket without issue. The buds feel light and particularly comfortable in open-ear mode. I could almost forget I was wearing buds and, as somebody who's used to in-ear buds with transparency modes, it was a real joy to keep my ear canals clear. I could, for example, play on my Steam Deck while still hearing everything my wife was saying, and when I was listening to a podcast outside I was fully aware of what was happening around me.</p><p>When I twisted the pivot to slide the tips into my ear they felt  less comfortable, probably because there's no flexible rubber on those tips. But they're slim, which means they won't dig into your ear, and I could still wear them for hours at a time. Only once, after about three hours, did I feel the urge to take a break.</p><p>Twisting between open-ear and in-ear modes is easy, with a satisfying click between each of the five increments. The hinge felt sturdy and tight even when I repeatedly yanked them back and forward more aggressively than any normal person would.</p><p>The flexibility of the buds' main stem does mean their tips wiggle towards and away from your head when you press them. That means that hitting the physical button – no touch controls here – on either side requires a bit of force because you need to press the buds against your ear before the button actuates. But that's a minor gripe, and the controls worked every time I tried them.</p><h2><strong>Soundcore AeroFit 2 Pro: Reliable, customizable sound with a dedicated gaming mode</strong></h2><p>The AeroFit 2 Pro earbuds don't sound as rich as top-of-the-market earbuds, but I was generally impressed with the audio quality. They're clear and vibrant in every configuration – provided you're happy to fiddle with the settings a bit.</p><p>The sound smartly adjusts as you twist them from open-ear to in-ear. In open ear mode with the default EQ the audio lacks detail and the bass is slightly artificial but the important stuff – including vocals in both podcasts and music – is loud and punchy. When you twist to the in-ear mode, the sound gets far more detailed: I could pick out every note on every instrument in The Verve's Bitter Sweet Symphony.</p><p>Soundcore Signature and a separate \"Balanced\" EQ will sound decent whatever you listen to, but rarely amazing. Soundcore Signature, for example, muffled the vocals in Bitter Sweet Symphony – whereas in Elton John's Rocketman, they were vibrant. Everything also sounded a little washed with ANC turned on, so I switched it off when possible.</p><p>You have to be prepared to dig into the settings to get a sound that works for you. Thankfully, there are of options including 22 EQ presets and you can set separate, custom EQs for in-ear and open-ear modes. J. Cole's 03' Adolescence worked much better with the Hip Hop EQ, brining out the detail in his vocals and the bass in the beat. Bitter Sweet Symphony sounded, strangely, most balanced and lively on the Jazz preset.</p><p>A dedicated gaming mode is what initially drew me to these buds. Soundcore says it reduces latency and emphasizes vocals and footsteps – I could still feel the lag between my inputs and game sounds on my laptop, Steam Deck, and Switch 2, and they're nowhere near as good as dedicated earbuds with 2.4GHz wireless connection (to be expected, of course). </p><p>You do get clear directionality and detail, so when I played <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/games/arc-raiders\">Arc Raiders</a> I could always tell where my enemies were coming from.</p><p>For more casual, story-driven games, I found gaming mode more of a hindrance than a help. In <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/games/disco-elysium\">Disco Elysium</a>, voices sounded blurry and blown-out, as if the actors were speaking too close to their microphones. Turning gaming mode off and fiddling with other settings gave me the sound I wanted.</p><p>It means gaming mode feels, ultimately, pointless. The noticeable lag means you're unlikely to use these buds in a multiplayer shooter – and casual games sound better without it.</p><p>But I do appreciate its inclusion, and it fits the idea that these buds offer tons of bonus features that you might not expect. </p><p>They support the LDAC Bluetooth codec, which works with newer Android devices and gives you noticeable more detailed sound. You can adjust the left-right audio balance – useful if your hearing isn't equal in both ears. They connect seamlessly to two devices at once, such as your phone and laptop, and smartly switch back and forth. Spatial Audio gives you a wider soundscape at the cost of detail, and has both a movie and music mode (I enjoyed watching films this way). And you can even turn on head tracking so the sound moves about as you tilt your head, which feels novel.</p><h2><strong>Soundcore AeroFit 2 Pro: Weak ANC and below-par battery </strong></h2><p>It's a shame that one of the real selling points – open ear buds that you can transform for ANC – is one of its big weaknesses.</p><p>Without a snug fit and a full seal around your ear, background noise is bound to seep through. The ANC definitely blocks some noise but it's weaker than almost any dedicated in-ear bud I've tested. It faltered on the three tests I always use: at the gym I could still hear the public music as well as my own, in a cafe I could still hear background conversations, and on the London Underground the rumble of the tube made it difficult to hear podcasts. </p><p>Whether it's sufficient for you depends on what sort of noise you'll need to block out. If you just want to filter out day-to-day sounds, they're fine, but if you work in a particularly noisy environment, I'd look elsewhere.</p><p>ANC, as I've mentioned, washes out the audio a bit, and it also cuts battery life from about seven hours to five. Seven hours without ANC is perfectly fine, but five hours with ANC is lower than I'd hope for at this price. They do, thankfully, charge quickly and wirelessly and the case holds a lot of charge, so you should get around 30 hours in total before you need to plug them in. That's not bad at all.</p><p><em>Samuel is a freelance reporter and editor specializing in longform journalism and hardware reviews.

That much is clear from these last few episodes. <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/the-pitt-season-2-episode-5-1100-am-review-recap\"><u>Episode 5 was the best chapter up to that point</u></a>, while <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/the-pitt-season-2-episode-6-1200-pm-review-recap\"></a> from some frustrating character moments and an emphasis on relatively less interesting medical cases. But now the series bounces back again in Episode 7, as things really start to heat up in the Pittsburgh Trauma Medical Center. Literally.</p><p>If last week’s crop of medical cases proved slightly underwhelming, that’s not at all a problem here. Thankfully, we’ve already moved on from that inexplicably mundane motorcycle accident. Instead, the show pivots to a handful of new cases and provides newfound momentum with several ongoing subplots. The season is nearing the midway point now, and the tone is definitely shifting in a darker and more frantic direction.</p><p>Perhaps most notably, we see Dana (Katherine LaNasa) and Emma (Laëtitia Hollard) take charge of a sexual assault case. These scenes are hard to watch, and they do a great job of conveying the dehumanizing ordeal involved in being poked, prodded, and tested in the aftermath of a terrible trauma. LaNasa really shines throughout, radiating warmth, compassion, and experience. But as things start to go off the rails at the end, we see the terrible toll this work takes on her. LaNasa really is one of the show’s MVPs.  </p><p>Elsewhere in the ER, we got the surprise return of Shawn Hatosy’s Dr. Jack Abbot, who, it seems, doesn’t get enough thrills in his night job. More Jack is always a good thing for the series. The fight to save the life of the injured SWAT member adds a welcome sense of urgency to the episode. And in the aftermath, we get to savor several memorable scenes between Hatosy and other cast members. The moment of bonding between Jack and Samira (Supriya Ganesh) is especially enjoyable (if a bit heartbreaking, given the sad turn in the case of her diabetic patient). </p><p>And if the series has been a little slow to advance the plight of Dr. Langdon (Frank Ball), that finally changes here as Langdon and Robby (Noah Wyle) finally have their big confrontation. It’s very brief, sure, but Robby clearly says everything that he feels needs to be said. That brief exchange leaves Langdon crushed and at loose ends. Once again, it’s impressive just how differently Ball is playing his character in Season 2. The swagger is gone, replaced by a weary man trying and failing to make amends for his misdeeds. I can’t wait to see where Langdon’s story arc progresses in the back half of the season.</p><p>This is all pretty heavy material, but the show doesn’t entirely lose sight of the humor that characterized earlier episodes. The focus on Javadi’s (Shabana Azeez) family strife continues to amuse. The poor kid never stood a chance with parents like these. And the show continues to make a meal out of Santos (Isa Briones) and her futile quest to get her charts in order. It even turns out that she has a pretty decent singing voice. Though it should be noted, we also get some newfound insight into her personal struggles and learn that she has a habit of self-harm. Santos has become one of the show’s most well-rounded and compelling characters in Season 2.</p><p>Finally, Episode 7 wraps up with the big reveal about what’s been going on with the mysterious Code Black. It seems multiple hospitals are being targeted with ransomware attacks, forcing The Pitt to not only accept even more patients, but to go offline in the process. If the tension wasn’t already soaring along with the heat, that’ll certainly do it. The season’s slow start is making way for a very interesting and high-stakes struggle to survive the holiday onslaught.</p>",

Its pinpoint sensor, fast polling rate, low click latency and marathon battery life match those of more expensive devices, and make me feel like I'm using a pro-level <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/best-lightweight-gaming-mouse\">lightweight FPS mouse</a>. But that left click is, under certain conditions, jarring, hollow, tinny, and unpleasant. </p><p>I did eventually make it work for me – which I'll explain later – but it points to niggling build quality issues with an otherwise excellent mouse. </p><p>Let's get the bad stuff out of the way before focusing on the pile of good stuff.</p><p>The left and right mouse clicks are absolutely fine, provided you touch the buttons towards the front. They feel relatively clean and crisp, and spammable if needed. No complaints. But if your fingertips stray down the mouse towards the middle of the buttons – which they can easily do in fingertip or claw grips – the clicks are awful. They sound echoey, feel loose and sloppy, and vibrate against your fingers. </p><p>With most mice, when you click the bottom of the button, the whole button will move as one. When you press the bottom of the buttons on the M3 Mini, the top doesn't click in, only the bottom does. It feels almost like those buttons are on a see-saw, with a pivot in the middle, rather than moving as a solid piece.</p><a href=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/26/20260121-114748-1769440082842.jpg\"><img src=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/26/20260121-114748-1769440082842.jpg\" title=\"undefined\"></a><p>It's not the only issue I had with the M3 Mini. The side buttons feel pretty solid but the casing around them doesn't. If you squeeze the sides of the mouse they'll start to flex, and if you squeeze you can actually activate the side click without touching a button.</p><p>Both of these problems sound alarming but neither ruined the mouse for me. In reality, you're never going to squeeze the mouse hard enough to flex the sides, and it felt sturdy and safe in my hand.</p><p>The mouse button is the more serious issue, and I had to adapt to get around it, training my hand to stay forward. In claw grip, I just bent my fingers a little less than normal to ensure the tips stayed in the right position. And when I got used to it this mouse was pleasant to use, mostly because of its light weight and comfortable shape. </p><h2><strong>A Light, Comfortable Shell</strong></h2><p>At 55g, the M3 Mini is a genuinely lightweight mouse. Lighter doesn't mean better, of course: the most important thing is how it feels in the hand and how smoothly it glides across your mousepad. The feet on the M3 Mini aren't the slickest, and have more friction than higher-end mice, but because of the mouse's weight I never felt like I was having to drag it across my pad. The ride was effortless.</p><p>It certainly helps that its hourglass-style shape and curved base fills my hand surprisingly well for a smaller mouse, to the point where I could use it in a full palm grip – where your whole palm grabs the bottom of the mouse – with zero issues. Switching between fingertip, claw, and palm grips felt natural, and my fingers and hand always found a comfortable place to rest. </p><a href=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/26/20260121-114901-1769440082843.jpg\"><img src=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/26/20260121-114901-1769440082843.jpg\" title=\"undefined\"></a><p>If you have particularly large hands (mine are slightly larger than average), you might struggle to find a stable position on its slim body, but it'll work well for everyone else.</p><p>The textured patterns on both sides of the mouse helped me grip it securely. If you run your thumb along them it feels scratchy, but when I was actually using the mouse I never felt any movement or irritation. The chalky plastic coating was easy to hold onto for hours at a time.</p><h2><strong>Fast Sensor and Long Battery Life</strong></h2><p>There are four variations of the M3 Mini, each with different combos of sensors and max polling rates, which is the number of times the mouse reports its position to your PC. They range in price from $40 to $70, although the top-of-the-range model that I tested is often available cheaper (it's close to $60 as I write this).</p><p>The ones you want to consider are the PixArt 3395 sensors (either 1000Hz or 4000Hz polling rate), or the 3950 sensor 8000Hz variant. Those two sensors are both widely used and will perform well no matter what you throw at them. I tested the 8K variant in a variety of genres– <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/games/arc-raiders\">Arc Raiders</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/games/fortnite\">Fortnite</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/games/counter-strike-2\">CS2</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii\">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> – and was very happy. Quick flick-shots hit their mark and slower tracking felt smooth, with no noticeable hitches or stuttering.</p><p>Whether it's worth paying more for 4K or 8K polling rate is personal preference. It should make tracking less jittery and more responsive, but to feel a difference above 1000Hz you'll need a decent CPU-GPU combo and a high refresh-rate monitor – even then, not everyone thinks it's worth it. I can feel a benefit as I move from 1K to 4K, but I think 8K is overkill.</p><a href=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/26/20260121-115024-1769440082843.jpg\"><img src=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/26/20260121-115024-1769440082843.jpg\" title=\"undefined\"></a><p>Base your choice on the price and your budget: personally, I think it's worth stumping up the extra $20 for the best sensor but if you don't want to, you'll still get solid performance.</p><p>I like how simple Keychron makes it to switch between polling rates and DPI. Both have a dedicated button on the bottom of the mouse, and both buttons have their own indicator LEDs so that you always know your current setting. As somebody who likes to switch regularly – I generally bump up my polling rate and lower my sensitivity as I move from work to gaming – I appreciated how streamlined it felt. There's also a switch to toggle between the fast 2.4Ghz wireless connection and Bluetooth.</p><p>If you opt for higher polling rates you'll sacrifice some battery life, but that's fine here because the M3 Mini lasts for ages. On the top two configurations, you should get 135+ hours at 1000Hz polling rate. Impressive. It runs out faster at higher polling rates, but I tested it on and off for a couple of weeks at various polling rates and only drained a third of the battery.</p><a href=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/26/20260121-115041-1769440082843.jpg\"><img src=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/26/20260121-115041-1769440082843.jpg\" title=\"undefined\"></a><p>The battery life on the 1K mouse variant is less impressive: Keychron says it'll last roughly 70 hours. It's another reason to pick the meatier specs.</p><p>Keychron's launcher software is browser-based and there's no offline version, which will rule this mouse out for some people – although, again, you can change polling rate and sensitivity just by clicking the buttons on the bottom. I personally prefer web-based software to installing a new program on my PC for every mouse, and I found Keychron's intuitive. Tweaking the basics such as polling rate and DPI is simple, and you get the advanced settings you'd hope for, including ripple control, angle snapping, motion sync and adjustable lift-off distance.</p><p><em>Samuel is a freelance reporter and editor specializing in longform journalism and hardware reviews.

While it doesn’t pack the same punch as the first-party <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-review\">Switch 2 Pro Controller</a>, the S10 makes for a solid second option for anyone willing to sacrifice ancillary stuff like Amiibo support. Plus, it comes with better triggers and a customizable d-pad.</p><p>EasySMX has made a big push into the third-party controller scene with one big claim: remote wakeup. It’s odd that Nintendo locked this basic, highly convenient feature behind the $80 Switch 2 Pro Controller or its even pricier counterpart, a pair of Joy-Con 2 controllers. This confusing change from the original Switch keeps just about every pro controller option from waking up the Switch 2 with the Home button. Even the official <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/13/nintendo-switch-pro-controller-review\">Switch 1 Pro Controller</a> falls short here, effectively paywalling what should be a universal, standard feature. Enter EasySMX with a somewhat awkward solution to the issue, promising remote wakeup with a strange workaround.</p><p>Per the instructions provided by EasySMX, I synced my shiny new controller, detached both Joy-Cons, and then reattached them within 20 seconds after the initial sync. After putting my console back into sleep mode and trying to wake it up again… I got nothing. A few frustrated tries later though, it did work. I haven’t had any issues since it clicked, aside from when I connected the controller to my PC and then went back to the Switch 2, but I just repeated the process without issue.</p><p>In motion, the controller itself is really comfortable, especially for anything that relies heavily on its two buttery-smooth sticks, with comfortable, textured grips that kind of remind me of the DualSense’s stick grips. I played the entirety of <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/once-upon-a-katamari-review\">Once Upon A Katamari</a>, which is controlled almost exclusively using both sticks, using the S10.</p><section data-transform=\"quoteBox\">The EasySMX S10 is a solid Switch 2 controller for most people, especially if you like low-profile buttons.</section><p>My only real gripe with the sticks extends to the rest of the controller’s face; it’s all too low-profile. The grip part of the stick, where it mushrooms out from the rest of the stick, is too close to the rest of the controller, considering the distance between each controller element. This gives a kind of claustrophobic feel to swapping between sticks, buttons, and the d-pad. Granted, my thumbs are a bit bigger than average, but I found myself accidentally bumping the stick when pressing up on the d-pad.</p><p>That flaw aside, this d-pad is great. Despite literally inventing the d-pad decades ago, Nintendo has repeatedly dropped the ball in recent iterations, with a design that often accidentally triggers a secondary input in an additional, adjacent direction. I can’t tell you how many games of Tetris 99 I’ve had to salvage because of an accidental input from Nintendo’s first-party Pro Controllers. The Switch 2 Pro Controller is a step in the right direction, but it’s not where I need it to be.</p><p>The S10 offers customization between a classic d-pad and a circular design similar to the one found on the current <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/all-xbox-controller-colors-in-order\">Xbox models</a>. I usually prefer the circular setup, but the traditional mode is a little more precise. Either way, it’s nice to have a choice.</p><p>The mechanical face buttons press with a satisfying little click like a mechanical keyboard would. They’re also pretty low-profile – which unfortunately isn’t my preference, because they give each press a kind of soft feeling that I can’t get behind. The triggers and bumpers, on the other hand, are much more comfortable and satisfying to press. They’re still low-profile like the first-party options, but this works much better for non-analog triggers than it does face buttons.</p><p>The grip buttons are the weakest link, though. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve accidentally pressed them just by gripping my controller tighter. This won’t be an issue for everyone, especially people with smaller hands and fingers, and it only became an issue when I had those buttons mapped to an input. Still, I wish there were a tighter gate to minimize accidental presses.</p><p><em>Charlie is a freelance contributor for IGN.

The first two episodes will premiere on ABC on Wednesday, February 25, and stream on Hulu on Thursday, February 26.</em></p><p>In an era where it seems easier to count the hit shows that haven’t received a big-budget streaming revival, it was inevitable that Scrubs would make its return. The original series is still beloved by fans, despite that <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/03/24/scrubs-season-9-review\">underwhelming final season</a> and its failed attempt to spin off into something new. Those fans needn’t worry about Season 10. The series immediately captures that old magic upon its return, even if it’s not all smooth sailing at Sacred Heart. </p><p>Original creator Bill Lawrence and stars Zach Braff, Sarah Chalke, and Donald Faison are all back for Season 10, which immediately rectifies the big problem with Season 9. There’s a strong argument to be made that Scrubs simply isn’t Scrubs without the core bromance between Braff’s Dr. John “J.D.” Dorian and Faison’s Dr. Christopher “Turkleton” Turk anchoring each and every episode. The new season wastes as little time as possible before reminding us of how fun these two are together. Their chemistry is just that good. </p><p>That’s what’s so immediately striking about the Scrubs revival. It’s as if it hasn’t been 16 years since the series’ cancellation. Sure, everyone has a few extra lines on their faces and a little more gray in their temples, but Braff, Chalke, and Faison have that same youthful energy and charm that characterized the show back in the day. Watching the first episode is like settling in with an old friend who doesn’t mind that you haven’t called or written for the past decade. It’s all good.</p><p>For anyone who adored the first eight seasons of the series, this is the epitome of sitcom comfort food. Even with a new showrunner in Aseem Batra, the new Scrubs clearly isn’t out to reinvent any wheels or blaze new trails for medical TV dramas. The series isn’t completely oblivious to the harsh realities of life in a modern American emergency hospital – <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/tv/the-pitt\">The Pitt</a> is right there if that’s more your speed – but that all takes a backseat to the camaraderie of the doctors and J.D.’s zany inner life. </p><p>Of course, a lot of time has passed, and not everything is like it was back in 2001. That’s where hardcore Scrubs fans may be in for a bit of an adjustment. Some of the series’ core supporting cast also return (most notably Judie Reyes as Turk’s other life partner, Nurse Carla Espinosa, and John C. McGinley as the fiery Dr. Perry Cox), but there are some notable gaps. Perhaps most head-scratching is the absence of Neil Flynn’s Janitor. Between that and the relative lack of focus on Dr. Cox in these first four episodes, the series struggles to fill the void when it comes to antagonists in J.D.’s life. It almost succeeds with the introduction of his new professional rival, Joel Kim Booster’s Dr. Eric Park, but here again, Dr. Park isn’t in the spotlight enough in these first four episodes. </p><p>Enter the new batch of medical interns. Sacred Heart is, after all, a teaching hospital at the end of the day, so it’s necessary to introduce a new batch of wide-eyed, ambitious doctors-in-training to take the place once filled by J.D. and friends. There’s certainly an appeal in watching that role reversal play out. But, on the other hand, the shadow of Season 9 still looms large, and there’s the all-important question of whether the newbies can hold their own against the old guard.</p><p>The initial verdict is… fine? None of these intern characters are particular standouts in these early episodes, but the show only gives the actors so much to work with. The characters aren’t necessarily shoved in our faces the way Season 9’s new cast was. Most of these interns have one distinguishing characteristic (the handsome one, the British one, the social media-obsessed one) and exist to play the straight people to J.D., Elliott, and Turk more outlandish doctors. Only by Episode 4 does it feel like they’re starting to develop more coherent personalities and foibles. </p><p>Luckily, the new season does find plenty of success with Vanessa Bayer’s Sibby, Sacred Heart’s new medical wellness director. Sibby is there to embody the changing culture that has cropped up since the heyday of the original series and put a hard kibosh on Cox’s withering rants and The Todd’s (Robert Maschio) rampant sexual harassment. Bayer gets ample room to shine in these four episodes and quickly emerges as the strongest of the show’s new ensemble cast. Also of note are Michael James Scott and X Mayo as a tag-team nurse duo who help fill the void left by Aloma Wright’s Nurse Laverne. </p>",

      "content": "<img src=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/19/crop-image-project-2-1771515719569.png\"><p>I’ve played all of the God of War video games, including that one with the Reject Your Child quick time event, and that crappy mobile game from back in the Bush Administration. I played at least one game I only half remember of the God of War card game. I was a Kratos main in PlayStation All-stars Battle Royale. I like the guy, is what I'm saying, as a sort of cathartic avatar of the Id taken to its very tragic limits in Greece, and as a clunky conversation starter about guilt and finding power in something other than grievances in Midgard. But I can’t recall ever wondering “I want to know more about pre-Ares Kratos’ teenage years.” And as an answer to a question I would probably never ask, Sons of Sparta is a pleasant character rehabilitation of a largely unlikable guy couched in a largely boring adventure about Kratos learning the value of responsibility.</p><p>It’s also a pretty mediocre metroidvania, clearly taking the form and function of these games but failing to meet the high bar set by the titans of the genre, let alone bringing anything novel to this specific experience. You’ll move through colorful locations, doing the kind of running, jumping, button pressing, object pushing, and monster slaying that will be second nature to your inner Belmont, but you’ll do so at a pace so slow that it makes the journey feel like aimless wandering, fighting through hordes of baddies with combat that tries too hard to be special but ends up crowded and cloying.</p><p>I found this young Kratos to be a well-meaning, earnest guy piously (maybe naively so) devoted to the gods and the stubborn defender of his younger brother, Deimos. These are better times for the pair, who have just been granted permission to leave Sparta in order to adventure through and protect the surrounding lands at their own leisure. The well-written banter between them, and the other young people living in the Spartan agoge, reveals the Kratos that could have been, a charismatic, duty-bound leader that is tough when necessary, but also introspective, open to learn, and most jarring of all, funny.</p><section data-transform=\"quoteBox\">Combat, for better and worse, was the most reliably compelling thing going on for a lot of the game. Kratos has a lot of offensive options but none that really resemble the God of War’s barbarism.</section><p>Even the brief moments of pre-Ares pledge adult Kratos in Sons of Sparta, who is telling his daughter the happenings of the game as a fable while she’s grounded, reveal a man who actually has capacity to love his wife and child in the present, and not just be consumed by rage because of their passing. They banter back and forth in the background as notable in-game events go down, and the way Calliope will cast doubt on the seemingly tall tales of her father, or follow up on moments that either seem contradictory or wrong was charming in the way The Prince attempting to recount his journey in The Sands of Time was.</p><p>Ultimately, these don’t really save the story from feeling dull and rote. Sons of Sparta is full of interesting characters that you meet after long stretches of not very interesting travel and exploration. The many locations that Kratos and his brother romp through, like the fiery foundry of Daedalus or the dense and spooky Veiled Bog, look good but there’s nothing all that special or memorable about them. A lot of them seem to be begging to tell the story of what got them to the state they're in, like a haunted Winery that is covered in a goop and being possessed by Grecian Ivan Ooze, or a farming village where all of the residents have been replaced by cultists. But Sons is content with just marching you through a place in service of one long goal, to find a missing student of the Agoge, without stopping to elaborate on any of these side stories. </p><p>The around 20 hours of my journey was a lot of me wishing I could know more about a cool place I was in, knowing the best I was going to get was a blurb in the lore compendium, checking off every single Metroidvania trope without really any hope of seeing much innovation on the concept. The only “new” idea Sons has about the genre is when the player can expect to gain the signature abilities these games are known for. There's no explicit right or wrong time to gain mechanics, of course, but I went about 10 hours before gaining the ability to drink a healing potion and got a double jump a few hours later, things you might expect to do at the beginning of similar titles. But you spend so much of the early parts of Sons of Sparta running such rudimentary obstacle courses that every time I gained something like the ability to sprint, I felt like I had to wrestle through a fugue state to give it a fair shake. </p><p>Combat, for better and worse, was the most reliably compelling thing going on for a lot of the game. Kratos has a lot of offensive options but none that really resemble the God of War’s barbarism. Armed with a spear and a shield, you'll mash a single attack string, poking and bashing enemies into submission. Normal attacks cause spirit orbs to float out of your targets, which fill your gauge that can be used to turn your blows into spirit attacks, doing less damage but generating health orbs and significantly more stun meter, which you want to build especially on stronger enemies as a stunned opponent is one that can be executed.</p><p>I immediately missed the attack paths of the other series’, that let you mix light and heavy attacks or control tempo with delay strings. Instead, you can equip different spear shafts that change your combo-enders, providing one big damage attack but very few of which stand out from one another outside of this. One adds a Brad Pitt-style leaping spear thrust that gives your combo a little more range, but I didn’t find fussing over the right last hit to be worth much.</p><p>Instead, the real effective ways to spice up your damage dealing comes from attaching different spear tips that add passive effects. They unlock active abilities as you upgrade them. Not all spear tips are made equal and there are clear stand outs, like one that extends your reach. The reach-extending one’s active ability made every attack hit twice for a brief period of time. These have a more dramatic effect on your playstyle than the shafts, but I rarely strayed away from this tip as it seemed to clearly be the most versatile. I didn’t find many opportunities to get the most out of some funkier ones like the poison tip or ice tip, which do damage over time and slow enemies, respectively, as they’re effects never gave me a clear enough advantage against tougher enemies that seemed just as dangerous under these conditions.</p><p>Pommels can be added to the bottom of the spear to give Kratos another active ability, these being more like special attacks that spend your spirit meter to do. The differences between these were more dramatic - one allows the spartan to deliver a flurry of thrusts in quick succession while another sends him marching, spear swinging in wide arcs around his body. I changed these up the most to adapt to challenges because each felt tailored to handling specific sorts of the threats. </p><p>The most dramatic offensive tools are those that come from the gifts of the god that Kratos and Deimos invite themselves to possess. These operate like spells that, mostly, give Kratos options he can’t get from his spear and shield - namely good ranged options like Apollo’s sling that lets you launch pellets of solid light at foes, or Hestia's shrub whose leaves toss bouncing flames. They also double as keys to specific sorts of locks that litter the vast world of Laconia, Apollo’s light can power specific generators and Hestia’s fire can burn away prickly bushes. But in combat, they are often your strongest and most restricted tool, limited by a magic gauge that can’t be refilled through your attacks like health and spirit can.</p><p>There’s quite a lot of ways to attack the enemies of Sparta, many little ways to modify these, and even more ways to grow and change these modifications through the upgrade crafting system. But so few of these options have remarkable gameplay consequences that incentivized me to explore past my early game habits. I didn’t even consider upgrading any of my spear tips past the level required to get their special abilities, and that was only just so I could see them in action. That isn’t to say the combat is easy, per say, but most of your most effective battle plan is to mash attack when able, after getting a safe moment or two to do so.</p><p>Enemies can be diligent and lethal, attacking often and in groups, requiring you to get pretty familiar with Kratos’ powerful defensive tools in order to survive. The parry is great for breaking up combos and putting stun damage on a foe, but it isn’t so strong that you autowin the skirmish after a successful swat, like some other games that might reward a good parry with a free execution. You still have to stay locked in, because the enemy will recover quickly to get back to the beating. Dodges, and the handful of follow up attacks that you can nail after, are necessities as well, and mixed together can make getting out of tougher binds feel rewarding. All of these actions can be modified or enhanced through equipment as well - shield rims can make counter attacks stronger or simply raise your armor and make you tougher to take down, for instance.</p><section data-transform=\"quoteBox\">Losing in scenarios where multiple enemies might hit you with different kinds of attacks at once always feels like whatever the Greek word is for bullshit.</section><p>Bad guys get a little too cute with the kinds of offense they can dish out, though. Most action games feature enemies who flash red to denote an unblockable attack, but Sons of Sparta can feature enemies with a whopping four different kinds of special attack conditions, modifying whether an attack can be blocked but not evaded, ones that guard break but can be parried, or ones that you can defend in no way shape or form outside of simply not being around when it happens. This maximalist approach to defensive Simon Says creates too many variables in combat with lots of foes, and losing in scenarios where multiple enemies might hit you with different kinds of attacks at once always feels like whatever the Greek word is for bullshit.</p><p>Boss fights turn the screen filling attack machine up to 10, which is definitely a change of pace They don’t start getting tricky until about the last third of the adventure, but those baddies make you earn through extended chains of pattern recognition and reflex checking bullet storms. The easier ones in the earlier in the game can be more disappointing on the difficulty side, but what all bosses share is that they further remove the opportunity to take advantage of many of your offensive tools, since they seem to be largely immune to status effects and don’t have stun bars. </p>",

      "content": "<img src=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/18/starfleet-academy-ep-7-thumb-1771456606605.jpg\"><p>After last week’s adventure – and tragedy – <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/star-trek-starfleet-academy-episode-6-review-recap-return-to-the-miyazaki\"></a>, Starfleet Academy slows down for what we once would’ve called a <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/article/what-is-a-bottle-episode-meaning.html\"></a> Of course, these days the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7j6wNnlSpA\"></a> that allows for the creation of virtually any setting or backdrop means that even a bottle episode can take place on some crazy alien landscape, even if the whole idea of such an episode is to save money and production time (often to make up for a bigger, costlier segment like last week’s “Come, Let's Away”).</p><p>So in “Ko'Zeine” the focus is on two of the friendships among our main cast: that of Genesis (Bella Shepard) and Caleb (Sandro Rosta), and Darem (George Hawkins) and Jay-Den (Karim Diané). It’s the kind of story that is classic bottle episode, and the result is a nice if slight hour that plays off of some well-worn Trek tropes but also serves to further solidify how engaging this cast of young actors can be.</p><p>It’s the spring semester already, as the blooming cherry tree in the Academy makes clear, and that means it’s time for the school’s “all worlds break,” which has the cadets travelling to see their families or for some R&amp;R to locales all over the globe (and beyond) – none of which seem to be <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKyZKNNWngo\"></a> or <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/galleries/2015-01-12/the-25-best-resorts-in-mexico-readers-choice-2014\"></a>. Caleb however, as the boy with no home, has nowhere to go – or nowhere he wants to go, anyway – while Darem is called  home for an inconvenient, if quite heady, family matter.</p><p>When Darem is suddenly whisked away from the Academy and into an artificial wormhole by two apparent kidnappers, it’s cute how Jay-Den is like “whelp, there goes Ibiza” and jumps in to help his friend. That their destination winds up being the Sunset Moon of the Khionian Realm, where everything is rock and sand and red-hued, can only be seen as an homage to the original Star Trek “surprise wedding” episode, “Amok Time,” where Spock was forced to return to the similar setting of his homeworld of Vulcan in order to the tie the knot with his betrothed, T’Pring.</p><p>Because that’s why Darem has been called back to the Khionian Realm – to fulfill his obligation to marry his hometown sweetheart. Sure, it also means that he and his bride will become the new rulers of the realm, but what are ya gonna do?</p><section data-transform=\"quoteBox\">The antics of Genesis and Caleb aren’t particularly interesting or funny, but the reveal of why Genesis is willing to get into trouble is worth the wait.</section><p>It’s notable that both of these pairings were initially framed early in the season as being potential romantic partners (Genesis/Caleb, Darem/Jay-Den), but that this episode serves to strengthen their respective friendships instead. Yes, the spark of something is still there between Genesis and Caleb (and maybe Darem and Jay-Den too), but Caleb’s all wrapped up in his Tarima drama, and who can blame him after the events of last week? As for Darem and Jay-Den, obviously the Klingon and Kyle (Dale Whibley) – aka the nicest guy in the War College – are a thing now, and, you know, Darem needs good friends more than anything else anyway.</p><p>The antics of Genesis and Caleb aren’t particularly interesting or funny in this episode, but the reveal of why Genesis returned to the Academy during the break and is willing to get into trouble is worth the wait. The outsized sense of responsibility that both she and Darem feel is a weight that each must contend with in “Ko'Zeine,” and that their friends help them through these situations is gratifying. Again, the Darem/Jay-Den portion of the episode works better, not just in holding the viewer’s interest but also in terms of this thematic throughline. Jay-Den’s speech as best man/Ko'Zeine is ultimately what sparks Darem and his bride’s ability to break with tradition and allow Darem to leave for the life he actually wants to pursue, whereas Caleb is more just there to hold Genesis’ hand when the source of her insecurity is revealed.</p><p>But hey, even Caleb gets some nice moments this week as he tries to navigate the Tarima situation. The closing scene of him finally writing an honest letter to Tarima while the meteor shower kicks in outside is a great capper to an understated episode.</p><p>Questions and Notes from the Q Continuum:</p><ul><li>“You brought like four pairs of boots in here. You don’t even wear shoes!”</li><li>“Say hi to your sister.” Darem really is an asshole!</li><li>I just realized that the show is going to follow a “one year of school per season” format, which means these kids will graduate at the end of Season 4…? Is that how many years you go to the Academy?</li><li>Good thing Caleb clarified that it was Caleb “Mir” who was sending that initial message, just in case Tarima wasn’t clear on it.</li><li>It’s notable that it rains on Earth, or at least in San Francisco, as we know that Federation worlds were able to control the weather at least as far back as the 24th century. But you know, sometimes the rain is just cool, especially when you feel like brooding.</li><li>When all the cadets were beaming (I guess we still call it that?) off to their “all worlds” locations, I was reminded of Discovery’s introduction and constant use of personal transporters in the 32nd century, and boy am I grateful that Starfleet Academy has mostly avoided that gimmick.</li><li>If there’s a holotech rehab spa, and apparently there is since Sam (Kerrice Brooks) goes to one, does that mean that there are multiple sentient holographic individuals out there? I’m not talking about on Sam’s homeworld, but right here on Earth.</li><li>For some reason, Jay-Den’s <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/UniversalMonsters/comments/1d0icjw/in_frankenstein_1931_boris_karloff_wore_special/\"></a>-sized boots really stood out to me this week. (Maybe it was the skirt.)</li></ul>",

      "content": "<p>In order to keep the price at $649, there are obviously going to be some compromises, but the most immediate seems to be the packaging. The box that this monitor comes in is a pretty standard rectangular box, but once I opened it to take the display out, I was greeted by some of the flimsiest corrugated cardboard I’ve ever seen. I had to  take the monitor out of the box, worried that the packaging was going to tear. But, hey, once I got the display out, it was free of any kind of aesthetic damage, so that thin cardboard did its job. </p><p>Once I got the actual display out, I was impressed by the quality of the stand. Not only does it easily attach to the screen without any tools, but the base can rotate in any direction, and the mount itself will let the display also rotate in any direction. The point here, according to MSI, is to let people have a bit more power over their space, manipulating the stand to fit their setup. </p><p>That did make the process of actually attaching the stand a bit more laborious, as it was moving around as I was trying to set it up. But now that it’s on my desk, I’m a huge fan of how easy it is to move around, even if I just move it to get easier access to the ports on the back, which is huge, because they’re all facing down. </p><p>As for which ports you get, there’s one DisplayPort 1.4a and two HDMI 2.1 for video in. Then, there is a USB Type-B to allow USB passthrough for the 3 USB Type-A ports on the back. There’s also something I haven’t seen in a time – a USB Micro port, which is just used to update the firmware. </p><p>While the tech powering the display is new, the monitor doesn’t actually  all that new, and that mostly comes down to how thick it is. The display itself is nearly three inches thick, which is much thicker than most high-end monitors. A lot of this thickness is populated with vents, though, which is likely necessary to cool the added processor required for <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/what-is-gsync-pulsar-how-does-it-work\">G-Sync Pulsar</a>. </p><p>The bezels are reasonable, measuring in at about 0.7 inches by my own measurements, though there is a larger bezel on the bottom where you’ll find the logo. Turn the monitor around, however, and it’s very clear that this is a capital-G gaming monitor. Just like many other MSI devices, this monitor is emblazoned by a dragon on the back, and has a surprisingly modest RGB light strip on the opposite end. </p><p>On the bottom-left corner on the back, you’ll also find a little joystick that’ll let you interact with the OSD. By default, pushing it to the left will let you adjust the display mode, and pushing it to the right will swap inputs. Then, it’s up for brightness and down for volume – even though there is no built-in speaker. </p><p>Up on the top of the display is what looks like a webcam protruding from the monitor – but it’s no webcam. Instead, it’s a light sensor, which can track ambient light and color temperature to adjust the display accordingly. </p><p>When I used these features, it frequently made the display dim, but luckily it’s an opt-in feature. You just have to go into the OSD and go to “Ambient Adaptive Luminance” or “Ambient Adaptive Color” and enable them to have the MPG X27QRF X36 automatically adjust brightness or color, respectively. </p><a href=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/18/pulsar-1-1771439848607.jpg\"><img src=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/18/pulsar-1-1771439848607.jpg\" title=\"null\"></a><p>Without Pulsar, the MSI MPG 272QRFX36 would be a pretty standard high-refresh 1440p monitor. This is a decent IPS panel with a 360Hz refresh rate and 0.5ms GTG latency. However, my first impressions weren’t exactly glowing. </p><p>Right out of the box, the monitor was set to its “Eco” preset, which is great for conserving power, but also delivered an incredibly dim picture. Luckily, I was able to go into the OSD and set it to “Standard” which looks  better, and actually allowed me to do my tests. </p><p>Even though the 272QRF X36 is only rated for 500 nits of peak brightness, I tested the display with a colorimeter and found that it  peaked at 530 nits, which is not bad for a gaming monitor this fast. The display does struggle with color, though, only hitting 100% of the sRGB color gamut and 88% of the P3 gamut. That means it’s probably not going to be used for design work any time soon, but that’s really not what it’s meant for. </p><p>What actually matters is that the display looks  in games, while also being incredibly fast. Pairing it with an <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-review\">RTX 5080</a>, I was able to crank the settings in Black Ops 7, while also getting north of 360 fps, thanks to frame generation. Frame generation does limit some of the benefits of a high refresh display, namely latency, but it does look incredibly smooth when that many frames are being sent to the display. </p><p>The MPG 272QRF does compromise a little bit on image quality and color to get there, but even when I was playing Cyberpunk 2077, it was colorful enough to keep me engrossed in the game. However, when I swapped back to my usual OLED display, I immediately noticed the difference again. </p><h2>G-Sync Pulsar: Is It Worth It?</h2><p>But while the MSI MPG 272QRF X36 doesn’t have the best image quality in the world, the appeal is in the new G-Sync Pulsar tech that’s being debuted here. </p><p>Essentially, this technology uses a strobing backlight that’s tied to your current refresh rate to mitigate motion blur, making for a much smoother image when playing games at a high refresh rate. What makes this tech different from other backlight strobing or BFI (black frame insertion) methods in the past, is that it’s tied to a variable refresh rate, rather than the maximum refresh rate. </p><p>That means you get the benefits of VRR while also getting much less blur. Nvidia claims that playing on a Pulsar monitor is similar to playing at 1,000Hz, and while I wouldn’t go  far, I did feel a substantial difference, especially when playing competitive games. </p><p>For background, I mostly stick to turn-based RPGs or MMOs like World of Warcraft or Final Fantasy XIV. But over the weekend I spent some time playing <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-multiplayer-review\">Black Ops 7</a> and the Halo Master Chief Collection, and performed  better than I usually would. In the former, I went three matches in a row with a 3:1 ratio, where usually I’d be feeding the enemy team. </p><p>This isn’t exactly a scientific method of measuring the effect Pulsar had on my performance, as I could have just been lucky. But still, the games felt much smoother than they did before, and it did feel like it was making a difference, particularly to my ability to aim while moving. </p><p>Even with the lackluster image quality, if I didn’t need to have a 4K display for work, I’d buy this monitor to use as my daily driver. As long as you have a<a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/best-amd-graphics-cards\"> graphics card</a> that’s powerful enough to run a 1440p display at 360Hz, this Pulsar display is worth your attention, especially if you play a lot of competitive games.</p><p>It’s also important to keep in mind that this isn’t the only G-Sync Pulsar Monitor out there right now. The Asus ROG Strix XG27AQNGV and the AOC Agon Pro AG276QSG2 also support the new technology. And while I haven’t tested those monitors quite yet, if the Pulsar implementation is anything like it is on the MPG 272QRF X36, they’re worth a look. I’ll definitely be trying to get them in the lab to see what they can do. </p><p><em>Jackie Thomas is the Hardware and Buying Guides Editor at IGN and the PC components queen.

      "content": "<h2>Nice to Hold, but the D-Pad Gets Short Shrift</h2><p>The Afterglow Wave is a very comfortable gamepad that feels a lot like holding a <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/13/nintendo-switch-pro-controller-review\">Switch Pro controller</a>. It’s weighty without feeling heavy, with all the buttons comfortably in reach of my thumbs and fingers. Button feel is a little inconsistent throughout, though; the shoulder buttons feel about right to me, but the face buttons are stiff and, along with the grip-mounted back buttons, are very clicky and noisy. The d-pad feels about right, although it had some issues that I’ll get to shortly.</p><p>Speaking of the analog sticks, they feel very much like what they are: TMR sticks. Like many other TMR and Hall Effect sticks, they give easily and smoothly, but spring back to the center quickly and accurately. They feel very nice – although I prefer a little more resistance, especially in games that require very precise movement. If you’re familiar with this kind of stick, you probably already know whether you like that that dynamic or not.</p><a href=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/30/afterglow-wave-front-1769792296598.jpg\"><img src=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/30/afterglow-wave-front-1769792296598.jpg\" title=\"undefined\"></a><p>I am not a fan of the caps on the analog sticks. They’re concave, with rimmed edges that are sharp enough I could feel them dragging over the ridges of my fingertips, which is my own personal  nails-on-a-chalkboard. That said, the cupped design helped keep my thumbs on the sticks when they were inside the depression. But with certain motions, I tend to roll the outside of the cap around my thumb – and in those cases, the sticks slipped more often than the <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-review\">Switch 2 Pro controller</a>. Otherwise, they were responsive and sensitive, in a good way.</p><p>The in-game experience varied depending on the games I played. In <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/games/tetris-99\">Tetris 99</a>, the Afterglow Wave’s d-pad was almost as bad as those of Nintendo’s Pro controllers. I didn’t find myself accidentally hard-dropping tetrominos quite as often as with Nintendo’s gamepads, but occasionally, the d-pad seemed to bounce back if I let go of a direction quickly, causing them to shift the opposite direction one square, making me to place a tetromino in the wrong spot. In <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-prime-remastered\">Metroid Prime Remastered</a>, the motion controls worked well, but felt just a bit too sensitive, transmitting micro-movements to the screen that the Switch 2 Pro controller seems to ignore. That could be a good thing to some, but for me, it was a bit dizzying and unpleasant. </p><p>On the other hand, the analog sticks were plenty responsive in F-Zero X for the N64 and F-Zero GX for the GameCube, both played in their respective <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/wikis/nintendo-switch-2/Nintendo_Switch_Online_Service_and_List_of_Games\">Nintendo Switch Online apps</a>. Being able to twitchily turn in those games is paramount, so that was a bit of good news. Control stayed tight and I didn’t notice any change in delay even when I played from about 30 feet away, which is Turtle Beach’s stated wireless range for these controllers. I don’t know who is playing that far away from their TV, but hey, it’s nice to have options.</p><h2>Weird Design Choices and Missing Features</h2><p>One thing that drove me nuts throughout testing was the placement of the home and capture buttons – for some reason, they’re on the outside of the plus and minus buttons. (In contrast, they’re in the middle on the Switch 2 Pro controller.) This means that every third time I tried to pause the game, I went to the home screen instead. Sure, that effectively accomplishes the same thing, but it’s jarring and bad! I’d love to be able to remap them, but this controller isn’t remappable via the Switch 2’s interface. </p><p>That’s also annoying because it means you can’t assign the back buttons that way; instead, you do it by holding down the triangle-shaped button on the bottom front edge, then tapping the back button you want to map to, then pressing the button you’d like to assign to it. The Afterglow Wave also lacks rumble, which I wouldn’t mind in isolation, but here is another bit of straw on this controller’s shaky back.</p><p>This controller’s biggest problem is absolutely that it doesn’t wake the Switch 2. In my book, that automatically takes it out of the running to be a cheaper Pro controller alternative – I’ve lived in a world where I can turn on my game consoles from my couch for 20 years now, and I’m not going back. </p><a href=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/30/afterglow-wave-close-up-1769792296598.jpg\"><img src=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/30/afterglow-wave-close-up-1769792296598.jpg\" title=\"undefined\"></a><p>Maybe the price works if you dig the controller’s RGB schtick. The colored LEDs surrounding the analog sticks and lurking beneath the wavy lines etched into the face can show static colors of your choosing, or effects like a slowly-morphing rainbow. One effect sees them react to the movement of your analog sticks by cycling through colors. It’s nice, I suppose, although I’m never really looking at the controller while I’m playing. Still, the lights do make it easy to find in a dark room.</p><p>At the end of the day, am I mad at the Afterglow Wave? Not really; it’s a fine controller to have around the house. But the price is a huge sticking point that I just can’t get past. For $65, I can almost buy three  <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/9gXBYP\"></a>, a budget option that can still wake the Switch 2. Or I could pick up almost one full 8bitdo <a href=\"https://zdcs.link/ak1LYn\"><u>Ultimate 2 Bluetooth Controller</u></a>, which also wakes the system, is remappable (via an 8bitdo app), and comes with a nice charging cradle. I can’t directly vouch for either since I haven’t used them, but I can say that the previous 8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth Controller, which is one of <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-2-controllers\"><u>IGN’s top picks for the Switch 2</u></a>, has also been one of my favorite controllers since I bought it a couple of years ago. Assuming the Ultimate 2 follows in its footsteps, I’m sure it’s great.</p><p><em>Wes is a freelance writer (Freelance Wes, they call him) who has covered technology, gaming, and entertainment steadily since 2020 at Gizmodo, Tom's Hardware, Hardcore Gamer, and most recently, The Verge.

As a lifelong Elvis fan, this is the closest I’ll ever get to what it must have been like to see him perform live; I would recommend seeing the film in IMAX for the maximum you-are-there effect.</p><p>For EPiC, Luhrmann and editor-executive producer Jonathan Redmond assembled and painstakingly restored once-lost footage (over 50 hours worth) from the past concert films <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/movies/elvis-thats-the-way-it-is\"><u>Elvis: That’s the Way It Is</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/movies/elvis-on-tour\"></a>, and strategically utilized soundbites from a wide swath of archival interviews and live albums to allow Elvis to narrate his own story. </p><p>That so many different rights holders cooperated to help this film see the light of day is a small entertainment industry miracle, and I assume if Baz’s Elvis biopic had flopped at the box office, EPiC would never have happened. Unsurprisingly, EPiC is a companion piece to that biopic and owes much of its aesthetic style and narrative flow to that film, from how it frames Elvis’ story, to the same remixes and rearrangements of his songs used in the 2022 film, to even using the same spangled, gaudy credits design. One notable difference, however: NEON is the distributor of EPiC, while 2022’s Elvis was a Warner Bros. release.</p><section data-transform=\"quoteBox\">You don’t have to be an Elvis fan to watch this film and be amazed at how much Presley delivered as a showman.</section><p>One probably shouldn’t have expected Luhrmann to make a standard concert documentary, as the director added several ostentatious stylistic flourishes throughout, like wildly crosscutting between several entirely different Elvis performances of the same song to create some truly exhilarating musical sequences; the big standout examples are “Polk Salad Annie” and “Burning Love.”</p><p>You don’t have to be an Elvis fan to watch this film and be amazed at how much Presley delivered as a showman. He leaves everything on the stage here. One of the final images is of him exiting the stage and getting into an elevator, drenched in sweat and absolutely spent. His dedication to his craft and to entertaining his audience is on full display throughout EPiC, whether it’s directing his band, or his humorous, warm exchanges with fans in the crowd; he’s so thirsty at one point that he just reaches down and drinks someone’s cocktail. </p><p>EPiC shows Elvis in his absolute prime, vital and full of life. It’s sad and stunning to realize he’d become a bloated caricature of himself and die just a few years after this footage was taken. And since EPiC has Elvis telling his own story, he only reveals to us his  self. We obviously don’t get any deep, dark secrets coming from the man himself; don’t expect him to spill any tea about his relationship with his then-wife, <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/priscilla-review\"></a>, or any of his other love interests. As for Elvis’ substance abuse, the closest EPiC comes to acknowledging it is when he cracks a joke about morphine. </p><p>But viewers will learn a tremendous amount about his love of all styles of music, witness how he crafted a live show, and see him interact – albeit briefly – with other celebs and music artists such as Sammy Davis Jr., Cary Grant, and Clyde McPhatter (<a href=\"https://community.pandora.com/t5/Creators-Blog/Celebrating-The-Black-Artists-Who-Shaped-Elvis-Presley/ba-p/175478\"><u>who was a huge influence on Elvis</u></a>).</p>",

(Just listen to that guy scream, clawing at the dirt, as he’s pulled into the titular cavern of horrors by one of the horrible hog-things!)</p><p>Creator Genndy Tartakovsky has said that one of his mission statements with his projects is <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/an-orange-alien-girl-a-blue-man-and-a-cute-creature-primals-creator-reveals-the-aborted-season-3-ideas-he-had-for-an-anthology-version-of-the-series\"><u>no blue skies, no green grass, “nothing normal,”</u></a> and we see that in action here as the camera cuts to an unnatural blood-red moon before tilting down to our heroes. What a band this group is, now that all of the Red Shirts who had joined Mira’s search party are dead (I still miss those last two looney tunes in particular): We’ve got the wise warrior woman, a smart-as-hell T. rex, her adorable cubs, and a zombie with a heart of gold. Surely these guys can take on the grotesque albino hog-thing and her brood of killers…</p><p>And make no mistake: Mira is definitely in charge here, with even Fang defaulting to her (wordless) order for the dinosaurs to stay behind while she and Spear attempt to infiltrate the cave. And even though they’ve been apart all these months, and Spear is, you know, dead, the two still make a good team. I’ve said it before, but Mira has always had the upper hand over Spear and Fang, if only because she’s got more chill than they do. And we see it here again, as Spear is ready to rush into combat in the cave but Mira knows that they need to take a more covert approach to save her people. (Until they don’t.)</p><p>This episode feels a bit more violent than usual – which is saying something by Primal’s standards. Maybe it’s because of the presence of that little kid from the village, who escapes the pit of hell for a minute only to happen upon the corpse of the villager who had also just gotten out of the pit, finding the woman bleeding from a hole in her head while the hog monsters eat her insides. Yuck!</p><p>As for the reintegration of Spear into the group… man, Fang is still being pretty mean to her old buddy. This leads to a fun sequence where Spear, relying on his improving if still hazy memories, tries to bond with her by bringing her water and then some tasty treats. She’s not having it, but Blue and Red Jr. (that’s what I’m calling her pups) are more than happy to indulge themselves. Those two numbskulls continue to be a highlight of the season.</p><section data-transform=\"quoteBox\">I’m more concerned by what’s going on between Fang and Spear... Are these two finally going to have it out next week?</section><p>And so by episode’s end we’ve got another cliffhanger, with Mira badly injured in the aftermath of defeating the hogs. We know she survives because she’s got to go off and have her and Spear’s child in order to get us to the last scene of Season 2! But still, I’m more concerned by what’s going on between Fang and Spear, as the former got pretty rough with the latter after Mira was injured. Are these two finally going to have it out next week, and hopefully come to some sort of peace? I hope so.</p><p><strong>Questions and Notes From Anachronistic History</strong></p><ul><li>It’s interesting how able-bodied Spear is when he’s in action mode, running with Mira (and even faster than her), for example. But when it comes to the simple things, like sitting down or getting up, he’s a mess.</li><li>Is it just me or were a couple of the shots of the hog creatures recycled from the last time we were in this cave?</li><li>The hog things can smell Spear, but man, so must everyone else.</li><li>Mira having to stand by and listen while her people are getting chomped on is pretty rough, and the way her eyes start watering in that moment is a nice touch.</li></ul>",

Episode 5 (titled “In the Name of the Mother”) opens with the Trial of Seven between Dunk’s faction, including newfound ally Prince Baelor Targaryen, and nasty Prince Aerion’s, which immediately establishes the life-is-cheap tone of the rest of the episode.</p><p>Dunk (a never-better Peter Claffey) is quickly knocked unconscious, and the story flashes back to his youth where young Dunk (a wide-eyed Bamber Todd) and his best friend and first love Rafe (played with world-weary grit by Dune: Prophecy’s Chloe Lea) scavenge the remains of a battlefield for whatever they can sell back in Flea Bottom. Where Dunk is sensitive, Rafe is steely and unsentimental, hardened at such a young age by growing up amongst the disease and despair that’s ever-present in Flea Bottom.</p><p>Roughly half of “In the Name of the Mother” takes place in the past, chronicling Rafe and Dunk’s plan to scrape up enough coin to buy passage to the Free Cities where they can start a new life together. Or at least that’s their hope. A vicious city watchman (Edward Davis, another Dune: Prophecy cast member making a stop in Westeros) harasses them, with Rafe pick-pocketing him a few times — the final time fatally. </p><p>In a heartbreaking instant, Rafe has her throat slit by the watchman and dies on the street with Dunk at her side. She had been the stronger of the duo, pressing Dunk to be wiser about the world and to accept that his long-missing mother is dead and never coming back. And then, with one slash of a dagger, their dream of running away together comes to a brutal end. (Rafe also appears to be of Dornish descent, so perhaps older Dunk saw something of her in the imperiled Tanselle, maybe a chance for the life he might have had with Rafe. Alas, love doesn’t seem in the cards for Dunk.)</p><section data-transform=\"quoteBox\">The swiftness and brutality of the Trial of Seven combat scenes makes for some of the most unflinching knight-on-knight violence viewers have seen this side of a Ridley Scott film.</section><p>Rafe’s death is also when young Dunk first meets Ser Arlan of Pennytree (Danny Webb), who staggers out of a tavern, vomiting, but coming to the aid of those in distress, as a good knight should. Despite being half-drunk, Ser Arlan wields his mighty sword – <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/yes-ser-arlan-pennytrees-formidable-weapon-in-a-knight-of-the-seven-kingdoms-nude-scene-was-a-10-prosthetic-heres-how-the-sausage-was-made\"></a>! – and cuts down the watchman and his sidekick (the latter’s head instantly becoming pig fodder). With nowhere else to go and having lost any other chance of escaping Flea Bottom, young Dunk surreptitiously follows Ser Arlan as he rides off into the countryside. Eventually, the hedge knight finds the kid and offers him water with this simple bit of life advice: “Get up.”</p><p>“Get up” becomes a refrain for the rest of the episode, with Egg urging his hero Dunk to get back up on his feet and defeat Aerion. Like a medieval Rocky, Dunk is a dim-witted palooka who can take a beating like no one else. He endures several gruesome injuries but finally rises to the occasion and defeats Aerion, forcing him to publicly concede. But we quickly find out that Dunk’s victory has come at a heavy price, one that will affect the course of history in Westeros.</p><p>Following the battle, Baelor arrives to check on Dunk only for us to see that the back of the prince’s head has been caved in by what is believed to have been his own brother Maekar’s mace. Like Ned Stark in Game of Thrones, Baelor’s honor and decision to do the right thing gets him killed. Dunk finally finds a true high-born knight he could believe in, one who reflected the chivalry he believed they should uphold, and Dunk gets him killed. Dunk has spoken about his misfortune before, but it sure seems like he’s unlucky to be around.</p><p>The swiftness and brutality of the Trial of Seven combat scenes makes for some of the most unflinching knight-on-knight violence viewers have seen this side of a Ridley Scott film. Every wound, groan, blood spurt, impact of a mace or a horse smashing into a fighter makes for a very visceral, cinematic experience. While the jousting scenes in earlier episodes packed a huge wallop, A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms saved its bloody best until (second to) last.</p>",

Hell is yourself.” - Ludwig Wittgenstein</em></p><p>It begins with a group of children looking down a hole. A boy in a hood, the remains of a hangman’s noose around his neck, pilots a boat adrift at sea. I do not know where he has come from or where he is going or if he was one of the ones staring into that well’s abyss. I only know the way forward. Red lights peak through the dark and fog. They are my compass, and I follow them. Buoys. Where they guide me, I do not know, but there is no other path. The ocean is so vast, and my boat is so small. For a time, I am alone. At the fourth buoy, the boy stops the boat and pulls aboard a girl. When he reaches for the hare mask covering her face, she pins him to the small outboard’s wooden bottom, her hands ripping at his mask until he kicks her away. They stare at each other from opposite ends of the boat. It might as well be a chasm. “I thought you were dead,” the boy offers. “Where are the others?” the girl asks. The boy doesn’t know. She takes a lantern and stands at our boat’s bow. The buoys are still our guide, but the girl lights the way forward. </p><p>By the time I reach the end of Reanimal, the latest horror puzzle platformer from <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/26/little-nightmares-review\">Little Nightmares</a> developer Tarsier, I have forgotten all of this, and lost track of what parts of this opening are most important. I am too busy trying to make meaning from what I have seen, too focused on trying to connect the pieces of Reanimal’s puzzle, to understand how we got here. But stories, at least the good ones, the ones that know what they’re doing, tell you what they’re about from the beginning. And Reanimal is a very good story. Remember this, it tells you. Remember . </p><p>Together – I play the boy, my co-op partner plays the girl. There is no way to select who plays who; it simply works out this way – we sail through jagged cliffs, past mines larger than our boat, bisect a forest of jagged, barren trees. Then the banks of the river we have followed fade, and a large industrial building looms out of the fog ahead of us. It is a remarkable image in a game of remarkable images. Reanimal certainly knows how to set a scene. </p><p>There is very little overt explanation.The boy and the girl are brother and sister, but this fact is never told to you. You learn it through the way they help each other up, comfort each other when things go wrong. Their relationship is something you experience, the questions largely left for you to answer. Why does she attack him after he fishes her out of the sea? What happened to them before they were in the boat? Reanimal unspools its story slowly, and asks you to fill in the gaps yourself. To remember what you’ve seen, to put together the imagery, the symbols, notice patterns in the shapes throughout its world. I’m unsure of what they’re after until we find another child separated from us by steel bars blocking a drain pipe. “You came back,” he whispers. “I knew you would. You should leave… while you still can.” But we don’t. The girl’s earlier question is the answer to mine. We are here to save the others. Our friends.</p><section data-transform=\"quoteBox\">Reanimal can be played alone, but it's more meaningful to take the journey with someone else.</section><p>We navigate broken buildings, push through dark forests, leap across gaps, crouch into places only a child can fit. Often, we need to work together. The world is so big, and we are so small. It takes two of us to lift a metal trapdoor. I hold a lever to still a rotating metal shaft so my partner can pilot the girl across. On the other side, she knocks down a piece of wood so I can cross a gap. Reanimal is simple, elegant. You walk, run, jump, interact with and carry objects, boost one another to ledges neither of you can reach alone, and occasionally fight off foes in the clumsy way a child might. Little distinguishes the boy from the girl, save that she can attach her lantern to her hip while carrying something else. The boy’s lighter, on the other hand, is only usable if his hands are free. It’s a subtle distinction, but an important one, and my partner and I often made significant choices about who would do what based on how much light it would cost us, and whether we felt we could sacrifice it. </p><p>Reanimal can be played alone, but I found it more meaningful to take the journey with someone else, to coordinate and work together, to congratulate ourselves on our success and discuss our failures before trying again. Like the boy and the girl on screen, we are experiencing this together. Like them, we are not alone. That subtle distinction – of working with a living, breathing person – made it much better than it would have been had I spent the whole experience with a computer-controlled girl who always did exactly what she was supposed to. That’s not what this story is about, and I am deeply grateful that, in an era which has largely abandoned local co-op, Reanimal offers it.</p><p>Both Reanimal’s gameplay and the choices it offers are satisfying, but simple. It is less a game you play and more a world you move through and experience without the obvious artifice of a video game. There is no HUD, no meters, no minimap. The camera is often fixed to show you exactly what Tasier wants you to see, and the sense of visual composition here is remarkable. Even horror can be beautiful when framed the right way. Often, the answers to the gameplay questions Reanimal presents are obvious – though not less satisfying for it – and the only way forward, though occasionally we get lost. What carries us ahead are not the puzzles themselves, but the desire to see what’s next. If you are expecting great leaps from the studio’s work on the first two Little Nightmares, you will not find it here, and I’m not bothered by that. You don’t return to your favorite restaurant angry the menu hasn’t changed, and here the chef is a master of his craft.</p><p>The environment is not our only obstacle. We start to notice the horrors as we search for the missing wheels to a handcar. A body leans against a wall, its belly a gaping hole left by something that forced its way out – or in. A plunger applied to a clogged toilet reveals a key and the deformed, deflated skin of what was once, perhaps, a man; his features are off, deformed, his face caught between that of a person and a pig.</p><p>What we’re up against isn’t obvious until we come across the second of the wheels we need for the handcart, and the man/animal skins around us come to life, slithering after us like snakes. We do the only thing we can do: we run. It gets worse from there; the first living human we encounter is impossibly tall, his face a Halloween mask of sagging skin, empty eye sockets, a maw that is always open. He skitters after us like a spider, biting our heads off if he catches us. He is not the worst of it; not even close. We spend most of Reanimal running from something. I don’t want to say more. These are terrors you really should see for yourself. </p><p>But I can say this: the place the boy and girl have returned to is wrong. There is a theory that hell is the worst moments of your life, replayed over and over again, without ceasing, simultaneously something you recognize and fresh at the same time. What does it say that the boy and girl have seemingly returned here by choice after having escaped? “I told you to leave,” the boy we encountered tells us later. Or are they all trapped here, together, in a hell we can’t leave? Only one thing is certain: we are off the edge of the map. Here be dragons.</p><p>As we continue, the world opens up to us. We navigate dark forests, the flooded ruins of cities, active warzones, and until the end, whatever shattered this place is only partially clear. Our journey is only partially linear. Returning to the boat allows us to explore, to explore this flooded place and find what lies off the beaten path. It is here that Reanimal is most obviously a video game, rewarding the curious with new masks, collectible concept art, and so on, but it never feels out of place or forced, and doesn’t detract from the atmosphere. Nor does the occasional replay of a chase sequence because you don’t initially know what to do or where to go, which is enough to spell your end. Reanimal’s atmosphere, its art, its sense of place and character and mystery carry the day at every turn, through the odd confusion, annoyance, or visual bug. It compelled us to see it through to the end, to understand the tale it was trying to tell in its roughly six-hour journey through hell. I think I understand. But I know there is much we missed, and I want to return to see it through, and see what, if anything, changes as a result.</p>",

      "content": "<img src=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/13/goat-1771012243566.jpg\"><p>A world where anthropomorphic animals live their lives much like our own is such a perennial setting for animation that <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/movies/goat\"></a> is opening while the very well-received – and insanely financially successful – <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/zootopia-2-review\"></a> is still in theaters. And it’s not even the only animated animal film with a basketball focus, given there are two animation/live-action hybrid <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/space-jam-a-new-legacy-review\"></a>. So with that burden on the back, it’s perhaps even more gratifying for it to turn out to be an entertaining, lively and terrifically animated film in its own right. </p><p>Our hero here is Will Harris (voiced by Stranger Things’ ​​Caleb McLaughlin), a young goat who is not just a massive fan of roarball – this film’s name for basketball – but also dreams of making it as a professional player himself, despite being one of the so-called “smalls,” i.e., animals who, quite literally, don’t seem to be built for the game. </p><p>But after videos of him go viral when he plays a game of streetball against an actual pro (Aaron Pierre’s amusingly named horse, Mane Attraction) and more than holds his own, Will finds himself on his beloved hometown team, the Thorns - even though he’s basically been hired as a publicity stunt by team owner Flo (Jenifer Lewis), with no one intending for him to ever actually play in a game. </p><p>Goat plays things very safe on the story side. Is there a point where circumstances lead Will to be called off the bench and enter a game? Does he then show just how great he is to the fans? Can he and his teammates work through their personal issues to actually become a cohesive unit? Who’s to say!? </p><p>Yes, this is a kids/family animated movie, but we’ve still seen many in recent years with some interesting and surprising storylines or plot points. Yet there’s something to be said for telling a predictable/traditional story well, and while Goat is going down a rather safe path, there’s a lot of wit, charm and warmth to be found in the way that writers Aaron Buchsbaum and Teddy Riley (working from a story by Nicolas Curcio and Peter Chiarelli), director Tyree Dillihay, and the animators take us along on Will’s journey.</p><p>Part of that is accomplished by giving the film a near co-lead in the form of Thorns team captain Jett Fillmore (Gabrielle Union), a black panther who’s a roarball legend but now facing getting older and criticism that she’s long past her prime. There are a lot of good scenes for Jett on her own and also between her and Will, as she begins to bond with him despite her initial dismissive nature towards her new young teammate, and the film gives the two a well done and properly emotional rapport. </p><section data-transform=\"quoteBox\">Where Goat truly shines and stands out is in its animation.</section><p>McLaughlin and Union both bring a lot of heart to their vocal performances, with Union also adding the right touch of world-weary cynicism (and a touch of narcissism) to Jett, who’s used to dominating the game in a way that’s made her a bad teammate over the years. And they’re aided by a strong group of supporting players comprising their teammates, including Nicola Coughlan as the ostrich Olivia Burke, David Harbour as the rhino Archie Everhardt, and Nick Kroll as Komodo dragon Modo Olachenko, along with Patton Oswalt as their coach, proboscis monkey Dennis Cooper, all of whom get some funny spotlight moments. It was amusing, but made sense, to learn via the closing credits that the only one of these characters that never really pops comedically or feels especially interesting vocally, the Thorns’ giraffe player, Lenny Williamson, was the one voiced by the non-actor in the cast, Stephen Curry, who is one of Goat’s producers. </p><p>But where Goat truly shines and stands out is in its animation. Sony Pictures Animation has put out a lot of impressive – and very impressive-looking – films in recent years, including Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and its sequel, The Mitchells vs. The Machines, and KPop Demon Hunters. The work of Sony’s extremely talented designers and animators continues to impress with Goat, which boasts some fantastic visuals throughout. </p><p>Will and his friends live in the part of their world called Vineland, which is packed with wonderful details. Rather than simply having these animals live in a town just like our own, or do something cute and old-school cartoon-esque like put a regular-looking house up in a tree, Vineland has a vibe all of its own. It’s as if branches, trees, bushes, and foliage were actively intertwined with the architecture in our world. The park court Will plays at has massive branches around the hoop, while leaves line the walls of restaurants and homes. It’s a cool mashup of things that look built with nature and feels like a vibrant and creative spin on this sort of “wild animals in suburbia” animated scenario. </p><p>And then there are the other lands the team travels to for their games, and specifically the courts they play on. Because while roarball’s rules are pretty much one-to-one with basketball, when it comes to the environments these teams play in, things get much trickier and outright dangerous. One court is covered in stalagmites bursting forth from the ground to navigate, while another is covered in ice that begins to crack and separate beneath the feet of the teams, revealing the freezing water below, even as the game keeps going. And then there’s the game that looks like what would happen if Darth Vader set up a basketball court on <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/17/rogue-one-whats-the-deal-with-darth-vaders-castle\"></a>, with flowing magma beneath the volcanic rock the teams are playing on, adding a suitably operatic vibe to the situation. It’s all awesome to behold, with high-energy, kinetic motion to the games themselves that help further invest you in Will and his teammates in classic underdog fashion. </p><p>Goat also has a lot of fun with the idea that these characters truly are animals, not just people who look like animals. While they walk on two legs, we soon learn that these goats, horses, panthers and other creatures also still run on all fours when the situation calls for it. And lots of fun sight gags come from how they still act and behave as we might expect them to act in our world in certain scenarios, from how Jett drinks from a bowl like a cat, to the easily panicked Olivia carrying a bucket of sand that she can bury her head in when she’s freaking out. (Yes, ostriches don’t actually bury their heads in sand; it just can look that way, but a good gag based on a common animal misconception is still a good gag!)</p>",

As most viewers probably predicted, fate had another shoe to drop for poor Louie Cloverfield (Ernest Harden Jr.). Episode 6, “12:00 P.M.,” is at its best when it focuses on the fight to save Louie and the emotional fallout that comes after.</p><p>The only real question with Louie was what would go wrong for this affable but clearly very ill man. The tooth abscess turned out to be a red herring. In the end, Louie’s liver simply couldn’t endure what he was putting it through any longer. There’s a certain abruptness to his death in Episode 6 that feels very fitting. No farewell speeches or long, tearful goodbyes. One minute he seems ready to be discharged, the next he’s bleeding out. This series succeeds because it embraces the stark reality of emergency medicine rather than opting for a more sentimental approach. </p><p>This episode is bookended with strong scenes, as in the closing moments, we see most of the staff gather round to pay their respects to Louie. Thanks to Robby (Noah Wyle), we also get some sad insight into who he was and what drove him to essentially commit suicide by alcoholism. It really provides a different perspective on the character and his interactions with the various doctors and nurses. It all serves to offer a sad, tender farewell to the character. But again, the show stops short of being melodramatic or saccharine.</p><p>Episode 6 is also great about using Louie’s death to fuel some key emotional moments along the way toward that final farewell scene. We get strong performances from the likes of Gerran Howell, Patrick Ball, Amielynn Abellera, and Katherine LaNasa as their characters process their grief. The exchange between Dr. Langdon (Ball) and Dana (LaNasa) in the break room is a particular highlight here, as we see Langdon continue to try to make amends.</p><p>Unfortunately, a few frustrating choices do hold the episode back compared to Episode 5. For one thing, there’s a surprising amount of emphasis on the new motorcycle accident patient, considering that it’s not a particularly interesting case from either a medical or dramatic standpoint. Maybe there’s another curveball being deployed here, possibly involving Robby and his motorcycle sabbatical. But as it stands, I would have preferred more progress on one of the more compelling cases being juggled right now. In particular, it would be nice to have more momentum on the front of Jackson Davis (Zack Morris), the college student showing signs of paranoid schizophrenia. </p><p>The other problem is that this episode seems to go out of its way to make viewers dislike two of the new Season 2 additions, Dr. Al-Hashimi (Sepideh Moafi) and Ogilvie (Lucas Iverson), even more than past episodes. With the former, it’s her insistence on pushing a clearly deeply flawed A.I. system and her bullheadedness about acknowledging said flaws. The series has shown little interest in integrating Dr. Al-Hashimi into the cast and not have her simply feel like the interloping outsider and antagonist to Robby. Episode 5 offered some welcome progress on that front, but Episode 6 basically undoes it all.</p><p>As for Ogilvie, it’s pretty hard not to loathe the character after his obnoxious reaction to Louie’s death. And I suppose that’s the point. Clearly, we’re meant to be put off by this insufferable know-it-all with a serious empathy deficiency. But I do wish there was a little more balance to his characterization. Why is it so necessary for us to hate him? Why is he so two-dimensional when none of the other characters are? The series definitely has some work to do on the Ogilvie front.       </p>",

      "content": "<img src=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/12/highonlife2-review-blogroll-1770924011991.jpg\"><p>There’s an old refrain among comedians that no joke survives its retelling, and you don’t need to look any further than the shoddy track record of comedy movie sequels to see the truth in that. Fortunately, funny video games tend to fare much better, from Borderlands 2 to Portal 2, and so you would hope that a weird, deeply inappropriate game about drugs and talking guns like High On Life 2 might enjoy the same kind of evolution. In some ways it does just that, with many of its existing bright spots shining even more brightly – the lovable weapons that serve as your companions are more amusing than ever, and movement outside of combat is greatly improved by radical new skateboarding mechanics. But other areas don’t hold up as well, like the significantly less polished story, jokes that don’t land quite as often, and performance issues that are even more shaky than the first game. I still enjoyed my time with High On Life 2, and truly relish the opportunity to return to a world this goofy any chance I get, but this is definitely closer to Zoolander 2 than 22 Jump Street.</p><p>High On Life 2 picks up right where our foul-mouthed cast of characters left off… sort of. After a dizzyingly fast intro recaps the events of the first game and gets you back into the action, you find yourself on the wrong side of the law and ready to begin the familiar process of hunting down a list of baddies to bring down an evil organization. Instead of a drug cartel, this time the villain comes in the form of a pharmaceutical company that I felt no guilt killing off members of over the course of the roughly 10-hour campaign, now playing the role of rogue assassin as I ply my trade of death illegally – a nice twist to the otherwise nearly identical setup of the original.</p><p>Sadly, the story built around this string of over-the-top murder missions is a bit sloppy, with a couple big reveals that don’t really land and a surprising number of monologues to explain motives and technologies. There’s a shocking amount of “tell, don’t show” for a game that is typically very intentionally about not sweating the details and following the rule of cool. It sorta reminds me of a D&amp;D campaign that’s gone on way too long and starts to feel like the DM is twisting himself in knots trying to get to that cool payoff, missing the mark too often in the process. The good news is that the plot at least moves along at a pretty fast clip with a steady stream of silly gags to keep you guessing, even when the story gets messy.</p><p>Speaking of silly gags, like its predecessor, this is an adventure that relies a whole lot on the success of its goofiness and whimsy, and there are plenty of laugh out loud moments to be had. The high points are extremely memorable, like when you fight an incredibly annoying boss who transports himself inside your menus and starts messing with your game settings (appropriately voiced by the legendary Richard Kind), or when one mission concludes with a murder mystery that has you gathering clues and interrogating witnesses instead of shooting guns. Sometimes the lowbrow humor also just hits, like a side quest where someone wanted me to help them find a bridge troll and…y’know, I think I’ll just leave it at that. High On Life 2 is at its best when it’s trying weird and creative things, and when it manages to pull that off, there’s really nothing quite like it.</p><section data-transform=\"quoteBox\">I was having the most fun when it was trying new stuff, and the least when it was retreading old bits.</section><p>That talking Aussie blade cuts both ways though, as jokes fall flat a tad too often in this sequel, and it’s pretty tough to watch when they do. Granted, it’s always harder to pull off gags in a world that has had a lot of its juice squeezed out already – we know about the species of sentient guns, for example, and have already had most of the funny moments we’re going to get out of that surreal experience – but some of the jokes are quite literal repeats of things that happened in the first game. If I was having the most fun when High On Life 2 was trying new stuff, I was having the least when it was retreading old bits or just throwing a couple curse words onto the end of a sentence in lieu of actual punchlines. </p><p>The stars of the show in the original were the gun companions you met and befriended along the way, and that certainly remains true in this follow-up. Meeting a down on his luck pistol named Travis (who has a charmingly dorky voice from Ken Marino) and reuniting him with his estranged wife is both a satisfying arc and a clever way to introduce the first dual-wielded weapon when his spouse joins the party (I do wish they’d make out less though). All four of the new gun companions are awesome and have helpful abilities in both combat and puzzle-solving, like Sheath, whose harpoon “trick hole” attack can impale people during fights and create ziplines while platforming. Plus, most of the OG Gatlians make a return as well, including my favorite partner in crime (literally this time), Gus, the shotgun who looks like a frog and has the unmistakable voice of J.B. Smoove. Hell yeah.</p><p>Unfortunately, a wider variety of guns hasn’t done much to make the sloppy and overly simplistic gunplay any better – in fact it even feels a touch worse. Some of the new weapons are quite crisp compared to the wonky slugthrowers of yore, especially Sheath’s burst-fire that reminds me of the battle rifle from Halo. But with so many enemies and projectiles flying around, claustrophobic rooms with odd geometry that enemies get caught behind and within, and weapon accuracy being a bit all over the place, combat leans into chaos more than anything else. Most of the time that’s fine because you’re playing a game that’s all about over-the-top nonsense, but when you occasionally die due to unfair circumstances or when a fight drags on for a bit too long, it can kill the mood. To its credit, the enemy variety is mostly decent, with a stream of ugly new creatures to blast apart introduced at a steady clip, from flying robotic freaks to spooky, scary skeletons – but if you were looking for a polished FPS with gunfights that feel at all coherent, look elsewhere.</p><p>The biggest and most interesting change with High On Life 2 is mobility, as you’re given a trusty skateboard in the opening minutes that serves as your travel companion throughout the adventure. Instead of fighting on foot, most encounters highly encourage or outright require you to be grinding on rails, riding on the sides of walls, and soaring through the air on your skateboard. When it comes to traveling from place-to-place or navigating your way through platforming sections, this is pretty awesome, and a shocking amount of your time will be spent rolling around like you’re playing Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. I didn’t really expect the skateboard to play such a big role, but honestly I can’t imagine going back to the relative sluggishness of running around on foot.</p><p>In combat, the skateboard’s influence isn’t so positive. You’re seemingly expected to never stop moving while fighting hordes of aliens, which makes the already chaotic encounters even more noisy and hard to read. Many fights take place in open areas where you’re surrounded by more bad guys than you could possibly keep track of, and staying put is a death sentence with so little cover, so you’ll have to take shots at passersby while leaping from various parts of the environment to keep yourself going as fast as you can. Combine that juggling act with slippery weapons, enemies that teleport around, and weird foes that are often hard to even understand what you’re looking at, and oh boy, the result is just an absolute diarrhea of pixels.</p><p>Those pixels seem to be pushing High On Life 2 to its limits as well, because I saw frequent framerate dips (some that caused my screen to freeze for several seconds before getting it together) and progress-hindering bugs that required me to reload the last checkpoint. Developer Squanch Games did include “various performance issues across the game” on a list of known problems with the review build that will apparently be addressed by a patch, but it didn’t specify the extent to which those would be resolved – and in my experience, a day-one patch rarely makes  of a game’s performance problems magically disappear when they are this extensive. Nothing I saw struck me as game breaking beyond a simple reset, but it was consistent and egregious enough to make me worried for the stuff people will find when this is out in the wild. </p>",

      "content": "<p>At first glance, the Asus ROG Raikiri II looks like pretty much any other third-party Xbox controller. However, look closer, and there are a few more face buttons than would otherwise be there. Just like the Asus ROG Xbox Ally X that came out last year, the Raikiri II has extra menu buttons, with one on the top left, next to the Xbox button, meant to bring up the Asus Armoury Crate software, and the library button on the other side that is meant to bring up the library tab of the Xbox full screen experience. </p><p>Here’s the catch, though: these buttons straight up don’t do anything on a standard gaming PC. Asus even has a piece of software that you can download to give the Raikiri II the same functionality as the controller on the Xbox Ally X, but in my testing it only works on, well, the Xbox Ally X. That’s great for anyone plugging their Xbox Ally X into their TV to play from the couch – you’re going to get the same functionality as in handheld mode. But if you’re buying this controller for your PC, you’re going to have two essentially useless buttons on the controller. But, hey, at least they don’t actually do anything when you accidentally hit them. </p><p>Aesthetically, the Asus ROG Raikiri II borrows a lot from Asus’ latest handheld, too. It has the same black colorway, and you can even look up close and it has the same tiny “ROG Xbox” lettering on the front of the peripheral. </p><p>And of course, being an import from the Republic of Gamers, this controller has plenty of RGB lighting. There are three zones of lighting, one in the middle, in the shape of the ROG logo, and then a stripe on either side of the controller. By default, the lighting has the standard blinking rainbow effect, but you can customize it using Asus’ Gear Link web portal. Asus isn’t the first company to move hardware management to a web app, but it is much better than having some heavy software always running in the background on your PC – at least if you have a stable internet connection. </p><p>The software does allow you to customize button assignments and even the response curve of your thumbsticks. However, the paddles on the back of the controller can only be assigned to one of the existing controller buttons. That useful, especially if you’re playing a game that requires you to press buttons while you’re moving or something, but I would have liked to see some kind of macro support here. Just let me assign button combinations to the paddles – it would, for instance, make playing Final Fantasy XIV on a controller a bit easier. </p><p>Much like other ‘pro’ controllers like the <a href=\"https://sea.ign.com/news/220763/\">Razer Wolverine V3 Pro</a>, the Raikiri II does allow you to swap out the thumbsticks. There is an extra set of thumbsticks included in the box, but they’re very long. </p><p>The controller also comes with a charging stand, which wirelessly charges the controller via some POGO pins on the back. The stand fits nice and snug in the included carrying case with a hole in the back for the USB-C cable, much like the Xbox Elite Controller, but Asus also includes little feet that let you set it up wherever you want.</p><p>I’d actually recommend taking the stand out of the carrying case and setting it up somewhere near your gaming setup. The charging stand has a little USB port in the front of it, which you can use to connect the 2.4GHz dongle. Then, you can just place it somewhere out in the open, and you won’t have to worry about the signal from the dongle being interrupted by anything. </p><a href=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/12/raikiri-5-1770914293115.jpg\"><img src=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/12/raikiri-5-1770914293115.jpg\" title=\"null\"></a><p>The Asus ROG Raikiri II is one of the few controllers out there right now that are using Tunneling Magnetoresistance, or TMR sensors. Just like Hall Effect, these sensors use magnets to more accurately track your inputs, they’re just a bit more power efficient.

You can also change the actuation point of the triggers with little switches on the back, but there are just two settings – all the way down and half-way. To this day, having a high-end controller stop the trigger press half-way down just feels weird, but it’s likely a boon for professional FPS players. </p><a href=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/12/raikiri-1-1770914293115.jpg\"><img src=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/12/raikiri-1-1770914293115.jpg\" title=\"null\"></a><p>The face buttons, on the other hand, use micro switches, rather than TMR sensors, and they still feel incredibly responsive. However, the buttons are incredibly clicky, and they can get quite loud if you’re really mashing them.

And the micro switches will probably keep the buttons quick and responsive for quite a while. </p><p>It all comes together to a controller that just feels good to use. I’ll admit that I’m no esports pro, but even spending time in Assassin’s Creed: Shadows, I’ve noticed a difference just in how smooth the camera moves when I’m using the right analog stick. And unlike something like the <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/11/15/xbox-elite-wireless-series-2-controller-review\">Xbox Elite controller</a>, it’s not too heavy, so it doesn’t start to weigh me down after a long gaming session. </p><p>And you’re going to be able to get some long gaming sessions out of this controller, too.

After sitting idle for a while, the lighting will turn off, but the controller will stay on. There have been a couple of times where, out of instinct, I picked the controller up and went to hit the Xbox button to turn it back on, only for the Game Bar to pop up. Annoying, but that’s something I got used to after a few days. </p><p><em>Jackie Thomas is the Hardware and Buying Guides Editor at IGN and the PC components queen.

      "content": "<img src=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/12/starfleet-academy-ep-6-thumb-1770862336580.jpg\"><p>The latest episode of Starfleet Academy is exciting at times, touching at others, but then there’s another mode that it sinks into here or there which I can only describe as, well, boring. Essentially, “Come, Let's Away” tries to do too many things in one episode, and as a result it feels overly long and bloated – and as such it’s indicative of one of my biggest complaints about the show so far this season.</p><p>I’ve been <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/tv/star-trek-starfleet-academy/reviews\"><u>pretty positive about Starfleet Academy</u></a> through the first half of this first season, but one element that I’ve found consistently troublesome is the streaming bloat of the individual episodes. So far, each segment has been roughly an hour long (not including the pilot, which was 75 minutes), and frankly, that’s too long for a standard episode of TV, Star Trek or not. We don’t need all of our TV to be 60-minute episodes if they don’t need to be 60-minute episodes, and in the case of Starfleet Academy Episode 6… well, this definitely did not need to be a 60-minute episode!</p><p>So in what could’ve been a tight adventure tale with a dose of character development in the classic Star Trek mode, we instead get an overstuffed story with too many characters, too many detours, and not enough .</p><p>Things start interestingly enough with the reveal that Caleb (Sandro Rosta) and Tarima (Zoë Steiner) have taken their relationship to the “let’s get down to business” level, which is a refreshingly realistic approach for the often staid and chaste relationships of much of Trekdom. While Captain Kirk was doing his thing with various alien ladies of the week back in the day, the 1990s era of Star Trek more often than not played the sexual side of its characters down in a big way. Anyone writing off Starfleet Academy as just a kids show should take note here.</p><p>Of course, the scene isn’t about the sex, but rather is an opportunity for us to learn more about Tarima’s telepathic abilities and the troubles they’ve caused her (and will continue to cause). It turns out she’s the reason her father, seen in Episode 2, is deaf, having inadvertently injured him when she lost control of her heightened powers as a child. And even here, she doesn’t quite have control, as she accidentally violates Caleb’s trust by pulling from his memories of his mother. It’s a nice little wrinkle in their relationship that adds depth to things, where the couple could’ve topped out at batting eyelashes and flirting. And by episode’s end, not only does Tarima use her abilities to help save the day, but she also winds up the worse for wear as a result. To be continued there.</p><section data-transform=\"quoteBox\">The idea of a lost relic of a ship that's at least a century old is pretty compelling, and the lighting and atmosphere for the scenes onboard the Miyazaki are effectively creepy.</section><p>The other major thread of Episode 6 involves a training exercise on a long-abandoned Starfleet ship, the USS Miyazaki, which really does have all the makings of a great Captain Picard (“Starship Mine”) or Captain Kirk (“The Doomsday Machine”) story. The Academy kids team up with the War College gang for what is apparently a ritual for the Federation's finest students to go on a joint mission to the wreck, but of course things don't go as planned once they're onboard.</p><p>The idea of a lost relic of a ship that's at least a century old is pretty compelling, and the lighting and atmosphere for the scenes onboard the Miyazaki are effectively creepy. This also goes for the new villainous race introduced here, the Furies, who we're told are “human/alien hybrids.” We don't get much more on them beyond that, and I kind of assumed that the episode was going to culminate in the reveal that the failed singularity drive of the Miyazaki actually led to the creation of these mutant freaks (who, by the way, are also described as cannibals). The fact that they're not the lost crew of the Miyazaki and are instead simply puppets of a returning Paul Giamatti’s Nus Braka is kind of disappointing, actually.</p><p>Still, putting Caleb and Jay-Den and Sam and the rest in the situation of having to fight these things off is pretty exciting, and there's lots of cool bits and pieces to be found in solving the puzzle of how they're going to get out of this mess, including Sam plugging into the ancient computer and the Vulcan B’Avi (Alexander Eling) falling back on his knowledge of a  about Starfleet history in order to troubleshoot their situation. (B’Avi’s interest in, or perhaps reliance on, comic books to learn about Starfleet as a child actually makes a ton of sense when you consider that these kids grew up in the era of The Burn, when it was no easy task to visit or even communicate with other worlds.)</p><p>It's a shame then that the Vulcan is killed in the climax of the episode, even if it’s somehow dramatically satisfying in that we now know that Starfleet Academy is at least willing to kill off its B-tier characters. Not everyone is safe here, it seems. Still, <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/star-trek-starfleet-academy-episode-3-vitus-reflux-review-recap\">B’Avi had seemed as though</a> he was being set up to be a recurring player, and now he's gone, which is kind of a bummer.</p><p>But where the episode really does stumble, and this gets back to my earlier point about a 60-minute episode that should have probably been 52 minutes, is in the return of Giamatti's character and his tête-à-tête with Holly Hunter’s Captain Ake. Sure, the history between these two is of some interest, and we knew that Giamatti would be back after the pilot eventually. But this doesn't seem like it's the right place for it, and their scenes, frankly, drag. The charged character dynamics that the writers and actors are striving for between these two just don't feel like they're there in these scenes, and I hate to have to say that because I've really been hoping that the show would find some kind of center to Ake/Braka’s adversarial relationship <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/star-trek-starfleet-academy-series-premiere-review-recap-episode-2\">since the pilot</a>. Of course, we still have four more episodes to go this season, so there's still a chance that they'll get there. But this wasn’t their week.</p><p><strong>Questions and Notes from the Q Continuum:</strong></p><ul><li>A <a href=\"https://stexpanded.fandom.com/wiki/USS_Miyazaki\"></a> apparently was featured in a piece of fan fiction called Harry Potter and the Return of James T. Kirk(!)… but this is the first time it’s appeared in actual canon, as far as I can tell.</li><li>I wonder who the ship is named after?</li><li>Captain Ake says the Miyazaki was destroyed after its singularity drive failed back in the day, but that seems like a weird turn of phrase since the ship, while damaged, seems mostly intact.</li><li>Speaking of which, the “ship graveyard” that the Miyazaki is in… is it composed just of the one ship? What’s all the debris floating around it?</li><li>The creature design of the Furies is pretty scary in that they seem to be trans-spatial or otherwise displaced in time and space, which again would have supported the idea of them being the byproduct of some kind of singularity/wormhole event gone wrong.</li><li>I love the comic book bit, but why are the characters in the book – who are supposed to be from a century before this episode – wearing 23rd century uniforms?

Yet another hero shooter that I couldn’t pick out of a lineup from the dozens of other options that are available? Not exactly riveting stuff. But as I’ve learned over a couple decades of gaming, you never really know what you’re in for until you’ve got the controller in your hands – and after doing just that, it turns out Highguard has plenty going for it. After two weeks of running matches with friends, I’ve been taken in by its polished gunplay, compelling roster, and trailblazing base-assault game mode. The problem is that lone mode is currently load-bearing, so it’s unfortunate that it feels like a bit of a rough draft and has already begun to get repetitive. To its credit, developer Wildlight Entertainment has been extremely fast to make changes and add content since launch. So I don’t know that Highguard will be able to steal my attention away from competitive shooter options for the longterm, but it’s off to a promising start.</p><p>This competitive shooter borrows components from lots of different, like playable characters with special abilities that are very much drawn from hero shooters and a simplified loot system that’s reminiscent of battle royale games, but it sets itself apart with a unique multiplayer gametype: Raid Mode. In this mode, two opposing teams of either three or five battle it out to invade and utterly destroy each other’s base in incredibly chaotic sieges. Inspired by the developers’ experience attacking player bases in survival games like Rust, Highguard looks to condense that high-stakes showdown into minutes-long matches, rather than serving as the climax to hours of preparation in a game with less structured PvP. While matches sometimes feel a bit unevenly paced before getting to the action-packed raids, it’s an extremely fun formula that stands out as a fresh experience in this genre.</p><p>Raids are smartly broken into a few phases: a short defensive phase where players pick their starting weapon loadout and reinforce their own base, then an exploration and looting phase where teams leave their base in search of weapons, armor, and other upgrades to use in battle. But the real fun begins during the Intercept phase when a sword called the Shieldbreaker spawns on the map for one team to claim, making conflict inevitable and showcasing Highguard’s stellar gunplay (more on that later). Whichever team is able to claim the Shieldbreaker and carry it to the enemy’s base then begins the final phase, called the Raid phase, where the invading team temporarily tears down the shield protecting the other team’s base and assaults it in an attempt to destroy defensive structures and plant bombs to destroy generators – by far the most exciting and high stakes part of each match. Depending on the outcome of the raid phase, this process can repeat itself up to four times during each match, making games last anywhere from eight to 30 minutes, depending on how heated the competition is.</p><p>I really dig the structured, phased approach used in this game mode, as it offers a very clear objective every step of the way, where I never felt like I had a bunch of things competing for my attention. I could very easily see a version of these matches where I’m having to choose between adding defenses to my base, looting better gear, or trying to invade an enemy base, which sounds like way too much to juggle at once. Having my crew always be on the same page about how we were supposed to be spending our time was great, and helped build suspense as we inched ever closer to the absolute mayhem that is the Raid phase, regardless of which side of that confrontation we ended up on.</p><section data-transform=\"quoteBox\">Wildlight has already made some smart tweaks based on early feedback.</section><p>This is a great blueprint overall, and Wildlight has already made some smart tweaks based on early feedback to improve it even further – for example, there are now points of interest marked on the map that offer better loot, which encourages more frequent gunfights during the exploration phase and a chance to jump past your opponents with more meaningful loot in a way that wasn’t as possible at launch. The problem hasn’t been completely addressed, as you are still likely to spend quite a bit of time just running from place to place, and will sometimes find yourself up against more passive teams that result in you quietly looting areas for a couple minutes before the action picks up. But this is one area of significant criticism I had that’s already been mitigated quite a bit in a handful of short weeks, which is pretty heartening.</p><p>It’s no big surprise that Wildlight has built a shooter that immediately feels great, as this new studio is made up primarily of people who worked on Titanfall and Apex Legends. Whether I was sniping enemies at a distance or getting in close for a cheeky submachine gun or shotgun kill, combat was crisp and immediately reminded me of my days sweating it out in Apex Legends lobbies (especially the extremely recognizable feel of the sliding). The selection of weapons is quite small, with just one of each type available, but the upside of that slim arsenal is that each feels incredibly well-tuned – and when you start to find higher rarities, you’ll see little modifiers and buffs randomly rolled on each that slightly tweak things like reload speed, magazine size, or stability. Those become more interesting at higher levels, where you might find things like a fully automatic version of the normally slow-firing hand cannon, which can provide that game changing power I was looking for. Even so, though, you’ll become familiar (and likely overly familiar) with the extremely limited selection quite quickly, and this is one area in which Wildlight has been slow to add new options. Once I figured out which weapons I enjoyed using most, I’ve mostly just defaulted to those in every match, making weapon variety one of Highguard’s most pressing needs at the moment.</p><p>Similar to the small but mighty number of weapons, Highguard’s nine playable characters, called Wardens, will feel quite familiar to anyone who has spent time in a hero shooter like Overwatch or Apex Legends. Each character fulfills a specific magic-based fantasy, like Atticus, the flying, lightning bolt-chucking DPS machine, or Kai, an ice magic user who can turn into a massive frost demon and is unmatched in his ability to defend an area. Following in the tradition of most hero shooters, they all have two abilities on a cooldown, plus an ultimate that can be used a few times per match. These might be helpful little tricks, like one character’s ability to temporarily make walls intangible so your team can pass through them discretely, or powerful combat abilities, like another character who can lob balls of lava over an area, making the whole zone impassible. There’s nothing particularly original to this formula, but Highguard does a really good job at making each character someone I’m eager to master. Seeing someone form a giant ice wall and then magically push that wall right at my team as we tried to cross a narrow bridge convinced me to immediately try that character out in the next match.</p><p>The highlight of Highguard, and the thing that really set it apart from all the other shooters out there, is the raid mechanics, where one team brings down the full force of their squad’s destructive capabilities on a heavily fortified base, while the other uses their superior positioning to bring their advance to a halt. There aren’t many things cooler than a castle siege, and Highguard channels the battle of Helm’s Deep as the meat and potatoes of its one and only game mode. At the beginning of each match, your team votes on which fortress to call their own, each of which comes with its own set of strengths and weaknesses. For example, one volcanic base called Hellmouth is a classic castle surrounded by a lava moat, with dangerous choke points for invaders to cross and long lines of sight for defenders to shoot from. The downside is that if they manage to get through these narrow entryways, there’s not a lot stopping them from blasting through your inner walls and planting bombs on your all-important generators. Or you could instead choose to call Smuggler’s Den your home; a multi-leveled base that lacks narrow chokepoints, but has layers of defensive walls to get through that can be tough for invaders to navigate before getting ambushed by a defending squad.</p><section data-transform=\"quoteBox\">The raid mechanics really set it apart from all the other shooters out there.</section><p>As the attacking team during a raid, you’ll make use of some interesting raid tools in addition to your standard guns and abilities. The zipline allows you to create shortcuts and new pathways when assaulting a base, while the rocket launcher and blast hammer have a more straightforward solution to sieging by allowing you to blast through reinforced walls, killing enemy players in the process. Fighting your way through the enemy’s ranks to plant and defend a bomb deep within their territory is exactly as thrilling and tense as it sounds, but watching the enemy panic and despair as a giant explosion rocks their base and their defensive walls crumble around them makes it well worth the effort.</p><p>Holding the line against the enemy while on the defensive end of a raid can be incredibly stressful, but also extremely rewarding, like one time where I reinforced a series of walls to box the invaders into a choke zone, then used a well-placed ice wall to cut their team in half, then ambushed them before they could reorient themselves. I do wish there were more opportunities to set traps and go full Home Alone with your base, though – as of now, the only way to make your base harder to assault is by making a select number of walls harder to destroy. There are a few tricks, like intentionally breaking through floors and walls to create new lines of sight when the enemy steps into your domain, but aside from that it really comes down to your ability to outplay the invaders on your own turf, using the static advantages and disadvantages of whichever base your team ends up with. Still, managing to stave off an enemy assault and kick them out on their ass is extremely satisfying.</p><p>When you’re not defending or attacking a base, you’ll spend your time out in the much larger areas of the map where you’ll find yourself greatly in need of a faster way to get around, and that’s where mounts come in. While they don’t have a role in raids, as they aren’t permitted within the bounds of a base, they’re absolutely essential out in the world. You can instantly mount or dismount them at any time to close long distances quickly, as well as leap to normally out of reach areas. Once you start fighting against the enemy team for the Shieldbreaker, you’ll find them extremely important in the capture the flag style of that phase, where victory often comes down to being able to outmaneuver the enemy. Riding isn’t without risks though, as it turns you into a huge target, and if your mount gets killed, you will lose access to it for a while which makes you a sitting duck for your enemies and leaves you vulnerable for a small period of time as you fall to the ground and pick yourself back up.</p><p>One thing that feels like it’s missing from Highguard at the moment are PvE opponents, which there is a complete lack of even during the phase where you’re just exploring the map in search of gear. I’d assume there would be baddies trying to stop you or bosses to hunt down to for rarer loot along the way, but instead you’ll find the map complete devoid of life aside from the enemy team, who more often than not I didn’t bump into until the next phase where we ran to the same location in search of the Shieldbreaker. The lack of NPC enemies is mitigated somewhat by supply drops that spawn during the gear up phase, giving you a reason to engage in PvP earlier in each round, as well as waypoints that guide you toward better gear to cause more frequent gunfights, but I still feel like it would be nice to have more to do before the big conflict at the end.</p><p>The most notable update is the addition of a 5v5 mode that was haphazardly thrown in as a response to complaints that the default 3v3 option was a bit too slow (an argument I could see the logic of, but never really felt myself). While the higher player count is chaotic and clearly rushed out the door (the rough edges of its UI make that obvious), it works a lot better than I thought it would. We also have a ranked playlist now that plays pretty much identically to the standard 3v3 mode, but with a nice ladder system to climb and some cosmetic incentives to keep you grinding. Neither of these additions are particularly game-changing if you weren’t already enjoying the raiding action that’s the crux of Highguard, but knowing the developers are paying attention is certainly a good thing, and the updates have kept me around to try out whatever shiny new thing is next.</p><p>Wildlight has clearly learned some lessons from the various lumps in the road that Apex Legends faced, particularly when it comes to the live-service model. After taking a peek at Highguard’s roadmap for the next year, which includes new content every single month, I’m pretty impressed by how much is supposedly coming down the pipe. That roadmap includes new playable characters (one of which was added last weekend), as well as several new bases, maps, and weapons, all within the first year, with seasonal content coming every two months. Of course, that plan has already gone awry: the 5v5 mode has been made permanent despite starting out as a temporary option, and other planned content was moved up to arrive earlier as initially high player numbers rapidly dwindled after launch. That could leave anyone wary, but it’s at least great to see Wildlight reiterate that it’s prepared for long-term support, and so far it’s been doing a great job being responsive, even if the stuff it’s putting out isn’t always fully baked yet.</p>",

If you find yourself enjoying the cross-cut montage of the main characters crossing paths on the 101 and the evocative LA-at-night atmosphere, you wouldn’t be entirely wrong in feeling a little deja vu.</p><p>Like an entry level college course from which the film takes its name, Crime 101 is proficient in all the right elements of a heist movie. Director <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/videos/director-series-bart-layton-cinefix\">Bart Layton</a> and the stacked cast led by <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-officially-releases-avengers-doomsday-thor-trailer-online-as-x-men-trailer-heads-to-theaters\">Chris Hemsworth</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/we-havent-shot-that-one-hulk-star-mark-ruffalo-seemingly-spoils-thor-actor-chris-hemsworth-returning-in-avengers-secret-wars\">Mark Ruffalo</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/videos/the-night-catwoman-brought-her-oscar-to-the-razzies-ign-inside-stories\">Halle Berry</a> do what they can to take some chances around the periphery, veering from the formula in a few interesting ways. But like a high-end thief who strays from his MO, the movie ultimately pays for it in the end.</p><p>Crime 101 doesn’t actively do anything bad. In fact, the film tries to do a handful of interesting things, but only does each of them half as well as it could have with a little more focus. The pull of familiar heist movie tropes, the cat and mouse of <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/2009/11/13/heat-blu-ray-review\">Heat</a> or the “one last score and I’m out” of… well, <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/heat-2-movie-gets-one-step-closer-with-amazon-mgm-deal\">Heat again</a>, proves too strong and too thoroughly reproduced in Crime 101 for the variations to comfortably fold in. It all adds up to a pretty standard heist flick featuring some flourishes to the formula that feel more out of place than like a creative riff on the genre.</p><p>For example, Chris Hemsworth’s Mike Davis is an awkward, almost cripplingly shy man who, at times, seems to be neurodivergent. It’s definitely a departure from <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-avengers-doomsday-thor-trailer-serious\">Thor</a> or any number of the comedic supporting roles he’s shone in over the years. He’s a charismatic presence on screen no matter who he’s playing and his performance here works in the moments where he struggles to connect with a would-be love interest or when he scrubs himself down before a job to avoid leaving DNA evidence behind. However, the characterization gets a little lost when he shows no compunction about car chases or shaking down insurance executives. </p><p>Mark Ruffalo’s Detective Lubesnick and Halle Berry’s broker Sharon, even Hemsworth’s thief, all suffer under the unjust treatment of awful bosses and the same dead-end sense of futility. Both Sharon and Detective Lubesnick wear the bitterness well, but are dismissed by their superiors in ways that are equally frustrating and formulaic. The trio also share a clarity as to who the real villains are in their world, leading to no small amount of <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/videos/disneys-robin-hood-what-the-f-is-this-doing-here-cinefix-top-100\">Robin Hood</a> style class warfare, with the film dipping a toe into a thread of wealthy white people buying and hoarding Black and Native American art while stopping short of a proper eat-the-rich kind of theme.</p><section data-transform=\"quoteBox\">There are interesting ideas at play throughout the film that get swapped out like one getaway car for another in service of a plot that’s less compelling than any one of them.&nbsp;</section><p>The real problem is none of this is allowed to be what the movie is “about” because Crime 101 is so determined to fall in line with the crime thriller genre that the flourishes feel more like bugs than features.</p><p>On the upside however, <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/chloe-zhao-told-barry-keoghan-to-act-like-star-wars-hayden-christensen-in-marvels-eternals\">Barry Keoghan</a> is an energetic little blast of a character. His version of the dangerous wild card thrown into the mix brings a rabid energy to the proceedings. He’s desperate to prove himself, bouncing back and forth between a skilled criminal and a clear psychopath.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/09/08/warrior-review\">Nick Nolte</a> (now with 100% more gravelly-voice) does his thing as the elderly fence / father figure to Mike, but doesn’t get much else to play with outside of what the elderly fence / father figures usually get to do in movies like this.</p><p>Frankly, one of the real highlights is a one-and-a-half scene cameo. <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/16/the-hateful-eight-review\">Jennifer Jason Leigh</a>, in her screentime with Mark Ruffalo, helps make a tragic scene grounded  hilarious as an argument erupts about how much of a “beach guy” Lubesnick may or may not be. As far as scene partners go, they’re a pair I’d love to see more of.</p><p>By the end of the movie, though, the scales are tipped toward familiar crime movie tropes as opposed to the variations on the pattern. There are interesting ideas at play throughout the film that get swapped out like one getaway car for another in service of a plot that’s less compelling than any one of them.</p><p>Ultimately, there really isn’t anything  with Crime 101.

In the most technical sense, Nirvanna the Band the Show the Movie exists in that same vein, making it a delight to watch with an audience. However, it’s also a time-travel movie incorporating footage from earlier versions of the concept, forcing the story to twist around itself with head-spinning proficiency, leading to one of the most absurd, laugh-out-loud comedy films in years.</p><p>How exactly do you employ a sci-fi conceit while blurring the lines between real and unreal in a mockumentary where messing with actual people is the point? If you’re Canadian comedians Matt Johnson and Jay McCaroll, who play fictional avatars of themselves and enact hare-brained plans to get hired at a music venue, well…you just do. The result, born from the duo’s against-all-odds creative ethos, is a jaw-dropping blast that constantly raises the same core question as Alfonso Cuarón’s 3D space scorcher,<a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/09/23/gravity-review-2\"></a>: “How the hell did they  this?”  </p><p>For the uninitiated: The legacy sequel, directed by<a href=\"https://www.ign.com/videos/blackberry-official-trailer\"></a> director (and<a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/matt-and-mara-review-tiff-matt-johnson-1235045059/\"></a> actor) Johnson, follows his and McCaroll’s short-lived Viceland TV show from 2017-2018, Nirvanna the Band the Show, itself a sequel to their independent web series Nirvanna the Band, which ran from 2007 to 2009. You don’t need to have seen either one to watch the new movie, since it opens with footage they shot on cheap handycams in 2008, introducing us to the duo’s core dynamic: A hyperactive, fedora-sporting Johnson ropes the more laid-back McCaroll into trying to score a music gig at Toronto bar &amp; restaurant the Rivoli under the copyright-skirting moniker, “Nirvanna the Band.” This is despite them never having actually written a song, or even contacted the venue’s management. After a mini-episode’s worth of buffoonery, the film skips forward to 2025 and finds the makeshift musicians in a state of arrested development. Johnson – who behaves largely the same, but has put on some weight – is still trying to convince a now-haggard McCaroll that his next plan will actually work, at the risk of a potential creative schism.</p><section data-transform=\"quoteBox\">The scenes combining old and new footage shot nearly two decades apart and skillfully spliced together are a fist-pumping triumph.</section><p>This (re)introduction to the characters also serves to convince new viewers to stick around for the ride. It’s hard not to, when Johnson’s latest ploy involves the publicity stunt of parachuting off Toronto’s iconic, nearly 2,000-foot-tall CN Tower, a scheme whose absurd logistics are funny enough until, shockingly, we actually see Johnson and McCaroll con their way up to the top of the structure<a href=\"https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/movies/how-a-scrappy-web-series-became-an-outrageous-cinematic-love-letter-to-toronto-called-nirvanna/article_0db52f93-26b5-49d9-91ee-4fa10c563434.html\"></a>. This dizzying feat – shot by off-screen comrades with hidden HD cameras – doesn’t go exactly as planned (in reality  in the fiction), but it’s pulled off with enough panache that any computer-generated seams are completely invisible, buying loads of goodwill from anyone who might still need convincing.</p><a href=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/10/ntbtstm-still-5-1770762095594.jpg\"><img src=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/10/ntbtstm-still-5-1770762095594.jpg\" title=\"null\"></a><p>Nearly 20 years into trying and failing to play at the Rivoli, McCaroll is at the end of his rope. However, Johnson’s ultimate, galaxy-brained ploy is yet to come – traveling to the year 2008 by turning the pair’s RV into a<a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/12/23/back-to-the-future-review\"></a>-style time machine fueled by a long-defunct Canadian novelty drink. Before they know it, the duo finds themselves in an earlier version of downtown Toronto populated by Goth fashion, billboards for The Dark Knight, and – most impressively of all – younger, wide-eyed versions of themselves, accomplished through a combination of body doubles, ingeniouslyedited archival footage, and meticulously recreated sets. The scenes where the older and younger pairings almost come into contact, combining old and new footage shot nearly two decades apart and skillfully spliced together, are a fist-pumping triumph.</p><p>The movie’s mischievous plot involves not only fetch quests to try to return to 2025, but the hilarious horrors of alternate timelines and even stranger publicity ploys whose staging blurs the lines between fiction and reality. All the while, the story’s emotional core pivots around the now forty-something Johnson and McCaroll coming within inches of their past selves, and in the process, reflecting on this timeline’s Obama-era, iPhone 3G optimism – not to mention the limitless promise of being able to self-distribute video content for the first time. This is in sharp contrast to their many regrets and failures during the intervening years. Much like the recent<a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/jackass-forever-review\"></a>, it’s a prank film about the passage of time, told with the same scrappy DIY sensibility as the original web series, albeit with Johnson employing more crash zooms and rapid movements to emphasize both comedic and dramatic moments. </p><a href=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/10/ntbtstm-still-6-1770761894439.png\"><img src=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/10/ntbtstm-still-6-1770761894439.png\" title=\"null\"></a><p>Will this peek into the past finally convince McCaroll that he’s better off without his over-enthusiastic, man-child bestie? In Nirvanna the Band the Show the Movie, quite literally  is possible, including the production improvising entire plot developments around a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/drake-shooting-toronto-mansion-03741edc5b50c9cab8424c7fa15adab1\"></a> outside the home of Toronto rapper Drake. It’s ambitious and audacious, to say the least.</p><p>Each roguish set piece remains grounded in the emotional dynamic of its leads, who – despite their jejune conduct and sensibilities – imbue these broad, middle-aged-loser versions of themselves with genuine pathos. The movie’s mockumentary style, whose aesthetics are hilariously adjusted for each era, harbors both the daring realism of an elaborate hoax as well as the gooey “aw, shucks” melodrama of two men realizing how much they need each other. It’s a pitch-perfectmedley of styles and a nonstop hoot with a crowd.</p>",

      "content": "<p><em>Cold Storage will be released in theaters on Feb. 13.</em></p><p>For those who have enjoyed certain types of horror-comedy hybrid films through the years, there’s something comforting about <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/movies/cold-storage-2026\"></a>from the start. On-screen text at the opening, which turns an ominous backstory about the remnants of the Skylab space station and what it actually brought down to Earth into a purposely jokey over-the-top display, makes it clear that there’s a “we’re having fun here!” approach. </p><p>That tone continues in the film’s prologue, as an investigation into ghastly deaths in a tiny Australian town caused by a piece of Skylab evokes 1990’s wonderful <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/movies/tremors\"></a>, both with its desert setting and its heightened, funny tone accompanying its horror movie scenario. It’s not full farce or self-parody, but it’s winking just enough, buoyed by some clever visuals from director Jonny Campbell, particularly when it comes to depicting what happens to the oh-so-dangerous fungus discovered at the scene and the passage of time that follows. </p><p>Cold Storage loses some momentum after its great opening, feeling more hit and miss comedically as we pick up 18 years later, when two employees at a 24-hour self-storage warehouse – Travis (Joe Keery) and Naomi (Georgina Campbell) – come into contact with this fungus. The substance has been secretly sitting in hidden levels underneath them; their place of work just so happened to once house a military base. The specific horror-comedy vibe the filmmakers are going for is a tricky one to maintain, and there are beats that don’t quite hit the mark as we get to know Travis, Naomi, and a few other characters that will be significant over the long night they’re about to endure.</p><p>Still, there’s a lot to appreciate throughout, starting with the film’s leads. <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/tv/stranger-things\"></a> fan favorite Keery and <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/movies/barbarian\"></a> star Campbell make for an appealing central duo, with the proper amount of charisma and chemistry to sell the bantering ‘opposites attract’ dynamic between Travis the ex-con and Naomi the aspiring veterinarian. They also have one hell of a pivotal third major player in the form of Liam Freaking Neeson as Robert Quinn, a now retired military veteran we first meet in the prologue.</p><p>Robert gets a heads-up that things are going awry at the storage warehouse and goes to help, even as Travis and Naomi begin to find out just how much trouble they’re in. Again, this film’s tone doesn’t require Neeson to go full <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/movies/the-naked-gun\"></a> as far as sending up his tough guy image to an extreme level, but it does let him show different, gently funny and humanizing sides to his usual action persona, including the fact that Robert has quite a bad back from a previous injury. Yes, this is something begging to be significant in the third act, and thankfully, the film pays it off in a very entertaining manner.</p><a href=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/10/cold-storage-thumb-1770757793311.jpg\"><img src=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/10/cold-storage-thumb-1770757793311.jpg\" title=\"null\"></a><p>Cold Storage is produced and written by David Koepp, adapting his own novel. Koepp has an interesting Hollywood career; he’s a go-to screenwriter for massive studio movies from franchises like <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/movies/jurassic-park\"></a>, <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/movies/mission-impossible\"></a>, <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/movies/spider-man\"></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/movies/indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny\"></a>, but in between those sorts of films, he’s also frequently writing (and sometimes directing) smaller, quirkier projects. And while some of them have been misfires, there have been some notable highlights there as well, including 1999’s compelling ghost story, <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/movies/stir-of-echoes\"></a>, and last year’s terrific Steven Soderbergh-directed spy film, <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/movies/black-bag\"></a>.</p><p>Cold Storage finds Koepp operating outside his usual style with something much more heightened and winky. This is a movie about a fungal outbreak that turns those it infects into zombie-like creatures; it’s also about the long locked up remnants of a previous outbreak accidentally being unleashed, leaving some out-of-their-depth average-joe employees to deal with it. So if there was a shorthand I’d use for this movie, it would be “<a href=\"https://www.ign.com/tv/the-last-of-us-the-series\"></a>meets <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/movies/the-return-of-the-living-dead\"><u>The Return of the Living Dead</u></a>,” and in that regard, while it doesn’t match either of those projects at their best, it’s still quite fun in its own right. </p><p>Koepp and Jonny Campbell add some nice flourishes that keep the film from feeling like a carbon copy of other zombie-adjacent stories (though there are  of familiar elements, of course), including the fact that those infected will eventually just plain explode out of nowhere. That allows for moments that are both surprising and jolting, and also darkly funny and plenty gory. </p><section data-transform=\"quoteBox\">Scripter Koepp and director Campbell add some nice flourishes that keep the film from feeling like a carbon copy of other zombie-adjacent stories.</section><p>In the midst of all this, subplots involve an elderly woman (Vanessa Redgrave, reuniting with her Mission: Impossible screenwriter Koepp 30 years later) coming to the storage place intending to kill herself with a gun; Naomi’s ex showing up after a household accident, also carrying a gun; and an inside job plan by Travis and Naomi’s boss to rob the storage place that night. Is it pretty silly that of these things happen to be going down at this isolated location on the very same night as a potentially world-ending outbreak is simultaneously beginning beneath their feet? Sure, but the jokey, easygoing tone of the movie allows you to let it slide more than you might otherwise. </p><p>Still, there are times where Cold Storage falters. As a<a href=\"https://www.ign.com/movies/prometheus\"></a> apologist, I will say this movie  pushes things in terms of having multiple characters – including those who should  know better – lean in close to something clearly horrible and dangerous occurring in front of them. There’s also just a tiny bit more sentiment included near the very end than what feels right for the overall feel of the story. The movie’s budgetary constraints are also felt in some of the visual effect shots, which are not always the most convincing.</p><p>But TV veteran Jonny Campbell, whose credits include episodes of shows like <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/tv/doctor-who\"></a> and <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/tv/westworld\"></a>, frequently overcomes that budget obstacle with some stylistic shots that are less beholden to sell complete reality. This includes a great sequence showing how the fungus is passing between insects and animals, where the camera hurtles forward and visually leans into everything looking more like CGI animation rather than photorealism. </p><p>Lending solid support is Ellora Torchia () as a military analyst contacted by Neeson’s Robert who ends up being his -like new buddy feeding him crucial info even though they’ve never met in person. There’s also a very likeable, endearing performance by Lesley Manville () as Robert’s old comrade-in-arms who also comes out of retirement to try to help save the day. </p>",

We go round and round, repeating forever. The same events, the same choices, the same conclusions. All of this has happened before, and all of it will happen again. Romeo is a Dead Man, the latest from developer Grasshopper Manufacture and director Suda51, posits a different question: what if time was a sphere? The events might change, but all roads still lead to Rome. It’s a fascinating idea, but also one you shouldn’t rack your brain trying to figure out. This is a time travel story: spend too long trying to piece things together, and you’ll be making diagrams out of straws. In a convenient example of form as function, Romeo is a Dead Man is as fractured as a game as the universe Romeo navigates within it. To tell you the truth, I’m still trying to figure out if I liked it several days after beating it. But I can’t stop  about it, and how its form mirrors its narrative. And that’s not nothing.</p><p>Our tale follows the titular Romeo Stargazer, a sheriff’s deputy in the small town of Deadford (you’re going to notice a pattern with the naming conventions pretty fast, if you haven’t already) in Pennsylvania (okay, not that one).There’s not much to Deadford: it’s known for a potential alien landing site and its “dead” tomatoes. One day, Romeo discovers an amnesiatic woman named Juliet lying in the road. She begs him to kill her, but Romeo’s a good lad (and kind of a doofus), and he falls in love with her instead, despite the super questionable confluence of their names. “No good will come from falling in love with a woman you found in the middle of the road,” his grandfather, genius inventor Benjamin Stargazer, warns. And you know what? He’s right! You wanna be star-crossed lovers, kid? Because this is how you become star-crossed lovers.</p><p>Anyway, they fall in love, agree to elope, and then Romeo gets attacked by a weird creature and dies, but his grandfather saves his life with a super cool helmet, then also dies. Romeo becomes Deadman, space time is shattered by a mysterious incident, and Juliet disappears. The latter two might be connected. Now sustained (and powered-up) by his grandfather’s tech, Romeo is recruited by the FBI’s Space-Time Police and tasked with bringing space-time criminals to justice, tracking down Juliet, and figuring out what, if anything, she has to do with all this. He also gets a bitchin’ jacket that his dead-but-also-not-dead grandfather has somehow transported himself onto. Ol’ Ben also technically invents time travel in the future, making him a literal grandfather paradox. Wild.</p><p>That’s a lot, huh? Listen, this is a Suda51 joint. Weirdness is the name of the game. If I tried to explain all of it to you, I’d probably look like a dude with crazy eyes and a wall of notecards and newspaper clippings connected by red string. The truth is that, even after finishing Romeo is a Dead Man’s 15-hour story, I’m not sure I understand all of it – and hey, neither does Romeo. Talk about feeling like the main character. But for whatever reason, it’s stuck with me. That all of this is conveyed through a combination of cutscenes, comic book pages, and other weird but cool methods as you get deeper in probably didn’t hurt.</p><section data-transform=\"quoteBox\">Romeo is a Dead Man is a game made up of a lot of very disparate ideas.</section><p>Like the Fragmented Universe Romeo finds himself in, Romeo is a Dead Man is a game made up of a lot of very disparate ideas. Missions start on the Space-Time Police’s ship, The Last Night, which is a 2D, sprite-based world where you can hang out with the crew – they’re a weird group that includes Romeo’s mom and sister, as well as FBI Space-Time agents with names like BlueMountain, TheBlack, and RedBrown; one tells you that Deadman is a lame name. From there, you scan the universe for anomalies, pilot The Last Night to them (you mostly pick a destination and hit the gas), blast away at the dimensional monstrosity blocking wherever you need to go with a weapon called Eternal Sleep, and then ride Romeo’s motorcycle across a bridge of light to to your destination. I can’t emphasize enough how ridiculous all of this is, especially when your ship says “FBI” on the side in big bold letters.</p><p>Once you’re where you need to be – which could be Deadford City Hall, a cult enclave in the ‘70s where you run around with a delightful zombie named Jenny, or a haunted asylum, among others – you’re playing a 3D action game where your job is to track down a space-time fugitive and bring them to space-time justice, which usually means fighting a lot of zombies and other monsters who are also here for… reasons. Romeo has access to four melee weapons and four ranged weapons. You’ll have to unlock every one but your starting chainsaw-sword and pistol, but the process is pretty quick. I had them all after the opening mission. Once you do, that’s it. There are no more worlds to conquer, weapon-wise.</p><p>Melee combat is your standard combination of light attack, heavy attack, and dodge that seems to have taken over every modern action game, and I'm kinda wondering why game designers hate blocking so much (unless it’s a ). The cool thing about Romeo's melee combat is that you can chain light and heavy attacks together in any order. It’s not particularly deep – weapons don’t have move lists, and there's nary an Izuna Drop (or anything similar) in sight – but it does feel good, especially against the smaller Rotters. I enjoyed every weapon in Romeo's arsenal, whether it was his standard sword, the combining-and-separating Arcadia or the gauntlet-based Juggernaut, which allows Romeo to pretend he's a boxer… or Dante from Devil May Cry. Even the big, slow sword is cool.</p><p>Against the bigger, badder enemies, you'll want to sheathe your blades and get your hands on some superior firepower, mostly because those enemies come with flower-shaped weak points. There are no bad ranged weapons here: pistol, machine gun, shotgun, they all work great and pack a punch, though I was particularly fond of the rocket-launching Yggdrasil. When something absolutely, positively has to die, accept no substitutes. You may have to reload after every shot, but Romeo's wearing Solid Snake's bandana no matter what smoke wagon you're making guys dead with. “Don’t worry, infinite ammo” baby.</p><p>I admit that I'm kind of mixed on Romeo is a Dead Man's rogues’ gallery. There are a decent number of them, yeah, and the varying nature of their weak points is nice, but Grasshopper shows you all of its cards pretty early on, and by the end you'll have seen these cats That said, I do really like things like the Jellies, which force you to disperse their oozing exterior with a melee weapon before you can do real damage to the body beneath. </p><section data-transform=\"quoteBox\">Combat isn't particularly deep, but it does feel good, especially against smaller foes.</section><p>Either way, killing enemies builds blood, which can be spent on Bloody Summer, a very strong attack that also regenerates some of Romeo’s health. Each weapon has its own version of this move, and you can also use it while dodging or jumping for some variety. It’s a good way to dish out the hurt and manage Romeo’s health without dipping into his limited healing items.</p><p>Bafflingly but perhaps unsurprisingly, Romeo is a Dead Man borrows elements from the Soulslike genre. (If you were ever looking for a sentence with a 100% success rate in the “typing this made Will sad” category, there’s a winner.) Space-Time Pharmacies serve as save and fast travel points and restore your health and healing items, but also respawn any enemies you’ve killed. There’s no penalty for dying; you don’t drop the currency you’ve earned from killing enemies. Instead, you actually roll a roulette wheel that provides buffs to things like attack, defense, blood gain, and so on, courtesy of Romeo’s mom. Without other consequences, respawning enemies can make death and saving annoying in what is a fairly linear action game. I guess you could argue that it might fit thematically with each death or use of the Space-Time Pharmacy creating a parallel universe or something, but mostly it just feels weird and makes certain segments repetitive.</p><p>Even the bosses aren't immune to repetition, and you'll see the same mini-bosses multiple times. The space-time criminals that cap off each stage are one of one, but even these fights aren't total home runs. There’s a couple of really good ones, like the hard-charging Death Changeling, but you have seen these archetypes before and some are… less good. Sorry, Fused Reanimated, but instant kill attacks are never fun. The reality is fighting bigger enemies (and bosses) often means exploiting their weak points with your guns, leaving melee weapons in a kind of weird limbo. Romeo is a Dead Man's combat isn’t bad, per se, but I do wish there was more to it.</p><p>Thankfully, Romeo isn’t alone, or at least doesn’t have to be. You can find seeds scattered throughout spacetime that allow you to grow Bastards (yes, this is what they’re actually called) aboard The Last Night. Bastards are friendly zombies that can be summoned in combat and do things like serve as sentry cannons, heal you, shoot chain lightning, fire weakness flowers at baddies, and even run at enemies and explode. They’re cool to have around and incredibly useful – though Romeo is a Dead Man does a poor job of emphasizing that; I had to fuse a bunch together late game to get some strong enough to help me out because I’d largely ignored them until then (and growing them is its own process I will get into later).</p><p>The places you’ll do all this fighting are pretty grand. They’re largely not remarkable spaces in and of themselves, but what’s cool is subspace. Romeo, being a space-time cop, can access subspace, which is another dimension parallel to the one he’s in. But he can't do it whenever he wants. He has to find TVs showing a dude eating steak and saying weird and sometimes cryptic things to him, and he can enter subspace from there. Subspace is generally made out of neon rectangles that form paths and structures beneath your feet, but because subspace is parallel to real space, it kind of sits on top of the normal environments. The long and short of it is that paths blocked in real space might not be in subspace and vice versa, and you’ll often have to find your way to another TV to get around roadblocks in whatever dimension you’re in. </p><p>Solving puzzles in subspace will open up new paths (and new TVs to reemerge into the real world from), and finding keys in subspace will open blocked paths in the real world. I enjoyed seeing how these dimensions fit together, and subspace is usually combat free, so it’s a nice change of pace. The only downside is that subspace looks very samey, so it can be easy to get lost if you need to backtrack or forget what TV you came out of. Thankfully, Romeo is a Dead Man clues you in by having the guy inside the TV say something new once you find a new TV. Thanks, chief.</p><p>If you need a break or want to upgrade Romeo, you can head back to The Last Night from any Space-Time Pharmacy. In addition to the cool sprite art and crew, The Last Night is also home to a shop where you can buy food, materials, and equipable pins that up your numbers. You can also tend to your Bastard garden (you gotta plant those seeds, you know?), cook stat-boosting curry with Romeo’s mom, and refine space debris into weapon upgrade materials. </p><p>The best part of The Last Night is how tactile it is. You want a new Bastard? You gotta manually go to the garden, have Luna (Romeo’s sister) appraise your seeds, plant them, and then come back and pull them out of the ground when they’re done. If you want to upgrade them, you have to fuse two together manually. Wanna fight a boss you’ve taken down again? You have to talk to a specific guy. You want curry? You have to play the minigame to make it every time. My favorite example is the little arcade game that you play to level Romeo up, spending the currency you collect to travel what is essentially a ghostless Pac-Man maze. How you do it is up to you, but  There’s no “oh, just level me up” option. Even something as simple as taking on optional challenges for rewards (decent stand-alone dungeons where you fight through to the end and so on) requires traveling to them physically. Romeo is a Dead Man forces you to live in its world. </p><p>Some folks will consider this repetition for the sake of it, but a lot of Romeo is a Dead Man happens over and over again. Each night, he has a nightmare and spills the drink on his nightstand when he wakes up. Each time you find a new fugitive, you perform the same series of actions to defeat the Dimensional Seer blocking your path forward and get to where they are. Each time you take a space-time criminal down, the credits roll. This is a time travel multiverse story; the point is that the same events are going to happen a lot. They’ll change, but the destination is the same. Remember the sphere? In the end, you always end up in the same place. By forcing you to engage with the repetitive nature of its world, Romeo is a Dead Man tells its story through its gameplay. It’s rad. Does it always work? No. I never found much use for the curry (and many of the other supplemental items). But I'm kind of eager to dive into New Game+ and see if it changes anything, because… well, multiverse time travel story, right? If time really is a sphere, it might not matter, which might make Romeo's use of New Game+ even cooler.</p>",

Its wacky, over-the-top take on tennis is at its best when you have four friends together on the couch. And for the first time since the GameCube era, series developer Camelot has delivered an entry that feels feature complete on day one, with the most unique characters, solo and multiplayer modes, and silly gimmicks we’ve ever seen crammed into a Mario Tennis game. Sadly, that doesn’t mean it’s all content, as the single-player adventure once again comes up woefully short in terms of both its length and quality. But when playing locally or online, Fever’s tight, responsive controls and crazy abilities result in a chaotic party game that’s a lot of fun in short bursts.</p><p>The headline twist this time around are the mighty Fever Rackets, which dominate the action. There are 30 to choose from, and each comes with a unique special ability that can swing the game in your favor. Those powers are activated by pulling off a Fever Shot once your gauge is full, and they range from offensive, like planting a rotating Fire Bar straight from <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-bros\">Super Mario Bros.</a> on your opponent’s side of the court, to defensive, like creating a shadow double of yourself to cover more ground. They can also block your screen with ink, litter piles of banana peels on both sides of the court, or grant time-limited buffs, like making your shots curvier for the next 20 seconds. </p><p>The Fever Rackets are a blast to experiment with, and their inclusion adds a different flavor to each match. At their best, they force you to think about all the special quirks in play. If I place a slippery sheet of ice on one quadrant of my rival’s turf, we both know I’m probably going to try and hit my next shot right at it to force them onto the uncomfortable terrain. Or… will I? Shot placement in tennis is full of mindgames, and the Fever Racket’s transformative effects enhance that dynamic. </p><p>There are also checks and balances to each that are fun to uncover. The Bullet Bill Racket transforms the ball into a wicked fast line drive that appearsoverpowered at first glance, until you learn it can be easily neutralized by playing up close at the net. And when both players use this racket, it can result in a hilarious, rapid Bullet Bill rally that usually ends with a demoralizing body shot. Mixing and matching racket types to see what happens is great, which is why it really bothers me that there’s no way to randomly select your Fever Racket for either human players or CPU opponents, as it would be fun to try to make the most of the cards you’re dealt. You randomly select characters and courts, just not rackets, so that feels like a prime candidate to be added in a post-launch update.</p><section data-transform=\"quoteBox\">The Fever Rackets are a blast to experiment with, and they add a different flavor to each match.</section><p>Some Fever Rackets are definitely stronger than others, but Mario Tennis Fever adds a smart mechanic to somewhat balance them out. When a player initiates a Fever Shot, most offensive effects don’t take place until the ball hits the ground, leading to a tense back-and-forth volley where both players desperately try to hit the ball before it bounces. You have to be confident in choosing which one to bring into the match and when to unleash it, because the wrong decision can see your opponent sending your big shot right back at you. </p><p>On the flipside, Fever Rackets can also make things feel more luck-based at times, especially in doubles. Four separate powers in play can lead to courts that are completely covered in mud, fire, and unregulated chaos, similar to playing <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/12/06/super-smash-bros-ultimate-review\"><u>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</u></a> with all items cranked to the max. When your health hits zero – which forces you to sit on the sidelines in doubles or move at a slower speed in singles – it often doesn’t feel like your fault because of how unavoidable taking damage becomes. Even your doubles partner’s Fever Shot can hurt you. This isn’t necessarily bad; Fever just leans harder into the party game side of things than its predecessor, <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/06/20/mario-tennis-aces-review\"></a>, which almost resembled a competitive fighting game with high-level mechanics like bar management and perfect blocks.</p><p>To account for all the mayhem that Fever Rackets entail, the actual tennis is a bit simpler. The overall speed is slightly slower and floatier, last-second dives for the ball make mistakes less punishing, and the court is a little smaller, meaning it’s easier to reach cross-court shots and keep a point going. I understand this choice: Aces’ intense pace combined with Fever’s increased madness would probably be too much to keep up with. On one hand, I miss the more hardcore version of tennis Aces provided. I played that game online for years because of its high skill ceiling and rewarding mechanics – it was a truly inspired take on the sport. On the other hand, Fever is way more fun to invite friends over to play for a casual game night since it’s easier for newcomers to pick up. It’s worse as a competitive tennis game, but better as a party tennis game. Plus, most modes let you use a high-speed ball that leads to a more upbeat rhythm, even if it doesn’t entirely resolve my disappointment that Aces’ thrilling trick shots, racket health, and time-bending abilities have been replaced.</p><p>That said, it still feels really good to anticipate where the ball is going, get in position, and release a fully-charged topspin shot, complete with great, punchy sound effects. Camelot has been refining the same control scheme of drop shots, lobs, and angled smashes for decades, and it’s still fun to return to, especially with CPUs that actually put up a fight at higher difficulties and the largest roster the series has ever seen. There are 38 characters to choose from, each with their own stats and unique traits. Newcomer Baby Waluigi has been a breakout star online, but I’ve actually gravitated towards the overlooked Baby Wario, whose powered-up topspin shot helps me control the pace of each point. I’m also happy to see the <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-review\">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> redesigns of DK and Diddy Kong show up.</p><p>The character models are probably the best-looking part of Fever, with detailed clothes and facial animations, like the texture on Luigi’s shirt or even more bristles in Mario’s mustache than before. However, it doesn’t blow me away visually as a Switch 2 exclusive. Its cartoony art style looks good, as Mario games generally do, but it doesn’t feel like a significant leap forward. It targets 60 fps and hits that, but I noticed a few times in splitscreen doubles matches where it dipped before the ball was served. At least it’s always consistent when it matters most during the point, even with all the wild Fever effects on screen.</p><p>Keeping in line with Fever’s GameCube spirit, you have to unlock a bunch of characters, rackets, courts, and special costumes by clearing specific challenges, playing a certain number of matches, and progressing through the Adventure mode. Recent Mario sport games have tied progression and unlockables to online play, so it was a welcome sight to boot up Fever for the first time and see I had plenty to chase that wasn’t tied to my internet connection. That is, until I booted up the Adventure mode and discovered what I was in for.</p><p>If you’re primarily looking forward to Mario Tennis Fever because of its single-player Adventure mode, I’m sad to share that it’s easily the most underwhelming part of this package. Mario, Luigi, Peach, Wario, and Waluigi get transformed into babies, and Mario must regain his tennis skills to save everyone, for some reason. It starts out promising, with a few gorgeous early cutscenes that throw Mario and friends into unexpected situations. Camelot upholds its reputation for surprisingly great cinematics like this, but the Adventure mode only goes downhill from there. </p><p>The first 90 minutes of this disappointingly short three-and-a-half hour campaign take place at a tennis academy, where Baby Mario undergoes painfully drawn-out, simplistic tutorials about the basics. You complete fairly one-note minigames to increase your stats, mash through text that reiterates each shot type, and partake in ridiculously easy qualification matches to move up the ranks. Throughout, you are also quizzed on your tennis knowledge, like one stumper where I was asked which character type was known for its speed: all-around, defensive, or Take a guess. This is clearly meant for young kids playing their first Mario Tennis game, and “Tutorial” would’ve been a more appropriate name than “Adventure”. It would be more enjoyable if the writing was funny or clever, but the characters all say very vanilla things that essentially only exist to teach you how to play. This is a far cry from <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/10/03/golf-story-review\"></a>, which remains the gold standard for how to do a proper campaign in an arcadey sports game that combines strong writing, interesting challenges, and off-the-wall diversions, all of which are missing here.</p><section data-transform=\"quoteBox\">Adventure mode is filled with drawn-out tutorials and one-note minigames.</section><p>You eventually leave the academy to progress through a comically small world map. This part of Adventure strongly resembles Aces’ campaign, where you use your tennis skills to fight a handful of bosses and solve very light puzzles. There are a few challengers to find, but there’s a surprising lack of tennis matches in this tennis campaign – and just when I felt like things were ramping up, it was over, so I shrugged and moved onto the other single-player offerings.</p><p>Tournament mode is a staple of Mario Tennis, and this is unfortunately one of its worst forms. Playing through three separate brackets to win trophies is fine as always, but Fever introduces an announcer in the form of a Talking Flower from <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-bros-wonder-review\">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a> who never stops commentating. He reacts to every single shot, and I felt like I’d heard all of his voice lines multiple times before even wrapping up my second tournament. It gets grating very quickly, and I can’t imagine even kids would enjoy the nonstop commentary. The Talking Flower is turned on for all modes by default, but thankfully you can disable it everywhere… except in Tournament and Adventure.</p><p>The runaway best single-player mode is Trial Towers, a new addition that reminds me of <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/12/03/super-smash-bros-melee\"></a>’s Events. Each trial throws a specific setup at you, like a match where your Fever Gauge is always full or a battle of three babies against a giant Bowser, and it’s up to you to figure out how to exploit the setup and win a brief five-point match. There are even optional, difficult achievements for completionists, like winning without taking damage, or never losing a point. It’s a lot of fun working your way through each challenge, and incorporating this concept into an Adventure mode with unique characters and an interesting story should be the way forward for this series.</p><p>As always, Mario Tennis Fever shines in multiplayer, and there’s plenty of flexibility in that department. You can compete online in ranked matches split, between singles and doubles, either with Fever Rackets or without them. Winning boosts your point total as you work to improve your letter grade, with rankings scheduled to reset at the start of each month. I was only able to play online for a couple hours before launch, but my experience was smooth. In addition to playing with up to four people locally, you can bring two people from one console into a private online lobby and set up any type of casual match you’d like. </p><p>When you want something besides the standard tennis, you and your friends can pick a special match like the motion-control-focused Swing Mode, the traditional Ring Shot mode where you compete to score the most points by hitting the ball through rings floating above the net, a pinball court that uses bumpers and paddles, or a court that introduces Mario Wonder’s Wonder Effects like floating hippos. These range from decent distractions, like carefully aiming your Fever Shots at Piranha Plants to grow the size of your opponent’s court, to completely uninteresting, like repeatedly lobbing and dropshotting the ball just out of reach of a mindless CPU opponent upwards of 30 times in a row.</p><p>It doesn’t take long for even the best special modes to get repetitive, and I found myself quickly going back to the standard tennis matches. Thankfully, that specific mode has more than enough to shake things up thanks to the large roster of characters and rackets, but it ends up feeling like too much of a good thing. Fever is still a lot of fun in briefer sessions, but when I think of the breadth of worthwhile content found in Nintendo’s other recent multiplayer options like <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-review\">Kirby Air Riders</a> or <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-party-jamboree-review\">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a>, Fever comes up a bit short. After 20 hours, I already feel like I’ve had my fill, and I see it as more of a fun distraction to play for a few minutes here and there while my group warms up for something else rather than one that’s going to get a serious amount of playtime.</p>",

By ditching the microswitches that have been used in <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gaming-mouse\"></a> for decades, Logitech’s new model delivers noticeably snappier left and right clicks and fascinating new tuning options. It won’t make you a pro player overnight, but it narrows the gap like never before – and it looks essential for actual esports players, whose intense interest in the X2 massively accelerated its development.</p><h2>Logitech G Pro X2 Superstrike – Design, HITS and Shape</h2><p>The Pro X2 Superstrike gets its super powers from what Logitech calls HITS, or a ‘Haptic Inductive Trigger System’. It’s a fancy way of saying the X2 uses an analog sensor to detect how far each main mouse button has been pressed, while a haptic motor beneath rumbles to signify that a click has been recognised, aping the normal tactile feedback you’d expect with a surprising degree of fidelity. Mechanical <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gaming-keyboard\">gaming keyboards</a> have used analogue sensors like this for nearly a decade, but they still relied on the physical movement of a switch to signify a key press – so Logitech’s solution feels like a mixture between this and the haptic feedback Apple has been building into its MacBook trackpads since 2015.</p><p>The benefits are easier than I expected to feel in person.</p><p>First, you can set the X2 to react to a button-press after just 0.1mm of travel, rather than the 0.6mm commonly seen in gaming mice using traditional optical or mechanical microswitches. That near-elimination of physical movement hugely reduces input latency – the ‘up to 30ms’ quoted in Logitech’s marketing materials is an order of magnitude more than the speed-up you see from polling rates jumping from 1000Hz (1ms) to 8000Hz (0.125ms), for example. </p><a href=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/09/20260209-121327-1770670538922.jpg\"><img src=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/09/20260209-121327-1770670538922.jpg\" title=\"undefined\"></a><p>The benefit here is fairly obvious: if you come around a corner in <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/games/counter-strike-2\">Counter-Strike 2</a> and spot another player just as they spot you, your bullets will be recognised by the server a few ticks before they start firing back, all else being equal, which makes it a lot easier to kill rather than be killed.</p><p>Secondly, the X2 supports rapid trigger, another feature brought over from mechanical keyboards. This is a mode where, rather than button presses and releases being detected based on physically moving past a set threshold, they’re detected based on a change of direction. For example, if you wanted to right click as fast as possible to move your champion and dodge spells in <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/games/league-of-legends\">League of Legends</a>, you would ideally be somewhere in the middle of the mouse button’s travel distance, quickly moving up and down without waiting for the mouse to fully reset. On a traditional mouse, this would only work just around the 0.6mm actuation point, but on the X2, this works anywhere, making the technique much more consistent. </p><p>The move from a traditional microswitch below the left and right mouse buttons to the Haptic Inductive Trigger System has required some internal adjustments, with a thinner chassis and base plate, titanium screws and a ventilated PCB. These changes trimmed 7g from the initial 68g prototype, allowing the mouse to hit a final kerb weight of 61g - just a gram heavier than the Superlight 2.</p><a href=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/09/20260209-121158-1770670402191.jpg\"><img src=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/09/20260209-121158-1770670402191.jpg\" title=\"undefined\"></a><p>Elsewhere, surprisingly little has changed from the <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/logitech-g-pro-x-superlight-2-review\"></a> to the X2. Logitech’s new mouse possesses exactly the same shape as its forebear – it’s a medium-sized, gently-sloping symmetric potato, in contrast to the miniaturized <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/logitech-pro-x-superlight-2c-mouse-review\"></a> or ergonomic <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-best-ultra-light-mouse-for-fps-csgo-valorant#superlight2\"></a>. It’s not surprising that Logitech is sticking with a proven ‘safe’ shape that works for the vast majority of hand sizes and grip styles to start off, and I’m sure we’ll see the same Superstrike tech in a compact or ergonomic design at some stage. The side buttons also remain of traditional stock, and feel a little odd next to the nearly silent main mouse buttons.</p><p>The X2 Superstrike also gets a bit of an external glow-up, with black left and right buttons and some extra wordmarks contrasting nicely with an otherwise white body. Of course, this is Logitech we’re talking about, so I expect to see a magenta version – or another tasteful alternative color scheme – before too long.</p><h2>Logitech G Pro X2 Superstrike – Gaming Performance and Battery Life</h2><p>It’s rare that you can plonk down a new gaming peripheral and feel a difference before you’ve even hit the loading screen of a game, but that’s exactly what I got with the Superstrike. Just clicking on the play button in Steam feels more snappy and immediate; it’s the same tight and connected feeling you might experience when using a <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gaming-monitor\">high refresh rate gaming monitor</a> for the first time. </p><p>In-game, the difference is more profound. I wouldn’t say that it felt like , exactly, but there’s a thrilling sense of ease when it comes to clicking heads in a Counter-Strike 2 or <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6\">Battlefield 6</a> deathmatch. Single-hit kill weapons like the AWP or AK-47 in Counter-Strike feel deadlier than ever before, and spray-and-pray guns like SMGs still feel pretty hooked up. Of course, you’ll still live or die based on your map knowledge, muscle memory and general awareness – a healthy course of CS2 matches proves that there’s plenty more I need to practice to get good – but having a rapid left click feels like a valuable way to even the odds.</p><p>Notably, the Superstrike also doesn’t need de-tuning to feel totally natural in other games, either. After selecting the fastest actuation settings and enabling rapid trigger, I was expecting a rough time surfing the web or clicking on static targets in strategy game <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/games/battletech\">Battletech</a>, but I didn’t experience accidental misclicks or other issues whatsoever. That was a pleasant surprise, and led to an extremely easy adaptation process.</p><p>While the Superstrike represents a night-and-day difference versus the Superlight 2 when it comes to gaming, its battery life figures are competitive with the older mouse. The G Hub software does warn you that increasing the amount of haptic feedback can reduce longevity, but I used the mouse at 1000Hz with haptics set to 3/5, and the mouse easily lasted through around 20 hours of testing while dropping from 75% to just under 50%. Logitech quotes 90 hours of constant motion for the X2, versus 95 hours for the Superlight 2, so if the predecessor was fine for you, this will be too.</p><h2>Logitech G Pro X2 Superstrike – Software and Connectivity</h2><p>Like the Superlight 2, the Superstrike uses <a href=\"https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/software/ghub\">Logitech’s G Hub software</a> for settings adjustments, with no web option available just yet. Here, you get all of the same options as before – sensitivity, key binds, polling rates, and so on – plus the new tunable left and right mouse buttons. </p><p>The new HITS settings include actuation distance (how far you have to press for a click to register), rapid trigger sensitivity, and haptic feedback strength. There’s not a huge amount to tweak, but you can independently set up HITS on each of your left and right mouse buttons and share your settings with a single code, in case you want to mimic the setup used by a pro (or your friend Ross). I also appreciated the inclusion of a live read-out of your button presses, so you can see exactly how far you’re pressing down and choose your settings accordingly.</p><p>The best thing you can do in the settings to understand the mouse is completely disable the haptic feedback. Instantly, the X2 feels like a dead fish, even though it still clicks exactly as well as before – underscoring the magic that Logitech's engineers have achieved here with the artificial tactile response.</p><p>Connectivity is also the same as the Superlight 2, with wired USB and 2.4GHz Lightspeed wireless being the only options – Bluetooth has been excised in that nearly limitless push to cut weight and less useful features for the competitive gaming crowd.</p><p><em>Will is deputy tech editor for IGN, specialising in PC hardware, sim racing and display tech.

I now understand why she opted to put the title in quotation marks, because this is by no means a faithful homage. It's shallow fan fiction that has more in common with E.L. James's Fifty Shades of Grey than Brontë's unflinching portrait of obsessive love, vengeance, the violence of class, racism and generational trauma. If, as Fennell has <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly0nnrr48ko\"></a>, this is her teenage recollection of Wuthering Heights, then it speaks more to the white affluence of her upbringing than Brontë's novel.</p><p>The writer-director dispenses with the book's beginning and end, as well as multiple characters who fully contextualize the toxic atmosphere of the eponymous estate. Instead, she opens with black and the grunting sounds of a man. Is he having sex? No, he's being strangled to death in a contrived public hanging scene, gleefully watched by young heroine Catherine Earnshaw (Charlotte Mellington), as other kids laugh at his \"stiffy\" and the camera follows some common folk engaging in promiscuity. This sets the highly sexualized tone for the rest of the film, charting Cathy's sexual awakening from child to \"spinster,\" as her father, Mr. Earnshaw (Martin Clunes), calls her, once Margot Robbie takes over the role. </p><p>There's been valid criticism of the whitewashing of \"dark-skinned gipsy\" orphan Heathcliff, a role shared by Owen Cooper and <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/videos/wuthering-heights-official-trailer\">Jacob Elordi, who washes up at Wuthering Heights</a> via Mr. Earnshaw – no longer the novel's loving adoptive parent but redrawn in, from the book, Hindley Earnshaw's revolting, drunken likeness (Hindley being his son, who doesn't appear in the film). But Robbie's casting is equally ill-fitted. The novel's Catherine is a dark-haired, dark-eyed teen, whose unruly stubbornness and violent love that she shares with a similarly-aged Heathcliff speaking volumes for their juvenile nature. </p><p>Robbie looks amazing for 35, but here her age works against the authenticity of Catherine's youthful recklessness. She struggles to exude the naivety of a teen who thinks she can have her cake and eat it, by having both Heathcliff and the social status of wealthy Edgar Linton (Shazad Latif), after he moves into the nearby Thrushcross Grange and proposes.</p><section data-transform=\"quoteBox\">It all feels too forced, like a sales bin, smutty romance novel come to life, working too hard to hide the erasure of Brontë's far more complex ideas.</section><p>Robbie and Elordi are obviously very attractive people, and with the number of steamy sex scenes shoehorned in, you'd be forgiven for thinking this amounts to palpable chemistry. But it all feels too forced, like a sales bin, smutty romance novel come to life, working too hard to hide the erasure of Brontë's far more complex ideas about the hell of societal convention.</p><p>That's due in large part to the script, which ignores the Gothic supernatural elements and too often paraphrases Brontë's earnest, expressive dialogue in key scenes. Fans hoping to hear Catherine's \"If all else perished, and he remained\" speech will be left wanting. It also strips away the compelling social commentary about Heathcliff's ethnic ambiguity and sanitizes the brutality of his revenge narrative, softening Heathcliff's aggressive cruelty into something coldly charismatic. His Yorkshire accent isn't bad, but Elordi's performance recalls his Euphoria character, Nate, more than Brontë's antagonistic antihero.</p><p>Supporting players like Nelly (Hong Chau) and Isabella Linton (Alison Oliver) fare better. While Nelly's backstory is changed from servant to bastard companion, Chau affords Nelly a quiet composure as a vulnerable witness to (and sometimes meddler in) Catherine and Heathcliff's destructive romance. As Edgar's ward (she's his sister in the book), Oliver nails Isabella's sickly sweet innocence. Even as the film weirdly pushes Isabella to evoke the spirit of Brontë's Catherine, she brings a deviant edge to her infatuation with Heathcliff. It's a wonder they didn't just cast the Irish actor as the lead.</p><p>The same could be said for Latif, who, as a mixed British-Pakistani actor, better fits the profile of Heathcliff. The novel even describes him as a \"little Lascar,\" the name for a sailor from the Indian subcontinent. Where Brontë's Edgar is laced with snobbish hostility towards Heathcliff, thus becoming a mighty catalyst for the low-born lad to exact revenge against him, Latif's iteration barely registers. He rarely engages with his rival and, as with the silk wallpaper modelled after Catherine's skin, serves merely as window dressing. His color blind casting ticks the box for diversity, but Fennell gives him little character to work with. </p><p>Her approach to the class divide feels somewhat hackneyed, too. The lilt of the Yorkshire accent is relegated to the lower class, where Fennell throws in sexual deviancy as a marker, too. Film and TV frequently stereotype the Yorkshire accent this way, but the Earnshaws aren't landed gentry; they didn't require posh accents like the Lintons to reinforce the upstairs-downstairs dynamic. </p><p>Cinematographer Linus Sandgren does capture the tumultuous beauty of the Yorkshire Moors and the stormy atmosphere of the Heights estate, but the production design of Thrushcross Grange is jarringly anachronistic. It becomes a Gothic Barbie Dreamhouse (derogatory), with the costuming, though beautiful, more in keeping with an Alice in Wonderland film. Throw in Charli xcx's pulsating original songs and Anthony Willis's overwhelming score, and you've got a bombastic world that does more to distract than solidify the emotional journey of these iconic literary figures.</p><p>I don't believe all book-to-screen adaptations need to be carbon copies. And maybe if you haven't read the novel, \"Wuthering Heights\" will work for you. But I must have read a different book in my teens than Fennell, because her vision obscures my memory of it – as it will for many Wuthering Heights fans out there.</p>",

Or rather zombie Spear.</p><p>But look, zombie Spear Spear deep down, even if it’s not obvious at first. And this episode is about Mira figuring that out, after their surprising reunion at the end of last week, even if it’s proving more difficult for Fang to come to terms with this new incarnation of her best friend.</p><p>Mira always sort of represented the best of the best of us, even by anachronistic pre-history standards, and so while it’s clear that she knows this is a (somewhat) revived Spear, she also seems willing to accept him for what he is now, even if he can’t quite form words or, well, sit down without some difficulty. (Also, his arm literally is falling off by episode’s end.) But, where it counts, he’s still the Spear she used to know, namely when putting himself on the line to save those he loves. That’s what got him in this whole being an undead zombie situation in the first place, after all.</p><p>And so in “The Dead Cast No Shadow,” when the threat of the week arrives – detestable baboon-type things – Spear wastes no time doing whatever he needs to in order to protect his people. This is clear in the neat moment when he has to go back and try two or three times to run up a tree in order to throw himself across to another tree branch. He gets it eventually, but he wasn’t giving up until he did (which certainly can’t be helping with the whole body falling apart situation).</p><p>As for Fang, look – who can blame the old girl for being confused and upset by this reunion? When Spear basically retells his story, in pantomime, of what’s happened since his resurrection, right down to the <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/primal-season-3-episode-3-review-recap-feast-of-flesh\"></a> he performed two weeks ago, it’s sad to see how close and yet how far he is from being normal again. But it’s also a howling, disturbing freak show, so it’s no wonder that Fang would back off – and want to keep her babies away from Spear as well. Fang is an animal, don’t forget, and zombie Spear surely doesn’t have the same scent that living Spear did. He looks different too, and he’s threatening in his manner at times. Fang’s guard is up.</p><section data-transform=\"quoteBox\">As for Fang, look – who can blame the old girl for being confused and upset by this reunion? </section><p>The close-ups of Mira and Spear as they try to reconnect are so expressive that it’s that much sadder when Spear can’t comprehend that Mira is carrying his child. When he scrawls all over her dirt drawing of a pregnant woman, it’s disappointing for Mira and the viewer, but also… what is Spear drawing exactly? It seems like it’s more than just scribbles.</p><p>By episode’s end, this family is fully reunited, if dysfunctional, with Fang still suspicious of the new Spear. But her pups love him, plopping down in his lap to cuddle – what other sign of approval do you need? – and Mira has accepted his new state, for now anyway. And yet, it still feels like things are going to come to a head between the former partners Fang and Spear…</p><p><strong>Questions and Notes From Anachronistic History</strong></p><ul><li>Pour one out for the last two members of Mira’s rescue party from her village who were big into magic and rituals, but not great at staying alive. They were primed to become the sort of Abbott and Costello of this season, but alas, they didn’t make it.</li><li>Blueface and Redhead, aka Blue and Red Jr. – that’s what I’m calling Fang’s pups for now on, or at least until we get official names for them – are hungry all the time, and it’s hilarious.</li><li>Spear out-hunting Fang is reminiscent of that Season 1 episode when Fang kept out-hunting Spear shortly after they met.</li><li>Does it seem like the animals we’re encountering in Season 3 are a bit closer to modern creatures than in previous seasons?</li></ul>",

While well-received critically upon its original 2009 release, <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/games/yakuza-3\">Yakuza 3’s</a> sluggish combat and uneven story pacing has seen it age about as well as leftover sashimi, leaving it to linger at the back of the pack while the Like a Dragon series has pushed forward into exciting turn-based twists and experimental spin-offs. Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties, then, is a much-needed retooling that ratchets up the fun factor of its fighting and smooths out most of its unwanted story creases, resulting in an enjoyable return to the largely underused island setting of Okinawa – even if not all of its changes and additions were powerful enough to uppercut me off my feet.</p><p>Although it received an HD remaster in 2019, I must admit I haven’t revisited <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/games/yakuza-3\">Yakuza 3</a> since it first debuted on PlayStation 3 because I couldn’t bear the thought of once again battling my way through its annoyingly block-happy hordes. The bulk of <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/games/yakuza-3\">Yakuza 3’s</a> enemies were so stubbornly resilient to Kazuma Kiryu’s attacks that getting further than a few hits into a combo was a struggle; instead of gleefully breaking jaws, <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/games/yakuza-3\">Yakuza 3’s</a> fighting felt more like painfully pulling teeth.</p><p>Thankfully, that has all changed with Kiwami 3, which dramatically speeds up enemy encounters and endows Kiryu with two flexible fighting styles to cover all his thug-bashing bases. His default stance is classic Dragon of Dojima, a mix of satisfyingly weighty combo attacks and wrestling-style grapples that hit harder than a shotgunned can of Suntory Highball. As entertaining as that is, however, I found myself largely relying on his secondary stance, which arms him with eight different weapons. Those range from the baton-like tonfa to inflict stun, a pair of scythes to inflict bleed, brass knuckles to break guards, a shield to deflect blades and bullets, and a pair of nunchucks to regularly look like a total badarse with. </p><p>It’s a versatile and violent fighting style that transforms Kiryu into a lightning-fast, leisure suit-wearing shinobi, and it’s supremely intuitive to pick up. There’s no manual weapon switching or inventory management to fiddle with, since everything in his sharp-edged arsenal is triggered by a seamless combination of tapping and holding the three main attack buttons, allowing you to go from slapping a group of gangsters with a wooden boat oar to flinging a pointy pair of sai at their throat without even the slightest pause in the action. The original <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/games/yakuza-3\">Yakuza 3</a> may have ultimately had more weapons to choose from, but given how quickly they would break I rarely bothered to actually use them, and thus I found Kiwami 3’s Swiss Army Knife-style fighting stance a vastly improved method for dealing out wanton destruction using the contents of a Ninja Turtle’s toy chest.  </p><section data-transform=\"quoteBox\">Kiwami 3’s Swiss Army Knife-style fighting stance [is] a vastly improved method for dealing out wanton destruction using the contents of a Ninja Turtle’s toy chest.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</section><p>Kiwami 3’s combat doesn’t just feel smoother and more satisfying, it looks a lot flashier too. As was the case with the previous Kiwami remakes, Kiwami 3’s visual design has been boosted to bring it inline with the more modern entries, from the vastly improved character models to the firework-like particle effects that spark off Kiryu’s furious fists. This aesthetic overhaul extends to the environments too, and I was particularly pleased to explore the remodelled slice of Okinawa that features heavily in Kiwami 3’s opening half, since it’s a region that’s rarely been revisited in subsequent Yakuza and Like a Dragon adventures. Its sun-kissed coastal town vibes contrast nicely with Kamurocho’s hustle and bustle, making it akin to <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/games/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth\">Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth’s</a> Hawaii – albeit on a significantly smaller scale.  </p><h2>What’s the Story, Morning Glory?</h2><p>While Kiwami 3 broadly retains the same outline of the original game’s story, which centres on a spiteful turf war in Okinawa, the developers have treated the plot like a street thug and given it a good punch up. In the original <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/games/yakuza-3\">Yakuza 3</a>, certain chapters confined Kiryu to the Morning Glory orphanage he runs for lengthy periods of time, presenting precious little beyond slowly paging through text-based conversations with its pint-sized residents. Thankfully, Kiwami 3’s structure has been reshuffled to make these sleepy seaside sections entirely optional beyond an initial set of mandatory tutorials, meaning you now have the choice of either taking the time to forge bonds with these little Okinawan Oliver Twists, or just hurrying back to black-belting the Pocari Sweat out of every mobster yakuzin’ for a bruisin’ in the world outside the orphanage’s walls.</p><p>If you’d have given me the option of skipping these slice of life segments in the original <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/games/yakuza-3\">Yakuza 3</a> I’d likely have taken it, yet surprisingly in Kiwami 3 I found myself growing more invested in the plight of Morning Glory’s munchkins than I ever did before. That’s thanks to a smart use of snackable mini-games that transform humdrum domestic chores into stimulating diversions. You can complete the kids’ algebra homework against the clock, go spearfishing for flounder and then transform those ingredients into a meal in an energetic burst of <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/games/cooking-mama\">Cooking Mama</a>-inspired culinary chaos, or, my personal favourite, steer a sewing machine needle around a <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/games/super-hang-on\">Super Hang-On</a> style circuit made of fabric in a delirious bout of high-speed hemming that regularly left both me and the handcrafted tote bag onscreen in stitches. As I ticked off each enjoyable household task, I found myself bonding with these little wide-eyed waifs in a more organic manner. That meant the stakes felt appropriately heightened later on when Kiryu’s criminal past inevitably catches up with him.</p><p>That’s not to say that Kiwami 3 completely sharpens the original’s storytelling, and there are still some of the series’ signature attention span-stretching conversation cutscenes present here – including one marathon meeting room exposition dump in its ninth chapter that’s so comically drawn out it actually gives you the option of taking regular breaks for Kiryu to stretch his legs by walking around a tiny office he can’t leave. There’s also a surprising twist in Kiwami 3’s post-credits epilogue that will likely raise a few eyebrows among series purists (though was really neither here nor there for me), but by and large Kiwami 3’s main story has been reworked for the better and it kept me hooked for the 17 hours it took me to reach its cathartic, combat-heavy climax.    </p><p>Elsewhere Kiryu goes from playing daddy to slaying baddies in Kiwami 3’s other major addition to its main story, Bad Boy Dragon. This biker gang-based riff on the Devil Flags subquest from <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-review\">Pirate Yakuza</a> tasks Kiryu with rescuing new recruits from bullies on the streets, splitting them into squads, and accompanying them into large scale clashes against other rival leather-clad clubs, from the easybeats of Okinawa’s streets to the more fierce fighters from Tokyo’s Night Terrors outfit. In between battles you can hold gang rallies to boost the XP of your members, customise your gang colours, and invest in special attacks to unleash in a scrap, from humble hand grenades to spectacularly silly stampeding bulls.</p><p>However, Bad Boy Dragon’s novelty wore off far sooner for me than Pirate Yakuza’s equivalent seafaring mode did, because Kiwami 3’s gang-based brawler is considerably more repetitive by comparison. Whereas Pirate Yakuza featured a healthy mixture of cannon-based naval warfare and on-land scraps, Bad Boy Dragon is mostly just a series of samey skirmishes held in copy-and-pasted warehouses that quickly blur into each other. Despite the fact you’re in a biker gang, there’s very little actual biking to be done – you can’t get stuck into <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/games/road-rash\">Road Rash</a>-style battles on Tokyo’s expressway like in Lost Judgment, for example. Kiryu’s chopper is strictly used to rapidly ferry him between the four squads under his command before resuming the button-mashed biker beatdowns. Bad Boy Dragon ultimately feels a little half-baked – if you’re going to build a mode around biker gangs, you really need to go the whole chrome-covered hog.   </p><p>Still, even though I parked Kiwami 3’s biker mode fairly early on, I found plenty of other things to do outside of the main story. In one moment I’d be struggling to deliver towering ice cream cones through streets lined with waddling sumo wrestlers, while in another I’d be customising my 2007-era flip phone with dangling tchotchkes to boost Kiryu’s health and damage. Later I found myself posing as a host at a cabaret club and disappointing the customers with terrible jokes, as well as indulging in optional mainstays like karaoke and the baseball batting cage. Sure, at this point a lot of these amusements have been repurposed more than the fabric of Marge Simpson’s pink Chanel suit, but I was pleased to find that collectible Game Gear games have been included for the first time in the series – even if it is a bit odd that handheld Sega classics like <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/games/columns\">Columns</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/games/sonic-chaos\">Sonic Chaos</a> can only be played back at Kiryu’s hideout rather than pulled out of his pocket on the fly. (Perhaps that’s a tacit admission that the Game Gear’s godawful battery life made portable play too impractical?)</p><p>Admittedly I was surprised to find the substory count in Kiwami 3 had been whittled down to 31 from the original game’s 100 or so, but then I remembered how many of <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/games/yakuza-3\">Yakuza 3’s</a> optional quests were just clones of the same small handful of ideas. Kiwami 3’s substories focus on quality over quantity, and I have no objections to that approach.  </p><p>Outside of its remodelled main campaign, Kiwami 3 features an entirely new story mode called Dark Ties, which puts the player into the shoes of the sharply dressed and amusingly sardonic antagonist, Yoshitaka Mine. Dark Ties explores Mine’s first steps into the Tokyo underworld, his reluctant alliance with the lecherous Tojo clan heavy Tsuyoshi Kanda, and the complex motivations behind his devastating actions in Kiwami 3’s main campaign. It also allows us to let loose with his ferocious ‘shoot-boxing’ fighting style, which blends fast flurries of punches with acrobatic flip-kicks and the ability to pinball off one enemy and completely redirect your attack towards another to seamlessly continue your combo. He can also unleash devastating ‘Dark Awakening’ special attacks, such as spiking an enemy’s skull into the ground and dragging their faces along the pavement like a bloodied bowling ball. </p><p>Mine is limited to the one fighting stance, however, and his skill tree is stumpier than a yakuza’s left pinkie. That’s because his quest simply doesn’t last long enough to allow room for any real evolution of his abilities. Dark Ties has been marketed as a fully-fledged game in its own right, but that seems slightly disingenuous given it only features three chapters versus Kiwami 3’s 12, restricts the action to the same Kamarucho setting that Yakuza fans know better than the calluses on the back of their face-mashing fists, and pits you against just two bosses in two fights a piece.  </p><p>To be fair, it still took me just over five hours to roll credits in Dark Ties, but that runtime didn’t feel as substantial as it sounds since Mine’s mode regularly gates its story missions behind the arbitrary completion of agonisingly menial tasks. During Dark Ties’ prolonged middle chapter in particular, the advancement of Mine’s story is dependent on performing good deeds for Kamarucho locals in order to slowly boost the reputation of his unlikeable cohort Kanda. A few of these are genuinely entertaining, like being asked to pose as a bouncer outside an adults-only club and evaluating the clientele, but the bulk of them are boring chores like legging it to the nearest convenience store and back so that you can bring a hungry man a bento box. </p><section data-transform=\"quoteBox\">Dark Ties has been marketed as a fully-fledged game in its own right, but that seems slightly disingenuous.</section><p>Tasks like these are made all the more arduous given that Mine isn’t equipped with the same segway-like Street Surfer that Kiryu can whip out on a whim to speed things along in Kiwami 3. I wanted to enjoy Mine’s calculated ascension towards the top of the Tojo clan, but for extended periods, Dark Ties made me feel less like a dragon and more like a dogsbody.        </p><p>Mine does have one ace up his pinstriped-suit sleeve, however, and that’s the dungeon-brawling roguelike minigame unique to his adventure. Dubbed ‘Survival Hell’ – despite the fact that ‘Roguelike a Dragon’ was sitting  – this strictly-timed dash for cash and collectibles takes place across five underground arenas, each consisting of four floors of increasingly challenging goons and culminating in an imposing boss fight. Die during a run and you lose it all, but each floor has an optional exit point should you wish to bank your winnings early and invest them into buffs like special weapons and CPU-controlled bodyguards to better your chances of survival on subsequent runs. It’s compelling, chaotic, and stuffed with countless surprises. Having rolled credits on both Kiwami 3 and Dark Ties, Survival Hell is the one feature of either story that is still calling me back for more.</p>",

More than 400 years after Shakespeare wrote the tragedy, in a much changed world, there’s still something relatable about the young Prince of Denmark’s obsessive, grief-driven vengeance.   </p><p>But what is an adaptation  if not reimagination, recontextualization, and the addition of titanic dragons that rain literal lightning judgement down on those below? Scarlet – an animé adaptation of Hamlet from Oscar-nominated auteur Mamoru Hosoda – is not afraid to get playful with its source material, and the film is the better for it. Here, Hamlet is a girl named Scarlet (voiced by Mana Ashida). Still a medieval princess growing up in Late Middle Ages Denmark, Scarlet spends her youth as all young people should – playing in the dirt, and basking in a parent’s love.</p><a href=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/06/scarlet-poster-crop-1770408936130.jpg\"><img src=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/06/scarlet-poster-crop-1770408936130.jpg\" title=\"undefined\"></a><p>However, for those who know anything about the source material, this innocence cannot last. When Scarlet’s father, the King of Denmark, is coup-ed by his own brother, Claudius, with the help of Queen Gertrude, Scarlet goes full Arya Stark. She trains as a swordswoman, driven by a furious thirst for revenge. Her plot is interrupted by her uncle’s own machinations, who poisons his niece with little fanfare before she can take him out herself.</p><p>Unlike Hamlet, which stretches the above series of events (or some variation thereof) over four-plus hours,Scarlet speeds through the aforementioned plot in the first 20 minutes or so. The film has other ambitions – namely, the exploration of the beautiful and deadly Otherworld, a mysterious desert land where dead from across the ages go before they pass on to somewhere else. Scarlet wakes up in this liminal space after her poisoning, and is no less focused on revenge; when she hears Claudius is  in this place, she sets out to kill him once again.</p><p>But the Otherworld is populated with other souls on their own journeys. Scarlet almost immediately crosses paths with Hijiri (Masaki Okada), a present-day EMT who seems set on helping everyone he meets in the Otherworld, even when they are trying to kill him. The unlikely pair journeys across the unforgiving desert, crossing paths with bandits and musicians, children and elderly. A massive, mountain-like dragon sometimes descends from the atmosphere to strike the unworthy down with storms of lightning.</p><section data-transform=\"quoteBox\">Hosoda has proven himself a master at making the mundane feel epic and the fantastical feel real. </section><p>If that last part sounds spectacular, it , and this is a film that is worth seeing on a big screen if possible. From The Girl Who Leapt Through Time to the Oscar-nominated Mirai and Belle, Hosoda has proven himself a master at making the mundane feel epic and the fantastical feel real. The lightning giant is just one example of the visual grandeur of this animated world, which treats dynamic fight sequences, musical performances, and quiet, resilient moments trudging through a sandstorm as equally important.</p><p>Mamoru Hosoda doesn’t get nearly enough credit for the ambition of his themes. In its original form, Hamlet is a story with an intentionally claustrophobic court setting. The inward-looking nature of its powerful characters, most especially its youthful and actively grieving protagonist, places any of its observations about the nature of humanity on a very personal level. Even when we call it politics, it is about the interpersonal drama of the Danish court.</p><p>In Scarlet, our princess swordswoman is very much driven by the same toxic, murderous family dynamics as the film’s source material, but by expanding the setting to this Otherworld, Hosoda is also expanding its theme. When Scarlet is asked to reflect on the understandable selfishness of her suffering, it is done through interactions with people, communities, and civilizations from across time; dear Hamlet never had such a resource of scope. The result is a deeply personal story that, through the visual grandeur and texture of this land between life and death, resonates on a societal level too. </p><p>Scarlet has a deep empathy for its world, which is to say that it has a deep empathy for  world. This kind of gentleness can often be mistaken for a lack of realism, but Hosoda’s script is not unaware of humanity’s many cruelties. Rather, it suggests that we must fight anyway, in the small ways that we can, and that – maybe – across generations and centuries, something might come of it. Some viewers might find that thesis depressing, but I think there’s something hopeful about it; judging by the way Hosoda balances the film’s bloodshed with humanity’s potential for culture, caring, and community, I think the filmmaker might think so too. </p>",

Not only in terms of this movie, but of this entire <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/the-strangers-chapter-1-review-madelaine-petsch\">Renny Harlin-directed trilogy</a>. Despite comprising over four hours worth of story over three installments following the same protagonist, very little has been narratively accomplished, and no core ideas have been thematically clarified. This realization came to me during a scene where Maya, our hero played by Madelaine Petsch, witnesses the main antagonist viciously murder someone she should theoretically care about. But she has zero reaction whatsoever. No tears, no anguished screams of “No!” or “How could you?”, just a blank stare as yet another one-note character is snuffed out in this exasperating excuse for a trilogy.</p><p>At the end of Chapter 2, Maya managed to kill Pin-Up Girl, one of the three main villains. Those villains would be the Strangers in question, a group of masked serial killers who like to knock on doors and chop up people with axes. Scarecrow, the leader and only male of the group, ended the last movie looking pretty upset about this turn of events, so you would think this movie would involve Maya and him speeding towards a thrilling battle to the death, right? Well, no, actually, that’s not what happens at all.</p><p>In fact, the first meeting between Maya and her main enemy involves him finally being unmasked, as they have a surprisingly calm conversation inside a chapel and acknowledge that they’ve each killed someone the other one cared for (Maya’s fiancé Ryan bit the dust at the end of Chapter 1). Scarecrow tells Maya to leave town, but this is a horror movie, so instead of doing the sensible thing, Maya sticks around for one more go-around with the bad guys before we’re finally free of this nonsense.</p><p>Setting aside that Maya has a perfectly good escape vehicle that she unceremoniously wrecks by not paying attention while she’s driving (really), or that the body count across three movies has gotten so high that you would think this town would warrant being declared a national emergency, there is simply nothing left to do with these characters within the scenario they’ve been established in. But Harlin and screenwriters Alan R. Cohen and Alan Freedland seem to know this, which is why The Strangers - Chapter 3 does involve a fresh conceit, that being that Maya is recaptured almost immediately after leaving the chapel since Scarecrow and Dollface have plans to turn Maya into the new Pin-Up Girl. You know, because when you kill a serial killer, you become a serial killer. That’s how it works, right?</p><section data-transform=\"quoteBox\">This is the worst installment in a trilogy of movies that I sincerely have nothing substantially positive to say about.</section><p>At the very least, it’s the first novel spin this trilogy has had on the Strangers premise, but it doesn’t register because the characters involved are too thin to support it. In my review of <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/the-strangers-chapter-2-review\"></a>, I remarked that Maya had become somewhat more textured by her experiences in the first two films, but Chapter 3 goes out of its way to give her nothing to do. She has virtually no dialogue outside of her first and final scenes, and while Madelaine Petsch felt engaged in the middle film when she was fighting and fleeing from her tormentors, here she spends almost the entire movie with a vacant expression that’s not informed by what’s going on around her. It’s as if everyone involved had grown tired of the whole deal after filming three films back-to-back, and while that’s certainly understandable, it doesn’t excuse the movie being as boring to watch as it appears to have been to make.</p><p>That lack of creative investment spills into every aspect of the production. New characters are introduced and promptly dispatched before we learn anything about them. Characters from the first two films who had Obviously Evil signposts over their heads are revealed to be obviously evil. There are more backstory scenes showing us the origins of Scarecrow and Dollface that don’t have any real bearing on the present day events. Even the kills in this one feel marred by fatigue. If you’re not going to bother getting us emotionally invested in your characters before killing them, at least make the kills appreciably gory so they can be enjoyed on a popcorn entertainment level. But this movie is weirdly low on blood despite having an absurd number of deaths; you’ll find much more blood (and a much better movie) if you check out Sam Raimi’s <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/send-help-review-rachel-mcadams-dylan-obrien-sam-raimi\"></a> this weekend instead.</p><p>I don’t like slamming movies this way. I go into every one hoping it’s something I can enjoy on some level, and I'm an avid fan of the horror genre. But this is the worst installment in a trilogy of movies that I sincerely have nothing substantially positive to say about. While I was expecting a movie lacking in ambition or nuance based on its predecessors, Harlin and company have turned in a finale that is bereft of urgency, tension, or even baseline thrills. The Strangers - Chapter 3 may not be the worst horror movie I’ve seen in a theater, but it might be the laziest.</p>",

      "content": "<h2><strong>Lenovo LOQ 15 – Design and Features</strong></h2><p>The LOQ 15 isn’t about to win design awards. Just like its predecessor, the Lenovo LOQ 15 has a clean design without the extra frills that more expensive gaming laptops seem to require these days. . It’s functional, with a solid feel to it and the ability to smoothly and easily close the lid one-handed.</p><p>The port selection includes a USB-A, USB-C, and a 3.5mm headphone jack, on the right-hand side, and a couple of extra USB-A ports and an HDMI output on the rear. There’s also an Ethernet port if you want to play games where stable Wi-Fi isn’t readily available. There’s no high-speed USB4 or Thunderbolt 4 or 5, but unless you’re planning on transferring RAW image files or UHD video from an external device, that’s not likely to be something you’ll miss. Three USB-A ports are plenty for a keyboard, mouse, and webcam, or other external device, and the USB-C port is great for recharging your phone or connecting external storage devices. Keeping the majority of the connections on the back ensures the cables are tucked out of the way too.</p><p>Though the onboard Wi-Fi 6 is hardly cutting-edge, it’s plenty fast for everyday office work and gaming. </p><p>At just over 5 pounds, the LOQ 15 isn’t the most portable laptop, but it’s lighter than most gaming laptops and it’s not a chore to carry around – I can’t see it causing much strain being carried around in a backpack either. It’s big enough that I probably wouldn’t want to game on my actual lap, but it’s portable enough that gaming on a train or plain table isn’t outside the realm of possibility.</p><p>Lenovo cites RAM and storage upgradeability as a benefit for this laptop, and indeed it is. It’s just a shame RAM is so expensive that actually doing so anytime soon in a <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/best-budget-gaming-laptop\">budget gaming laptop</a> seems unlikely. The 16GB is fine for most games, but there are some AAA games that demand 32GB for anything beyond low settings, so you may find some experiences limited until you can upgrade.  </p><p>The model I reviewed comes with a 512GB SSD, which is fine for indie libraries, but while testing a handful of AAA games I often found myself having to uninstall something just to install the next game – though that’s something most people won’t have to deal with. The 1TB model isn’t a big cost upgrade, just adding an extra $100 if you customize the build yourself, so before AI-inspired shortages send that northwards, grab the larger model while you can.</p><p>The display is reasonably bright at 300 nits, and its 144 Hz refresh rate is welcome for more casual games and esports – though don’t expect this laptop’s entry-level GPU to be putting out triple digit frame rates in AAA games.</p><p>The keyboard is a real contender for one of my favorites in recent memory, with a solid feel and satisfying light click-clack as you type away. There’s 1.5mm of travel, and none of the keys feel crammed together. One of the advantages of a laptop this size is you can let your fingers roam a little more, and Lenovo takes full advantage of this with its keyboard design. There’s only white backlighting, but as long as I can see the keys in the dark, I’m not too concerned with what color they are.</p><p>Audio is what you would expect from a more affordable gaming laptop with a mere pair of 2W speakers. There’s basically no bass to speak of and at higher volumes there’s a distinct drop in clarity. The support for Dolby Atmos is a welcome addition if you’re movie watching, but you are 100% better off listening through headphones as you’ll find the experience much improved.</p><p>The Lenovo Legion Space software the laptop ships with is somewhat useful, in that it can help you manage power profiles for the laptop’s various components, and it gives you an insight into their utilization, temperature, etc. It’s a handy tool but one that likes to radiate from the taskbar with notifications aplenty every time you boot it up. I don’t need it, I doubt most users do, but it’s there.</p><p>What I really wish wasn’t, was the McAffee antivirus trial which had almost expired by the time I got the laptop up and running. I feel like I’ve been haunted by trials of this antivirus for 30 years and they’re still coming. Windows Defender is plenty for most - and anyone who wants more, will want to choose their own. “Free trials,” like this, are more annoying than anything else.</p><a href=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/06/lenovo-loq-7-1770392667163.jpg\"><img src=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/06/lenovo-loq-7-1770392667163.jpg\" title=\"null\"></a><h2><strong>Lenovo Loq 15 – Performance</strong></h2><p>As much as looks are important for a gaming laptop, performance is still king. That’s not to say that I went into this expecting the Lenovo Loq 15 to be the kind of gaming laptop that dominates the competition; It’s an entry level gaming laptop, after all. But for an affordable device  with entry-level components, it was perfectly capable of playing everything I threw at it.</p><p>All tests were conducted at 1080p resolution, with maximum settings, and where available, with DLSS set to quality.</p><p>In synthetic tests the Lenovo LOQ 15 put out perfectly serviceable numbers. It’s around 30% slower than the Alienware Aurora 16X we reviewed recently, but costs 40% less, and its real-world gaming results are even more impressive.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7\">Call of Duty Black Ops 7</a>, the Lenovo laptop managed 78 frames per second which looks buttery smooth on the 144Hz high refresh rate display. <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/games/cyberpunk-2077\">Cyberpunk 2077</a> was naturally more demanding, but we still managed to get 49 fps with ray tracing at Ultra settings. We were even able to achieve a playable 32 fps when using RT overdrive, which for an entry-level mobile GPU like the RTX 5050 feels like an impressive achievement.</p><p>Unfortunately we couldn’t get the benchmark to finish with Frame Generation enabled - it just crashed towards the end of the benchmark every time I tried running it. Hopefully, it’s just a weird anomaly on our test system, it remains an option for improving performance even further despite the sky-high detail settings.</p><a href=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/06/lenovo-loq-8-1770392667163.jpg\"><img src=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/06/lenovo-loq-8-1770392667163.jpg\" title=\"null\"></a><p><a href=\"https://www.ign.com/games/metro-exodus\">Metro Exodus: Enhanced</a> continues to be a demanding game for even modern GPUs and the Lenovo LOQ 15 was only able to manage 37 fps there. Very playable, but not the smoothest of experiences when the action picks up. Total War: Warhammer III was much more playable, though, with 84 fps on average for a very smooth gaming experience, despite using Ultra settings.</p><p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is one of the newest games in our benchmark list and it shows: The game looks utterly gorgeous. Even on an RTX 5050 we were able to manage 38 fps without frame generation, and 66 fps average with it enabled. I did encounter a strange blocky artifact in the benchmark for this game during testing, but it wasn’t present in the main game itself, so I’m taking that as a weird quirk of the benchmark than any real issue – one worth mentioning just in case, though.</p><p>All of that gaming power does come at the slight cost to noise levels. When plugged in and on high performance mode, this laptop does get rather loud and I wouldn’t want to game on it without headphones. But that’s hardly a huge ask. And if you don’t mind taking a slight hit to performance and playing in more balanced power modes, the noise levels are no way near as distinct.</p><p>General performance in Procyon was decent – comparable to some other AMD laptops we've reviewed recently like the <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/razer-blade-16-2025-review\">Razer Blade 16</a>, despite its newer and higher-end CPU. However it’s very clear Intel holds an advantage in these kinds of benchmarks, so consider that carefully if you’re primarily interested in this laptop for general office work.</p><p>Battery life, unfortunately, wasn’t amazing. It’s not terrible, lasting just over five hours in our Procyon battery test. But that’s more comparable to high-end gaming PCs with more powerful processors and big, hefty GPUs. The Lenovo LOQ 15 has a small battery, and that helps keep weight and size down, but it’s not the kind of machine you’ll use on the go for a full day of work or play.</p><p>I found the Lenovo LOQ 15 AMD a pleasure to use day-to-day. It’s light enough, and I particularly appreciated that despite being an entry-level laptop when it comes to gaming, it’s far from entry-level in style and design. The lid opens and closes easily with one hand, the design is sleek whilst still giving little nods to its gaming chops, like the honeycomb air intake grills on the underside.</p><p>The somewhat limited battery life wasn’t an annoyance day to day, but getting a little battery anxiety around a full work day on a brand new laptop isn’t ideal. This is one laptop you’ll want to keep the charging brick handy if you’re planning a long session.</p>",

      "content": "<img src=\"https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/06/mewgenics-review-blogroll-1770382822401.jpg\"><p>There aren't a ton of games that I've happily put more than 100 hours into as quickly as I have with Mewgenics. This feline-flavored, turn-based, roguelike tactical RPG takes place on a 10x10 grid, with mostly traditional classes like Fighter, Mage, Hunter, Tank, and Necromancer, among others. What sets it apart, aside from the cutesy macabre art style that slathers its creative zones with blood and poop, is that so many of the skills and attributes that your team will end up with are randomized and for the most part out of your control. That all but ensures no two runs will play out the same way, forcing you to improvise and play the hand you're dealt. Combined with the absolute mountain of content here – so much that I'm still seeing entirely new enemies, skills, mutations, and loot pop up after more than 150 hours – it's been able to draw me back in time and time again by dangling the possibility of an absolutely wild team coming together and bulldozing through the boss who turned my last party into kibble. I still haven't seen the final ending after all that time (this game has several) but I can't imagine I'll be tired of it before I do.</p><p>Mewgenics is a game about cats, but it's not necessarily going to appeal to people who passionately love them because it's a dark comedy that treats them as meat to be put through a grinder. The name itself is a play on eugenics, a morally appalling practice of selective breeding that has historically led to things like forced sterilization to remove undesirable traits from the gene pool, so you know going in that it's going to be a little spicy. If you've played any of Edmund McMillen's previous work (here he's collaborating once again with Tyler Glaiel), such as the infamously difficult Super Meat Boy or the infinitely replayable Binding of Isaac, you'll have a sense of the type of humor to expect. It's delightfully gross and endlessly weird at every turn.</p><section data-transform=\"quoteBox\">It's delightfully gross and endlessly weird at every turn.</section><p>Even knowing that, as a long-time cat owner myself, I was perhaps a bit too conservative with just how unsympathetic and detached you're expected to be. I probably took longer than I should've to unlock crucial upgrades for my house because doing so requires shipping dozens of cats off to live with a set of goofy weirdo NPCs, never to be seen again. One of the most important and flamboyant, Tink, will only take newborn kittens, and in exchange he'll give you tools that provide more information on how to breed more kittens – and he needs a lot, so you have to get accustomed to parting with them right away. Other characters want older cats, mutated cats, injured cats, or cats who've been on runs to specific places in order to improve stores or add new rooms to your house, among other things. Traditionally an RPG like this is about nurturing your characters and developing them until they become more powerful, but Mewgenics requires a different way of thinking: cats with low or unremarkable stats are lost causes who will weigh your squad down, so you're best off spending them like currency and keeping only the picks of various litters.</p><p>Selectively breeding your cats takes place in the fairly simple house screen, a 2D side view where your cats chaotically mill around while you arrange furniture pieces that you find as loot or buy from a shop, inventory Tetris-style. The goal here is to improve stats like Stimulation and Comfort in order to get your cats in the mood to produce high-quality offspring and improve the chances they'll come out with favorable mutations. Those can be things like a messed-up tail that makes their basic attacks inflict burning, or fur that gives them more health regen when they're wet, or , among tons and tons of others that are all represented visually on your increasingly weird-looking cats. </p><p>(You also have to clean up cat poop daily to keep your Health stat up by simply clicking on piles of various shapes and sizes. It's a bit of a chore after a while, especially when it gets crowded and you have to move cats out of the way to get to it – somehow, of all the furniture items I've gathered, I've never seen a single litter box.)</p><p>When everything's arranged to your liking, you hit the End Day button and your cats will choose their own mates based on who's in a room with them, as well as their own genders, orientations (yup, there are gay and bisexual cats), and libedos. Then, out come the kittens after some bizarre cat humping and gooey birth animations that take obvious pleasure in being unsettling. (You can tone that down if you need it to be safe for work.) Optimizing this to produce the most powerful cats possible while also avoiding too much inbreeding (which, as Tink will tell you, isn't cool even though it has the word \"breeding\" in it because it causes birth defects) is tricky – but you can't really fail at this part because, even if you lose all your cats, you can just start again from scratch using the randomized strays who show up every day.</p><p>The real challenge is in finding the traits you want and ensuring they're passed down to new generations without too many side effects, and that definitely takes some planning. Mewgenics doesn't make it super easy, since there's no way to view all your cats in a list or spreadsheet – you just have to tediously cycle through them one at a time. You do unlock some tools to label them (and view their gnarly family trees), but when you have 40 cats roaming around it can be a pain to find one with the stats and abilities you're looking for when you go to put together a four-cat party (or fewer, if you want to live dangerously and level them up faster) for an adventure.</p><p>Building your team is another area where Mewgenics is unconventional and unpredictable because when you're picking cats and assigning their classes you can't see what all of their starting abilities will be. You'll get their base stats, mutations, and basic attacks, and sometimes they'll come with a spell or passive ability from one of their parents' classes, but it's not until you lock in their class that you'll learn what you're really working with and if they'll synergize well. Considering that each of the 12 classes has 75 abilities that pop up (even after all this time I'm still seeing new ones), I get the same thrill from this reveal that I do from picking up my hand in poker or seeing the modifiers on a daily run in Slay the Spire or Monster Train 2: sometimes it's good news and I'm excited to see where it takes me, sometimes it's not and I brace myself for a thrashing and hope for a surprise turnaround if I can survive long enough to level them up and unlock some better skills.</p><p>What's inconvenient at this stage is that while you can see what items you have available in your house inventory before you set out on an adventure, and after you lock in your classes you're taken to the equipping screen to deck your cats out with up to five pieces of potentially build-defining gear apiece, you cannot see those items when you're actually picking your classes and your starting abilities are first revealed. That might be fine if you have a fantastic memory, but for the rest of us it's frustrating to not be able to check if I have a good piece of gear to boost the stats of my summoned familiars at the exact moment I'm deciding if I should go with an animal-friend Druid or a robot-building Tinkerer, or if I should go with a Fighter or a Tank instead. </p><p>It's tricky to keep track of what you have on hand because gear in Mewgenics doesn't last forever. You can expect to get three, maybe four runs out of something before it breaks, and that's assuming you don't wipe and lose everything you took with you and picked up along the way (except for your choice of one item from several that a helpful weirdo saves for you after a failed attempt). If weapons breaking in recent Zeldas rubbed you the wrong way, you probably won't enjoy that aspect of Mewgenics, but I actually do like the way it prevents me from relying too heavily on any one strategy. You can get something incredibly powerful and play with it more than once, without letting that item define every run you'll do from that point on.</p><p>Taking gear on only two or three runs may not sound like much, but that's more than the actual cats get. Another reason you can't count on the tricks you used in the previous run working just as well on the next, even if you use the same classes and gear, is that each cat only gets one adventure in which to level up and develop their skills. (You'll be able to use them in combat one or even two more times during special battles where major monsters attack your house.) That was tough to get my head around at first, because I'm accustomed to my RPG party members sticking around, at least until I get them killed. </p><p>Maybe this is why you're not allowed to name your own cats, and instead they come pre-named from a pool of (I estimate) a billion different silly possibilities: Mewgenics doesn't want us to get too attached. After a while I stopped paying much attention to their names except to chuckle at them, preferring to think of my squad members as their classes rather than individuals. Only the ones I ended up using as my primary breeding stock really stuck with me. (Man, talking about this game makes you say some weird stuff.)</p><p>When you head out to one of the three acts' adventure maps, which are all drawn in a jerkily animated, charmingly childlike style, you start with a single path that then branches off into two, each of which has two completely different stages packed with their own unique sets of enemies – so many you definitely won't see them all even after several runs. You'll definitely want to mouse over them and read their descriptions before diving into battle, because some of them have some extremely nasty tricks up their sleeves – including a few that can instantly and permanently kill a cat or infect it with a parasite that takes up a gear slot. The stakes are already pretty high given your cats are permanently injured every time they get downed, and can be outright killed if their body is destroyed by attacks or eaten by zombies, so you don't want to get surprised if you can help it.</p><p>Each zone is also stocked with multiple bosses that range from powered-up versions of your own classes to huge, nasty monsters with their own creative game-changing mechanics, and one that's basically just an evil Kirby. Yes, a few of them are annoying (I avoid going to Act 1's Boneyard unless a quest demands it because that boss is a total jerk), but on balance they're excellent battles that often make me think differently about how to manage my team's turn order and abilities.</p><p>One thing that stands out to me about the structure of Mewgenics' runs – aside from how they can take as long as two hours once you've unlocked all the zones (and some secret ones) – is that unlike most roguelikes, you rarely get to make decisions about the path you take between battles. You mainly get to choose between the default path and a harder one with better loot and one more battle to level up a cat in, and then very occasionally between two types of rewards (usually an equipable item or a piece of furniture for your house). That makes the between-battle encounters feel a little less interesting than in a lot of similar games, especially when the random encounters turn out to be basically a coin flip where you're picking between a red pill or a blue pill, or pushing a button vs pulling a lever without any indication of which will give you a bonus and which will give you a debuff. </p><p>There are, of course, some more in-depth, multi-stage encounters where you're picking between a set of options in a choose-your-own-adventure story where your chances of success for each one are determined by a cat's stats. However, since the cat whose stats you're working with is chosen randomly, there are two layers of luck involved before you get a shot at a good outcome. It often feels completely random, but that's alright because so much of Mewgenics is doing the best you can with circumstances beyond your control.</p><p>During combat, there are so many different things in play that the interactions between cat mutations, passives, spells, gear, environmental modifiers, and enemies can get crazy complex, and figuring out exactly what happened – or predicting what will happen – can be like investigating a crime scene (often with just as much blood splatter). Why did that enemy pingpong between two trash bags, with each bounce doing one point of damage, until it died? How did one of my cats just straight-up eat a boss without me even telling it to move? Or, why did that giant Daddy Shark get to take another move and insta-kill my Cleric when I'd carefully placed him just outside what should've been his projected attack range? (That one stung.) All of those answers are in there somewhere if you know where to look and study the rules carefully. In one of those cases, it was related to – you guessed it – poop. The map does get chaotic when there are a lot of enemies and fire or plants or ice on the screen, but thankfully there's a tactical view that usually clears things up… mostly. </p><p>Most of the time, if you think something might work, it will. Water and ice spells and spells will put out fire, water will conduct electricity and zap everything standing in it, that sort of thing. However, sometimes its rules aren't super logical: a couple I've noticed is that robots are susceptible to bleeding, poison, and  parasite infestations, and the Butcher class's innate meat hook weapon can't actually hook meat unless you luck into the right upgrade for it. But again, most of the time it works like you'd expect it to.</p><p>I do love when a powerful team dynamic emerges as you earn new skills (your choice from a random selection of three) or raise one cat's stats after every battle. Recently I had a squad with a Monk who could toss out meat pickups that typically just heal the team, but when combined with a Butcher who can turn all of those meats into minion fly familiars and a Druid who can boost those flys' stats and turn them into killing machines, it became a way to raise an army in a single turn. On another run I had a Cleric whose health regeneration applied to the whole team and an item that let me continually boost that regen multiple times per turn, allowing my Necromancer to run wild with a high-damage attack that also drained half of his own health. There are countless examples like this, and while you won't win the lottery with a great combo every run, they happen more than often enough to make me excited about what might be next.</p><section data-transform=\"quoteBox\">While you won't win the lottery with a great combo every run, they happen more than often enough to make me excited about what might be next.</section><p>What's a little frustrating when I'm planning out my moves in a tough fight where every action matters is that there's no way to access a cat's full character sheet while you're in a battle, so you can't see their list of mutations or all of their equipment's full effects when you need that information the most. It's almost all represented visually on your cats, at least, but you have to remember, for example, what a cat having a second head growing on its butt means. When the rules are changing so dramatically from run to run, I would love to be able to reference all of them at any time.</p><p><em><strong>Editor's Note, February 9:</strong></em><em> Shortly after publishing this review, the team behind Mewgenics let us know that they planned to make tweaks in response to some of Dan's \"requests,\" as well as other feedback. For example, a few UI updates already arrived ahead of launch, including being able to see mutation info on the level-up screen and during combat, being able to look at your other cats during level-ups, and being able to see cat genders from the backpack screen.]</em></p><p>As if all of those variables weren't enough, Mewgenics throws yet another curveball at you when it sends you on one of its story or side quests. Those all revolve around a unique and powerful item that changes the rules in a big way and telling you to take it to a specific zone. One of the most memorable gives you a five-second time limit for every action – and if you don't make a move, the AI will take over and move for you. (I was glad I wasn't playing that one on my Steam Deck because the controls there are serviceable, but not nearly as quick as with a mouse and keyboard.) Another shook things up by giving my cats random selections of abilities from every class when they leveled up, creating powerful hybrids that are usually rare. There are tons of these available, though it's kind of a bummer that if you fail a side quest you don't get a second attempt at that unless it randomly comes up again once you've paid enough cats. The story itself is pretty silly and light – don't expect any Hades-style epics here – but good for a few yuks as you do the bidding of an incompetent mad scientist.</p><p>Another area where Mewgenics is truly exceptional is in its sound and music, which are fantastic in both big and subtle ways. It comes with a collection of original and hilarious songs that accompany each level and culminate in major boss battles that are designed to loop for as long as a battle takes, and there are multiple variations on each that include instrumental versions – your cats will even meow along to them sometimes. (My favorite is probably \"Where's That Smell Coming From?\") And those meows come from a vast selection of different randomly selected voices, including some celebrity cameos.</p><p>One of the best touches, though, is the crowd sounds. Mainly you'll hear this after beating a battle: there's cheering and clapping with varying enthusiasm based on how quickly you pulled off your win. That's fine, but the best part is the shocked gasps when one of your cats is killed in action. That gets me every time – and trust me, I've heard it a lot.</p><p>Lastly, Mewgenics has a fun and surprising approach to the practice of \"save-scumming,\" where you quit out of a battle you've messed up and restart it with knowledge of what not to do. I won't spoil what happens, but there are consequences if you abuse it. Thankfully, you do get some flexibility in case of a power outage or spouse demanding you stop playing that game you've been playing for 150 hours and do the dishes, and it's kind of implicit that you have permission to save-scum once per run – and yes, I use it regularly.</p>",

And, boy, does he sure need the help.</p><p>“Seven” is the gloomiest, literally and figuratively, episode so far, with the colorful palette of the previous episodes replaced by a muddy, grim aesthetic. And with the exception of one brief exchange between Dunk and Raymun Fossoway, there’s none of the playful banter or humor that’s been a highlight of the previous episodes. </p><p>Dunk must confront his fate after <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/a-knight-of-the-seven-kingdoms-episode-3-review\"><u>coming to Tanselle’s rescue in Episode 3</u></a> and beating up Aerion. The reasonable Baelor understands why Dunk did what he did, but he still assaulted a Targaryen prince so he must face some punishment (Baelor has already prevented Dunk from simply being executed).</p><p>Baelor reads Dunk his rights, if you will, and the latter faces Aerion, Maekar, and their lords to demand a trial by combat. But, of course, Aerion finds a way to weasel around it by calling for a trial of seven, an ancient custom where each side enlists seven knights to fight each other and the gods will decide who wins. (Even Maekar thinks his son is just trying to wuss out of fighting Dunk one-on-one by employing this tactic.) </p><section data-transform=\"quoteBox\">Bertie Carvel instills in Baelor ... a compassion and honor missing from many other Targaryens.</section><p>Unfortunately, Dunk doesn’t know enough knights, let alone six good ones, willing to help him. Eventually, thanks to Egg, he assembles six knights – we should’ve known it was too good to be true that Ser Steffon Fossoway would keep his word! – and it’s not until Baelor’s arrival that a trial of seven can commence. Bertie Carvel instills in Baelor a kind but firm authority and a compassion and honor missing from many other Targaryens. </p><p>Another big highlight of “Seven” is seeing Egg in his full Prince Aegon regalia. The opening scene where Egg apologizes to Dunk for deceiving him is moving, especially when Egg tears up as Dunk scolds him. He was just a kid who wanted to go to the tourney so badly that he hatched a half-assed scheme to be anyone’s squire after his drunken brother Daeron decided to sit it out. </p><p>Speaking of Daeron, the one gift he does seem to possess beyond his capacity for alcohol consumption is prophetic dreams. He’s dreamt of Ser Duncan the Tall with a slain dragon, which adds an additional layer of morbid curiosity to the fortune teller’s grim <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/a-knight-of-the-seven-kingdoms-episode-3-prophecy-fortune-egg-aegon\"><u>prophecy about Egg’s future</u></a> in Episode 3.</p><ul><li>Egg’s horrifying story about Aerion threatening to castrate him so then he’d have a sister he could marry. Those freakin’ Targaryens, man.</li><li>Dunk’s vision of Ser Arlan shrugging was hilarious.</li><li>Tanselle – who did a fine job repainting the sigil on Dunk’s shield – has fled, so there goes Dunk’s one romantic hope.</li><li>Animal lover Dunk petting the mouse in his cell window and later talking to his horses.</li><li>Aerion demeaning a nobleman by making him climb under the table to fetch his walnut.</li><li>It was nice to see armorer Steely Pate have another good scene with Dunk.</li><li>Ser Lyonel knighting Raymun Fossoway. Congrats on your promotion, Raymun!</li><li>That big jerk who humiliated Dunk before the nobles by farting.</li><li>Daeron knows he’s a coward who will end up in a hell without wine for lying to Maekar that Dunk kidnapped Egg. </li><li>The Game of Thrones theme kicking in at the very end. Let’s gooooo!</li></ul>",
