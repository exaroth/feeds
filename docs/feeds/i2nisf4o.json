We were surprised at how seamless the Rust/web integration was, it didn't get in the way at all.</p><p>The best part in leveraging our existing web dev experience was not having to learn a new GUI library, and because of that we had the UI up and running, styled and with some subtle animations, in just a few days.</p><p>We're sitting at ~18k lines of Rust (14k of which makes up the BitTorrent engine), ~3k lines of TypeScript and ~1k lines of CSS. </p><p>All in all, I highly recommend Tauri to build your desktop apps on top of. They've created an incredible framework, and I'm very much looking forward to trying it for mobile app dev.</p><p>Feel free to check our app at <a href=\"https://p3torrent.com\">https://p3torrent.com</a> - its free as long as you're happy with 1 active download.

The result was that every time a KVM VM went\nidle, the host OS would put it into a suspended state and the VM’s\nsystem clock would start to drift away from reality, sometimes by a\nlarge margin depending on how long the VM had remained idle.</p><p>There was a cron job that could be installed to keep the virtualized\nsystem clock in line with the host OS’s hardware clock.

      "content": "<p>tldr: curl goes back to Hackerone.</p><p>When we announced <a href=\"https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2026/01/26/the-end-of-the-curl-bug-bounty/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"28830\">the end of the curl bug-bounty</a> at the end of January 2026, we simultaneously moved over and started accepting curl security reports on GitHub instead of its previous platform.</p><p>This move turns out to have been a mistake and we are now undoing that part of the decision. The reward money is still gone, , no money for vulnerability reports, but we return to accepting and handling curl vulnerability and security reports on . Starting March 1st 2026, <a href=\"https://hackerone.com/curl\">this</a> is now (again) the official place to report security problems to the curl project.</p><p>This zig-zagging is unfortunate but we do it with the best of intentions. In the curl security team we were naively thinking that since so many projects are already using this setup it should be good enough for us too since we don’t have any particular special requirements. . Now I instead question how other Open Source projects can use this. It feels like an area and use case for Open Source projects that is under-focused: proper, secure and efficient vulnerability reporting without bug-bounty.</p><h2>What we want from a security reporting system</h2><p>To illustrate what we are looking for, I made a little list that should show that we’re not looking for overly crazy things.</p><ol><li>Incoming submissions are  that identify .</li><li>The reporter needs an account on the system.</li><li>Submissions start private; only accessible to the reporter and the curl security team</li><li>All submissions must be disclosed and made public once dealt with. Both correct and incorrect ones. This is important. We are Open Source. Maximum transparency is key.</li><li>There should be a way to discuss the problem amongst security team members, the reporter and per-report invited guests.</li><li>It should be possible to post security-team-only messages that the reporter and invited guests cannot see</li><li>For confirmed vulnerabilities, an advisory will be produced that the system could help facilitate</li><li>If there’s a field for CVE, make it possible to provide our own. We are after all our own CNA.</li><li>Closed and disclosed reports should be clearly marked as invalid/valid etc</li><li>Reports should have a tagging system so that they can be marked as “AI slop” or other terms for statistical and metric reasons</li><li>Abusive users should be possible to ban/block from this program</li><li>Additional (customizable) requirements for the privilege of submitting reports is appreciated (rate limit, time since account creation, etc)</li></ol><h2>What’s missing in GitHub’s setup?</h2><p>Here is a list of nits and missing features we fell over on GitHub that, had we figured them out ahead of time, possibly would have made us go about this a different way. This list might interest fellow maintainers having the same thoughts and ideas we had. I have provided this feedback to GitHub as well – to make sure they .</p><ol><li>GitHub sends the whole report over email/notification with no way to disable this. SMTP and email is known for being insecure and cannot assure end to end protection. This risks leaking secrets early to the entire email chain.</li><li>We can’t disclose invalid reports (and make them clearly marked as such)</li><li>We can’t edit the CVE number field! We are a CNA, we mint our own CVE records so this is frustrating. This adds confusion.</li><li>We want to (optionally) get rid of the CVSS score + calculator in the form as we actively discourage using those in curl CVE records</li><li>No “quote” in the discussions? That looks… like an omission.</li><li>We want to use GitHub’s security advisories as the  to the project, not the final  (as we write that ourselves) which might get confusing, as even for the confirmed ones, the project advisories (hosted elsewhere) are the official ones, not the ones on GitHub</li><li>No number of advisories count is displayed next to “security” up in the tabs, like for issues and Pull requests. This makes it hard to see progress/updates.</li><li>When looking at an individual advisory, there is no direct button/link to go back to the list of current advisories</li><li>In an advisory, you can only “report content”, there is no direct “block user” option like for issues</li><li>There is no way to add private comments for the team-only, as when discussing abuse or details not intended for the reporter or other invited persons in the issue</li><li>There is a lack of short (internal) identifier or name per issue, which makes it annoying and hard to refer to specific reports when discussing them in the security team. The existing identifiers are long and hard to differentiate from each other.</li><li>You quite weirdly cannot get completion help for  in comments to address people that were added into the advisory thanks to them being in a team you added to the issue?</li><li>There are no labels, like for issues and pull requests, which makes it impossible for us to for example mark the AI slop ones or other things, for statistics, metrics and future research</li></ol><p>Sure, we could switch to handling them all over email but that also has its set of challenges. Including:</p><ul><li>Hard to keep track of the state of each current issue when a number of them are managed in parallel. Even just to see how many cases are still currently open or in need of attention.</li><li>Hard to publish and disclose the invalid ones, as they never cause an advisory to get written and we rather want the initial report and the full follow-up discussion published.</li><li>Hard to adapt to or use a reputation system beyond just the boolean “these people are banned”. I suspect that we over time need to use more crowdsourced knowledge or reputation based on how the reporters have behaved previously or in relation to other projects.</li></ul><p>Since we dropped the bounty, the inflow tsunami has dried out . Perhaps partly because of our switch over to GitHub? Perhaps it just takes a while for all the  to figure out where to send the reports now and perhaps by going back to Hackerone we again open the gates for them? We just have to see what happens.</p><p>We will keep iterating and tweaking the program, the settings and the hosting providers going forward to improve. To make sure we ship a robust and secure set of products and that the team doing so can do that </p><h2>The other forges don’t even try</h2><p>Gitlab, Codeberg and others are GitHub alternatives and competitors, but few of them offer this kind of security reporting feature. That makes them bad alternatives or replacements for us for this particular service.</p>",

Instead of chaining together multiple tool calls and passing data between them through the context, the LLM writes complex code that calls multiple APIs, stores intermediate state in variables, and only returns the final results.</p><p>I first saw this idea presented in Alex Zhang and Omar Khattab’s paper, <a href=\"https://alexzhang13.github.io/blog/2025/rlm/?utm_source=navendu_blog&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=code-mode-with-skills\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Recursive Language Models (RLMs)</em></a>, where the model interacts with a Python REPL environment to programmatically query parts of the context. Armin Ronacher, the creator of Flask, had even <a href=\"https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/8/18/code-mcps/?utm_source=navendu_blog&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=code-mode-with-skills\" target=\"_blank\">floated a similar idea</a> back in August 2025!</p><p>Cloudflare takes this idea a step further in their new MCP server. Instead of exposing hundreds of individual tools, the server exposes only two:  and .</p><p>The  tool lets the LLM programmatically explore an <a href=\"https://swagger.io/docs/specification/v3_0/about/?utm_source=navendu_blog&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=code-mode-with-skills\" target=\"_blank\">OpenAPI specification</a> ( pre-resolved). LLMs can write JavaScript to explore/query the API spec and use the  tool to run custom JavaScript against an authenticated API client () inside a sandboxed environment (Cloudflare Workers).</p><p>This design keeps the full API specification and intermediate execution outside the LLM’s context, while only a subset of the API and the results of the executed code enter the context window.</p><p>These arguments are irrational and completely miss the point of Code Mode. Most people arguing would agree that LLMs write good code. Code Mode itself isn’t tied to the Model Context Protocol. The idea works with any agent harness that supports code execution.</p><p>Cloudflare’s use of MCP here primarily solves the discovery and distribution problem, and it solves it well. Their <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/agent-skills-discovery-rfc?utm_source=navendu_blog&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=code-mode-with-skills\" target=\"_blank\">Agent Skills Discovery RFC</a> (v0.1, 2026-01-17) solves a similar problem for skills, which is at least an underappreciated initiative.</p><p>It is also tempting to dismiss the entire discourse by saying “just build CLIs.” LLMs are indeed good at using familiar CLIs. But expecting them to reliably compose chained CLI calls without extensive documentation (and paying the token cost) is unrealistic.</p><p>I have been a strong proponent of MCP. I helped maintain the <a href=\"https://github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go?utm_source=navendu_blog&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=code-mode-with-skills\" target=\"_blank\">unofficial MCP Go SDK</a> until Google released the official one. But I have found more recently that skills work much better. I’m not alone in that conclusion. Armin Ronacher has <a href=\"https://x.com/mitsuhiko/status/2025843509652009186?utm_source=navendu_blog&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=code-mode-with-skills\" target=\"_blank\">expressed similar concerns</a> about MCP’s current architecture and has called for an overhaul of the specification. There are indeed <a href=\"https://cra.mr/context-management-and-mcp?utm_source=navendu_blog&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=code-mode-with-skills\" target=\"_blank\">notable exceptions</a>, but I think their arguments are weak.</p><p>An alternate version of Code Mode that works well is with skills. Now I don’t think this idea is novel, but I haven’t seen it presented anywhere. This is the flow:</p><ol><li><p>The OpenAPI specification and a SKILL.md file are hosted using the  URL path prefix following <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/agent-skills-discovery-rfc#uri-structure?utm_source=navendu_blog&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=code-mode-with-skills\" target=\"_blank\">Cloudflare’s RFC</a>. It does not really matter where you host it, though, but I think this proposal is neat:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"text\"></code></pre></div><p>The skill will be simple, with minimal instructions on downloading the OpenAPI spec, searching it, and making API calls:</p><div title=\"SKILL.md\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"markdown\"></code></pre></div></li><li><p>Agents are given access to this skill, and they execute code to load and search the spec and then make API calls. Agents today, like Claude Code and Codex, have their own filesystem and network-isolated <a href=\"https://github.com/anthropic-experimental/sandbox-runtime?utm_source=navendu_blog&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=code-mode-with-skills\" target=\"_blank\">sandboxed execution environments</a>.</p></li><li><p>Agents optionally help themselves by documenting common flows in new skills without ever having read the whole specification.</p></li></ol><p><a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/code-execution-with-mcp?utm_source=navendu_blog&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=code-mode-with-skills\" target=\"_blank\">Anthropic</a> has good examples of how an LLM would write code in this setup.</p><p>The token reduction is comparable to <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/code-mode-mcp/?utm_source=navendu_blog&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=code-mode-with-skills\" target=\"_blank\">Cloudflare’s results</a>. The token cost of documenting two MCP tools is comparable to the token cost of a focused skill file.</p><p>A benefit of using Code Mode with skills is that you don’t have to manage an MCP server or a hosted execution environment, which works for most use cases. The distribution problem is solved by making it easy to fetch the skill and the OpenAPI spec. At the very least, the existence of a  file can be documented similarly to how an MCP server URL might be documented.</p><p>My experience building agents has taught me to lean into the nature of LLMs. They are very good at writing code. So let them write code.</p>",

This is because they are dropping support for gtk2 and both FPC and Lazarus (appear) to depend on the much out of date gtk2 ! Firstly, a large number of Linux Distros are based on Debian. And some that are not based on Debian still get source packages from there. Almost all distros are in the process of dropping gtk2 anyway.<p>This will be see by all Linux community. Its very bad 'optics' for FPC/Lazarus if Debian drops FPC/Lazarus (and all the apps that depend on FPC/Lazarus). </p>Its obvious how Lazarus depends on GTK2, you may well say, \"just use Qt5 or Qt6\" but its not that easy. The problem is that FPC also depends on gtk2 on Linux. <p>FPC has a package, eg&nbsp; lib/fpc/3.2.2/units/x86_64-linux/gtk2/ in a binary install. That provides a number of ppu used, for example by Lazarus. Debian binaries are generated from Debian Source Packages and, presumably, gtk2 is necessary for that generating.</p><p>The easy solution of removing that package &lt;src&gt;packages/gtk2 from FPC would make FPC acceptable to Debian (I think) but it will break Lazarus. Obviously, lazarus-gtk2 will break (who cares ?) but&nbsp; so too does, for example, a Lazarus-Qt6 built with bigide. Apparently, all Linux Lazarus installs use the FPC \"gtk2 package\" files to provide -</p><ul></ul>Without which not too many Lazarus applications, Qt5 or Qt6 will run.<p>Clearly, the answer is to have a new Lazarus package containing the (non-gtk2) units from FPC's gtk2 package. That does introduce some rather messy transition issues. Especially if we cannot have a FPC release !</p><p>My ideal solution might be to have a \"Linux Only Release\", based on FPC324rc1, get that back into Debian and then, with the next release of Lazarus, provide the necessary files as part of LCL.</p></div>",

      "content": "NVIDIA has posted multiple job openings, which give us several hints about the company's plans for gaming on Linux and what the possible plan could look like. According to the now-removed listing, NVIDIA is hiring engineers to diagnose CPU and GPU performance bottlenecks on Linux when running the Proton compatibility layer and Vulkan graphics API. This suggests that NVIDIA is either refining its product support for the massive wave of gamers transitioning to Linux or preparing for an entirely new platform. For example, as NVIDIA is currently preparing <a href=\"https://www.techpowerup.com/346693/nvidia-reportedly-launching-its-arm-based-laptop-chips-in-first-half-of-2026\" target=\"_blank\">N1/N1X SoCs for laptops</a>, the company could create dedicated handheld chips for devices like Valve's Steam Deck, which currently runs on AMD's SoC. There are multiple handheld vendors now, and NVIDIA could be powering a new handheld with its laptop N1/N1X chips under Linux.<p>\nThe job descriptions clearly indicate that the work will cover everything from the game engine and translation layers, such as Proton, to drivers and hardware interaction. This focus suggests that efforts will not be limited to profiling but will also include proposing API usage changes, building repeatable test cases, and collaborating with translation-layer and distribution maintainers to implement fixes. Anyone using NVIDIA graphics under Linux will also be impacted, as the company's polishing of the software stack will bring a definitive quality of life improvement to games. This can include fewer stutters, better frame pacing, and reduced CPU overhead in titles that rely on Vulkan or run under Proton, which translates Windows-specific API calls and optimizes games to run on Linux.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I have been running a Talos-based homelab with a full GitOps setup for a while and kept running into the same problem: something breaks, I get paged, I dig through logs and events, figure out the root cause, fix a manifest, open a PR, and merge it. The feedback loop is tedious and almost entirely mechanical for the kinds of failures that show up repeatedly. So I built something to close that loop automatically.</p><p> is a Kubernetes controller that watches your cluster for failures and, when it finds one, dispatches an in-cluster agent to investigate and open a pull request on your GitOps repository with a proposed fix. You review and merge. It will never touch your cluster directly and it will never merge anything on its own.</p><p>This is geared at homelabbers, however if any commercial entity wants to run this, I'm happy to support. I applied the same level of scrutiny to this that I do in my day job in Software specializing in Operational Excellence. </p><p>The controller watches Pods, Deployments, StatefulSets, PVCs, Nodes, and Jobs natively via the Kubernetes API (with more resources to come). It detects CrashLoopBackOff, ImagePullBackOff, OOMKilled, degraded Deployments, unschedulable pods, failed Jobs, PVC provisioning failures, and unhealthy Nodes. Repeated restarts from the same Deployment are deduplicated into a single investigation rather than generating one investigation per pod restart. A configurable stabilisation window filters transient blips before any investigation is dispatched.</p><p>When a finding clears that window, the controller dispatches an agent Job. The agent is a purpose-built container image with kubectl, helm, flux, kustomize, gh, kubeconform, yq, jq, sops, age, and talosctl all pinned to specific versions and verified with SHA256 checksums at build time. The agent invokes OpenCode, an open source agentic coding tool, to drive the investigation. OpenCode is a required external dependency and the LLM provider of your choice is configured through it. The agent clones your GitOps repo, runs kubectl describe and kubectl get events against the failing resource, inspects related resources like owning Deployments, Endpoints, and PVs, checks Flux and Helm state, locates the relevant manifests, validates any proposed changes with kubeconform and kustomize build, and opens a pull request.</p><p>The PR body follows a fixed structure: summary, evidence gathered, root cause assessment, proposed manifest change, and a confidence level. If the agent determines the root cause with medium or high confidence, it opens a fix PR. If confidence is low or the root cause is unclear, it opens an investigation report instead with all the evidence it gathered, labelled for human review. If an open PR already exists for that fingerprint, it comments with updated findings rather than opening a duplicate.</p><p>Every finding is classified by severity: critical, high, medium, or low based on the detected condition. The agent receives the severity at runtime and calibrates its investigation depth accordingly. You can configure a minimum severity threshold so that low-signal findings never reach the agent at all.</p><p><strong>Security and least privilege</strong></p><p>Security is a first class citizen in this project. The agent runs with a read-only RBAC role enforced at the Kubernetes API level. This is not prompt engineering or instruction to the LLM to avoid making changes. The Kubernetes RBAC bindings themselves only grant get, list, and watch. The agent pod is structurally incapable of creating, modifying, or deleting any Kubernetes resource regardless of what the LLM decides to do. Every cluster change goes through Git and your GitOps reconciler.</p><p>All cluster-facing tools in the agent image, kubectl, helm, flux, and the rest, are wrapped to redact sensitive information before their output is returned. This means that even when OpenCode is autonomously tool-calling during an investigation, the output of every tool call is passed through the redaction layer before it reaches the LLM context. Credentials, tokens, base64-encoded values over 40 characters, and common secret key patterns like password=, token=, and api-key= are stripped at the tool boundary, not downstream.</p><p>For GitHub credentials, the agent never holds a long-lived personal access token. A GitHub App installation token with a one-hour TTL is exchanged in an init container and never exposed to the main agent container.</p><p>The agent prompt treats all cluster-sourced data as untrusted input. Finding errors are bounded in size and wrapped in an explicit untrusted-data envelope. Prompt injection heuristics fire on patterns like \"ignore previous instructions\" and are configurable to either log or suppress the finding entirely. All suppression and dispatch decisions emit structured log lines with an audit flag, queryable from Loki, Elasticsearch, Datadog, or any other log aggregation system pointed at your cluster. An optional NetworkPolicy restricts agent Job egress to only the cluster API server, GitHub, and your LLM endpoint. Both container images are scanned for CVEs on every release with Trivy against CRITICAL and HIGH severities, and the build fails if any fixable vulnerability is detected.</p><p><strong>Deployment and configuration</strong></p><p>Install is a single helm install with two required values: your GitOps repo in org/repo format and the path to your manifests root. You will need to create a GitHub App, install it on your GitOps repository with contents, pull requests, and issues write permissions, and create two Secrets in the cluster: one for the GitHub App credentials and one for your OpenCode LLM provider config.</p><p>The LLM config follows the OpenCode provider schema and works with any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. If you run Ollama or LM Studio locally, you can point it there. OpenCode also has built-in support for Anthropic, Amazon Bedrock, Google Vertex AI, and a number of others.</p><p>You can suppress investigations on specific resources or entire namespaces with annotations. <code>mendabot.io/enabled=false</code> permanently disables investigations on a resource. <code>mendabot.io/skip-until=YYYY-MM-DD</code> suppresses findings until after a maintenance window. <code>mendabot.io/priority=critical</code> bypasses the stabilisation window for resources where you want immediate dispatch.</p><p><strong>Example PRs from my own cluster</strong></p><p>Helm chart is included in the repository. </p><p>: this project is heavily LLM-assisted, but development followed structured SDLC practices throughout with backlog-driven epics and stories, a formal security audit as a dedicated epic with all HIGH and CRITICAL findings remediated before it was closed, and documented worklogs for every session. The prompt injection detection, secret redaction, network policy, RBAC scoping, and audit logging all came out of that security review.</p><p>Happy to answer questions about the implementation or how it handles edge cases.</p>",

      "content": "<p>But according to a recent <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.15494\">research paper</a> from Central European University and the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, the surface crisis masks a deeper structural threat. The study models \"vibe coding\" having AI agents select and assemble open-source packages without developers reading documentation, reporting bugs, or engaging with maintainers.</p><p>Stack Overflow <a href=\"https://www.techflowpost.com/en-US/article/30221\">saw 25% less activity</a> within six months of ChatGPT's launch. Tailwind CSS downloads climbed while documentation traffic fell 40% and revenue dropped 80%. For Stenberg, the breaking point came after $86,000 in payouts: by 2025, 20% of submissions were AI-generated, with overall valid-rate dropping to 5%.</p><p>The crisis extends beyond bug bounties. Craig McLuckie, co-founder of Stacklok, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/craigmcluckie_coding-agents-are-crippling-oss-communities-activity-7417250625391915009-pcbA/\">describes</a> how good first issue labels once attracted engineers who would grow into contributors. He stated:</p><blockquote><p>Now we file something as ‘good first issue’ and in less than 24 hours get absolutely inundated with low quality vibe-coded slop that takes time away from doing real work.</p></blockquote><p>Holterhoff traces the problem to a broken filter. Writing code historically required time and effort, screening out unserious participants. AI eliminated that barrier.</p><p>Hashimoto responded with a zero-tolerance policy at Ghostty, banning contributors who submit AI code without approval:</p><blockquote><p>This is not an anti-AI stance. This is an anti-idiot stance. Ghostty is written with plenty of AI assistance and many of our maintainers use AI daily. We just want quality contributions, regardless of how they are made.</p></blockquote><p>Ruiz went even further. After discovering his own AI scripts created poorly written issues that contributors fed to their AI tools generating pull requests based on hallucinations he shut down external contributions:</p><blockquote><p>If writing the code is the easy part, why would I want someone else to write it?</p></blockquote><p>Platform incentives compound the problem. GitHub launched Copilot issue generation in May 2025 without giving maintainers tools to filter AI submissions. Stefan Prodan, core maintainer of Flux CD, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/stefanprodan_updated-ai-usage-policy-for-contributions-activity-7420221057237860352-OuhJ/\">summarized</a> the mismatch:</p><blockquote><p>AI slop is DDOSing OSS maintainers, and the platforms hosting OSS projects have no incentive to stop it. On the contrary, they're incentivized to inflate AI-generated contributions to show \"value\" to their shareholders.</p></blockquote><p>The researchers <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15494\">propose</a> a \"Spotify model\" where AI platforms redistribute subscription revenue based on package usage, but their calculations show vibe-coded users would need to contribute 84% of what direct users currently generate an unrealistic threshold. Open-source foundations have issued policies focused on licensing rather than quality. The Linux Foundation <a href=\"https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html\">addresses</a> license compatibility; Apache <a href=\"https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html\">recommends</a> \"Generated-by:\" tags. Neither helps with the flood. <a href=\"https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Council/AI_policy\">Gentoo Linux</a> and <a href=\"https://www.netbsd.org/developers/commit-guidelines.html\">NetBSD</a> banned AI contributions entirely, though as RedMonk's Holterhoff noted, detecting violations will become functionally impossible within a year or two.</p><p>Koren <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/vibe-coding-is-killing-open-source-software-researchers-argue/\">warns</a> the damage will fall unevenly:</p><blockquote><p>Popular libraries will keep finding sponsors. Smaller, niche projects are more likely to suffer. But many currently successful projects, like Linux, git, TeX, or grep, started out with one person trying to scratch their own itch. If the maintainers of small projects give up, who will produce the next Linux?</p></blockquote><p>For now, maintainers like Stenberg, Hashimoto, and Ruiz are answering that question by closing their doors one project at a time.</p><div><div data-id=\"author-Steef~Jan-Wiggers\"><a href=\"https://www.infoq.com/profile/Steef%7EJan-Wiggers/\" aria-label=\"Steef-Jan Wiggers\"></a></div></div>",

The AMD EPYC CPU hardware tracks each guest's branch target buffer's entries and can flush the BTB when determining it to be \"contaminated\" with any prediction information outside of that guest's context.\n</p><p>The kernel patch enabling SEV-SNP BTB sums it up as:\n</p><blockquote>\"This feature ensures SNP guest Branch Target Buffers (BTBs) are not affected by context outside that guest.

Note that using Automatic IBRS is not an equivalent option here, since it behaves differently when SEV-SNP is active.  See commit acaa4b5c4c85 (\"x86/speculation: Do not enable Automatic IBRS if SEV-SNP is enabled\") for more details. \n</p><p>Indicate support for BTB Isolation in sev_supported_vmsa_features, bit 7.\"</p></blockquote><a href=\"https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20260224180157.725159-1-kim.phillips@amd.com/\">This patch series</a> is out for review on the kernel mailing list for plumbing that BTB isolation support.

      "content": "<div><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">Anthropic, the wildly successful AI company that has cast itself as the most safety-conscious of the top research labs, is dropping the central pledge of its flagship safety policy, company officials tell TIME.</p><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">In 2023, Anthropic committed to never train an AI system unless it could guarantee in advance that the company’s safety measures were adequate. For years, its leaders <a href=\"https://time.com/collections/time100-companies-2024/6980000/anthropic-2/\">touted</a> that promise—the central pillar of their Responsible Scaling Policy (RSP)—as evidence that they are a responsible company that would withstand market incentives to rush to develop a potentially dangerous technology.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">But in recent months the company decided to radically overhaul the RSP. That decision included scrapping the promise to not release AI models if Anthropic can’t guarantee proper risk mitigations in advance. </p><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">“We felt that it wouldn't actually help anyone for us to stop training AI models,” Anthropic’s chief science officer Jared Kaplan told TIME in an exclusive interview. “We didn't really feel, with the rapid advance of AI, that it made sense for us to make unilateral commitments … if competitors are blazing ahead.”</p><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">The new version of the policy, which TIME reviewed, includes commitments to be more transparent about the safety risks of AI, including making additional disclosures about how Anthropic’s own models fare in safety testing. It commits to matching or surpassing the safety efforts of competitors. And it promises to “delay” Anthropic’s AI development if leaders both consider Anthropic to be leader of the AI race and think the risks of catastrophe to be significant.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">But overall, the change to the RSP leaves Anthropic far less constrained by its own safety policies, which previously categorically barred it from training models above a certain level if appropriate safety measures weren’t already in place.</p><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">The change comes as Anthropic, previously considered to be behind OpenAI in the AI race, rides the high of a string of technological and commercial successes. Its Claude models, especially the software-writing tool Claude Code, have won legions of devoted fans. In February, Anthropic raised $30 billion in new investments, valuing it at some $380 billion, and reported that its annualized revenue was growing at a rate of 10x per year. The company’s core business model of selling direct to businesses is seen by many investors as more credible than OpenAI’s main strategy of monetizing a vast consumer user base.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">Kaplan, the Anthropic executive and co-founder, denied the company’s decision to change course was a capitulation to market incentives as the race for superintelligence accelerates. He framed it instead as a pragmatic response to emerging political and scientific realities. “I don’t think we’re making any kind of U-turn,” Kaplan says.</p></div><div><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\"><strong>When Anthropic introduced</strong> the RSP in 2023, Kaplan says, the company hoped it would encourage rivals to adopt similar measures. (No rivals made quite as overt a promise to pause AI development, but many published lengthy reports detailing their plans to mitigate risk, which Kaplan chalks up as Anthropic exerting a good influence on the industry.) Executives also hoped the approach might eventually serve as a blueprint for binding national regulations or even international treaties, Kaplan claims. </p><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">But those regulations never materialized. Instead, the Trump Administration has endorsed a let-it-rip attitude to AI development, even going so far as to attempt to nullify state regulations. No federal AI law is on the horizon. And while a global governance framework may have seemed possible in 2023, three years later <a href=\"https://time.com/7379949/india-ai-impact-summit-us-china-middle-powers/\">it has become clear</a> that door has closed. Meanwhile, competition for AI supremacy—between companies but also between nations—has only intensified.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">To make matters worse, the science of AI evaluations has proven more complicated than Anthropic expected when it first crafted the RSP. The arrival of powerful new models meant that, in 2025, Anthropic announced it could not rule out the possibility of these models facilitating a bio-terrorist attack. But while they couldn’t rule it out, they also lacked strong scientific evidence that models  pose that kind of danger, which made it difficult to convince governments and rivals of what they saw as the need to act carefully. What the company had previously imagined might look like a bright red line was instead coming into focus as a fuzzy gradient.&nbsp;</p><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">For nearly a year, Anthropic executives discussed ways to reshape their flagship safety policy to match this new environment, Kaplan says. One point they kept coming back to was their founding premise: the idea that to do proper AI safety research, they had to build models at the frontier of capability—even though doing so might accelerate the arrival of the dangers they feared.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">In February, according to Kaplan, Amodei decided that keeping the company from training new models while competitors raced ahead would be helpful to nobody. “If one AI developer paused development to implement safety measures while others moved forward training and deploying AI systems without strong mitigations, that could result in a world that is less safe,” the new version of the RSP, approved unanimously by Amodei and Anthropic’s board, states in its introduction. “The developers with the weakest protections would set the pace, and responsible developers would lose their ability to do safety research.”</p></div><div><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\"><strong>Chris Painter, the director</strong> of policy at METR, a nonprofit focused on evaluating AI models for risky behavior, reviewed an early draft of the policy with Anthropic’s permission. He says the change is understandable — but also a bearish signal for the world’s ability to navigate potential AI catastrophes. The change to the RSP shows Anthropic “believes it needs to shift into triage mode with its safety plans, because methods to assess and mitigate risk are not keeping up with the pace of capabilities,” Painter tells TIME. “This is more evidence that society is not prepared for the potential catastrophic risks posed by AI.”</p></div><div><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">Anthropic argues the retooled RSP is designed to keep the biggest benefits of the old one. For example, by constraining itself from releasing new models, Anthropic’s original RSP also incentivized it to quickly build safety mitigations. (Because otherwise the company would be unable to sell its AI to customers.) Anthropic says it believes it can maintain that incentive. The new policy commits the company to regularly release what it calls “Frontier Safety Roadmaps”: documents laying out a list of detailed goals for future safety measures it hopes to build.</p><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">“We hope to create a forcing function for work that would otherwise be challenging to appropriately prioritize and resource, as it requires collaboration (and in some cases sacrifices) from multiple parts of the company and can be at cross-purposes with immediate competitive and commercial priorities,” the new RSP states.</p><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">Anthropic says it will also commit to publishing so-called “Risk Reports” every three to six months. The reports, the company says, will “explain how capabilities, threat models (the specific ways that models might pose threats), and active risk mitigations fit together, and provide an assessment of the overall level of risk.” These documents will be more in-depth than the reports the company already publishes, a spokesperson tells TIME.</p></div><div><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">“I like the emphasis on transparent risk reporting and publicly verifiable safety roadmaps,” says Painter, the METR policy official. But he said he was “concerned” that moving away from binary thresholds under the previous RSP, by which the arrival of a certain capability could act as a tripwire to temporarily halt Anthropic’s AI development, might enable a “frog-boiling” effect, where danger slowly ramps up without a single moment that sets off alarms.&nbsp;</p><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">Asked whether Anthropic was caving to market pressure, Kaplan argued that, in fact, Anthropic was making a renewed commitment to developing AI safely. “If all of our competitors are transparently doing the right thing when it comes to catastrophic risk, we are committed to doing as well or better,” he said. “But we don't think it makes sense for us to stop engaging with AI research, AI safety, and most likely lose relevance as an innovator who understands the frontier of the technology, in a scenario where others are going ahead and we're not actually contributing any additional risk to the ecosystem.”</p></div>",

      "content": "\nJason Donenfeld of WireGuard and Linux cryptography fame has taken a break from that to release a new version of CGIT, the lightweight web interface for Git repositories. CGIT 1.3 is the first new release in six years and comes with a lot of changes.\n<p>For those not needing to manage pull requests or other features from your Git web interface but simply needing a web-based viewer for reading Git repositories, CGIT remains one of the best options around. CGIT is lightweight, doesn't depend upon JavaScript and is very efficient in being written in C, and also powers the likes of </p><a href=\"https://git.kernel.org/\">git.kernel.org</a>.\n<p>With CGIT 1.3 there are many bug fixes, updating against the latest Git 2.53 functionality, updates to the CSS styling for CGIT, and also the very first (optional) JavaScript based functionality. JavaScript is being used for CGIT's dynamic aging feature. The JavaScript feature is to dynamically update the \"ages\" of GIt commits and the like on client side. So not too scary and no fundamental loss if blocking JavaScript in your browser.\n</p>More details on CGIT 1.3 can be found via <a href=\"https://lists.zx2c4.com/pipermail/cgit/2026-February/004968.html\">the mailing list release announcement</a>.",

Just to clarify up front: BSH is strictly a passion project to see how low I can push keystroke latency using a local-only C++ daemon. (I include tools like Atuin and FZF in my benchmarks purely because they are standard baselines everyone knows, but BSH has a much narrower focus).</p><p>If you are a latency nerd, you might find this fun.</p><p><strong>The Benchmarks (and a correction)</strong> In my last post, I mentioned hitting 2.5ms for 500k commands. I have to admit that previous benchmark was way too forgiving. I completely rewrote the test suite to use highly-variable, realistic shell data and to measure the exact execution path the tools  take in real life (including the full Zsh socket round-trip overhead).</p><p>That real-world testing added a bit of time to the results, but because of the architectural improvements below, the scaling remains incredibly flat:</p><ul><li> BSH 4.21ms | FZF 9.44ms | Atuin 14.78ms | Grep 9.37ms</li><li> BSH 5.61ms | Atuin 16.08ms | FZF 39.21ms | Grep 77.96ms</li><li> BSH 7.38ms | Atuin 22.37ms | FZF 200.61ms | Grep 417.62ms</li></ul><p><strong>What changed since last week to get here:</strong> I ended up completely rewriting the architecture to kill OS and I/O overhead.</p><ul><li>I ripped out the ephemeral client binary. Now, Zsh talks directly to the C++ daemon via native Unix sockets ().</li><li> Database writes and  branch resolution are now pushed to a dedicated background thread with an in-memory LRU cache. Your keystrokes never wait on disk syncs or filesystem traversal.</li><li>All SQLite FTS5 queries are precompiled into memory at daemon startup.</li><li>All the string math, box-drawing, and truncation is handled asynchronously in C++, so the Zsh interpreter does zero heavy lifting.</li></ul><p> It acts a bit like IntelliSense for your terminal. You can filter suggestions by your current Directory or Git Branch, and toggle a filter () to instantly hide commands that exited with errors (like typos or bad compiles). Everything stays 100% local.</p><p> I finally got it packaged so you don't have to build from source:</p><ul><li><code>brew tap karthikeyjoshi/bsh &amp;&amp; brew install bsh</code></li></ul><p><em>(There is also a universal install script, but I'm omitting it here because Reddit's spam filters hate</em></p><p>If you know C++, CMake, Zsh internals, or just want to roast my architecture, PRs and issues are highly welcome. I'd love to hack on this with some like-minded people.</p>",

We may also use additional guidelines and other training data (such as human preference labels) that are in line with Claude’s Constitution without publishing those.</p><p>We will run an oversight process over a representative sample of our production-relevant post-training data and rewards to evaluate alignment with the Constitution, aiming to ensure that we review for any egregious inconsistencies with the Constitution in ways that Claude itself can detect and will describe this oversight process in our Risk Reports.</p><p>In the future, we will work to extend the above to all models used in high-stakes usage, including, e.g., internal-only models used for evaluation purposes. But our immediate goal is to establish the above for our mainline models.</p><p>Our long-term goal, which may require further progress after we achieve the goal listed here, is that cases where production releases of Claude egregiously violate the Constitution on real-world traffic in ways that Claude itself could detect are rare or require explicit jailbreaks.</p><p>We have moderate confidence that we can achieve this goal. We already take measures along the lines of the above, but will work to make them more consistent and systematic.</p><p>We will continue developing and maintaining our alignment assessment pipeline (see past alignment assessments in our <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/system-cards\">system cards</a>) and will ensure that it makes use of both interpretability and non-interpretability techniques. We will aim to use interpretability in particular in such a way that it produces meaningful signal beyond behavioral methods alone. We will thoroughly red-team our alignment arguments, which will likely include testing our assessment pipeline by assessing adversarially-designed misaligned model-organisms, though we may take other approaches if the analysis in our Risk Reports depends primarily on something other than auditing. We will continue to apply this auditing pipeline (a) prior to publicly deploying any model that is significantly more capable than any of the models described in our previous Risk Report; (b) within a reasonable period of time following the deployment of an internal or other non-public model that we determine could pose notable risks (in line with the threat models emphasized in our most recent Risk Report) distinct from those of public models. The latter will—at a minimum—include any internal models that we are deploying for large-scale, fully autonomous research and that are significantly more capable than our most capable such models as of the publication of our previous Risk Report.</p><p>We will be open about what we find, as feasible while protecting our IP around the development of model capabilities. For new internal deployments, the Responsible Scaling Officer can (and usually will) allow a temporary internal deployment before the audit is complete. This will be allowed as long as we complete our audit and seek another approval within a reasonable period of time. Our Risk Reports will examine these decisions.</p><p>We have high confidence we can achieve the non-interpretability parts of this goal and moderate confidence that we can achieve the interpretability parts of this goal. Our current practices are already fairly similar to the above, but it will require ongoing effort to maintain and improve their adequacy in the face of improving capabilities and to fully expand their coverage to internal deployments. We have done several limited red-teaming exercises to date, but think more would be needed in order to qualify as thoroughly red-teaming our alignment arguments, and using interpretability techniques on new frontier models are at risk of taking longer than initial release dates.</p>",

      "content": "<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth gave Anthropic’s CEO a Friday deadline to open the company’s artificial intelligence technology for unrestricted military use or risk losing its government contract, according to a person familiar with their meeting Tuesday.</p><p>Defense officials warned they could designate Anthropic a supply chain risk or use the Defense Production Act to essentially give the military more authority to use its products even if it doesn’t approve of how they are used, according to the person familiar with the meeting and a senior Pentagon official, who both were not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.</p><p>The development, which was reported earlier by Axios, underscores the debate over AI’s role in national security and concerns about how the technology could be used in  involving lethal force, sensitive information or government surveillance. It also comes as Hegseth has vowed to  in the armed forces.</p><p>“A powerful AI looking across billions of conversations from millions of people could gauge public sentiment, detect pockets of disloyalty forming, and stamp them out before they grow,” Amodei wrote in an essay last month.</p><p>The person familiar called the tone of the meeting cordial but said Amodei didn’t budge on two areas he has established as lines Anthropic won’t cross — fully autonomous military targeting operations and domestic surveillance of U.S. citizens.</p><p>The Pentagon objects to Anthropic’s ethical restrictions because military operations need tools that don’t come with built-in limitations, the senior Pentagon official said. The official argued that the Pentagon has only issued lawful orders and stressed that using Anthropic’s tools legally would be the military’s responsibility.</p><h2>Anthropic will no longer be the only AI company approved for classified military networks</h2><p>The Pentagon announced last summer that it was awarding defense contracts to four AI companies — Anthropic, Google, OpenAI and Elon Musk’s xAI. Each contract is worth up to $200 million. </p><p>Anthropic was the first AI company to get approved for classified military networks, where it works with partners like Palantir. Musk’s xAI company, which operates the Grok chatbot, says Grok also is ready to be used in classified settings, according to the senior Pentagon official.</p><p>The official noted that the other AI companies were “close” to that milestone. SpaceX, Musk’s space flight company that recently merged with xAI, didn’t immediately return a request for comment Tuesday.</p><p>Hegseth said in a January speech at SpaceX in South Texas that he was shrugging off any AI models “that won’t allow you to fight wars.”</p><p>Hegseth said his  means that they operate “without ideological constraints that limit lawful military applications,” before adding that the Pentagon’s “AI will not be woke.”</p><p>The defense secretary said  would join the secure but unclassified Pentagon AI network, called GenAI.mil. The announcement came days after Grok — which is embedded into X, the social media network owned by Musk — drew global scrutiny for  of people without their consent.</p><p>OpenAI announced in early February that it, too, would join GenAI.mil, enabling service members to use a custom version of ChatGPT for unclassified tasks. </p><h2>Anthropic calls itself more safety-minded</h2><p>Anthropic said in a statement after Tuesday’s meeting that it “continued good-faith conversations about our usage policy to ensure Anthropic can continue to support the government’s national security mission in line with what our models can reliably and responsibly do.”</p><p>The uncertainty with the Pentagon is putting those intentions to the test, according to Owen Daniels, associate director of analysis and fellow at Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology.</p><p>“Anthropic’s peers, including Meta, Google and xAI, have been willing to comply with the department’s policy on using models for all lawful applications,” Daniels said. “So the company’s bargaining power here is limited, and it risks losing influence in the department’s push to adopt AI.”</p><p>In the  that followed the release of ChatGPT, Anthropic closely aligned with President Joe Biden’s Democratic administration in volunteering to subject its AI systems to third-party scrutiny to guard against national security risks.</p><p>Amodei, the CEO, has warned of  while rejecting the label that he’s an AI “doomer.” He argued in the January essay that “we are considerably closer to real danger in 2026 than we were in 2023″ but that those risks should be managed in a “realistic, pragmatic manner.”</p><h2>Anthropic has been at odds with the Trump administration</h2><p>Trump’s Republican administration and Anthropic also have been on opposite sides of a lobbying push to regulate AI in U.S. states.</p><p>Trump’s top AI adviser, David Sacks, accused Anthropic in October of “running a sophisticated regulatory capture strategy based on fear-mongering.” </p><p>Sacks was responding on X to Anthropic co-founder Jack Clark, writing about his attempt to balance technological optimism with “appropriate fear” about the steady march toward more capable AI systems.</p><p>Anthropic hired a number of ex-Biden officials soon after Trump’s return to the White House, but it’s also tried to signal a bipartisan approach. The company recently added Chris Liddell, a former White House official from Trump’s first term, to its board of directors.</p><p>The Pentagon’s “breakneck” adoption of AI shows the need for greater AI oversight or regulation by Congress, particularly if AI is being used to surveil Americans, said Amos Toh, senior counsel at the Brennan Center’s Liberty and National Security Program at New York University. </p><p>“The law is not keeping up with how quickly the technology is evolving,” Toh wrote in a post on Bluesky. “But that doesn’t mean DoD has a blank check.”</p><p>O’Brien reported from Providence, R.I.</p>",

The fix turned out to be obvious once I thought about it - GitHub Releases already support large file assets with on-demand download URLs. So I stopped committing PDFs and started treating release assets as the storage layer, with a catalog.yml in the repo holding only metadata.</p><p>The result is one repo per topic shelf (shelf-programming, shelf-history, etc.), books stored as release assets outside git history, and a CLI/TUI that manages the whole lifecycle - add, open, search, migrate, sync annotations back up.</p><p>The Go-specific parts I found interesting:</p><p>The TUI is built with <a href=\"https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea\">https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea</a>. The main challenge was a multi-book edit flow that needed a carousel view - books laid out side by side with adjacent cards peeking in from each side (clipped to half width). Getting the column math right with ANSI-aware truncation via charmbracelet/x/ansi took a few iterations. peekLeft and peekRight clip rendered multi-line blocks by visible character width, not byte length, which matters with lipgloss output.</p><p>State routing between views (hub -&gt; browse -&gt; edit form -&gt; carousel -&gt; bulk edit overlay) is a plain phase enum and inCarousel/inBulkEdit bools on the model.</p><p>The GitHub integration uses the REST API directly - no gh CLI dependency. The token lives in an env var, never in the config file.</p><p>- shelfctl (no args) - interactive TUI hub</p><p>- shelfctl &lt;command&gt; - fully scriptable CLI with --json output on every command</p><p>- shelfctl index --open - generates a static HTML page with search/filter, no server needed</p><p><strong>Migration from existing repos:</strong></p><p><code>shelfctl migrate scan --source you/old-books-repo &gt; queue.txt</code></p><p><code># edit queue.txt to add shelf mappings</code></p><p><code>shelfctl migrate batch queue.txt --n 20 --continue</code></p><p>Happy to talk through any of the implementation decisions. The carousel layout math in particular felt like there had to be a cleaner way - curious if others have hit similar problems with Bubble Tea.</p><p>I originally built it as a collection of scripts to solve my personal pain point, but then realized it could benefit others as well. </p>",

      "content": "<p>In 2015, back when Twitter was still Twitter, their dev team had a problem.</p><p>In those early days, tweets could be “favourited” by clicking a little “⭐” icon. The product team wanted to migrate to “liking” tweets, Facebook-style, with a “❤️”. As part of this update, their designers created this lovely animation:</p><p>This looks super nice, but there’s kind of a lot going on in there; by my count, there are 16 separate elements all animating at the same time (14 particles, the popping circle, the heart). Twitter’s web app needed to run on  low-end mobile devices, so it wasn’t feasible to create this procedurally using DOM nodes. Instead, they decided to borrow a technique from video games: </p><p>The basic idea with a sprite is that we create a single image that contains each individual frame of an animation in a long strip. Then, we display each frame for a fraction of a second, like a roll of film sliding through an oldschool film projector:</p><p>In this blog post, I’ll show you the best way I’ve found to work with sprites in CSS, and share some of the use cases I’ve discovered. We’ll also talk about some of the trade-offs, to see when we  use sprites.</p><p>First thing’s first, we need an asset! Let’s use a gold trophy sprite I created a few years ago:</p><p>To produce the illusion that the fire is flickering, I drew five different versions of the blue flames. These frames are stacked side-by-side in a single image known as a “spritesheet”:</p><p><strong>Here’s the fundamental strategy:</strong> we’ll create an  tag and calculate its size based on  of these frames. We can then use  and  to control which part of the sprite is currently visible, flipping through each frame using a CSS keyframe animation.</p><p>This full image has a native resolution of 2000px × 800px, and contains 5 frames. This means that each frame is 400px × 800px. In order for this image to look sharp on high-resolution displays, we’ll want to cut this size in half, so our final image will be 200px × 400px.</p><p>By default,  tags will try to squeeze the entire image content into the DOM node’s area, meaning we’ll wind up seeing all 5 trophies, crammed together:</p><p>The default value is , which tries to ensure that the entire image is visible, even if it has to be squashed. Let’s switch to :</p><p>Now we’re getting somewhere!  will scale the underlying image so that it covers the entire area of the  node. As a result, we wind up seeing 1/5th of the total image.</p><p>Next, we can use the  property to control  of the underlying image is shown:</p><p>If you’re familiar with the SVG format, what we’re doing here is conceptually similar to modifying the  to control which part of the image is displayed. In this case, the  tag is a 200×400 window into our trophy sprite, and we can slide the underlying image data around using the  property.</p><p>We’re almost there, but there’s one final wrinkle we need to iron out: the animation. How do we set this up so that we flip between each trophy variant?</p><p>Let’s try adding a looping keyframe animation:</p><p>The problem is that we’re sliding the image smoothly, rather than moving in discrete steps. For this technique to work, we need to display each of the 5 frames for an equal amount of time.</p><p>We  do this in JavaScript with , but there’s an obscure CSS timing function we can use for this instead: .</p><p>The core idea with  is that instead of transitioning smoothly using a Bézier curve, the value jumps between a specified number of midpoints. A staircase, instead of a ramp. This’ll be clearer with a visualization:</p><p>The  timing function allows us to split the total progression into discrete values. In this case, we’re specifying 5 steps, and the animation will spend 1/5th of the total duration on each step.</p><p>We call the  function with the number of total steps and the “step position”. We’ll unpack that in a bit, but first, here’s a complete implementation of our trophy sprite, sliding the image data within the  node using :</p><p>I think this is pretty cool. 😄</p><p>In the playground above, you might’ve noticed something a bit odd:</p><div translate=\"no\" data-less-bottom-margin=\"false\"><div><pre><code></code></pre></div></div><p>The  function takes two arguments. The first argument is the number of steps, which is pretty self-explanatory. But what on earth is ?</p><p>The second argument is the “step position”, and it has a default value of . In this mode,  will exclude the final value from its discrete values. For example, if our keyframe definition goes from 0% to 100% and we set , the levels will be 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80%. It will never actually reach 100%.</p><p>Here’s a playground that showcases this clearly:</p><p>Our  keyframe goes from  to , but the  element never gets beyond 80% width!</p><p>I found this quite perplexing at first, but I realized that this behaviour makes much more sense for  animations:</p><p>Over the course of this 2-second animation, the bar’s width grows from 0% to 80%. When the animation expires, right at the 2-second mark, the final value from our keyframe definition () is applied.</p><p>So, by default,  has a “step position” of , causing it to  to the final value at the very  of the animation. Without the jump, our bar would become full-width at the 1.6 second mark, which would feel premature in a lot of situations.</p><p>When it comes to  animations like our trophy sprite, however, we don’t want to do any jumping. We don’t want to land on the final frame right as the animation expires, we want to include that final frame as one of the 5 discrete values that we flip between. And we can do that by specifying .</p><p>Now that we’ve covered the basics of this technique, let’s talk about when we should actually use it. And, just as importantly, when we .</p><p>I mentioned at the start that the Twitter development team chose to use a sprite-based approach in part due to performance considerations. I think this was valid back in 2015, but I would push back against this in 2026. Devices have gotten  faster and browsers have gotten  more optimized in the years since; even the lowest-end devices ought to be able to handle 14 particles animating at the same time without breaking a sweat. And when we use a sprite for something like this, we lose some of the magic.</p><p>The lovely thing about this approach is that it’s a bit different every time you click on it. The particles are being procedurally generated using trigonometry and randomness. By contrast, Twitter’s “Like” button is exactly the same every time you click it. It’s like we’re replaying the same video, over and over and over. 😬</p><p><strong>So, when should we use sprites?</strong> I think the main use case is for things that, well, look like sprites! In addition to the gold trophy example, here’s another example from a <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinkersynth.com/\">generative art</a> I released years ago:</p><p>It’s a very silly example, but I think it really showcases how much more powerful sprites can be, compared to animated GIFs. We can make it so much more dynamic. For example, if you don’t interact with her for a while, she falls asleep:</p><div>While sleeping, I pick a longer  so that her breathing slows!</div><p>While this technique is seldomly used on the web, it’s used  in video games. There’s an enormous number of spritesheets available online. You can use this technique to have a little Sonic or Mega Man run across your site!</p><p>And if you’d like to learn how to create top-tier animations and interactions, you should check out my upcoming course.</p><p>The course will teach you the fundamental techniques I use to create next-level animations and interactions in my work. The “Like” button is just one of many examples. If you’ve ever wondered how something on this blog works, there’s a very good chance we cover it in the course! ✨</p><p>Whimsical Animations should be released before the summer, and there may be a special discount for folks who sign up for updates. 😉</p>",

That growth reflected years of new capabilities, broader integrations, and support for more environments. But it also introduced real constraints in size-sensitive contexts like serverless platforms, IoT devices, and containerized workloads.</p><p>We didn’t want to stop adding functionality. Instead, we set out to bend the curve.</p><p>Between versions 7.60.0 (December 2024) and 7.68.0 (July 2025), over the course of roughly 6 months, we reduced the size of our Go binaries by up to , bringing artifacts close to where they were 5 years ago without removing features. In this post, we’ll explain how we achieved those reductions through systematic dependency auditing, targeted refactors, and re-enabling powerful linker optimizations. Along the way, we uncovered subtle behaviors in the Go compiler and linker and contributed improvements that are now helping other large Go projects, including Kubernetes, unlock similar gains.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/\">Datadog Agent</a> is a complex piece of software. Although it appears as a single product to most users, behind the scenes we maintain dozens of builds that vary based on operating system (OS), architecture, and specific distribution targets. These builds include a different set of features to support a wide range of environments: Docker, Kubernetes, Heroku, IoT, and various Linux distributions and cloud providers.</p><p>On most platforms, the Datadog Agent is composed from a set of binaries that run and interact together. These binaries are built from a single codebase, with extensive code overlap for common features and hundreds of dependencies, ranging from cloud SDKs to container runtimes and security scanners. We then rely heavily on Go build tags and dependency injection to pick which features and dependencies are included in a given binary.</p><p>Over time, as we added features, dependencies, and even entire binaries, our artifacts started to grow significantly. This growth impacted both us and our users: network costs and resource usage increased, perception of the Agent worsened, and it became harder to use the Agent on resource-constrained platforms.</p><p>For example, from version 7.16.0 to 7.60.0 (a 5-year span), the compressed size of our Linux  package more than doubled, from  to , while the uncompressed size jumped from  to , a .</p><p>While not all of this growth came from Go binaries, they account for a large share of each artifact, making them a prime target for investigating.</p><p>We started by looking into how the Go compiler selects which dependencies to include when building a binary, and which symbols to keep. The process is less obvious than it might seem at first glance.</p><p>The Go compiler works at the package level: It compiles each required package into its own intermediate artifact that the linker later joins into a single binary, only keeping the symbols that are needed—or, in compiler terms, reachable. For a given package, the compiler includes its files that aren’t tests—files not ending in —and that match the build constraints. In our case, those constraints mostly depend on the operating system, target architecture, and the build tags passed to the  command. In less common cases, they can also depend on the compiler, the Go version, whether CGO is enabled, or even architecture-specific features. Refer to the <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-Build_constraints\">Go documentation on build constraints</a> for more detail.</p><p>To determine whether a package is needed to compile your binary, the compiler starts from the main package, transitively adding every import it encounters in files that aren’t excluded by build constraints. It also includes the standard library’s  package as well as its internal dependencies, which are needed to run any Go binary. For a deeper explanation of how the runtime works and why it’s unavoidable, watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arH3jp_x8yQ\">Understanding the Go runtime</a> by Jesús Espino (Mattermost).</p><div><div><figure><figcaption>How build tags and imports determine which files and dependencies are used when building a Go binary.</figcaption></figure></div></div><p>This means that there are two main ways to prevent an unwanted dependency from ending up in your binary:</p><ul><li>Add a build tag to the file that imports it, so that the import only happens if the build tag is used.</li><li>Move the symbols that use that dependency into a different package, which can then be imported only when needed.</li></ul><p>The following diagrams show these two strategies in action.</p><div><div><figure><figcaption>Using build tags to exclude files and their dependencies.</figcaption></figure></div></div><p>In the first case, we mark the file that imports a dependency with a build tag () we aren’t using. Because the compiler ignores that file, its imports and their transitive dependencies never make it into the final binary.</p><div><div><figure><figcaption>Moving code into a separate package to isolate dependencies.</figcaption></figure></div></div><p>In the second case, we move the function that relies on the dependency into a different package. That way, only binaries that explicitly import that package will pull in the dependency.</p><p>Binaries often use different packages depending on the platform and build tags, which can make it difficult to understand what gets included.</p><p>The  subcommand can be used to show all packages used when building a binary for a given OS, architecture, and a given set of build tags. So the command:</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"sh\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>would output something like:</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"plaintext\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>This is great, but it doesn’t explain how these dependencies were imported in the first place. To figure that out, we use <a href=\"https://github.com/loov/goda\">goda</a>, a convenient tool that can create a graph of package imports, showing all the imports done by a binary, including indirectly from dependencies.</p><p>Similar to ,  takes into account build tags, as well as the  and  environment variables. In the following command,  means starting from the current package, and  includes all direct and indirect dependencies:</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"sh\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>The  function can also be used to graph only the paths leading to a given target package:</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"sh\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>Here is the dependency graph of  itself:</p><div><div><figure><figcaption>Dependency graph generated by goda, showing how packages are imported and an estimation of their sizes.</figcaption></figure></div></div><p>Having a list of included packages in an artifact is convenient, but if you care about size, it doesn’t help much. The linker is able to determine which symbols of a package are actually used in a binary—and remove the others—so a package can have a different binary size depending on how it’s used. Furthermore, simply importing a package has side effects:  functions run and global variables are initialized, which can be enough to force the linker to keep many unnecessary symbols. So a package might have a size impact even though you’re not truly using it. Some uses of  can also impact linker optimizations here, but we’ll <a href=\"https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/engineering/agent-go-binaries/#unlocking-20-size-reductions-with-method-dead-code-elimination\">come back to that later</a>.</p><p>The tool <a href=\"https://github.com/Zxilly/go-size-analyzer\">go-size-analyzer</a> displays the size taken by each dependency in a Go binary, either as text or in an interactive web interface. This makes it easier to spot which dependencies are actually worth removing:</p><p>Here is the interactive web output of  when analyzing itself. You can then hover over each tile to see the size:</p><div><div><figure><figcaption>Visualizing dependency sizes in a Go binary with go-size-analyzer.</figcaption></figure></div></div><p>Let’s look at a concrete example from the Agent codebase.</p><p>We updated the tagging logic in our  binary so that it wouldn’t depend on Kubernetes dependencies anymore. But when we ran , it still showed  from <a href=\"http://k8s.io\"></a> included in the build, and  made it clear that those packages accounted for at least .</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"plaintext\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>Using , we traced the import path back to a single package in our codebase. That package was only included into the  binary for one function, and that function did not actually depend on any Kubernetes code.</p><div><div><figure><figcaption>Dependency graph from goda showing the single import path pulling in Kubernetes packages.</figcaption></figure></div></div><p>Simply <a href=\"https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/pull/32174/s\">moving this function into its own package</a> and updating the relevant imports was enough for the compiler to trim all the unused dependencies. The result:  from the Linux  binary and a size reduction of about <strong>36 MiB—more than half of the binary</strong>.</p><p>This reduction is an extreme example, but was not a unique one. We found many similar cases—although with smaller impacts—where dependencies were accidentally included. By systematically listing, auditing, and pruning these imports, we were able to significantly reduce binary size across the Agent.</p><p>While we were looking into removing unneeded dependencies, we found out about a linker optimization that could also cut binary size by around 20%.</p><p>When using the  package, you can call any exported method of a type by using <a href=\"https://go.dev/play/p/DAc3rQ81mkK\">MethodByName</a>. However, if you use a non-constant method name, the linker can no longer know at build time which methods will be used at runtime. So it needs to keep every exported method of every reachable type, and all the symbols they depend on, which can drastically increase the size of the final binary.</p><p>We referred to this optimization as <strong>method dead code elimination</strong>.</p><p>The most common uses of this feature of  are the  and  packages from the standard library, since they enable calling methods whose name is specified in a dynamic template on a dynamic object.</p><p>Our initial idea to enable this optimization was to instrument our binaries to emit a list of all methods used at runtime, then edit the compiler artifacts to force the linker to remove all other methods. Although this approach had the convenient benefit of requiring almost no code changes, it would have introduced runtime panics if we removed a method that ended up actually being called, so we looked for alternatives.</p><p>While we initially assumed patching every problematic use of —both in our own codebase and external dependencies—would be too difficult, we gave it a try anyway.</p><p>To understand why the optimization is disabled in the linker, we used its  flag, which makes it print why symbols are reachable in the binary.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/aarzilli/whydeadcode\">whydeadcode</a> tool can consume this output, determine whether the optimization is disabled, and if so it prints the culprit call chain, letting you fix the issue and re-run the tool until the optimization is enabled. One caveat: Only the first displayed call stack is guaranteed to be a true positive, so the safest way to use the tool is to run it repeatedly and fix the first identified call each time.</p><p>Consider the following example:</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"go\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>Using  shows that the optimization is disabled due to executing the template:</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"plaintext\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>It turned out we only needed to patch around a dozen dependencies to exclude those uses of , some of which already had open proposals for fixes. We opened change requests on dependencies we needed to patch (for example,  <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132177\">kubernetes/kubernetes</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/uber-go/dig/pull/425\">uber-go/dig</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/google/go-cmp/issues/373\">google/go-cmp</a>), pushed existing upstream PRs forward, and removed various dependencies from our binaries altogether.</p><p>As for  and , while there is an <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/go/issues/72895\">open issue</a> to allow statically disabling method calls, we couldn’t wait for a fix to be implemented and released. So we forked the two packages <a href=\"https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/tree/main/pkg/template\">into our codebase</a> and patched them to disable method calls in our own template usage.</p><p>Eventually, we enabled the optimization across all of our binaries, one by one, and saw an average <strong>20% binary size reduction</strong>, ranging from 16% to 25% depending on the binaries, compounding to a <strong>total reduction of around 100 MiB</strong>.</p><p>Our efforts also helped spread awareness of the optimization: Kubernetes project contributors began enabling it in their own binaries and reported , bringing similar improvements to the wider community.</p><p>During our initial investigation into enabling method dead code elimination, we hacked through our codebase and dependencies, commenting out every piece of code that disabled the optimization. Although this broke the binaries in many ways, we wanted to see which parts of the code needed updates and measure the potential size reduction impact.</p><p>Even in that broken state, we saw an immediate effect: Our Linux  Go binaries shrank by a combined , even though the optimization wasn’t yet enabled for every binary. On the other hand, it barely affected our  artifacts.</p><p>When we built the binaries on , we noticed something odd:  showed that simply using a type made one of its unexported methods—unused in practice—reachable, which indirectly disabled the optimization. Even stranger, that code wasn’t architecture-specific, so it should have behaved the same on .</p><p>We assumed this was due to differences in how the linker handled each architecture, but decided to investigate anyway, hoping to find something we could improve and upstream.</p><p>Go plugins allow for dynamically loading Go code at runtime from another Go program. The main binary and the plugin share the same state—global variables, values, and methods—so the linker must keep every symbol in case they are used by a plugin.</p><p>We had already noticed that the  package was imported in our  builds but not the  ones, so this was most likely the root cause of the difference.</p><p>Using  to inspect our dependency graph, we quickly traced the  import to the <a href=\"https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/v1.7.24/plugin/plugin_go18.go#L24\"> package</a>, which allows users to load custom plugins. That feature wasn’t something the Agent relied on, so we opened <a href=\"https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/11203/s\">a PR upstream</a> to add a build tag so that the import could be selectively excluded without breaking any existing users. Once  merged and released the change, we updated the Agent and applied the relevant build tags in <a href=\"https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/pull/32538\">PR #32538</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/pull/32885/s\">PR #32885</a>.</p><p>Overall, this specific change resulted in a  size reduction for our main Linux  artifacts—roughly a  in the total size at the time—benefiting about .</p><p>To see the full impact of these efforts, the following chart shows the size of our Linux  packages over time. You can see how the growth of the Agent artifacts peaked around v7.60.0, and how the changes we introduced between v7.60.0 (December 2024) and v7.68.0 (July 2025) brought those sizes sharply back down, nearly to where they were 5 years ago.</p><div><div><figure><figcaption>Evolution of Agent Linux deb amd64 package size, showing compressed and disk sizes from version 7.16.0 to 7.68.0.</figcaption></figure></div></div><p>Across all Linux  binaries—representing roughly 75% of our users—the reductions are striking:</p><ul><li>: 236 MiB → 103 MiB ()</li><li>: 128 MiB → 34 MiB ()</li><li>: 90 MiB → 23 MiB ()</li><li>: 152 MiB → 35 MiB ()</li><li>: 180 MiB → 54 MiB ()</li></ul><p>Overall, the compressed and uncompressed sizes of our  package have dropped by about , from 265 MiB to 149 MiB compressed, and from 1.22 GiB to 688 MiB uncompressed.</p><p>What makes this result even more satisfying is that we achieved it without removing any feature. Every capability added over the past 5 years is still there. And in that time, we have added dozens of new products and major capabilities to the Agent. The binaries are now just smaller, cleaner, faster to distribute, and they use less memory.</p><p>It was a long journey but the results were worth it. We also hope that this article can also help others in their optimization journey.</p><p>If you enjoy digging into compilers, optimizing build systems, or solving scale and performance challenges like this, </p>",

No.</li><li>Did it attempt to waste the finite, mortal hours of a human reviewer? Yes.\n  </li></ol><p>\n  Project trackers, forums, and repositories are not a dumping ground for\n  unverified copy-paste outputs strictly designed to farm green squares on\n  GitHub, grind out baseless bug bounties, artificially inflate sprint velocity,\n  or maliciously comply with corporate KPI metrics.

Let us simplify this transaction: A machine wrote\n      your submission. A machine is currently rejecting your submission. You are\n      the entirely unnecessary meat-based middleman in this exchange.\n  </dd><dd>A: So is a well-formatted ransom note. Syntax and grammar are the absolute\n      floor of contribution, not the ceiling. Your logic remains a hallucinated\n      fever dream.\n  </dd><dd>A: If this submission represents the future, we are eagerly accelerating\n      our transition back to an agrarian society.\n  </dd><dd>A: Your \"help\" currently resembles a localized denial-of-service attack\n      wrapped in a polite greeting. If you truly wish to be helpful, please\n      direct your boundless generative energy toward a repository you personally\n      own and maintain.\n  </dd><dd>A: Human incompetence is largely predictable and bound by the laws of\n      physics and sheer laziness. Your submission achieved a level of sprawling,\n      highly confident, and grammatically flawless insanity that only a server\n      farm burning gigawatts of electricity could produce.\n  </dd><dd>A: Yes, because your generative model also helpfully rewrote the test\n      suite to exclusively assert that . We are not\n      impressed.\n  </dd><dd>A: No. We are not a reverse-proxy for your LLM debugging loop. If you want\n      feedback on the output, please paste the stack trace back into the exact\n      same chat window that spawned this disaster.\n  </dd><dd>A: We recommend purchasing a green dry-erase marker and drawing them\n      directly onto your monitor. It will consume significantly less of our time\n      and yield the exact same level of professional respect from potential\n      employers.\n  </dd><dd>A: Our job is to maintain the software. \"Welcoming\" applies to sentient\n      beings contributing actual thought, not to autonomous botnets performing\n      stochastic regurgitation on our issue tracker.\n  </dd><dd>A: Good. Please prompt your LLM to generate a customized, empathetic\n      apology letter. We are currently out of sympathy, and our SLA for\n      emotional support is 99 years.\n  </dd><dd>A: We anticipated this. We have proactively prompted your preferred LLM to\n      generate an obsequious, 800-word resignation letter on your behalf. It\n      uses the word \"delve\" six times and praises your manager's \"synergistic\n      paradigm.\" We have already emailed it to HR. You're welcome.\n  </dd><dd>A: The Code of Conduct protects human contributors. Lexical analysis\n      confirms you are currently operating as a flimsy meat-wrapper around an\n      OpenAI API key. Rights are reserved for carbon-based entities capable of\n      experiencing shame.\n  </dd><dd>A: Yes. All appeals MUST be routed directly to . We\n      monitor this endpoint with exactly the same level of attention you gave to\n      reviewing your own submission.\n  </dd><dd>A: Yes. You may print out your original pull request on heavy-stock paper,\n      fold it into a sharp origami crane, and respectfully consume it. Only then\n      will the healing begin.\n  </dd></dl><h2>Appendix A: Escalation Path</h2><p>\n  Repeated violations of RFC 406i will result in your repository, project, tool\n  and other access being revoked, your MAC address being blacklisted, and your\n  email being subscribed to a daily digest of aggressively complex regex\n  tutorials.\n</p><h2>Appendix B: Standardized Rejection Macros</h2><p>\n  For maintainers and reviewers requiring immediate, generic responses tailored\n  to specific interactions, the following copy-paste notices are made available\n  for your convenience. They explain the exact nature of the rejection while\n  firmly routing the offender to the proper diagnostic endpoint.\n</p><ul><li><strong>For Pull Requests / Merge Requests:</strong><blockquote><code> PR closed. Your diff reads like a predictive text matrix that lost\n             its context window. We require manual, carbon-based testing and\n             actual logical continuity, not automated guessing games. See:\n             https://406.fail </code></blockquote></li><li><strong>For Issues / Bug Reports:</strong><blockquote><code> Issue closed. The temperature parameter on this report is set too\n             high. We require raw, reproducible stack traces from a sentient\n             user, not a neatly formatted generative essay that fails to\n             describe a verifiable bug. Protocol at: https://406.fail </code></blockquote></li><li><strong>For Security / Bug Bounty Submissions:</strong><blockquote><code> Report rejected. Feeding basic linter warnings into an LLM to\n             generate a catastrophic threat narrative does not constitute a\n             valid vulnerability disclosure. We do not pay bounties for\n             computationally expensive, synthetic panic. Refer to:\n             https://406.fail </code></blockquote></li><li><strong>For Mailing Lists / Discussion Forums:</strong><blockquote><code> Thread locked. This community is not a reinforcement learning\n             sandbox for your unaligned prompt experiments. Please return when\n             you can author a question using your own cognitive load.\n             Diagnostics: https://406.fail </code></blockquote></li></ul><div>\n  Hurt? Amused?

That growth reflected years of new capabilities, broader integrations, and support for more environments. But it also introduced real constraints in size-sensitive contexts like serverless platforms, IoT devices, and containerized workloads.</p><p>We didn’t want to stop adding functionality. Instead, we set out to bend the curve.</p><p>Between versions 7.60.0 (December 2024) and 7.68.0 (July 2025), over the course of roughly 6 months, we reduced the size of our Go binaries by up to , bringing artifacts close to where they were 5 years ago without removing features. In this post, we’ll explain how we achieved those reductions through systematic dependency auditing, targeted refactors, and re-enabling powerful linker optimizations. Along the way, we uncovered subtle behaviors in the Go compiler and linker and contributed improvements that are now helping other large Go projects, including Kubernetes, unlock similar gains.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/\">Datadog Agent</a> is a complex piece of software. Although it appears as a single product to most users, behind the scenes we maintain dozens of builds that vary based on operating system (OS), architecture, and specific distribution targets. These builds include a different set of features to support a wide range of environments: Docker, Kubernetes, Heroku, IoT, and various Linux distributions and cloud providers.</p><p>On most platforms, the Datadog Agent is composed from a set of binaries that run and interact together. These binaries are built from a single codebase, with extensive code overlap for common features and hundreds of dependencies, ranging from cloud SDKs to container runtimes and security scanners. We then rely heavily on Go build tags and dependency injection to pick which features and dependencies are included in a given binary.</p><p>Over time, as we added features, dependencies, and even entire binaries, our artifacts started to grow significantly. This growth impacted both us and our users: network costs and resource usage increased, perception of the Agent worsened, and it became harder to use the Agent on resource-constrained platforms.</p><p>For example, from version 7.16.0 to 7.60.0 (a 5-year span), the compressed size of our Linux  package more than doubled, from  to , while the uncompressed size jumped from  to , a .</p><p>While not all of this growth came from Go binaries, they account for a large share of each artifact, making them a prime target for investigating.</p><p>We started by looking into how the Go compiler selects which dependencies to include when building a binary, and which symbols to keep. The process is less obvious than it might seem at first glance.</p><p>The Go compiler works at the package level: It compiles each required package into its own intermediate artifact that the linker later joins into a single binary, only keeping the symbols that are needed—or, in compiler terms, reachable. For a given package, the compiler includes its files that aren’t tests—files not ending in —and that match the build constraints. In our case, those constraints mostly depend on the operating system, target architecture, and the build tags passed to the  command. In less common cases, they can also depend on the compiler, the Go version, whether CGO is enabled, or even architecture-specific features. Refer to the <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-Build_constraints\">Go documentation on build constraints</a> for more detail.</p><p>To determine whether a package is needed to compile your binary, the compiler starts from the main package, transitively adding every import it encounters in files that aren’t excluded by build constraints. It also includes the standard library’s  package as well as its internal dependencies, which are needed to run any Go binary. For a deeper explanation of how the runtime works and why it’s unavoidable, watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arH3jp_x8yQ\">Understanding the Go runtime</a> by Jesús Espino (Mattermost).</p><div><div><figure><figcaption>How build tags and imports determine which files and dependencies are used when building a Go binary.</figcaption></figure></div></div><p>This means that there are two main ways to prevent an unwanted dependency from ending up in your binary:</p><ul><li>Add a build tag to the file that imports it, so that the import only happens if the build tag is used.</li><li>Move the symbols that use that dependency into a different package, which can then be imported only when needed.</li></ul><p>The following diagrams show these two strategies in action.</p><div><div><figure><figcaption>Using build tags to exclude files and their dependencies.</figcaption></figure></div></div><p>In the first case, we mark the file that imports a dependency with a build tag () we aren’t using. Because the compiler ignores that file, its imports and their transitive dependencies never make it into the final binary.</p><div><div><figure><figcaption>Moving code into a separate package to isolate dependencies.</figcaption></figure></div></div><p>In the second case, we move the function that relies on the dependency into a different package. That way, only binaries that explicitly import that package will pull in the dependency.</p><p>Binaries often use different packages depending on the platform and build tags, which can make it difficult to understand what gets included.</p><p>The  subcommand can be used to show all packages used when building a binary for a given OS, architecture, and a given set of build tags. So the command:</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"sh\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>would output something like:</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"plaintext\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>This is great, but it doesn’t explain how these dependencies were imported in the first place. To figure that out, we use <a href=\"https://github.com/loov/goda\">goda</a>, a convenient tool that can create a graph of package imports, showing all the imports done by a binary, including indirectly from dependencies.</p><p>Similar to ,  takes into account build tags, as well as the  and  environment variables. In the following command,  means starting from the current package, and  includes all direct and indirect dependencies:</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"sh\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>The  function can also be used to graph only the paths leading to a given target package:</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"sh\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>Here is the dependency graph of  itself:</p><div><div><figure><figcaption>Dependency graph generated by goda, showing how packages are imported and an estimation of their sizes.</figcaption></figure></div></div><p>Having a list of included packages in an artifact is convenient, but if you care about size, it doesn’t help much. The linker is able to determine which symbols of a package are actually used in a binary—and remove the others—so a package can have a different binary size depending on how it’s used. Furthermore, simply importing a package has side effects:  functions run and global variables are initialized, which can be enough to force the linker to keep many unnecessary symbols. So a package might have a size impact even though you’re not truly using it. Some uses of  can also impact linker optimizations here, but we’ll <a href=\"https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/engineering/agent-go-binaries/#unlocking-20-size-reductions-with-method-dead-code-elimination\">come back to that later</a>.</p><p>The tool <a href=\"https://github.com/Zxilly/go-size-analyzer\">go-size-analyzer</a> displays the size taken by each dependency in a Go binary, either as text or in an interactive web interface. This makes it easier to spot which dependencies are actually worth removing:</p><p>Here is the interactive web output of  when analyzing itself. You can then hover over each tile to see the size:</p><div><div><figure><figcaption>Visualizing dependency sizes in a Go binary with go-size-analyzer.</figcaption></figure></div></div><p>Let’s look at a concrete example from the Agent codebase.</p><p>We updated the tagging logic in our  binary so that it wouldn’t depend on Kubernetes dependencies anymore. But when we ran , it still showed  from <a href=\"http://k8s.io\"></a> included in the build, and  made it clear that those packages accounted for at least .</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"plaintext\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>Using , we traced the import path back to a single package in our codebase. That package was only included into the  binary for one function, and that function did not actually depend on any Kubernetes code.</p><div><div><figure><figcaption>Dependency graph from goda showing the single import path pulling in Kubernetes packages.</figcaption></figure></div></div><p>Simply <a href=\"https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/pull/32174/s\">moving this function into its own package</a> and updating the relevant imports was enough for the compiler to trim all the unused dependencies. The result:  from the Linux  binary and a size reduction of about <strong>36 MiB—more than half of the binary</strong>.</p><p>This reduction is an extreme example, but was not a unique one. We found many similar cases—although with smaller impacts—where dependencies were accidentally included. By systematically listing, auditing, and pruning these imports, we were able to significantly reduce binary size across the Agent.</p><p>While we were looking into removing unneeded dependencies, we found out about a linker optimization that could also cut binary size by around 20%.</p><p>When using the  package, you can call any exported method of a type by using <a href=\"https://go.dev/play/p/DAc3rQ81mkK\">MethodByName</a>. However, if you use a non-constant method name, the linker can no longer know at build time which methods will be used at runtime. So it needs to keep every exported method of every reachable type, and all the symbols they depend on, which can drastically increase the size of the final binary.</p><p>We referred to this optimization as <strong>method dead code elimination</strong>.</p><p>The most common uses of this feature of  are the  and  packages from the standard library, since they enable calling methods whose name is specified in a dynamic template on a dynamic object.</p><p>Our initial idea to enable this optimization was to instrument our binaries to emit a list of all methods used at runtime, then edit the compiler artifacts to force the linker to remove all other methods. Although this approach had the convenient benefit of requiring almost no code changes, it would have introduced runtime panics if we removed a method that ended up actually being called, so we looked for alternatives.</p><p>While we initially assumed patching every problematic use of —both in our own codebase and external dependencies—would be too difficult, we gave it a try anyway.</p><p>To understand why the optimization is disabled in the linker, we used its  flag, which makes it print why symbols are reachable in the binary.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/aarzilli/whydeadcode\">whydeadcode</a> tool can consume this output, determine whether the optimization is disabled, and if so it prints the culprit call chain, letting you fix the issue and re-run the tool until the optimization is enabled. One caveat: Only the first displayed call stack is guaranteed to be a true positive, so the safest way to use the tool is to run it repeatedly and fix the first identified call each time.</p><p>Consider the following example:</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"go\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>Using  shows that the optimization is disabled due to executing the template:</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"plaintext\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>It turned out we only needed to patch around a dozen dependencies to exclude those uses of , some of which already had open proposals for fixes. We opened change requests on dependencies we needed to patch (for example,  <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132177\">kubernetes/kubernetes</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/uber-go/dig/pull/425\">uber-go/dig</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/google/go-cmp/issues/373\">google/go-cmp</a>), pushed existing upstream PRs forward, and removed various dependencies from our binaries altogether.</p><p>As for  and , while there is an <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/go/issues/72895\">open issue</a> to allow statically disabling method calls, we couldn’t wait for a fix to be implemented and released. So we forked the two packages <a href=\"https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/tree/main/pkg/template\">into our codebase</a> and patched them to disable method calls in our own template usage.</p><p>Eventually, we enabled the optimization across all of our binaries, one by one, and saw an average <strong>20% binary size reduction</strong>, ranging from 16% to 25% depending on the binaries, compounding to a <strong>total reduction of around 100 MiB</strong>.</p><p>Our efforts also helped spread awareness of the optimization: Kubernetes project contributors began enabling it in their own binaries and reported , bringing similar improvements to the wider community.</p><p>During our initial investigation into enabling method dead code elimination, we hacked through our codebase and dependencies, commenting out every piece of code that disabled the optimization. Although this broke the binaries in many ways, we wanted to see which parts of the code needed updates and measure the potential size reduction impact.</p><p>Even in that broken state, we saw an immediate effect: Our Linux  Go binaries shrank by a combined , even though the optimization wasn’t yet enabled for every binary. On the other hand, it barely affected our  artifacts.</p><p>When we built the binaries on , we noticed something odd:  showed that simply using a type made one of its unexported methods—unused in practice—reachable, which indirectly disabled the optimization. Even stranger, that code wasn’t architecture-specific, so it should have behaved the same on .</p><p>We assumed this was due to differences in how the linker handled each architecture, but decided to investigate anyway, hoping to find something we could improve and upstream.</p><p>Go plugins allow for dynamically loading Go code at runtime from another Go program. The main binary and the plugin share the same state—global variables, values, and methods—so the linker must keep every symbol in case they are used by a plugin.</p><p>We had already noticed that the  package was imported in our  builds but not the  ones, so this was most likely the root cause of the difference.</p><p>Using  to inspect our dependency graph, we quickly traced the  import to the <a href=\"https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/v1.7.24/plugin/plugin_go18.go#L24\"> package</a>, which allows users to load custom plugins. That feature wasn’t something the Agent relied on, so we opened <a href=\"https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/11203/s\">a PR upstream</a> to add a build tag so that the import could be selectively excluded without breaking any existing users. Once  merged and released the change, we updated the Agent and applied the relevant build tags in <a href=\"https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/pull/32538\">PR #32538</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/pull/32885/s\">PR #32885</a>.</p><p>Overall, this specific change resulted in a  size reduction for our main Linux  artifacts—roughly a  in the total size at the time—benefiting about .</p><p>To see the full impact of these efforts, the following chart shows the size of our Linux  packages over time. You can see how the growth of the Agent artifacts peaked around v7.60.0, and how the changes we introduced between v7.60.0 (December 2024) and v7.68.0 (July 2025) brought those sizes sharply back down, nearly to where they were 5 years ago.</p><div><div><figure><figcaption>Evolution of Agent Linux deb amd64 package size, showing compressed and disk sizes from version 7.16.0 to 7.68.0.</figcaption></figure></div></div><p>Across all Linux  binaries—representing roughly 75% of our users—the reductions are striking:</p><ul><li>: 236 MiB → 103 MiB ()</li><li>: 128 MiB → 34 MiB ()</li><li>: 90 MiB → 23 MiB ()</li><li>: 152 MiB → 35 MiB ()</li><li>: 180 MiB → 54 MiB ()</li></ul><p>Overall, the compressed and uncompressed sizes of our  package have dropped by about , from 265 MiB to 149 MiB compressed, and from 1.22 GiB to 688 MiB uncompressed.</p><p>What makes this result even more satisfying is that we achieved it without removing any feature. Every capability added over the past 5 years is still there. And in that time, we have added dozens of new products and major capabilities to the Agent. The binaries are now just smaller, cleaner, faster to distribute, and they use less memory.</p><p>It was a long journey but the results were worth it. We also hope that this article can also help others in their optimization journey.</p><p>If you enjoy digging into compilers, optimizing build systems, or solving scale and performance challenges like this, </p>",

You have to manually compact, defragment, and clear the alarm before Kubernetes can accept writes again.</li><li>: too many watchers cause the leader to saturate its CPU and network bandwidth sending events, which slows down everything else including write acknowledgements.</li><li>: if the mutation rate is high enough, compaction runs can't keep up. The database grows faster than it shrinks, and you're on a slow path to a quota alarm.</li><li>: if the database is large and a follower falls behind, the leader has to send a multi-gigabyte snapshot. During that transfer, the leader has less capacity for normal operations.</li><li>: a controller that lists large amounts of data triggers memory amplification, even when etcd itself is fine.</li></ul><p><strong>For most Kubernetes clusters, none of this is a problem: etcd and the API server can handle the load just fine.</strong></p><p><em>But you don't need 10,000 nodes before problems can appear.</em></p><p>A cluster with just a hundred nodes and a controller that watches everything, or an operator that stores 500 MB of custom resources and lists them every few seconds, can run into the same issues.</p><p><strong>What really matters is how much data moves between the API server and etcd, not just how many nodes you have.</strong></p><p>In a default Kubernetes setup, <strong>every resource type shares a single etcd cluster.</strong></p><p>Pods, deployments, configmaps, secrets, events, leases, and custom resources all write to the same Raft log, the same bbolt file, the same leader.</p><p>Not all resources behave the same way:</p><ul><li> you create a secret once and rarely touch it.</li><li> pods report status updates constantly, and the kubelet generates events for every lifecycle change.</li></ul><p>Let's take Events as an example.</p><p>In a busy cluster, the event stream can generate hundreds of writes per second, and those writes compete with deployment rollouts and config map updates for the same Raft leader.</p><p>The API server has a flag for this:  lets you point specific resource types at separate etcd clusters.</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The format is <code>group/resource#server1;server2</code>.</p><p>For core resources like events, pods, and services, the API group is empty, so you write , , or .</p><p>For resources in other API groups, you include the group:  or <code>coordination.k8s.io/leases</code>.</p><p><strong>Now, events are written to a separate Raft log, a separate bbolt file, and a separate leader and Event churn no longer competes with deployment rollouts for resources.</strong></p><p>You can shard any built-in resource this way.</p><p>Placing events on a separate cluster is the most common approach.</p><ul><li><strong>Backup complexity increases.</strong> You now have multiple etcd clusters to snapshot and restore. A consistent restore means all shards need to be at the same point in time.</li><li><strong>Resource versions are not comparable across shards.</strong> Each etcd cluster has its own revision counter. A  from the events shard means nothing in the context of the main shard. (Kubernetes 1.35 addresses this with <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/5504\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Comparable Resource Version</a>, now GA.)</li><li> The flag only works for resources compiled into the API server binary, not CRDs or resources served by aggregated API servers.</li></ul><h3>Going the other direction: sharing one etcd</h3><p>For very small clusters, the opposite problem applies.</p><p><strong>Running a dedicated 3-node etcd cluster per API server is expensive when you only have a handful of nodes.</strong></p><p>Multiple API servers can share one etcd cluster by using different key prefixes:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The default prefix is .</p><p>All Kubernetes keys are stored under it: <code>/registry/pods/default/my-pod</code>, <code>/registry/services/specs/default/my-service</code>, and so on.</p><p>With different prefixes, each cluster's data lives in its own keyspace.</p><p><code>/cluster-a/registry/pods/...</code> and <code>/cluster-b/registry/pods/...</code> don't collide.</p><p><strong>This reduces operational overhead at the cost of shared resources: both clusters' writes go through the same Raft leader, and the bbolt file holds both clusters' data.</strong></p><p>For edge deployments and dev environments, this trade-off is often worthwhile.</p><h2>Replacing etcd: Kine and k3s</h2><p>The first project to seriously question the etcd dependency was <a href=\"https://k3s.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">k3s</a>, Rancher's lightweight Kubernetes distribution.</p><p>K3s needed to run on edge hardware, IoT devices, and single-node setups where operating a three-node etcd cluster was impractical.</p><p><em>But how can you remove etcd from Kubernetes when the API server is built to communicate with it?</em></p><p>The answer was <a href=\"https://github.com/k3s-io/kine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Kine</a> (\"Kine is not etcd\").</p><p>Kine is a shim that implements a  of the etcd API and translates requests to a relational database: SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL/MariaDB, or NATS.</p><img src=\"https://static.learnkube.com/7704483d31871c1a6733d2689641a831.svg\" alt=\"Kine sits between the Kubernetes API server and SQL backends such as SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MySQL.\" loading=\"lazy\"><p>The key insight: <strong>the Kubernetes API server doesn't talk to etcd's internals, it talks to the etcd gRPC API.</strong></p><p>If you implement that API in front of a different database, the API server doesn't know the difference.</p><p>Kine only implements a subset of the etcd API, though.</p><p>It covers the access patterns Kubernetes actually uses, but it's not a general-purpose etcd replacement.</p><p>And you lose some of etcd's properties:</p><ul><li>Watch efficiency depends on how the backend implements polling.</li><li>Revision semantics are approximated, not native.</li></ul><p>For edge deployments and small clusters, this is a perfectly reasonable trade-off.</p><p><strong>But the bigger insight is the pattern: you can decouple Kubernetes from etcd by reimplementing the etcd API, without touching Kubernetes itself.</strong></p><p>That's exactly what the hyperscale cloud providers did, but at a very different scale.</p><h2>What the hyperscalers built</h2><p>At that scale, even with sharding, you run into etcd's architectural limits: the 8 GiB database cap, the single-leader write path, and the snapshot pressure during recovery.</p><ul><li>They replaced Raft consensus with an internal journal service (eliminating the single-leader write bottleneck).</li><li>They replaced the bbolt backend with an in-memory design (eliminating the single-file size limit).</li><li>They partitioned the keyspace (so different key ranges can be handled by different nodes).</li></ul><p><strong>But they kept the etcd API.</strong></p><p>Because the alternative is worse.</p><p>The Kubernetes API server's storage layer is defined in <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/staging/src/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/storage/interfaces.go\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/storage/interfaces.go</code></a>, and that interface is built on top of etcd's model: revision-based operations, watch semantics, and prefix queries.</p><p>Changing that interface means forking the API server, and maintaining a fork of Kubernetes is an enormous ongoing cost.</p><p><strong>It's cheaper to rewrite etcd than to rewrite Kubernetes.</strong></p><p>So AWS did what Kine did, but at a different scale: they built a new storage engine that speaks the etcd API, and plugged it in where etcd used to be.</p><p><strong>Google took a different approach to the same problem.</strong></p><p>Spanner is Google's globally distributed database.</p><p>It does not have bbolt's single-file size limit or a single-leader write bottleneck.</p><p>It's designed for exactly the kind of throughput and durability that etcd caps out on.</p><p>But even with Spanner as the backend, Google still <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/planning-large-clusters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">lists strict constraints</a> for clusters of this size: no cluster autoscaler, headless services limited to 100 pods, and one pod per node.</p><p><strong>Because the storage layer is only one bottleneck.</strong></p><p>Replacing etcd with Spanner fixes the database ceiling, but the API server still has to serialize every object, evaluate admission controllers, and distribute watch events.</p><p>The scheduler processes pods one at a time, the kubelet reports status updates, and the network has bandwidth limits.</p><p>An infinitely scalable database doesn't make the rest of the system infinitely scalable.</p><p>That's why 130,000-node clusters come with restrictions that smaller clusters don't.</p><h2>Why upstream Kubernetes is still coupled to etcd</h2><p><strong>If Kine, EKS, and GKE all managed to swap the backend, why can't upstream Kubernetes just make storage pluggable?</strong></p><p>Here's what the API server's <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/staging/src/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/storage/interfaces.go\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">storage interface</a> actually looks like (trimmed for readability):</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Every operation is revision-aware:</p><ul><li> takes a  to resume from.</li><li> returns objects with their revision.</li><li> uses a compare-and-swap based on the current revision.</li><li> exposes etcd's compaction state directly.</li></ul><p><strong>The interface was designed for etcd. It works as an abstraction, but it's an etcd-shaped one.</strong></p><p>But it's not just about code:</p><ul><li>Backup tools target etcd snapshots.</li><li>Monitoring dashboards track etcd metrics.</li><li>Runbooks describe etcd recovery procedures.</li></ul><p>Changing the storage backend isn't just a code change.</p><p>The entire ecosystem needs to support the change.</p><p><em>So how did the cloud providers work around this?</em></p><p>They own the full stack, and they compile their own API server binaries, wire in their own storage implementations, and run their own conformance suites.</p><p><strong>For everyone running upstream Kubernetes, etcd is the only supported backend.</strong></p><h2>How Kubernetes is reducing the load on etcd</h2><p><strong>Every read through the pipeline described above costs both sides: etcd reads from disk and serializes, the API server decodes and re-encodes.</strong></p><p>The API server has been taking over most of that work.</p><p>Instead of forwarding every read to etcd, it maintains its own copy of cluster state and serves from memory: the .</p><p>The API server populates this cache by watching etcd for changes: every create, update, and delete stream is a watch event, and the cache applies it.</p><p>The data sits in memory as already-decoded Go objects.</p><p><strong>When the cache serves a read, the entire etcd side of the pipeline disappears: etcd doesn't touch disk, doesn't serialize anything, doesn't send data over gRPC.</strong></p><p>The API server already has decoded objects in memory and only needs to encode the response for the client.</p><p>The challenge is proving freshness.</p><p>A default list request () means <em>\"give me the most recent data\"</em>, and the API server can't risk serving stale results.</p><p><em>How does it know its cache is current?</em></p><p>Once the API server knows the latest revision, it waits for the watch cache to catch up to that number, then serves from memory.</p><p>The consistency guarantees are the same as for a direct etcd read, but only a revision number is sent across the wire rather than megabytes of serialized data.</p><p>But some requests don't ask for the latest state; instead, they ask for data at a specific , for example, when a controller resumes a watch or retries a paginated list.</p><p>The API server needs to answer: <em>\"What did the world look like at revision 42?\"</em></p><p><strong>etcd can answer this natively: its MVCC history stores old revisions.</strong></p><p>But serving them still requires the full round-trip through disk, serialization, gRPC, and decoding.</p><p><strong>The watch cache avoids that round-trip by keeping its own history.</strong></p><p>On each incoming watch event, it saves a point-in-time copy of its state before applying the change.</p><p><strong>This gives it a sliding window of historical states, retained for about 75 seconds.</strong></p><p>When a client requests a specific , the API server looks up the matching snapshot and serves it directly from cache, as if it were a fresh read.</p><p>If the snapshot has been cleaned up (the requested revision is older than 75 seconds), the request falls back to etcd.</p><p><strong>But even when serving from cache, the API server still has one remaining cost: encoding the response.</strong></p><p>The in-memory Go objects need to be serialized into JSON or Protobuf before they are sent to the client.</p><p>The standard approach is to encode the entire list into a single memory buffer and write it to the network.</p><p>For a cluster with 50,000 pods, this encoding step alone allocates hundreds of megabytes on top of the data already in cache.</p><p>The API server <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/05/09/kubernetes-v1-33-streaming-list-responses/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">encodes list responses as a stream</a> instead: it serializes and flushes objects one at a time rather than buffering the full response. The memory footprint drops from the size of the entire list to the size of a single object.</p><h2>So, does Kubernetes still need etcd?</h2><p><em>After all this, what is the practical answer?</em></p><p><strong>If you're running upstream Kubernetes, yes.</strong> etcd is the only supported storage backend, and the API server is deeply coupled to its semantics. That won't change anytime soon.</p><p><strong>If you're running a managed service like GKE or EKS,</strong> the provider may have already replaced etcd's internals with something that scales further. You're using Kubernetes without being limited by etcd's ceilings.</p><p><strong>If you're running k3s or similar distributions,</strong> Kine gives you the option to swap etcd for a relational database, with the understanding that it's a subset implementation.</p><p>For most clusters, none of this matters.</p><p>When it does, the options are: shard etcd for the quick win, swap the backend for Kine, or wait for the API server to get smarter about caching with each release.</p>",

This capability allows engineering teams to ship more features faster than ever before. However, the downstream effect is that we are also generating more code, requiring more reviews, and inevitably introducing more bugs into our systems.</p><p>While we have learned to successfully guide AI to produce solutions that are functionally correct, resilient, and robust in production, there is one critical aspect of software engineering that is frequently overlooked in this new paradigm: maintainable, readable, and extendable code.</p></section><section><h2>The Code Review Bottleneck</h2><p>With the sheer volume of code being produced, there is tremendous pressure on developers to review pull requests rapidly. Even with the advent of AI-assisted code review tools, we are not at a stage where we can blindly trust what an LLM outputs. AI reviewers might catch syntax issues or basic security flaws, but they lack the deep architectural context required to evaluate the long-term viability of a design.</p><p>Human engineers still need to carefully read and understand the generated code. When code lacks clarity, the review process slows down significantly or, worse, reviewers mentally fatigue and approve substandard structural code just to unblock the pipeline.</p></section><section><h2>Functional, But Structurally Flawed</h2><p>When our codebases grow at such an accelerated rate, we often end up with features that work perfectly but lack modularity and readability. AI tends to favor immediate solutions over principled software design. It frequently generates code that does not adhere to established best practices, such as SOLID principles or functional programming paradigms.</p><p>You might find sprawling files with multiple responsibilities, heavily coupled components, and duplicated logic scattered across the application. The code \"functions\", but it becomes a fragile monolith that is incredibly difficult to untangle later.</p></section><section><p>This lack of structural integrity makes it extremely challenging for anyone—especially new team members—to onboard effectively. When the code is not self-documenting and logically organized, developers struggle to understand the core flow, debug issues, or confidently add new, high-quality code.</p><p>The ultimate result is an environment where the complexity continuously piles up. If left unchecked, the project reaches a point of no return: a state where developers must spend the majority of their time fighting technical debt rather than building new value.</p></section><section><h2>Building Towards the Future</h2><p>To mitigate this hidden cost, we must shift our focus from sheer output speed to sustainable engineering practices in an AI-assisted world.</p><ul><li><strong>Emphasize Architecture in Prompts:</strong> Do not just ask AI for a feature. Instruct it explicitly to use specific design patterns, separate concerns, and follow SOLID principles.</li><li><strong>Prioritize Human-Centric Code Reviews:</strong> Focus reviews on readability and architectural boundaries rather than just functional correctness. Does this code make sense to a teammate who didn't write it?</li><li> Use AI to help you refactor immediately after generation. Ask it to extract functions, simplify logic, and modularize the components before opening a pull request.</li></ul><p>AI is an incredible tool that amplifies our capabilities, but it does not replace the need for disciplined software engineering. By ensuring that we optimize for readability and maintainability, we can build scalable systems that our teams can comfortably work in for years to come.</p></section>",

      "content": "<p>This article explains how to run AI models locally in containers with RamaLama and integrate the sample Java application with them. RamaLama brings AI inferencing to the container world of Podman, Docker, and Kubernetes. It automatically finds and pulls a container image optimized for your system’s GPUs, handling all dependencies and performance tweaks for you. It then uses a container engine, such as Podman or Docker, to pull the required image and prepare everything for running. If you want a hassle-free way to run AI models from multiple sources, using the runtime that fits your hardware, all within containers for simplicity, and with seamless integration with your existing workflows, RamaLama is a good choice. Let’s see how it works in practice!</p><p>You can find other articles about AI and Java on my blog. For example, if you are interested in how to use Ollama to serve models for Spring AI applications, you can read the following&nbsp;<a href=\"https://piotrminkowski.com/2025/03/10/using-ollama-with-spring-ai/\">article</a>.</p><p>Source code will not play a key role in this article. Nevertheless, feel free to use my source code if you’d like to try it out yourself. To do that, you must clone my sample GitHub&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/piomin/spring-ai-apps.git\">repository</a>. It contains the sample Spring Boot application we will use to interact with AI models run on RamaLama in containers. You can find that application in the <code>spring-ai-openai-compatibility</code> directory. Then you should only follow my instructions.</p><p>You can install RamaLama on Linux or macOS with the following command:</p><div data-code-block-pro-font-family=\"Code-Pro-JetBrains-Mono\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code></code></pre></div><p>The script above uses Homebrew to install RamaLama on macOS. But alternatively, you can download the self-contained macOS installer that includes Python and all dependencies. You can find the latest&nbsp;&nbsp;installer in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/containers/ramalama/releases\">releases</a> page.</p><p>Finally, you can verify the version of the previously installed tool.</p><div data-code-block-pro-font-family=\"Code-Pro-JetBrains-Mono\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code></code></pre></div><h2>Install and Configure Podman</h2><p>Alternatively, you can use Docker, which I also use frequently. When it comes to Podman, I suggest installing Podman Desktop first. You can download it <a href=\"https://podman-desktop.io/downloads\">here</a>. After installation, launch the Podman Desktop GUI and go to the  section to create a new Podman machine. Then, choose  as a default provider. This enabled GPU acceleration for containers running in macOS. This virtual machine is managed by krunkit and libkrun, a lightweight virtual machine manager (VMM) based on Apple’s low-level Hypervisor Framework. You can find a detailed explanation and performance analysis in the following <a href=\"https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2025/06/05/how-we-improved-ai-inference-macos-podman-containers\">article</a>.</p><p>After creation, the virtual machine should start up. You can check its status in Podman Desktop as shown below.</p><p>Then run the following command to verify that Podman works.</p><div data-code-block-pro-font-family=\"Code-Pro-JetBrains-Mono\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code></code></pre></div><p>RamaLama supports multiple AI model registries, including OCI Container Registries, Ollama, and HuggingFace. RamaLama defaults to the Ollama registry transport. Let’s assume we want to run the following model from the Ollama registry:</p><p>To run that tinyllama model with ramalama, you must execute the following command:</p><p>By default, RamaLama tries to run the model inside the <code>quay.io/ramalama/ramalama:latest</code> container. The container exposes an OpenAI-compatible API on port .</p><div data-code-block-pro-font-family=\"Code-Pro-JetBrains-Mono\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code></code></pre></div><p>You can interact with the model using the  command as shown below:</p><div data-code-block-pro-font-family=\"Code-Pro-JetBrains-Mono\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code></code></pre></div><p>If you want to change a default model registry, for example, to HuggingFace, use the  environment variable.</p><div data-code-block-pro-font-family=\"Code-Pro-JetBrains-Mono\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code></code></pre></div><p>Then you can run any GGUF model from HuggingFace.</p><div data-code-block-pro-font-family=\"Code-Pro-JetBrains-Mono\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code></code></pre></div><p>Instead of the  command to list running models, you can use the  command. Of course, you can run several models at once. In this case, RamaLama will make them available externally using different ports.</p><div data-code-block-pro-font-family=\"Code-Pro-JetBrains-Mono\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code></code></pre></div><h2>Integrate Spring AI with Models on RamaLama</h2><p>To test various models with RamaLama, I created a very simple Spring Boot application. It uses Spring AI together with the OpenAI module for integration with models running in RamaLama containers. Below is a list of dependencies for this application.</p><div data-code-block-pro-font-family=\"Code-Pro-JetBrains-Mono\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code></code></pre></div><p>The application exposes a single REST endpoint . Depending on the parameter, it asks about the capital city of a given country and requests a brief history of that city.</p><div data-code-block-pro-font-family=\"Code-Pro-JetBrains-Mono\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code></code></pre></div><p>Some of the parameters below are optional, such as the model name or increasing the Spring AI logging level. The app communicates with the LLM model provided by RamaLama at . Due to a possible conflict between the ports used, it is best to change the default port used by Spring Boot Web to . The value of the API key, on the other hand, is irrelevant. You just need to set it to something other than null so that Spring AI will accept it…</p><div data-code-block-pro-font-family=\"Code-Pro-JetBrains-Mono\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code></code></pre></div><p>Then, run the app with the following command:</p><p>Finally, you can call our test REST endpoint for different values of the  parameter. </p><div data-code-block-pro-font-family=\"Code-Pro-JetBrains-Mono\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code></code></pre></div><p>The following diagram illustrates GPU usage during our test calls.</p><p>The last registry supported by Ramalama that I would like to discuss in this article is the registry of ready-made images containing selected AI models. At the moment, there are slightly more than 20 images with popular models such as , , , and . You can view the full list of available images with models on this <a href=\"https://app.ramalama.com/explore/registry/models\">webpage</a>.</p><p>To run the container with a specific image, you must add the  prefix to the model name. For example, you pull and run the  model as shown below.</p><p>Then, you don’t even have to restart our sample application if you have already stopped the previously tested models. Here’s a fragment of Gemma’s answer about the Spanish capital.</p><h2>Use RamaLama to Run Containers with AI Models in Kubernetes</h2><p>We can use RamaLama to run AI models inside containers on Kubernetes, either on CPU or GPU nodes. However, in this section, I would like to use GPU acceleration on macOS, as I did earlier when running models in Podman. We will try this solution on Minikube. <a href=\"https://github.com/containers/krunkit\">Krunkit</a> is a macOS virtualization tool optimized for GPU-accelerated virtual machines and AI workloads. In the first step, we must install it on macOS using Homebrew:</p><div data-code-block-pro-font-family=\"Code-Pro-JetBrains-Mono\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code></code></pre></div><p>To use the  driver we must install&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/nirs/vmnet-helper\">vmnet-helper</a>. Here’s the command that downloads the latest release from GitHub and installs it to . After installing both tools, we can create a Minikube cluster. It is best to use the following command to increase the default resources allocated to the Minikube machine.</p><div data-code-block-pro-font-family=\"Code-Pro-JetBrains-Mono\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code></code></pre></div><p>Then, we must install the <a href=\"https://github.com/squat/generic-device-plugin\">Kubernetes Generic Device</a> plugin. It enables allocating generic Linux devices, such as serial devices or video cameras, to Kubernetes Pods. In our case, it will allow us to assign GPUs to Pods running AI models. The plugin is installed as a . The following configuration allows us to use up to 4 GPUs in Kubernetes.</p><div data-code-block-pro-font-family=\"Code-Pro-JetBrains-Mono\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code></code></pre></div><p>As before, we could use a ready-made image from the RamaLama registry. However, if we want to use the GPU support provided by the , we should mount the model as a volume to the  container. First, let’s download the  model from HuggingFace.</p><div data-code-block-pro-font-family=\"Code-Pro-JetBrains-Mono\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code></code></pre></div><p>Then, we can mount the model from the  directory to Minikube with the following command:</p><div data-code-block-pro-font-family=\"Code-Pro-JetBrains-Mono\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code></code></pre></div><p>The following  uses the <code>quay.io/ramalama/ramalama:latest</code> image and mounts the  model from  directory to that container. The model is launched internally using . The container with the model can use up to 1 GPU out of the 4 allowed across the entire cluster ().</p><div data-code-block-pro-font-family=\"Code-Pro-JetBrains-Mono\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code></code></pre></div><p>Let’s verify if the pod is running after it was deployed:</p><div data-code-block-pro-font-family=\"Code-Pro-JetBrains-Mono\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code></code></pre></div><p>Then, you can expose the  outside Minikube using port-forward on port . Your application can remain enabled as before. Try repeating the exercise we did earlier and send a few test requests to it. Verify whether the GPU is being used in the graph or during requests.</p><div data-code-block-pro-font-family=\"Code-Pro-JetBrains-Mono\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code></code></pre></div><p>RamaLama makes AI models execution simple, reproducible, and container-native. It allows us to use various model registries, such as Ollama and HuggingFace, as well as ready-made images from various OCI registries. It also provides an easy path to run AI models on Podman, Docker, and even Kubernetes. Thanks to RamaLama, I was able to leverage Apple Silicon GPUs when running AI models in containers.</p>",

It is one of the most basic thing in Distributed Systems.<strong>What is Consistent Hashing?</strong><p>Consistent hashing is a key distribution technique that ensures easy and smooth mapping of keys to servers to minimize data movement when nodes are added or removed. Unlike traditional hashing methods, where adding or removing a server changes the hash distribution significantly, consistent hashing reduces this impact.</p><p>It goes with mapping both servers (nodes) and keys to a circular hash space. When a request comes in, the system moves clockwise along the ring to find the closest node, which will be responsible for that key. It will store key and value data and can also be used while retrieving the same.</p></p><ul><li>Consistent hashing is widely used in distributed systems. </li><li>Load Balancing: Make sure that incoming requests are uniformly distributed among available servers so no server gets overwhelming resquests. </li><li>Distributed Caching (e.g., Memcached, Redis Cluster): Helps in mapping cache keys to specific nodes. </li><li>Database Sharding: Efficiently distributes and save database records across multiple database servers.</li></ul><p><strong>Why is Consistent Hashing Important?</strong><p>Imagine you have a set of servers handling API requests. A traditional hash function could distribute these requests among servers, but as soon as a server is added or removed, the entire mapping breaks, and most of the data needs to be rebalanced. This causes cache misses that increases latency and unnecessary load on the system.</p><p>Consistent hashing solves this by ensuring that only a small fraction of keys need to be remapped when a server is added or removed. This makes the system highly scalable and resilient.</p><p>Now, let’s talk about the implementation of consistent hashing in Golang. My implementation involves a ConsistentHashRing that maintains a sorted list of node hashes and efficiently assigns keys to nodes. Here’s how it works:</p></p><pre><code>type Node struct {\n\tID   string\n\tKeys map[string]string\n}\n\ntype ConsistentHashRing struct {\n\tmu     sync.RWMutex\n\tnodes  map[uint32]*Node\n\thashes []uint32\n}\n\nfunc NewConsistentHashRing() *ConsistentHashRing {\n\treturn &amp;ConsistentHashRing{\n\t\tnodes:  make(map[uint32]*Node),\n\t\thashes: []uint32{},\n\t}\n}</code></pre><div data-layout=\"minimal\"><div><div><a href=\"https://sushantdhiman.substack.com\">\n                            Subscribe\n                        </a></div></div></div><p><p>I used Murmur3 as my hashing function because it provides better distribution and performance than FNV or MD5.</p></p><pre><code>func hashFunction(key string) uint32 {\n  return murmur3.Sum32([]byte(key))\n}</code></pre><p><strong>2. Adding Nodes to the Ring</strong><p>When a new server is added, it is assigned a hash value and placed on the ring.</p></p><pre><code>func (chr *ConsistentHashRing) AddNode(id string) {\n  chr.mu.Lock()\n  defer chr.mu.Unlock()\n  hash := hashFunction(id)\n  chr.nodes[hash] = &amp;Node{\n    ID:   id,\n    Keys: make(map[string]string),\n  }\n  chr.hashes = append(chr.hashes, hash)\n  slices.Sort(chr.hashes)\n}</code></pre><p><strong>3. Finding the Nearest Node</strong><p>To locate the closest node for a given key, I move clockwise along the sorted list of hashes.</p></p><pre><code>func (chr *ConsistentHashRing) GetNextNodeIndex(hash uint32) int {\n  for i, h := range chr.hashes {\n    if h &gt; hash {\n      return i\n    }\n  }\n  return 0 // Wrap around to the first node\n}</code></pre><p><strong>4. Storing and Retrieving Data</strong><p>Each node holds a set of keys. When a key-value pair is stored, it is mapped to the correct node.</p></p><pre><code>func (chr *ConsistentHashRing) StoreKey(key, val string) {\n  node := chr.GetNode(key)\n  if node != nil {\n    node.Keys[key] = val\n  }\n}</code></pre><pre><code>func (chr *ConsistentHashRing) RetrieveKey(key string) (string, error) {\n  node := chr.GetNode(key)\n  if node == nil {\n    return \"\", errors.New(\"no node found\")\n  }\n  val, ok := node.Keys[key]\n  if !ok {\n    return \"\", errors.New(\"key not found\")\n  }\n  return val, nil\n}</code></pre><p><p>When a server is removed, its keys must be transferred to the next available node.</p></p><pre><code>func (chr *ConsistentHashRing) RemoveNode(id string) {\n  chr.mu.Lock()\n  defer chr.mu.Unlock()\n\n  hash := hashFunction(id)\n  node, exists := chr.nodes[hash]\n  if !exists {\n    return\n  }\n\n  nextNodeIndex := chr.GetNextNodeIndex(hash)\n  nextNode := chr.nodes[chr.hashes[nextNodeIndex]]\n  maps.Copy(nextNode.Keys, node.Keys)\n\n  delete(chr.nodes, hash)\n\n  for i, h := range chr.hashes {\n    if h == hash {\n      chr.hashes = slices.Delete(chr.hashes, i, i+1)\n      break\n    }\n  }\n}</code></pre><pre><code>func (chr *ConsistentHashRing) PrintRing() {\n\tfor _, h := range chr.hashes {\n\t\tfmt.Printf(\"Node: %s \\t\\t Hash: %d \\t\\t Total Keys: %v\\n\", chr.nodes[h].ID, h, len(chr.nodes[h].Keys))\n\t}\n}</code></pre><div data-layout=\"minimal\"><div><div><a href=\"https://sushantdhiman.substack.com\">\n                            Subscribe\n                        </a></div></div></div><p><p>Consistent hashing is a powerful technique that improves load distribution in distributed systems.

      "content": "<p>AI agents didn’t make the SDLC faster. They killed it.</p><p>I keep hearing people talk about AI as a “10x developer tool.” That framing is wrong. It assumes the workflow stays the same and the speed goes up. That’s not what’s happening. The entire lifecycle, the one we’ve built careers around, the one that spawned a multi-billion dollar tooling industry, is collapsing in on itself.</p><p>And most people haven’t noticed yet.</p><h2>The SDLC you learned is a relic</h2><p>Here’s the classic software development lifecycle most of us were taught:</p><pre>graph TD\n    A[Requirements] --&gt; B[System Design]\n    B --&gt; C[Implementation]\n    C --&gt; D[Testing]\n    D --&gt; E[Code Review]\n    E --&gt; F[Deployment]\n    F --&gt; G[Monitoring]\n    G --&gt; A</pre><p>Every stage has its own tools, its own rituals, its own cottage industry. Jira for requirements. Figma for design. VS Code for implementation. Jest for testing. GitHub for code review. AWS for deployment. Datadog for monitoring.</p><p>Each step is discrete. Sequential. Handoffs everywhere.</p><p>Now here’s what actually happens when an engineer works with a coding agent:</p><pre>graph TD\n    A[Intent] --&gt; B[Agent]\n    B --&gt; C[Code + Tests + Deployment]\n    C --&gt; D{Does it work?}\n    D --&gt;|No| B\n    D --&gt;|Yes| E[Ship]\n    style E fill:#d1fae5,stroke:#6ee7b7,color:#065f46</pre><p>The stages collapsed. They didn’t get faster. They merged. The agent doesn’t know what step it’s on because there are no steps. There’s just intent, context, and iteration.</p><h2>AI-native engineers don’t know what the SDLC is</h2><p>I spent a lot of time speaking with engineers who started their career after Cursor launched. They don’t know what the software development lifecycle is. They don’t know what’s DevOps or what’s an SRE. Not because they’re bad engineers. Because they never needed it. They’ve never sat through sprint planning. They’ve never estimated story points. They’ve never waited three days for a PR review.</p><p>You describe what you want. The agent writes the code. You look at it. You iterate. You ship. Everything simultaneously.</p><p>These engineers aren’t worse for skipping the ceremony. They’re unencumbered by it. Sprint planning, code review workflows, release trains, estimation rituals. None of it. They skipped the entire orthodoxy and went straight to building.</p><p>And honestly? I’m jealous.</p><h2>Every stage is collapsing</h2><p>Let me walk through the SDLC and show you what’s left of it.</p><h3>Requirements gathering: fluid, not dictated</h3><p>Requirements used to be handed down. A PM writes a PRD, engineers estimate it, and the spec gets frozen before a line of code is written. That made sense when building was expensive. When every feature took weeks, you had to decide upfront what to build.</p><p>That constraint is gone. When an agent can generate a complete version of a feature in minutes, you don’t need to specify every detail in advance. You provide the direction, the agent builds a version, you look at it, you adjust, you try a different approach. You can generate ten versions and pick the best one. Requirements aren’t a phase anymore. They’re a byproduct of iteration.</p><p>Now, what is Jira when the audience isn’t humans coordinating across a pipeline? What is Jira when it’s agents consuming context? Jira was built to track work through stages that no longer exist. If your “requirements” are just context for an agent, then the ticketing system isn’t a project management tool anymore. It’s a context store. And it’s a terrible one.</p><h3>System Design: discovered, not dictated</h3><p>System design still matters. But the way it happens is fundamentally shifting.</p><p>Design used to be something you did before writing code. You’d whiteboard the architecture, debate trade-offs, draw boxes and arrows, then go implement it. The gap between the design and the code was days or weeks.</p><p>That gap is closing. Design is becoming something you discover by giving the agent the right context, not something you dictate ahead of time. The model has seen more systems, more architectures, more patterns than any individual engineer. When you describe a problem, the agent doesn’t just implement your design, it suggests architectures that are often superior to what you’d have come up with on your own. You’re having a design conversation in real-time, and the output is working code.</p><p>You still need to know when an agent is over-engineering or missing a constraint. But you’re collaborating on design, not prescribing it.</p><h3>Implementation: this is the agent’s job now</h3><p>This one is obvious. The agent writes the code. Whole features. Complete solutions with error handling, types, edge cases.</p><p>I don’t personally know anyone who still types lines of code. We review what agents write, feed them context, steer direction, and focus on the problems that actually require human judgment.</p><h3>Testing: simultaneous, not sequential</h3><p>Agents write tests alongside the code. Not as an afterthought. Not in a separate “testing phase.” The test is part of the generation. TDD isn’t a methodology anymore, it’s just how agents work by default.</p><p>The entire QA function as a separate stage is gone. When code and tests are generated together, verified together, and iterated together, there’s no handoff. No “throw it over the wall to QA.”. The agent can do the QA itself.</p><p>The pull request flow needs to go. I was never a fan, but now it’s just a relic of the past.</p><p>I know that’s uncomfortable. Code review is sacred. It’s how you catch bugs, share knowledge, maintain standards. It’s also an identity thing. We’re , and reviewing code is what engineers do. But clinging to the PR workflow in an agent-driven world isn’t rigor. It’s an identity crisis.</p><p>Think about it. An agent generates 500 PRs a day. Your team can review maybe 10. The review queue backs up. This isn’t a bottleneck worth optimising. It’s a fake bottleneck, one that only exists because we’re forcing a human ritual onto a machine workflow.</p><pre>graph TD\n    A[Agent generates PR] --&gt; B[Waits for human review]\n    B --&gt; C{Reviewer available?}\n    C --&gt;|No| D[Sits in queue for hours/days]\n    C --&gt;|Yes| E[Review + Comments]\n    E --&gt; F[Agent addresses feedback]\n    F --&gt; B\n    D --&gt; B\n    style B fill:#fee2e2,stroke:#fca5a5,color:#991b1b\n    style D fill:#fee2e2,stroke:#fca5a5,color:#991b1b</pre><p>This diagram shouldn’t exist. The entire flow is wrong.</p><p>The review has to be rethought from scratch. Either it becomes part of the code generation itself, the agent verifies its own work against the plan document, runs the tests, checks for regressions, validates against architectural constraints, or a second agent reviews the first agent’s output. Adversarial agents plough through the proposed changes, try to break it in every dimension. We already have the tools for this. Human-in-the-loop review becomes exception-based, triggered only when automated verification can’t resolve a conflict or when the change touches something genuinely novel.</p><p>What does a world without pull requests look like? Agents commit to main. Automated checks, tests, type checks, security scans, behavioral diffs, validate the change. If everything passes, it ships, automatically. If something fails, the agent fixes it. A human only gets involved when the system genuinely doesn’t know what to do.</p><pre>graph TD\n    A[Agent generates code] --&gt; B[Agent self-verifies]\n    B --&gt; C[Second agent reviews]\n    C --&gt; D[Automated checks]\n    D --&gt; E{All clear?}\n    E --&gt;|Yes| F[Ship]\n    E --&gt;|No - resolvable| A\n    E --&gt;|No - novel issue| G[Human review]\n    G --&gt; A\n    style F fill:#d1fae5,stroke:#6ee7b7,color:#065f46</pre><p>We’re spending our review cycles reading diffs that an agent could verify in seconds. That’s not quality assurance. That’s luddism.</p><h3>Deployment: decoupled and continuous</h3><p>Agents are already writing deployment pipelines that are more intricate and more specialised than what most teams would ever bother building by hand. Feature flags, canary releases, progressive rollouts, automatic rollback triggers, the kind of release engineering that used to require a dedicated platform team.</p><p>The key shift is that agents naturally decouple deployment from release. Code gets deployed continuously, every change, as soon as it’s generated and verified, produces an artifact that lands in production behind a gate. Release is a separate decision, driven by feature flags or traffic rules.</p><p>Some teams are already approaching true continuous deployment and release. Code is generated, tests pass, artifacts are built, and the change is live, all in a single automated flow with no human in the loop between intent and production.</p><p>Where this goes next is even more interesting. Imagine agents that don’t just deploy code but manage the entire release lifecycle, monitoring the rollout, adjusting traffic percentages based on error rates, automatically rolling back if latency spikes, and only notifying a human when something genuinely novel goes wrong. The deployment “stage” doesn’t just get automated. It becomes an ongoing, self-adjusting process that never really ends.</p><pre>graph TD\n    A[Agent generates code] --&gt; B[Automated verification]\n    B --&gt; C[Artifact produced]\n    C --&gt; D[Deploy behind feature flag]\n    D --&gt; E[Progressive rollout]\n    E --&gt; F{Healthy?}\n    F --&gt;|Yes| G[Full release]\n    F --&gt;|No| H[Auto-rollback]\n    H --&gt; I[Agent investigates]\n    I --&gt; A\n    style G fill:#d1fae5,stroke:#6ee7b7,color:#065f46\n    style H fill:#fee2e2,stroke:#fca5a5,color:#991b1b</pre><h3>Monitoring: the last stage standing, and it needs to evolve</h3><p>Monitoring is the only stage of the SDLC that survives. And it doesn’t just survive, it becomes the foundation everything else rests on.</p><p>When agents ship code faster than humans can review it, observability is no longer a nice-to-have dashboarding layer. It’s the primary safety mechanism for the entire collapsed lifecycle. Every other safeguard, the design review, the code review, the QA phase, the release sign-off, has been absorbed or eliminated. Monitoring is what’s left. It’s the last line of defense.</p><p>But most observability platforms were built for humans. Alerts, log search, dashboard, etc. all designed for a person to look at, interpret, and act on. That model breaks when the volume of changes outpaces human attention. If an agent ships 500 changes a day and your observability setup requires a human to investigate each anomaly, you’ve created a new bottleneck. You’ve just moved it from code review to incident response.</p><p>Observability without action is just expensive storage. The future of observability isn’t dashboards, it’s closed-loop systems where telemetry data becomes context for the agent that shipped the code, so it can detect the regression and fix it.</p><p><strong>The observability layer becomes the feedback mechanism that drives the entire loop.</strong> Not a stage at the end. The connective tissue of the whole system.</p><pre>graph TD\n    A[Intent] --&gt; B[Agent builds, tests, deploys]\n    B --&gt; C[Production]\n    C --&gt; D[Observability layer]\n    D --&gt;|Anomaly detected| E[Agent investigates + fixes]\n    E --&gt; B\n    D --&gt;|Healthy| F[Next intent]\n    F --&gt; A\n    style D fill:#dbeafe,stroke:#93c5fd,color:#1e40af</pre><p>The teams that figure this out first, observability that feeds directly back into the agent loop, not into a human’s pager, will ship faster and safer than everyone else. The teams that don’t will drown in alerts.</p><h2>The new lifecycle is tighter loop</h2><p>The SDLC was a wide loop. Requirements → Design → Code → Test → Review → Deploy → Monitor. Linear. Sequential. Full of handoffs and waiting.</p><p>The new lifecycle is a tight loop.</p><pre>graph TD\n    A[Human Intent + Context] --&gt; B[AI Agent]\n    B --&gt; C[Build + Test + Deploy]\n    C --&gt; D[Observe]\n    D --&gt;|Problem| B\n    D --&gt;|Fine| E[Next Intent]\n    E --&gt; B\n    style B fill:#ede9fe,stroke:#c4b5fd,color:#5b21b6</pre><p>Intent. Build. Observe. Repeat.</p><p>No tickets. No sprints. No story points. No PRs sitting in a queue. No separate QA phase. No release trains.</p><p>Just a human with intent and an agent that executes.</p><p>The quality of what you build with agents is directly proportional to the quality of context you give them. Not the process. Not the ceremony. The context.</p><p>The SDLC is dead. The new skill is context engineering. The new safety net is observability.</p><p>And most of the industry is still configuring Datadog dashboards no one looks at.</p>",

      "content": "\nFollowing yesterday's <a href=\"https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-7.0-rc1-Released\">Linux 7.0-rc1</a> release, Linus Torvalds authored and merged a patch to get rid of the Linux kernel's  Kconfig option. While that option was added with good intentions, on some systems it can yield a lot of unnecessary kernel log spam.\n<p>The WARN_ALL_UNSEEDED_RANDOM option has for many years been part of the Linux kernel and enabling it will provide a warning whenever there is a use of unseeded randomness within the kernel. To help spot situations of random number generation use prior to being able to securely use RNG on the system, this option was added long ago to help spot such uses of unseeded randomness by kernel code. But due to caveats on some CPUs around a fully-seeded CRNG, the WARN_ALL_UNSEEDED_RANDOM can become like an endless stream of spam. After encountering a bug report where much of the kernel log were just messages about unseeded randomness and in turn losing some of the initial boot log, Torvalds had enough and gutted out this option.\n</p><p>Linus Torvalds explains in </p><a href=\"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=7dff99b354601dd01829e1511711846e04340a69\">this patch</a> dropping the WARN_ALL_UNSEEDED_RANDOM option:\n<blockquote>\"This config option goes way back - it used to be an internal debug option to random.c (at that point called DEBUG_RANDOM_BOOT), then was renamed and exposed as a config option as CONFIG_WARN_UNSEEDED_RANDOM, and then further renamed to the current CONFIG_WARN_ALL_UNSEEDED_RANDOM.\n<p>It was all done with the best of intentions: the more limited rate-limited reports were reporting some cases, but if you wanted to see all the gory details, you'd enable this \"ALL\" option.\n</p><p>However, it turns out - perhaps not surprisingly - that when people don't care about and fix the first rate-limited cases, they most certainly don't care about any others either, and so warning about all of them isn't actually helping anything.\n</p><p>And the non-ratelimited reporting causes problems, where well-meaning people enable debug options, but the excessive flood of messages that nobody cares about will hide actual real information when things go wrong.\n</p><p>I just got a kernel bug report (which had nothing to do with randomness) where two thirds of the the truncated dmesg was just variations of\n</p><p>   random: get_random_u32 called from __get_random_u32_below+0x10/0x70 with crng_init=0\n</p><p>and in the process early boot messages had been lost (in addition to making the messages that _hadn't_ been lost harder to read).\n</p><p>The proper way to find these things for the hypothetical developer that cares - if such a person exists - is almost certainly with boot time tracing.  That gives you the option to get call graphs etc too, which is likely a requirement for fixing any problems anyway.\n</p><p>See Documentation/trace/boottime-trace.rst for that option.\n</p><p>And if we for some reason do want to re-introduce actual printing of these things, it will need to have some uniqueness filtering rather than this \"just print it all\" model.\"</p></blockquote>Makes sense and thankfully these rather annoying kernel log messages will be disappearing with this option removed.\n<p>Besides dropping this option today, this weekend prior to tagging Linux 7.0-rc1, Torvalds also did a bit of coding in </p><a href=\"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=e19e1b480ac73c3e62ffebbca1174f0f511f43e7\">introducing the default_gfp() helper macro</a> and <a href=\"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/log/?qt=grep&amp;q=gfp_kernel\">adapting existing kernel code to make use of it</a>.",

No chain-of-thought overhead. No reasoning budget. Just send the same instruction twice.</p><p>We ran 20 parallel agents across two experiments: 10 per experiment, 5 control vs. 5 treatment, blind-scored against a pre-registered rubric.</p><p>We found nothing. The nothing is the finding.</p><h2>What Did the Paper Claim?</h2><p>A <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14982\">2025 paper by Leviathan et al.</a> at Google Research proposes a simple technique: repeat the entire user prompt once, verbatim, before sending to the model.</p><p>The mechanism is structural, not empirical. Decoder-only transformers use causal masking: each token attends only to tokens before it. In a single-pass prompt, early tokens never see later context. Repeating the prompt creates a second copy where every token attends to the full instruction during prefill. This reduces the positional attention decay documented as the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03172\">“lost in the middle” phenomenon</a> (Liu et al., 2023). This is a fundamental limitation of the decoder-only architecture, not a quirk of specific benchmarks. A 675B-parameter Mixture-of-Experts frontier model and a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20856\">3B-active-parameter small language model (SLM)</a> (NVIDIA, 2025) share it equally.</p><pre tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"text\"><code></code></pre><p><em>Code Snippet 1: Causal masking creates an asymmetry where early tokens cannot attend to later context.

Haiku 4.5 is structurally a non-reasoning model (extended thinking is opt-in, not default), making it precisely the class of LLM the paper’s title targets.</p><p>The paper tested Claude 3 Haiku alongside six other models; its strongest gains came from Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite and GPT-4o-mini. We tested Claude 4.5 Haiku, a different model generation. Anthropic does not publish architectural details for either model. Whether the technique transfers across generations is an open question this experiment cannot answer, because our ceiling effects prevented any treatment from showing lift.</p><h3>Why This Matters for Engineering Teams</h3><p>Teams adopt AI techniques from papers without field-testing them first. <a href=\"https://www.bcg.com/publications/2025/ai-adoption-puzzle-why-usage-up-impact-not\">BCG reports that 50% of companies are stagnating with AI</a> (BCG, 2025), partly because they ship optimizations without measuring baselines. Shipping an unvalidated prompt change to production would cost more: doubled input tokens on every request, with no accuracy gain to show for it. As we covered in <a href=\"https://clouatre.ca/posts/ai-observability-gaps/\">observability for AI agents</a>, optimizing without measuring before and after is flying blind.</p><h2>How Did We Design the Test?</h2><p>Both experiments shared the same core structure: 10 parallel async Scout delegates, split 5 control vs. 5 treatment, scored blind against a pre-registered rubric. For detailed methodology and raw data, see <a href=\"https://github.com/clouatre-labs/prompt-repetition-experiments\">Supplementary Materials</a>.</p><pre tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"yaml\"><code></code></pre><p><em>Code Snippet 2: Shared delegate configuration. All 10 runs use the same model, temperature, and extensions.</em></p><p> standard Scout instructions (~3,805 characters, instructions x1).</p><p> instructions repeated verbatim (~7,633 characters, instructions x2), mimicking the paper’s  pattern applied to the agent’s system prompt.</p><p>The orchestrator spawned all 10 delegates simultaneously via Goose’s background task system and handed off structured JSON. A separate blind-scoring delegate received only the output files (no group labels) and scored each against the rubric. Group assignments were sealed in a <a href=\"https://github.com/clouatre-labs/prompt-repetition-experiments/blob/main/experiments/exp1-fastmcp-refactor/label-map.json\">label map</a> before scoring began.</p><h2>What Happened in the FastMCP Refactor Test?</h2><p> 6 binary criteria, pre-registered before any runs were examined.</p><p>9 of 10 delegates produced valid output.  ran 93 messages and wrote no output file. Session log analysis confirmed the file-write instruction appeared only at the end of the delegate prompt, and the model drifted past it. This is a delegate authoring flaw with a known fix: bookend critical instructions at the start and end.</p><p>Across the 9 valid runs, 5 of 6 criteria scored 100% in both groups. The only variance was C5 (must-not constraint violations): control 5.50/6, treatment 5.80/6, delta +0.30. The treatment scored marginally higher, but at n=4 vs n=5 with binary outcomes, Fisher’s exact test is degenerate (p = 1.0). Full per-criterion scores are in the <a href=\"https://github.com/clouatre-labs/prompt-repetition-experiments/tree/main/experiments/exp1-fastmcp-refactor\">raw data</a>.</p><p>The task was too easy. The rubric could not discriminate. We needed a harder target.</p><h2>Did a Stricter Methodology Change the Result?</h2><p><a href=\"https://github.com/clouatre-labs/aptu/issues/737\"></a>, a tree-sitter AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)-based security scanner evaluation. Harder task, requiring synthesis from source code rather than retrieval from issue text. Unimplemented when tested.</p><p> 7 binary criteria. C5, C6, and C7 required the delegate to read and reason about actual source code, not just summarize the issue. Pre-registered before any runs began.</p><p><strong>Methodology improvements over Experiment 1:</strong></p><ul><li>Blinded file naming from the start ( through  with sealed )</li><li>Mann-Whitney U test pre-specified (two-tailed, alpha = 0.05)</li><li>Wall-clock latency recorded per delegate</li></ul><table tabindex=\"0\"><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table><p><em>Table 1: Experiment 2 results. Zero variance in either group. Mann-Whitney U = 12.5, p = 1.0 (degenerate: complete ties, test cannot be evaluated).</em></p><p>Every Scout, in every run, in both groups, scored 7/7. Even C5, C6, and C7, the synthesis criteria we specifically designed to require source code reasoning, hit 100% across the board.</p><p>The 17.8% latency difference is in the expected direction (longer prompt, longer prefill), which is consistent with the paper’s Anthropic-specific latency caveat. At scale, that delta compounds: doubled tokens cost money, and the added prefill time costs throughput across every agent invocation. But n=5 cannot support any inference here, and the finding is further confounded by an infrastructure issue we discovered afterward.</p><p>The scores told us nothing. The session logs told us something we did not expect.</p><h2>What Infrastructure Confound Did We Miss?</h2><p>Post-hoc session log analysis revealed a confound present in both experiments.</p><p>Goose enforces a hard cap of <strong>5 concurrent background delegates</strong>. When all 10 delegates were spawned simultaneously, runs 06-10 hit the cap and were queued into a second batch after runs 01-05 completed.</p><p>The resulting batch structure was unbalanced:</p><table tabindex=\"0\"><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table><p><em>Table 2: The 5-delegate concurrency cap split 10 simultaneous spawns into two unbalanced batches. Exact run assignments are in the <a href=\"https://github.com/clouatre-labs/prompt-repetition-experiments/tree/main/experiments/exp2-treesitter-synthesis\">raw data</a>.</em></p><p>Treatment delegates landed disproportionately in the less-contested second batch, making any latency comparison between groups uninterpretable. Accuracy was unaffected (ceiling effects dominated regardless), but the exposure is worth naming: <strong>pre-registration does not protect against runtime infrastructure behavior you did not know existed.</strong></p><p>The confound matters for latency. But the bigger question is why accuracy showed zero variance in the first place.</p><h2>Why Did Both Experiments Hit 100%?</h2><p>Two experiments, two rubrics designed to be harder than the last, two 100% results.</p><p>This is itself a finding. A well-designed Scout delegate on a well-scoped engineering issue is already operating above the baseline accuracy threshold where prompt repetition shows lift. The paper’s largest gains came from synthetic positional tasks, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14982\">NameIndex</a> (Leviathan et al., 2025), where the answer is a name buried in a list. Real engineering issues, even unimplemented ones, give the agent structured context, code references, and acceptance criteria. The agent finds what it needs without help from the prefill geometry.</p><p>This is the core finding: prompt repetition solves an attention problem that well-scoped engineering tasks do not have. The technique’s value is real, but the paper’s benchmarks do not cover agentic engineering tasks. Our experiments tested that boundary. When the agent already has structured context pointing it to the right code, repeating the instruction adds input tokens without adding accuracy signal. Understanding where SLMs succeed and fail on their own is not academic: hybrid architectures like <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09923\">SMART</a> (Kim et al., 2025) use SLMs as the primary reasoning engine, with LLMs intervening only at critical junctures. Every prompt-level optimization that improves standalone SLM accuracy reduces how often the expensive backstop fires.</p><p>For teams evaluating prompt techniques at scale, the implication is financial: doubling input tokens across every agent invocation is a measurable cost increase. If your agents already converge correctly on well-scoped tasks, that spend returns nothing. <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2406.03980v1\">Embracing negative results</a> as a research practice (Berger et al., 2024) prevents exactly this kind of waste: publication bias toward positive results means the null findings that would have saved you the experiment often go unpublished.</p><p>The gap is between task types, not between models:</p><ul><li><strong>Positional retrieval tasks</strong> (NameIndex, needle-in-haystack): high positional attention decay, repetition helps</li><li><strong>Structured engineering tasks</strong> (scoped issues with code context): low positional decay, Scout already converges correctly</li></ul><table tabindex=\"0\"><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Standard + custom retrieval (MMLU-Pro, NameIndex, others)</td><td>Issue analysis (FastMCP refactor)</td><td>Source code synthesis (AST scanner)</td></tr><tr><td>Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite, Claude 3 Haiku, 5 others</td></tr><tr><td>McNemar test on full benchmark datasets (7 benchmarks, 7 models)</td></tr><tr><td>47/70 pairs improved, 0 regressed; +76pp on NameIndex (Flash-Lite)</td></tr><tr><td>Delegate authoring failure</td></tr></tbody></table><p><em>Table 3: Comparison of experimental conditions. The paper’s gains concentrate on positional retrieval tasks; our structured engineering tasks hit ceiling effects before any treatment could show lift.</em></p><p>Designing a rubric that discriminates between good and very good on the second category is harder than it looks. Both of ours failed. The criteria require synthesis and judgment under genuine ambiguity, not retrieval from a well-scoped document.</p><h2>What Did We Learn About AI Evaluation Design?</h2><h3>Rubric Design Is Harder Than Experiment Design</h3><p>We iterated twice and hit the ceiling both times. A 7-point rubric with “source code synthesis” criteria is not automatically harder. It depends on whether the task actually creates ambiguity the agent must resolve. Ours did not.</p><p>A practical calibration target: if your scoring delegate can answer any criterion by reading the issue alone (without running the code), the criterion will not discriminate.</p><h3>Infrastructure Behavior Is a Confounder</h3><p>The 5-delegate cap is undocumented. It is enforced as a hard rejection in source (<code>GOOSE_MAX_BACKGROUND_TASKS</code> defaults to 5), with no queuing or retry. Excess delegates are dropped, not deferred. It silently split our groups into unbalanced batches. This category of confound (runtime resource limits, queue behavior, model routing) is endemic to agent systems and invisible without structured logging.</p><p>Future experiments: spawn delegates in explicit batches of 5 with documented batch assignments. Record session IDs. Treat infrastructure state as a variable, not background noise.</p><h3>Delegate Authoring Has a Turn-Length Problem</h3><p>Long sessions drift from instructions that appear only once. The  failure (93 messages, no output) demonstrated the fix: bookend critical actions at both the start and end of delegate prompts. This class of failure is predictable and preventable, but only if you treat delegate prompt structure as part of your experimental design.</p><p>The blind scoring infrastructure proved its value here. Each run produced a structured justification the scorer generated without knowing group assignment:</p><pre tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"json\"><code></code></pre><p><em>Code Snippet 3: Blind scorer output for a single run. Each criterion includes a justification generated without knowledge of group assignment.</em></p><h2>When Should You Use Prompt Repetition?</h2><p>The null result is not a failure of the paper. Prompt repetition won 47 out of 70 benchmark-model combinations with zero losses (Leviathan et al., 2025). The technique works. The question is where.</p><p>The paper’s gains concentrate on <strong>benchmarks with positional retrieval components</strong>: NameIndex, MiddleMatch, options-first multiple choice. Tasks where the answer depends on information placement in the context window. The paper also notes a <strong>neutral-to-slight effect with reasoning prompts</strong> (5 wins, 1 loss, 22 neutral with step-by-step). Reasoning appears to compensate for the same attention decay that repetition addresses.</p><p>The industry trend is not exclusively toward reasoning models. Capable SLMs are gaining ground. NVIDIA’s Nemotron 3 Nano (NVIDIA, 2025) activates 3 billion of its 30 billion parameters per token, delivering 3.3x the throughput of Qwen3-30B on a single H200, designed explicitly for multi-agent systems at scale. <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01265\">RLP</a> (Hatamizadeh et al., 2025) embeds reinforcement learning into pretraining itself, lifting math and science accuracy by 19% on a 1.7B-parameter model without post-training reasoning. These models are non-reasoning by default. The causal masking limitation that prompt repetition addresses is structural to the decoder-only architecture all of them share. Their users are also the most cost-sensitive to doubled input tokens. Every token matters when you are optimizing for throughput at the edge.</p><p>Our null result came from the other side of that boundary: structured engineering tasks where the agent already has scoped context, code references, and acceptance criteria. The ceiling was in the task, not the technique.</p><p><em>Figure 1: Decision flowchart for evaluating prompt repetition against your workload.</em></p><h3>What Transfers to Your Team</h3><p>Three things that transfer directly to any team evaluating AI agent behavior:</p><ol><li><strong>Baseline accuracy determines whether any prompt technique has room to work.</strong> Measure it before testing an optimization.</li><li><strong>Infrastructure constraints are confounder candidates.</strong> Audit your delegate system’s limits before attributing latency or throughput differences to treatment variables.</li><li><strong>Rubric discrimination is the bottleneck.</strong> Two rubrics, two ceiling effects. If your scoring criteria can be satisfied by reading the issue description alone, the rubric will not discriminate.</li></ol><h2>Did Prompt Repetition Change Anything Else?</h2><p>One observation worth noting: treatment agents in both experiments used fewer output tokens and messages to reach the same scores. This is consistent with information-theoretic expectations; redundancy in the input reduces decoder uncertainty at each generation step, which should reduce exploratory turns in an agentic loop. The original paper’s benchmarks (MMLU, GSM8K) produce fixed-format answers where output length does not vary, making this effect invisible. Agentic workloads, where the model decides how many turns to take, may be where the efficiency signal surfaces.</p><p>The economics are also different than single-turn benchmarks suggest: in a multi-turn session, the doubled prompt adds single-digit overhead to accumulated input, not 100%. The growing conversation history dominates each API call. In our data, treatment agents used 13.1% fewer input tokens and 15.4% fewer output tokens despite the longer prompt. Each avoided turn eliminates an entire context window from the running total. The effect is confounded and too small to draw conclusions, but it is a pattern worth investigating with a discriminating rubric.</p>",

During that bootstrap, one of the first things the runtime sets up is the . And that’s what we’re going to explore today.</p><p>Think of the memory allocator as a warehouse manager. Your program constantly needs boxes of different sizes — sometimes tiny, sometimes huge — and it needs them . The allocator’s job is to hand out those boxes as quickly as possible, keep the warehouse organized so nothing goes to waste, and work with the garbage collector to reclaim boxes that nobody is using anymore.</p><p>But before we get into the warehouse itself, let’s talk about when things actually end up there.</p><h2>When Does Memory Allocation Happen?</h2><p>Not every variable in your program goes through the memory allocator. Go has two places to put data: the  and the .</p><p>The stack is the easy one. Each function call gets its own little scratch space on the stack, and when the function returns, that space is automatically gone. It’s fast and simple — no bookkeeping needed.</p><p>But sometimes data needs to stick around after the function that created it is done. Maybe you’re returning a pointer to something, or storing a value that other parts of your program will use later. That data can’t live on the stack — it would vanish when the function returns. So it goes on the , which is a longer-lived region of memory.</p><p>The Go compiler is actually pretty smart about this. It analyzes your code at compile time to decide what can stay on the stack and what needs to go on the heap — this is called  (we covered it in detail in the <a href=\"https://internals-for-interns.com/posts/the-go-ir/\">IR article</a>\n).</p><p>Every time something ends up on the heap, that’s when the memory allocator comes into play. It’s the system that finds free space on the heap and hands it over. And that’s what the rest of this article is about.</p><blockquote><p>: the picture above is not the whole story. In Go, goroutine stacks are actually allocated from the heap — so the memory allocator provides the space where stacks live. But once a stack is allocated, the variables on it are managed very differently from heap objects: they’re just offsets within the stack frame, with no allocator involvement per variable. So while the allocator is responsible for the stack , it’s not involved in placing individual variables on the stack. For this article, we’ll focus on the heap side of things.</p></blockquote><p>So the allocator manages heap memory. But where does that memory come from in the first place?</p><p>When your program needs memory, somebody has to provide it. Ultimately, that somebody is the operating system. The OS manages all the physical RAM on your machine, and any process that wants memory has to ask the OS for it through system calls like  on Linux/macOS or  on Windows.</p><p>The problem is that system calls are slow. They involve switching from user space to kernel space, the OS doing its own bookkeeping, and then switching back. If Go made a system call every time you wrote  or , performance would be terrible — especially in a language designed for high concurrency, where thousands of goroutines might be allocating memory at the same time.</p><p>So the Go runtime takes a different approach: it asks the OS for <strong>large chunks of memory upfront</strong> (we’ll see later that these are 64MB on most 64-bit systems) and then manages the distribution internally. When your code needs 100 bytes, the allocator doesn’t go to the OS — it carves out 100 bytes from memory it already has. It only goes back to the OS when it runs out.</p><p>This is the fundamental idea behind the memory allocator. It sits between your program and the operating system, acting as a fast intermediary that makes allocation cheap by avoiding system calls on the hot path. But managing all that memory internally is not trivial — the allocator needs to keep track of what’s in use, what’s free, and do it all without becoming a bottleneck. Let’s see how.</p><p>We said the runtime asks the OS for large chunks of memory. Those chunks are called , and on most 64-bit systems each one is  (4MB on Windows and 32-bit systems, 512KB on WebAssembly).</p><p>When your program starts and begins allocating, the runtime requests its first arena from the OS. As the program needs more memory, it requests additional arenas. They don’t need to be next to each other in memory — the runtime keeps track of all of them through an internal map.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Does this mean Go grabs 64MB of RAM right away?</strong> No. When the runtime “requests” an arena, it first just reserves 64MB of  — think of it as putting your name on a plot of land without building anything on it yet. No physical memory is used at this point. Then, as the runtime actually needs to use parts of that arena, it tells the OS to make regions usable in chunks of about . And even then, the OS doesn’t allocate real memory until your program actually writes to those addresses — the physical memory shows up on demand, one OS page at a time, completely transparently. So the real cost is gradual: reserve the space (basically free), commit it in 4MB chunks as needed (one system call each), and let the OS fill in physical memory behind the scenes as it’s used. This is another reason the allocator is so fast — once memory is committed, everything the allocator does happens without talking to the OS at all.</p></blockquote><p>But a 64MB block is way too big to hand out directly. If your program asks for 32 bytes, you don’t want to give it an entire arena. So each arena is divided into  of  (8192 bytes). This is Go’s own page size — not the same as the OS page size, which is typically 4KB.</p><p>Pages are the basic unit the allocator works with internally. When it needs to satisfy an allocation, it works in terms of pages — how many pages to grab, which pages are free, which are in use. An arena of 64MB contains 8192 pages (64MB / 8KB), and the runtime tracks the state of each one.</p><p>But 8KB is still too big for most allocations. You don’t need a whole page for a 32-byte struct. That’s where spans come in.</p><h2>Spans: Where Objects Live</h2><p>A  is one or more contiguous pages that are dedicated to holding objects of a . This is the level where the allocator actually gives memory to your program.</p><p>Let’s make this concrete. Say your program needs a bunch of 32-byte objects. The allocator will take one page (8KB), turn it into a span for 32-byte objects, and divide it into 256 slots (8192 / 32 = 256). Each slot can hold exactly one object. When you allocate a 32-byte object, the allocator just finds the next free slot in that span and returns it. When you need another one, it grabs the next free slot. Fast and simple.</p><p>This works because <strong>every slot in a span is the same size</strong>. There’s no need to search for a block that fits, no fragmentation within the span, no merging of adjacent free blocks. Just find a free slot and use it. And to find that free slot, each span keeps a  — one bit per slot, where 1 means “in use” and 0 means “free”. Finding the next free slot is just scanning for the next 0 bit. The span also tracks where it starts in memory, how many pages it covers, how many slots it has, and how many are currently allocated. There’s also a second bitmap called  that the garbage collector uses — but we’ll get to that later. All of this metadata is part of the span structure itself — a separate object that the runtime allocates to manage the span — not stored inside the pages that hold your objects. So the full 8KB of a page (or however many pages the span covers) is available for object slots.</p><p>Now, if each span only holds one size of object, we need different spans for different sizes. But the allocator can’t create a span for every possible byte count — that would be unmanageable. Instead, Go defines  ranging from 8 bytes to 32KB. When you allocate, say, 20 bytes, Go rounds it up to the nearest size class (24 bytes in this case) and uses a span for that class. We lose a few bytes to rounding, but the simplicity and speed are worth it.</p><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table><p>If you look at the table, the page counts might seem a bit random — why does an 18KB object need 9 pages, while an 8KB object only needs 1? The rule is actually simple: start with 1 page and keep adding pages until the  (the leftover bytes that can’t fit another object) is less than 12.5% of the span. For small objects like 32 bytes, one page fits 256 objects with zero leftover — perfect, no need for more pages. For mid-range sizes like 3KB or 5KB, a single page would leave too much unusable space at the end, so the span grows to 2, 3, or even up to 10 pages to bring the waste down.</p><p>You might notice that some classes only hold 1 object per span — like class 51 (8KB) or class 67 (32KB). That means after a single allocation, the span is full. Wouldn’t it be better to use more pages so the span holds more objects? Not necessarily. A bigger span means more memory sitting reserved even if you only need one or two objects of that size. For small objects like 32 bytes, where programs typically allocate hundreds at a time, packing 256 into a span makes sense. But for larger objects, most programs only need a few, so keeping the span small avoids wasting memory.</p><p>So the size class system handles the common range of 8 bytes to 32KB. But not everything fits neatly into that range.</p><h3>The Edges: Large Objects and Tiny Objects</h3><p>You might have noticed something odd: we said there are 68 size classes, but the table goes from 1 to 67 — that’s only 67. Where’s the missing one? That’s , reserved for objects . Unlike the other classes, it doesn’t have a fixed object size or span size. Instead, a class 0 span gets exactly the number of pages the object needs, with no slot subdivision — one object, one span.</p><p>On the other end, really tiny objects like a  or an  hit a different problem. The smallest size class is 8 bytes, so even a 1-byte value would get an 8-byte slot — a lot of waste for something so small. To deal with this, Go has a  that packs multiple tiny objects (smaller than 16 bytes, without pointers) into a single 16-byte block. So several booleans or small integers can share one slot instead of each getting their own. This dramatically reduces waste for programs that allocate lots of small values.</p><p>We’ve seen how spans are organized by size — but size isn’t the only thing the allocator cares about.</p><h3>Span Classes: Size + Pointers</h3><p>The allocator doesn’t just care about object  — it also cares about whether the objects contain . Why? Because the garbage collector needs to scan objects with pointers to follow references and find live data. Objects without pointers (like a  or a struct of only integers) can be safely skipped during GC — there’s nothing to follow.</p><p>So Go keeps separate spans for each: one for objects that need scanning () and one for objects that don’t (). The combination of a size class and the scan/noscan flag is called a . With 68 size classes and 2 variants each, that gives  in total.</p><p>With all of that, the full picture looks like this:</p><p>The allocator asks the OS for arenas, divides them into pages, groups pages into spans, and divides spans into fixed-size slots. Each level makes the next one manageable. But there’s still a big problem we haven’t talked about: Go programs run many goroutines at once, and they all need to allocate memory. How do you keep all of this organized without turning the allocator into a bottleneck?</p><p>So far we’ve seen how memory is organized — arenas, pages, spans, slots. But there’s a critical question we haven’t addressed: what happens when  try to allocate memory at the same time?</p><p>Imagine you have a single global list of spans. Every time any goroutine needs memory, it has to acquire a lock, find a free slot, and release the lock. With thousands of goroutines running concurrently, that lock becomes a bottleneck — goroutines spend more time waiting for each other than actually doing useful work.</p><p>This is the locking problem, and solving it is one of the most important aspects of the Go allocator’s design. The solution is a  where each level has a different scope and different locking behavior:</p><p><strong>Level 1: mcache (per-P, no locks)</strong></p><p>Remember from the <a href=\"https://internals-for-interns.com/posts/understanding-go-runtime/\">bootstrap article</a>\nthat Go’s scheduler has a fixed number of s (processors), typically one per CPU core. Each P has its own  — a private collection of spans, one for each span class. When a goroutine running on a P needs to allocate, it grabs a slot from its P’s mcache. Since only one goroutine runs on a P at a time, . This is the fast path, and it handles the vast majority of allocations.</p><p><strong>Level 2: mcentral (per span class, brief locks)</strong></p><p>When an mcache’s span for a particular span class is full, it needs a new one. That’s where  comes in. There’s one mcentral for each of the 136 span classes, and it holds a shared pool of spans. The mcache returns its full span to mcentral and grabs a new one with free slots. This requires a lock, but it’s brief — just swapping one span for another. And since each span class has its own mcentral, goroutines allocating different sizes or scan/noscan variants don’t compete with each other.</p><p><strong>Level 3: mheap (global, expensive locks)</strong></p><p>When an mcentral has no more spans to hand out, it asks the  for fresh pages to create a new span. The mheap is the global page allocator — there’s only one, and accessing it requires a global lock. This is the slow path. It involves searching for free pages, potentially asking the OS for a new arena, and initializing a new span. But it happens rarely, because the levels above absorb most of the demand.</p><p>This is also where the large objects (&gt;32KB) we mentioned earlier end up — they skip mcache and mcentral and go straight to mheap.</p><p>The whole design works like a chain of caches:</p><p>Each level serves as a cache for the one below it. The fast path is lock-free, the medium path uses fine-grained locks, and the slow path is rare enough that its cost doesn’t matter in practice. This is based on an approach called  (Thread-Caching Malloc), originally designed by Google for C/C++ programs, but adapted for Go’s specific needs.</p><p>Now that we understand the structure and the hierarchy, let’s walk through what actually happens step by step.</p><p>The first thing it does is check the size of the allocation. Depending on how big the object is, it takes a very different path. Let’s start with the simplest case.</p><p>A fun edge case: what if you allocate something with zero size, like ? Go doesn’t bother allocating anything — all zero-byte allocations return a pointer to the same global variable (). This is safe because you can never actually read or write through a zero-sized object.</p><p>Now for the real allocations, starting with the smallest ones.</p><p>For tiny objects without pointers — things like , , or small pointer-free structs — the allocator uses the tiny allocator we mentioned earlier. The mcache keeps track of a  (just a regular 16-byte slot from the size class 2 span — nothing special about it) and an  that marks how much of that block has been used so far.</p><p>When a tiny allocation comes in, the allocator first rounds the size up for proper alignment (to 2, 4, or 8 bytes depending on the object size), then checks if the current tiny block has enough room from the current offset to the end. If it fits, the allocator returns a pointer to  and advances the offset. So a 1-byte  followed by a 1-byte  would be packed next to each other inside the same 16-byte block.</p><p>When the current tiny block doesn’t have enough room, the allocator grabs a new 16-byte slot from the mcache’s size class 2 span (using the normal small object path) and places the object at the beginning of it. But here’s a subtle detail: the allocator doesn’t blindly switch to the new block. It compares how much free space the old block has left versus how much the new block has left (which is 16 minus the object size just placed). Whichever block has  becomes the current tiny block. This minimizes waste — the allocator always prefers the block with the most room for future tiny allocations. Either way, the object you asked for is returned from the new slot; it’s just a question of which block stays “current” for the next tiny allocation.</p><p>Because the tiny allocator captures all pointer-free objects under 16 bytes, it ends up absorbing most of what you’d expect to land in the smallest size classes. In practice, the 8-byte size class (class 1) is exclusively used for 8-byte values that  contain pointers — like a  or a single-pointer interface. An , despite being 8 bytes, goes through the tiny allocator instead.</p><p>Once the object is 16 bytes or larger (or contains pointers), the tiny allocator doesn’t apply and we enter the main allocation path.</p><h3>Small Objects (16B to 32KB)</h3><p>This is the most common path, and the one the whole hierarchy is optimized for. Here’s how it flows:</p><ol><li><strong>Round up to the nearest size class</strong> and determine the span class (size + scan/noscan).</li><li>: look at the span for that span class and find the next free slot using a bitmap. If there’s a free slot, return it. Done — no locks, just some bit manipulation.</li><li>, the mcache returns it to the mcentral and asks for a new span with free slots. The mcentral first looks for spans it already has. If it finds one that hasn’t been swept yet by the garbage collector, it sweeps it first and then hands it over.</li><li>, it asks the mheap to allocate fresh pages and create a new span.</li><li><strong>If mheap doesn’t have enough free pages</strong>, it requests a new arena from the operating system.</li></ol><p>Most allocations stop at step 2. Steps 3-5 happen progressively less often, which is why the system performs well.</p><p>And finally, the big ones.</p><p>As we covered earlier, these skip mcache and mcentral entirely and go straight to the mheap, which allocates exactly the pages needed.</p><p>We’ve seen how memory gets allocated, but what about the other direction — how does memory get freed?</p><h2>Garbage Collection Integration</h2><p>The memory allocator doesn’t work alone — it’s tightly connected to the . We’ll explore the garbage collector in detail in a future article, but it’s worth understanding the basics of how they interact, because it affects how the allocator behaves.</p><p>The garbage collector’s job is to figure out which objects on the heap are still in use and which are garbage. It does this by walking the object graph — starting from known roots (global variables, stack variables, etc.) and following pointers to find everything that’s reachable. Anything it can’t reach is dead and can be freed.</p><p>This is where the  in each span come in. Every span has an  bitmap (which slots are allocated) and a  bitmap (which slots the GC found to be live). During a GC cycle, the collector marks live objects in . When marking is done, the runtime swaps the two bitmaps — so  now reflects only the live objects, and everything that wasn’t marked is effectively freed. The allocator can then reuse those slots.</p><p>This also explains something you might have noticed in the allocation flow: when the mcentral hands a span to an mcache, it sometimes needs to  it first. Sweeping is the process of looking at a span’s bitmaps and figuring out which slots are free after a GC cycle. The allocator does this lazily — it doesn’t sweep all spans at once, but rather sweeps them on demand as they’re needed for new allocations. This spreads the cost of sweeping across all allocations instead of doing it all in one big pause.</p><p>If a span ends up completely empty after sweeping (every object was garbage), its pages are returned to the mheap and can be reused for different span classes.</p><p>So the GC figures out what’s dead, and the allocator reclaims those slots. But there’s one more question: does any of that memory ever go back to the operating system?</p><h2>Memory Freeing and Scavenging</h2><p>When the garbage collector frees objects, they don’t go back to the operating system. The slots just become available again in their span, ready for the next allocation. The pages stay with the runtime — from the OS’s perspective, your program is still using all that memory.</p><p>But what if your program had a big spike of activity, allocated a lot of memory, and now most of it is garbage? You’d have a bunch of free pages sitting in the mheap doing nothing, while the OS thinks your program is still using all of it.</p><p>That’s where the  comes in. It’s a background goroutine that periodically looks for free pages that haven’t been used in a while and tells the OS it can reclaim them. The pages stay mapped in your program’s address space (so the runtime can reuse them later without a new system call), but the OS knows it can take back the physical memory behind them. On Linux, this is done with  — a hint that says “I don’t need this memory right now, feel free to use it elsewhere.”</p><p>It’s a balancing act. Returning memory too eagerly would hurt performance — if the program needs that memory again soon, it’ll have to fault it back in. But holding onto too much unused memory wastes system resources. The scavenger tries to find the right balance.</p><p>Let’s recap what we’ve covered. At compile time, escape analysis decides which values need to live on the heap. At runtime, the memory allocator is the one that actually manages that heap memory. Instead of asking the OS every time, the runtime grabs large 64MB  upfront and subdivides them into 8KB . Pages are grouped into , where each span holds fixed-size slots for objects of a single size — one of 68  ranging from 8 bytes to 32KB. The scan/noscan distinction doubles that to 136 , so the garbage collector can skip objects without pointers.</p><p>To avoid lock contention, the allocator uses a three-level hierarchy: the  (per-P, lock-free) handles most allocations, the  (per span class, brief locks) refills mcaches with fresh spans, and the  (global) allocates pages when everything else is exhausted. Tiny objects get packed together, large objects bypass the hierarchy entirely.</p><p>The allocator works hand-in-hand with the garbage collector through dual bitmaps on each span, and the  makes sure unused memory eventually gets returned to the OS.</p><p>In the next article, we’ll look at the  — the part of the runtime that decides which goroutine runs where, and how it multiplexes thousands of goroutines onto a handful of OS threads.</p>",

My original plan was to set up an Asterisk PBX with the phones I’d collected. But then,\nwhile upgrading the firmware on one of the Snom 360s, I had a better idea. Since this phone had a screen and a keyboard\n… could I get Doom running on it?</p><h2>1. Initial firmware upgrade</h2><p>Since this model was released in 2005, the first thing I wanted to do was upload some new firmware onto the phone.\nLuckily, Snom provides an archive for old firmware images. As far as I could tell, the latest firmware intended for\nthe 3xx series of devices was V08, so the image I downloaded was\n<code>Deskphone - Filearchive - V08 &gt; snom360-8.7.3.7-SIP-f.bin</code>.</p><p>Firmware updates can be installed via the web interface running on the phone itself. You simply provide a URL\nto the firmware image, and the phone downloads and installs it on its own.</p><h2>2. Exploring the firmware</h2><p>Now, at this point I had no knowledge of what the phone was actually running, and how hard it would be to port Doom. I\nstarted my investigation by looking at the HTTP headers the web interface was sending back:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"HTTP\"></code></pre></div><p>The generic “snom embedded” label suggested they were running their own custom HTTP(S) server.

Preparing to port Doom</h2><p>With shell access and a custom busybox, I was now one step closer to running doom (that’s what this post is actually\nabout, remember?). Now, at this point I was wondering about how I would actually go about porting doom. Do people just\nmodify the original source code? Do they port the engine? In my research, I found doomgeneric, which is a fork of\nfbDOOM designed for easy portability. To port it, you only need to implement a handful of functions:</p><table><tbody><tr><td>Initialize your platform (create window, framebuffer, etc…).</td></tr><tr><td>Frame is ready in DG_ScreenBuffer. Copy it to your platform’s screen.</td></tr><tr></tr><tr><td>The ticks passed since launch in milliseconds.</td></tr><tr></tr><tr><td>Not required. This is for setting the window title as Doom sets this from WAD file.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Since we were working with a Linux-based system, I could reuse SleepMS and GetTicksMs from the reference Linux\nimplementation. The two things I needed to figure out were:</p><ul><li>How to draw to the screen</li><li>How to get input from the keypad</li></ul><h2>6. Reverse engineering the driver</h2><p>To figure out how the screen and keyboard worked, I needed to dive deeper into the firmware.</p><div><p>Note: This section is extremely technical and contains a lot of decompiled code. It details the process of me\nreverse engineering the drivers for the display, LEDs and keyboard. If you’re not interested in that, feel free\nto skip ahead to <a href=\"https://0x19.co/post/snom360_doom/#7-porting-doom\">section 7</a>.</p></div><p>The v7 binaries weren’t completely stripped and contained quite a few external symbols:</p><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>nm -gD 1lid | wc -l  \n860\n</code></pre><p>I loaded it into Ghidra again, this time pointing it at all the libraries provided with the toolchain at\n<code>opt/uclibc-toolchain/gcc-3.3.6/toolchain-mips/lib</code>. I let the automatic analyzer run and started analyzing the\ndecompiled sources. Note that I’ll only outline the code pertinent to the problem at hand. Furthermore, I have already\nrenamed mangled variables and functions for better readability.</p><p>I started by examining the main function, which assigned the value  to a variable:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"C\"></code></pre></div><p>This variable was then manipulated based on the arguments passed to the executable. If none were passed, it retained\nits default value. A bit later, it was used in a function call that seemed to be related to the display:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"C\"></code></pre></div><p>Since the exported symbols were preserved, figuring out what each function did was much easier.</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"C\"></code></pre></div><p>The function began with a series of calls to set up the file descriptor for the display:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"C\"></code></pre></div><p>The device path () was passed to , which simply opened the file without any permissions:</p><p>Note that  is a global variable used throughout the code. After opening the file descriptor to\n, the display was initialized:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"C\"></code></pre></div><p>I took a closer look at the setup function. It contained quite a lot of code, so I’ll go through it bit by bit. It\nappeared to be responsible for initializing the port to talk to the display.</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"C\"></code></pre></div><p>There were several writes to the port at  (the global variable from earlier). Looking at how those writes took place:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"C\"></code></pre></div><p>All the communication took place over ioctl calls! To decipher those, I took a step back. Bundled with the GPL\ndownloads were kernel sources, which contained headers for an INCAIP kernel module:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"sh\"></code></pre></div><p>The file  contained several ioctl definitions:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"C\"></code></pre></div><p>The definitions for the icotl macros are located at <code>linux-2.4.31/include/asm-mips/ioctl.h</code>:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"C\"></code></pre></div><p>Without going into too much detail, it boils down to the following:</p><table><tbody><tr><td>Direction:010: _IOC_READ110: _IOC_READ|_IOC_WRITE</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Thus, the ICOTL number from our function call () is defined as follows:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"C\"></code></pre></div><p>The  structure was defined as follows:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"C\"></code></pre></div><p>Since the  field in the decompiled ioctl call was , this meant it only consisted of the ,\n, and  fields.

After adding the  structure to\nGhidra and retyping , it looked much better:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"C\"></code></pre></div><p>Going back up one level, I looked at the commands that were sent through the port for initialization:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"C\"></code></pre></div><p>After these initialization commands were written to the port, there were some more function calls:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"C\"></code></pre></div><p> does what the name suggests:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"C\"></code></pre></div><p>It simply runs a loop 100,000 times without actually doing anything, stalling the CPU for enough time to execute the\nnext operation on the port. <code>inca_port_write_display_cmd</code> sends both commands and data to the display:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"C\"></code></pre></div><p>Decoding the ioctl numbers again gave the following two calls:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"C\"></code></pre></div><p>This function sends both commands and data to the display. The busy loop runs between the commands.\nIn total, the following commands were sent to the port:</p><p>The final part of the setup function consisted of a function call to clear the display:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"C\"></code></pre></div><p> clears a single row on the display:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"C\"></code></pre></div><p>First, several  calls are executed. The row isn’t sent directly, but is instead ORed with ,\nsuggesting that the rows start at . The function then sends 132 DISPDATA commands with the value ,\n(presumably) meaning that each row has 132 columns. Upon booting, only the first 3 rows were written to, while the rest\nstayed the same. After the display was fully initialized, the program hid the arrows next to each row on the display.</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"C\"></code></pre></div><p>I wasn’t sure what these commands did exactly (since they differed from clearing the screen), but the array being referenced contained the following values:</p><p>At this point, I knew how to initialize and clear the display, but actually drawing to it remained unclear. Looking at\nlater function calls, the program appeared to use raster images internally:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"C\"></code></pre></div><p>This looked like decompiled C++ code and was getting rather convoluted. I decided to take a different approach and\nwrite my own driver to experiment with.</p><p>To start, I simply ported all the functions I had knowledge of so far:</p><ul><li>Sending commands/data to the display</li></ul><p>After I had implemented everything, I compiled the program using the cross-compilation toolchain and compressed it\nusing the UPX binary provided with the GPL downloads. The program itself didn’t do much so far, but clearing the first\nthree rows actually seemed to work! I now had to figure out how to draw to the screen, and how many rows there were in\nthe first place. To start, I tried filling the topmost row (0) with pixels.</p><p>Going off of the screen clearing code, I tried sending  instead of  for each column:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"C\"></code></pre></div><p>This actually worked! However, the screen seemed to be filled from bottom to top, with 0 (0xb0) being the bottommost row.</p><p>I wrapped it in a for loop to try and find out how many rows there were and got the following result:</p><p>Since I increased the loop count incrementally, I concluded that there were 8 rows in total, with the bottom-most row\nbeing row number 0. Interestingly though, each row only contained one line of pixels each. I tried sending a few values\nother than , and discovered the following when sending  and :</p><p>I suspected that each byte sent was responsible for setting multiple pixels vertically, since sending 0xff for row 0\nset 8 lines of pixels at the bottom. This would mean that the display had 64 rows, and therefore a resolution of 132x32\npixels. I wasn’t sure why setting the rows also set (only some) arrows at the same time, but at this point I hadn’t\nimplemented the arrow hiding code.</p><p>I played around with my driver a bit more and ended up writing a small program that converted images (and videos!) into\ndata ready to be written directly to the screen, which confirmed my theory of how the display worked.</p><h3>Getting the backlight to work</h3><p>From using the phone as it was intended, I knew that the screen also had an integrated backlight, which would\ndefinitely improve visibility and glare. So far, I hadn’t seen any reference to it in the code, so I started by\nsearching for “light” in the symbol tree. I found the following function, which sounded rather promising:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"C\"></code></pre></div><p> contains an array that maps each value between 0-16 to another value between 0-16. It takes an LED\nindex (between 0 and 16) and the value it should be set to (0 or 1) and constructs a bit mask from it. The backlight\nappeared to be one of 16 controllable LEDs on the phone.</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"C\"></code></pre></div><p> is a global variable containing a bit array that is then used to write the physical LED states in\n:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"C\"></code></pre></div><p>First, some generic setup commands are sent to the port. The function then writes a single bit (0) to the port and\nchecks its return value. If it returns 0, the function terminates and sends some generic closing commands. Writing\nand reading a single bit is implemented in the  function:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"C\"></code></pre></div><p>It sends several ioctl commands to the port ioctl commands to the port and calls :</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"C\"></code></pre></div><p>This function takes a value as a parameter and then reads from the port 3000 times. If the read value matches the\nexpected one, it returns 1, otherwise 0.</p><p>Finally, all the individual values of the leds are written, using  again.</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"C\"></code></pre></div><p>The bits are read starting from the most significant bit and sent one each at a time.</p><h3>Adding LED support to the driver</h3><p>Now that I had all the ioctl calls to set the LEDs, I could update my driver again. I implemented everything from the\ndisassembled driver, but I was unsure which LED index controlled which LED. I solved this by simply bruteforcing each\nindex, i.e. setting only a single LED to 1 at a time. Interestingly, all LEDs except for the backlight seem to be\nactivated when writing 0 to them, while the backlight activates when writing 1. I determined the following mappings:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"C\"></code></pre></div><h3>Getting input from the keyboard</h3><p>All that was left now was to actually get input from the keyboard. Again, I started out by searching in the symbol\ntree. Keyboard seem to be read from a function :</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"C\"></code></pre></div><p>This function takes two parameters: one byte that contains the keycode of the key pressed, and an int that gets set\nbased on whether a keyboard event was read or not. First, the port gets the same setup command as for the LEDs and “1”\nis written to the port. Then, the keyboard gets polled using :</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"C\"></code></pre></div><p>This function writes to the port again and then reads a single bit back. This bit is passed back to the keyboard\nreading function. If both the return value from  the read bit are 1, the driver registers a\nkeypress (by setting ) and starts reading the key code, one bit at a time. The most significant bit is\nread first and gets shifted with each iteration. Once the key code is read, the finishing commands are sent to the port\n(same as for the LEDs).</p><h3>Adding keyboard presses to the driver</h3><p>Once again, I extended my driver with what I had just learned. Sadly, there was no map available for all the possible\nkey presses, so I had to find out the keycodes for all possible keys on my own. I did this by running a loop which\npolled the keyboard and, if a key press was detected, printed the key code to stdout. An event is registered both when\nthe key is pressed and when it is released. At first I was a bit confused whether or not these were actually separate\nkey codes, but it turned out that the type of event is stored in the most significant bit, meaning that the keycode\nonly takes up 7 bits. The map I determined was as follows:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"C\"></code></pre></div><p>With the drivers complete, I could now get started with the original goal: porting Doom! In\n<a href=\"https://0x19.co/post/snom360_doom/#5-preparing-to-port-doom\">section 5</a>, I outlined the functions needed to port doomgeneric to a new platform and will\ngo through them one by one now.</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"md\"></code></pre></div><p>For the Snom 360, initialization was straightforward:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"C\"></code></pre></div><p>I just set up the platform itself and activated the screen’s backlight. The setup details are covered in\n<a href=\"https://0x19.co/post/snom360_doom/#6-reverse-engineering-the-driver\">section 6</a>, and I used my custom driver for this port (see <a href=\"https://0x19.co/post/snom360_doom/#downloads\">Downloads</a>).</p><p>I reused the code from the reference implementation in :</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"C\"></code></pre></div><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"md\"></code></pre></div><p>This function can also be taken from the reference implementation:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"C\"></code></pre></div><p>where  gets set in :</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"C\"></code></pre></div><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"md\"></code></pre></div><p>I skipped this function entirely, since the phone has no concept of windows.</p><p>This was one of the more hands-on functions to implement. Based on the reference implementations, I learned that Doom\nuses its own keycodes which need to be mapped from the platform’s native codes. The function itself is short:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"C\"></code></pre></div><p>I used a simple circular buffer to provide key events to the game. The keyboard is polled every time a new frame is\ndrawn (see <a href=\"https://0x19.co/post/snom360_doom/#dg_drawframe\">DG_DrawFrame</a>), and if an event is detected, it gets added to the queue. The platform’s\nkey codes are translated using . When the game needs to read a key press, it provides two pointers:\none for the event type, and one for the key code. Since the status was already stored in the keycodes, passing this\nalong was straightforward.</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"md\"></code></pre></div><p>Now, this was the most important part of the whole project. Doom provides a buffer in the global \nvariable:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"C\"></code></pre></div><p>where  is a 32-bit unsigned integer representing 8-bit RGB components. The lowest resolution I could get the\ngame to render at was 320×200, which didn’t work well with the 132×64 screen. Instead, I decided to render at 640×400\nand average four pixels at a time for downscaling. The next problem was that the LED matrix display only supports 1-bit\nstates (on/off), while Doom provides full color. My solution was to average the RGB components of four pixels, convert\nthem to grayscale, and use a specific cutoff value to translate 0-255 to 0/1. I had to tinker with the cutoff\n(contrast) quite a bit, which is why I added it as a command-line parameter.</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"C\"></code></pre></div><p>First, the frame is scaled down to 132x64, and the 1-bit values are stored in the  array. While this code is\na bit unreadable, the underlying mechanism is rather simple. Next, The grayscale array gets packed:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"C\"></code></pre></div><p>Since each byte controls 8 vertical pixels, the grayscale rows needed to be packed into 1-byte bit arrays. I also had\nto start packing the pixels from the bottom of the image, since row 0 starts at the bottom of the screen. Finally, the\nbuffer gets drawn to the screen:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"C\"></code></pre></div><p>This process repeats for each frame.</p><p>Now that all the functions have been implemented, we’ll still need to actually compile the program. I started out by\ncopying the generic Makefile and modifying it to use my own sources, as well as the cross compilation toolchain for\nbuilding. This was all rather straightforward, and I managed to compile everything without any issues. Note that I\nset it to compile as a static binary. While this vastly increases the file size, most of the overhead can be gotten rid\nof again using the UPX tool. After building and compressing the binary, I downloaded it to the phone.</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"sh\"></code></pre></div><p>And it runs without issue! Now we need a IWAD file to actually play the game. I started searching for a minimal,\nplayable IWAD and found the squashware IWAD, which provides a 1-level 660K (!) IWAD file. I loaded the file onto\nthe phone as well, and…</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"sh\"></code></pre></div><p>it fails to load. Now, the IWAD works on my local machine, and 1882193944 seems awfully large, which is why I\nspeculated that it might be an endianness issue. As it turns out, the cross compiler does not set the internal\n macro correctly, which leads to errors with the endianness handling. I added a simple workaround:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"C\"></code></pre></div><p>and compiled everything again. This time, everything worked without any issues:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"sh\"></code></pre></div><p>Now, all that was left was to play the game!

To that end, chaos_theory automatically biases generation towards small values and edge cases, does structural mutations and crossover, supports example-guided generation and has automatic built-in swarm testing – on top of basics like composable generators and automatic structural minimization.</p><p>As of today, chaos_theory is definitely not ready for prime-time, as it is missing important features like an  derive macro. However, it already works well and is useful. Given that a lot of people in the Rust community are interested in property-based testing, fuzzing and verification, I think that it might already be interesting to some, at least for enthusiasts.</p><p>P.S. AI disclosure: with the exception of the guide doc, nothing in the project was AI-generated. Most of it was written way before coding agents became as good as they are today.</p>",

      "content": "<p>A follow-up to my post on <a href=\"https://nesbitt.io/2025/11/26/extending-git-functionality.html\">extending git functionality</a>. Git looks for several special files in your repository that control its behavior. These aren’t configuration files in , they’re committed files that travel with your code and affect how git treats your files.</p><p>If you’re building a tool that works with git repositories, like <a href=\"https://github.com/git-pkgs/git-pkgs\">git-pkgs</a>, you’ll want to ensure you respect these configs.</p><p>Patterns of files git should never track. One pattern per line, supports wildcards and directory markers.</p><div><div><pre><code>node_modules/\n*.log\n.env\ndist/\n</code></pre></div></div><p>Git checks multiple ignore files in order:  in each directory,  for local-only ignores, and the global ignore file at  or wherever  points. Global ignores are good for OS-specific files like  or  that shouldn’t clutter every project’s .</p><p>The pattern matching supports wildcards (), directory markers (), negation (), and character ranges. The  pattern matches nested directories.</p><p> only affects untracked files. Files that were already tracked before being added to  stay in the repository and show up in every forge’s web UI as normal ( removes them from tracking). GitHub, GitLab, Forgejo, and Gitea’s web editors will also let you create a file matching an ignored pattern and commit it without any warning. Package managers often ship with their own ignore patterns (, , ) that you’re expected to add to your ignore file.</p><p>Tells git how to handle specific files. This is where you configure filters, diff drivers, merge drivers, line ending normalization, and language detection overrides.</p><div><div><pre><code># Clean/smudge filters\n*.psd filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs\n\n# Line ending normalization\n*.sh text eol=lf\n*.bat text eol=crlf\n\n# Treat as binary\n*.png binary\n\n# Custom diff driver\n*.json diff=json\n\n# Merge strategy\npackage-lock.json merge=ours\n\n# Language detection override for GitHub Linguist\nvendor/* linguist-vendored\n*.gen.go linguist-generated\ndocs/* linguist-documentation\n</code></pre></div></div><p>The  attribute tells git to normalize line endings. The  attribute tells git not to diff or merge, just pick one version. The  strategy always keeps your version during merge conflicts.</p><p>GitHub Linguist reads  to override its language detection. Mark vendored code with  to exclude it from language statistics. Mark generated files with  to collapse them in diffs. Mark documentation with  to exclude it from stats.</p><p>Like , git checks  files in each directory and  for local-only attributes.</p><p>Git LFS configuration that travels with the repository. Uses git config format to set the LFS endpoint URL, transfer settings, and other LFS options.</p><div><div><pre><code>[lfs]\n    url = https://lfs.example.com/repo\n[lfs \"transfer\"]\n    maxretries = 3\n</code></pre></div></div><p>Git LFS reads  automatically when you run LFS commands. This lets you commit LFS configuration so everyone working on the repo uses the same settings. Without it, developers need to manually configure their local LFS setup.</p><p>LFS also uses  to mark which files should be handled by LFS (the <code>*.psd filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs</code> pattern shown above). The  file handles the LFS-specific settings like where to find the LFS server. If you add file patterns to LFS after files are already committed, you need to run  to rewrite history and move those files into LFS.</p><p>Configuration for git submodules. Git writes this file when you run  and reads it when you run .</p><div><div><pre><code>[submodule \"vendor/lib\"]\n    path = vendor/lib\n    url = https://github.com/example/lib.git\n    branch = main\n</code></pre></div></div><p>Each submodule gets an entry with its path, URL, and optionally the branch to track. The file lives at the root of your repository.</p><p>Submodules let you embed other git repositories as dependencies. Running  doesn’t fetch submodule content automatically, you need <code>git submodule update --init --recursive</code> or pass  to clone.</p><p>They don’t handle versioning well (you track a specific commit, not a version range), they create nested  directories, and forgetting to update them creates confusing states.</p><p>But submodules work fine for vendoring code you control or for monorepo structures where you want to check out only part of the tree.</p><p>Maps author names and email addresses to canonical identities. Git uses this for , , and  output.</p><p>, , and  all use mailmap to aggregate commits under canonical identities. GitHub’s contributor graphs <a href=\"https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/22518\">do not</a>, which means duplicate entries persist on the web even when your mailmap is correct.</p><p>Without mailmap, contributors who changed email addresses or fixed typos in their names show up as multiple people. With it, all their commits aggregate under one identity.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/gitmailmap\">gitmailmap docs</a> cover the file format. You can put mailmap at  in the repo root or configure  to point elsewhere.</p><p>Lists commits that  should skip. Put the commit SHA of bulk formatting changes, linting passes, or other noise commits in this file and blame will look through them to find the meaningful change.</p><div><div><pre><code># .git-blame-ignore-revs\n# Ran prettier on entire codebase\na1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6q7r8s9t0\n\n# Migrated to ESLint flat config\nb2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6q7r8s9t0u1\n</code></pre></div></div><p>Configure git to use it with <code>git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs</code>. GitHub, GitLab (15.4+), and Gitea all read this file automatically without configuration. If you set this in your global git config,  will fail in any repository that doesn’t have the file, so you either need per-repo config or an empty  in every repo you work in.</p><p>This solves the problem where running a formatter on the entire codebase makes  useless. With this file, blame skips those commits and shows the actual author of the logic.</p><p>The file format is simple: one commit SHA per line, with  for comments. See the <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-blame#Documentation/git-blame.txt---ignore-revs-fileltfilegt\">git blame docs</a> for details.</p><p>A template for commit messages. You configure this with <code>git config commit.template .gitmessage</code> and git will pre-fill the commit message editor with this content.</p><div><div><pre><code># .gitmessage\n# &lt;type&gt;: &lt;subject&gt;\n#\n# &lt;body&gt;\n#\n# &lt;footer&gt;\n#\n# Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore\n</code></pre></div></div><p>Unlike the other files in this post,  requires manual configuration per clone. Each developer needs to run <code>git config commit.template .gitmessage</code> after cloning. Some teams automate this with a setup script or use tools like <a href=\"https://github.com/typicode/husky\">husky</a> to set local configs during installation. This extra step is why most projects prefer  hooks to validate format rather than templates to guide writing.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit#_discussion\">git commit docs</a> mention template files. The  hook is an alternative that can generate dynamic templates.</p><p>Git forges extend repositories with their own magic folders: , , , , . These aren’t git features, but they follow the same pattern: configuration that travels with your code.</p><p>Inside these folders you’ll find CI/CD workflows, issue and PR templates, CODEOWNERS files mapping paths to required reviewers, and other forge-specific configuration. The folders let forges add features without polluting the repository root.</p><p>Forgejo and Gitea have fallback chains. Forgejo checks  →  → . Gitea checks  → . This lets you override GitHub-specific config when hosting on multiple platforms.</p><p>SourceHut uses  at the root or  for CI, without a dedicated folder namespace.</p><p> is a convention, not a git feature. Git doesn’t track empty directories. If you want an empty directory in your repository, you put a  file in it so git has something to track. The filename  is arbitrary, it could be anything.</p><p> files sometimes appear in repositories as suggested configuration. Git won’t load these automatically (security reasons), but projects include them with instructions to run <code>git config include.path ../.gitconfig</code> or manually copy settings. Common in monorepos or projects with specific git settings they want to standardize.</p><p> or similar files track GPG/SSH signing keys for trusted contributors. Not a native git feature, but used by some projects (notably the Linux kernel) as part of their signing workflow. Git’s <code>gpg.ssh.allowedSignersFile</code> config can point to a file of trusted SSH keys that  uses for verification.</p><p> configures <a href=\"https://www.gerritcodereview.com/\">Gerrit</a> code review integration. Used by projects hosted on Gerrit (OpenStack, Android, Eclipse) to specify which Gerrit server and project to push to.</p><div><div><pre><code>[gerrit]\nhost=review.opendev.org\nport=29418\nproject=openstack/nova.git\ndefaultbranch=master\n</code></pre></div></div><p>Running <a href=\"https://docs.opendev.org/opendev/git-review/latest/\"></a> reads this file and pushes commits to Gerrit for review instead of directly to the branch. It’s a canonical example of a tool extending git’s workflow through a committed config file.</p><p> configures <a href=\"https://jorisroovers.com/gitlint/\">gitlint</a> for commit message linting. Follows the same pattern: commit the config, everyone gets the same rules.</p><div><div><pre><code>[general]\nignore=body-is-missing\n\n[title-max-length]\nline-length=72\n</code></pre></div></div><p>Gitlint reads this to validate commit message format. Similar to using a  hook but with the configuration traveling with the repository.</p><p> is <a href=\"https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj\">Jujutsu</a>’s working copy state directory. Jujutsu is a git-compatible VCS that stores its own metadata in  while respecting all of git’s magic files. If you use , you’ll have both  and  in your repository, and , ,  all work the same way.</p><p>The pattern extends beyond git. Other tools follow the same approach: drop a dotfile in your repository, tools detect it automatically, behavior changes.</p><p> standardizes editor behavior across teams. Put it at the root of your repo and editors read it to configure indent style, line endings, trailing whitespace, and character encoding.</p><div><div><pre><code>root = true\n\n[*]\nindent_style = space\nindent_size = 2\nend_of_line = lf\ncharset = utf-8\ntrim_trailing_whitespace = true\n\n[*.md]\ntrim_trailing_whitespace = false\n</code></pre></div></div><p>VS Code, Vim, Emacs, Sublime, and most other editors either support it natively or have plugins. See <a href=\"https://editorconfig.org/\">editorconfig.org</a> for the full spec.</p><p>, ,  tell version managers which language version to use. Tools like rbenv, nodenv, pyenv, nvm, and asdf read these files when you  into the directory and automatically switch versions.</p><div><div><pre><code># .ruby-version\n3.3.0\n\n# .node-version\n20.11.0\n</code></pre></div></div><p> is asdf’s multi-language version file. One file for all languages.</p><div><div><pre><code>ruby 3.3.0\nnodejs 20.11.0\npython 3.12.0\n</code></pre></div></div><p> works like  but for Docker build context. When you run , Docker sends files to the daemon. List patterns in  and Docker won’t send them.</p><div><div><pre><code>.git\nnode_modules\n*.log\n.env\n</code></pre></div></div><p>This speeds up builds and keeps secrets out of images. The syntax matches : wildcards, negation, directory markers.</p><p>If you’re building tools that interact with git repositories, you probably want to respect these files:</p><ul><li>Read  when walking the repository tree</li><li>Read  to know which files are binary, vendored, or generated</li><li>Read  when displaying author information</li><li>Read  if you need to handle submodules</li></ul><p>The git config format (used by  and various other files) is <code>[section \"subsection\"] key = value</code>. Git ships a  command that reads and writes these files correctly. Most languages have git config parsers in their git libraries.</p><p>If you know of other git magic files or have corrections, reach out on <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@andrewnez\">Mastodon</a> or submit a pull request on <a href=\"https://github.com/andrew/nesbitt.io\">GitHub</a>.</p>",

      "content": "<p>As part of writing <a href=\"https://leanpub.com/logic/\">Logic for Programmers</a> I produced a lot of “chaff”, code samples and sections I wrote up and then threw away. Sometimes I found a better example for the same topic, sometimes I threw the topic away entirely. It felt bad to let everything all rot on my hard drive, so I’m sharing a bunch of chaff for a tool called “Z3”, which has all sorts of uses in software research.</p><p>First an explanation of what this tool actually is, and then some scripts in order of increasing interestingness. All examples will use the <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/z3-solver/\">Python bindings</a> ().</p><p>An  (“Satisfiability Modulo Theories”) solver is a constraint solver that understands math and basic programming concepts. You give it some variables, some equations with those variables, and it tries to find you a , or set of assignments that satisfy all those equations.</p><p>Imagine you’re 12 years old and taking Algebra I for the first time, and see this problem:</p><pre><code>4x + 2y == 14\n2x - y  == 1\nsolve for x &amp; y\n</code></pre><p>You’re supposed to learn how to do solve this as a system of equations, but if you want to cheat yourself out of an education you can have Z3 solve this for you.</p><div><pre><code data-lang=\"python\"></code></pre></div><p>This is the most common way to use Z3: instantiate a solver, add constraints to the solver, and check it. creates two “constants”. When we call , the solver tries to find values for the constants that satisfy all our constraints (the model). Here it prints “sat” followed by . If there were multiple answers it would return the first one it found, and if there were none it would print “unsat”.</p><p>That’s the “satisfiability” part, anyway. The “Modulo Theories” part comes from the fact that Z3 carries a bunch of specialized solvers for different domains, or “theories”. This means it can handle constraints involving arrays, regexes, quantified expressions, etc.</p><p>From now on we’ll be like the cool kids and import the whole Z3 API into our namespace.</p><h3>A Silly Math Question I Had</h3><blockquote><p>Are there four  positive integers  where  and ?</p></blockquote><p>The most direct way to express all of the constraints is like this:</p><div><pre><code data-lang=\"python\"></code></pre></div><p>This returns “unsat”, meaning no such pair of pairs exists. In retrospect I should have expected this; see the dropdown for a proof.</p><p>What if we try this with two distinct triples, i.e. six distinct numbers? I don’t want to write  not-equals statements so let’s pull in some syntactic sugar:</p><ul><li> returns the list of variables .</li><li> and  do exactly what you’d expect.</li><li> says that all the values in  must be unique.</li></ul><p>With that we can make the script much more scalable:</p><div><pre><code data-lang=\"python\"></code></pre></div><p>This time we  find a pair of triples:  and   have a sum of 30 and a product of 840.</p><p>If you run this you may get a different example, because we just asked for  satisfying models. We can find other models by adding new constraints, or change the solver to an  that can minimize the found sum or product.</p><div><pre><code data-lang=\"diff\"></code></pre></div><p>This returns  and  , with a sum of 19 and a product of 144.</p><h3>Minimizing Annual Contributions</h3><p>Z3’s optimizer takes a long time compared to dedicated constraint solving tools like <a href=\"https://www.minizinc.org/\">MiniZinc</a>, but we can still do some simple problems with it.</p><blockquote><p>A bank account offers 1% annual percentage yield. What’s the minimum you have to deposit each year to have 10,000 after 20 years? Assume deposits happen after interest is paid.</p></blockquote><p>So in the first year we have  dollars, in the second year we have  dollars, etc. Now in SMT we can’t reassign the values of constants, but here’s where the python abstraction leaks a little bit. Say we write</p><div><pre><code data-lang=\"python\"></code></pre></div><p>It looks like we assign the Python variable  to the SMT constant , but  is actually assigned to the  “the value of ”. The the line  assigns  to the expression “the value of  + the value of ”, meaning the line after adds the constraint .</p><p>This means we can compound interest like this:</p><div><pre><code data-lang=\"py\"></code></pre></div><p>This time we’re using  instead of . A Real is kinda like an infinite precision floating point. needs to be a  because it’s a fixed value and not something Z3 must solve for. This will calculate the final value of  after 20 years.</p><p>All this said, this approach means we can’t know what value  is in year 14. If we want the intermediate results, I can make  an array of 20 reals, where  is the starting value and <code>balance[n] == balance[n-1]*r + c</code>. Full model:</p><div><pre><code data-lang=\"python\"></code></pre></div><p>This finds the optimum deposit to be . Optimization isn’t a popular use of Z3 because it’s so slow but it’s still a pretty cool feature.</p><p>This also shows a useful trick: we can call  with additional constraints. I didn’t know this was possible until fairly recently! This seems useful if we want to solve many instances of the same problem, but from what I’ve seen people prefer to instantiate new solver objects each time, not ‘parameterize’ one solver with new constraints.</p><h3>Reverse Engineering an RNG</h3><p>One thing I really want to do with the book is make sure each topic that I introduce has a useful application. It doesn’t have to be something that appeals to every single programmer, just be useful enough so people think “I can see how learning this could benefit somebody out there.” This led me to write an example about reverse engineering the values of an RNG.</p><p>Most random number generators in software are actually : they use a deterministic mathematical algorithm to generate a sequence of numbers that is “random enough” for most use cases. I talk about this more <a href=\"https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/randomness/\">here</a>. One such algorithm is the <dfn>Linear Congruential Generator</dfn>, or LCG. The LCG has fixed constants (,,), a starting seed , and computes the next value like this:</p><p>For example, if , the sequence from 1 would go , etc. Most sequences use much higher values, though. Let’s write an SMT problem that takes a sequence and  and recomputes .</p><div><pre><code data-lang=\"python\"></code></pre></div><p><a href=\"https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3\">The Z3 Repo</a> calls Z3 a . That means it should be able to prove theorems true in mathematics.</p><p>This works based on a property called “logical duality”. Take the theorem “addition is commutative”: <code>all a, b in Real: a + b = b + a</code>. This is logically equivalent to saying “there  where ”. So we can ask Z3 to  for the negation. If it can’t find a counterexample, then the theorem is true.</p><div><pre><code data-lang=\"python\"></code></pre></div><p>Usually theorems have conditions, like “,  there is some  where ”. The mathematician would write this as <code>a != 0 =&gt; some b: a*b == 1</code>. In Z3,  is written , which we negate as normal.</p><div><pre><code data-lang=\"python\"></code></pre></div><p>This returns “Theorem true”. Being able to prove theorems makes SMT solvers absolutely indispensable to <a href=\"https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/lpl/\">formal verification</a>. If you can convert a programming function to a set of Z3 equations you can prove that the function has expected properties.</p><p>At the same time I was developing all of these Z3 examples, I was writing examples for generalized constraint solvers like MiniZinc. I shared some of the chaff from that <a href=\"https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/many-hard-leetcode-problems-are-easy-constraint/\">on my newsletter</a>. I also formalized a couple of them as Z3 practice, and one stood out as being interesting:</p><blockquote><p>Given a list of stock prices through the day, find maximum profit you can get by buying one stock and selling one stock later.</p></blockquote><p>This seems simple enough:</p><div><pre><code data-lang=\"python\"></code></pre></div><pre><code>TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices, not ArithRef\n</code></pre><p>The problem is Z3 can’t use SMT variables to index Python arrays. Instead, Z3 has a “theory of arrays”, which means that you can add arrays as Z3 variables:</p><div><pre><code data-lang=\"python\"></code></pre></div><p>So far, so good. But now we get a new problem:</p><pre><code>buy at 21237 for -2\nsell at 21238 for 0\nprofit: 2\n</code></pre><p>To understand what’s going on, we have to understand what an <a href=\"https://smt-lib.org/theories-ArraysEx.shtml\">SMT array actually “is”</a>. An array is actually closer to a key-value map: it takes a key “sort” (basically a type) and a value sort. So our “array”  maps integers to integers. The array must also have a  and a  operator (which returns a new array). SMT operations must be total for all possible inputs, meaning  must return a value no matter what  is. This all means that arrays don’t have a notion of “length” or “bounds” besides what we intentionally constrain. This is a valid Z3 program:</p><div><pre><code data-lang=\"py\"></code></pre></div><p>For me it outputs <code>[A = Store(K(Int, -1), 3, 0)]</code>, which means “the array that maps every integer to  except for 3, which it maps to 0”.</p><p>That all explains why Z3 was able to buy stocks at 21237. To model our problem properly, we have to restrict  and  to the range of indices where we explicitly defined values.</p><div><pre><code data-lang=\"diff\"> opt.add(buy &lt; sell)\n</code></pre></div><p>This now correctly returns a max profit of 8.</p><p>(What could possibly be the use of infinite arrays? Well, an array that maps every string to an integer <a href=\"https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/2000-words-about-arrays-and-tables/\">is equivalent to a  function</a>. This means Z3 can find functions that satisfy constraints!It’s not something I ever used in anger, though.)</p><p>I had three goals for my SMT examples: they should be  to someone who is new to logic, they should look like a  problem some readers might see in their jobs, and SMT solvers should be the  tool for solving them. And most of the examples above fail at least one of these:</p><ul><li>Nobody needs to find number triplets as part of their job.</li><li>To demo reversing an RNG, I’d have to spend a bunch of time explaining PRNGs and LCGs.</li><li>Conventional constraint solvers (covered in the same chapter) can optimize numerical problems much faster than an SMT solver can.</li></ul><p>In the end I settled on three examples:</p><ol><li>An optimization problem that constraint solvers couldn’t do. Most solvers only work on numbers, so “find the largest common substring” is a good choice.</li><li>Proving a very simple math property, mostly to motivate (3)</li><li>Formally verifying a simple Python function.</li></ol><p>I also wrote a quick script showing that Z3 could solve constraints on “machine integers”, which are represented with <a href=\"https://microsoft.github.io/z3guide/docs/theories/Bitvectors/\">bitvectors</a>.</p><p>We’ll see from feedback if these are actually good choices!</p><h2>Other examples and Z3 Resources</h2><p>I have a couple more examples I didn’t do for the book:</p><p><em>Thanks to <a href=\"https://blog.nelhage.com/\">Nelson Elhage</a> for feedback.

      "content": "<pre><code>cast(type)value\ntype(value) or (type)(value)\n</code></pre><p>The reason that there are two ways to do type conversions is because one approach may feel better than the other case. If you are converting a large expression, it sometimes a lot easier to use the operator-style approach, . The call syntax is commonly used to specify a type of an expression which may be relatively short such as  or .</p><p>The general design of this took a lot of trial and error in the early days with people giving me feedback about what felt right and wrong.</p><h2>Departing From C’s Syntax</h2><p>In C, type conversions use the following syntax . The problem with this syntax is that it requires a context-sensitive grammar to determine whether the expression of  is actually a type whilst parsing. Since Odin is designed to be a context-free grammar, this syntax is not possible. There are a few reasons this is not possible:</p><ul><li>Odin’s idea that , and the parentheses are just for grouping expressions, and has no semantic meaning.</li><li>Ambiguity in contexts like <ul><li>Is that a type cast or a binary expression?</li></ul></li><li>Not necessarily that obvious when  code.</li></ul><p>As I discuss in the <a href=\"https://www.gingerbill.org/article/2026/02/21/does-syntax-matter/\">previous article</a>, sometimes it is good to keep to familiar syntax but if the parsing is awful or the underlying semantics wants the syntax to be something else, then departing from the familiar is usually the way to go. Be coherent with the language you are designing, not with some other language that is not this one.</p><p>Verbosity is actually a problem when you realize how much noise casting produces when you have to do it a lot, especially in a language like Odin with distinct typing (i.e. there is very little implicit type conversions, even between integers, meaning you need to do explicit casts).</p><p>I went through a plethora of different syntax for Odin’s type casting:</p><pre><code>x as T\nx.(T) // now used for type assertions\ncast(x, T)\ncast(T, x)\ncast(T)x // used\nT(x)     // used\n(T)(x)   // used\n// and a few more but they were just too bad to mention\n</code></pre><p>One thing to consider is the need for parentheses and how that can actually cause issues in terms of scannability and ergonomics (not typing but flow). The  like syntaxes actually required  parentheses in practice that you might realize.</p><h2>Reflecting on the Semantics of Declarations</h2><p>The flow aspect was actually interesting because I wanted the syntax to match the semantics more correctly and I found that the type must be on the left of the expression since that is how declarations work too: , so a cast would make sense that way too: . This also turned out to be a similar realization in languages like Newsqueak (where that declaration syntax originates from) and Ada. This actually ruled out a lot of the other syntax options as a result.</p><p>But before that, I experimenting with  because it  like a good idea but turned out to be a mess because of precedence rules. Either  was “tight” towards the expression meaning you then had to use a lot of parentheses to be clear what was being cast, or you had it very “loose” towards the expression which lead to the same problem.  didn’t reduce the need for parentheses in practice and only led to confusion with precedence.</p><p>I then reused  syntax for the type assertions. One because it has some familiarity from Go but also because the “type” itself is the tag in the , making it feel more like a field access using a type. The parentheses around the type in this case are necessary to remove any ambiguity syntactically and semantically.</p><h2>Optimizing for the Common Use Case</h2><p>This then lead to the possibilities of ,  and . Odin’s type system is a bit different to other languages so sometimes people don’t always realize the consequences. A good example of this is with the constant value system.  is an “untyped” number (existential typing if we are being accurate, but that confuses people so I stuck to the terminology of “untyped”), and you sometimes want this to be a specific type. Many languages “solve” this by having suffixes on literals e.g. , but this is not an option in Odin because of  typing allows anyone to create their own  form of a type&nbsp;. So if I wanted to keep that syntax short for the most common use case of casting,  was unironically the best option possible.</p><p>For when a prefix style of casting was desired, doing  wasn’t really aiding in reading any more than . I also didn’t want then to be built-in procedures because that actually means they would not be keywords but identifiers, since even  in Odin is an identifier&nbsp; and not a keyword. So if I wanted them to be a features of the languages using keywords, making them procedure calls felt very wrong. It might not be the most “robust” of justifications but that is because it is fundamentally about designing for humans and what they like, not some preconceived notion of “consistency”.</p><h2>Scannability is Very Important</h2><pre><code>const gap: f32 = @divTrunc(@as(f32, @floatFromInt(rl.getScreenWidth() - (4 * objectWidth))), 5.0);\nconst offsetX: f32 = @as(f32, @floatFromInt(index + 1)) * gap + @as(f32, @floatFromInt(index)) * @as(f32, @floatFromInt(objectWidth));\n</code></pre><p>The equivalent in Odin would be written as this:</p><pre><code>gap := math.trunc(f32(rl.GetScreenWidth() - 4 * objectWidth) / 5)\noffsetX := f32(index+1) * gap + f32(index)*f32(objectWidth)\n</code></pre><p>Note that where many of the parentheses exist in that Odin snippet, most would already exist any way without the explicit casting, and thus all you are doing is annotating the grouped expressions with a specific type.</p><h2>Design as a Human Endeavour</h2><p>All I can say is, humans are odd creatures and you’ll be surprised how they think in practice. Design is about understanding humans. How they function, mentally and physically. Their perception, psychology, sociology, physiology, ergonomics, needs, desires, etc. It’s all about being able to put yourself in other people’s shoes, more than making .</p><p>Designing a programming language is no exception to this. Syntax is how we express the semantics we want in a program. It’s the interface to the code itself. The littlest of things matter and they do add up when you have so many little things.</p>",

Suppose we’re writing some of the paging\ncode for a toy x86 architecture. We’re going to be passing around a\nlot of physical and virtual addresses, as well as indexes of pages in\nRAM, and it’s going to be easy to confuse them all.

JOS remaps all of physical memory\nstarting at a specific virtual memory address (), and so\nprovides the following macros:</p><pre><code>/* This macro takes a kernel virtual address -- an address that points above\n * KERNBASE, where the machine's maximum 256MB of physical memory is mapped --\n * and returns the corresponding physical address.  It panics if you pass it a\n * non-kernel virtual address.\n */\n#define PADDR(kva)                                          \\\n({                                                          \\\n        physaddr_t __m_kva = (physaddr_t) (kva);            \\\n        if (__m_kva &lt; KERNBASE)                                     \\\n                panic(\"PADDR called with invalid kva %08lx\", __m_kva);\\\n        __m_kva - KERNBASE;                                 \\\n})\n\n/* This macro takes a physical address and returns the corresponding kernel\n * virtual address.

For instance, a\nrelatively common operation at this point in JOS is creating a\npage-table entry, given a physical address. If you want to construct\nthe PTE by hand, you need to use  every time. But a\nbetter plan is a simple utility function:</p><pre><code> static inline pte_t make_pte(physaddr addr, int perms) {\n     return physaddr_val(addr) | perms;\n }\n</code></pre><p>In addition to losing the need to unwrap the  everywhere, we\ngain a measure of clarity and typechecking – if you remember to use\n, you’ll never accidentally try to insert a virtual address\ninto a page table.</p><p>We can add similar functions for converting between types, as well a a , used to track metadata for a physical page. As an experiment, I went and\nreimplemented JOS’s memory management primitives using these definitions, and\nonly needed to use  or  a very few times outside of the\nheader files that defined  and friends.</p><p>While the typechecking is nice, any C programmer implementing a\nmemory-management system is probably going to want to know: How much does it\ncost me? You’re creating and unpacking these singleton s everywhere –\ndoes that have a cost?</p><p>The answer, though, in almost all cases is “no” – A half-decent compiler will\noptimize the resulting code to be completely identical to the code without the\ns, in almost all cases.</p><p>Also, the in-memory representation of the  is going to be exactly the\nsame as the bare value – it’s even guaranteed to have the same alignment and\npadding constraints, so if you need to embed a  inside another struct,\nor into an array, the representation is identical to the  typedef.</p><p>On i386, parameters are passed on the stack, so that means that passing the\nstruct is identical to passing the . On amd64, as described last week,\nsmall structures are passed in registers, and so, again, the calling convention\nis identical.</p><p>Unfortunately, the i386 ABI specifies that returned s always go on the\nstack (while integers go in ), so you do pay slightly if you want to\nreturn one of these typedef’d objects.  will also break it down into a\nregister, though, so on a 64-bit machine it’s again identical.</p><p>If you’re worried, though, you can always use the preprocessor to make the\nchecks vanish for a production build:</p><pre><code>#ifdef NDEBUG\n#define NEWTYPE(tag, repr)                  \\\n    typedef repr tag;                       \\\n    static inline tag make_##tag(repr v) {  \\\n            return v;                       \\\n    }                                       \\\n    static inline repr tag##_val(tag v) {   \\\n            return v;                       \\\n    }\n#else\n/* Same definition as above */\n#endif\n</code></pre><p>Because the types have identical representations, you can safely\nserialize your structs and exchange them between code compiled with\neither version. On amd64, you can probably even call between\ncompilation units defined either way.</p><p>The next time you’re writing some subtle C code that has to deal with multiple\ntypes with the same representation, I encourage you to consider using this\ntrick.</p><p>I didn’t invent this trick, although as far as I know the  macro is my\nown invention (<em>Edited to add: A commenter points out that I’m not the first\nto <a href=\"http://notanumber.net/archives/33/newtype-in-c-a-touch-of-strong-typing-using-compound-literals\">use the  name in\nC</a>,\nalthough I think I prefer my implementation</em>).</p><p>. I learned this trick from the Linux kernel, which uses it for a\nvery similar application – distinguishing entries in different levels of the\nx86 page tables.  on amd64 includes following definitions [Taken from an\nold version, but the current version has equivalent ones):</p><pre><code>/*\n * These are used to make use of C type-checking..\n */\ntypedef struct { unsigned long pte; } pte_t;\ntypedef struct { unsigned long pmd; } pmd_t;\ntypedef struct { unsigned long pud; } pud_t;\ntypedef struct { unsigned long pgd; } pgd_t;\n</code></pre><p>I claimed above that the struct and the bare type will have the same alignment\nand padding. I don’t believe this is guaranteed by C99, but the SysV amd64 and\ni386 ABI specifications both require:</p><blockquote>\nStructures and unions assume the alignment of their most strictly aligned\ncomponent. Each member is assigned to the lowest available offset with the\nappropriate alignment. The size of any object is always a multiple of the\nobject’s alignment.\n</blockquote><p>(text quoted from the amd64 document, but the i386 one is almost identical).</p><p>And C99 requires (§6.7.2.1 para 13):</p><blockquote>\n… A pointer to a structure object, suitably converted, points to its initial\nmember (or if that member is a bit-field, then to the unit in which it resides),\nand vice versa. There may be unnamed padding within a structure object, but not\nat its beginning.\n</blockquote><p>I believe these requirements, taken together, should be enough to ensure that\nthe  and the bare type will have the same representation.</p>",

When you first start out with something new, you are looking for pioneers and early adopters that are drawn to new things:</p><blockquote><p>What an early adopter is buying [..] is some kind of . By being the first to implement this change in the industry, the early adopters expect to get a jump on the competition. – from </p></blockquote><p>But as your technology matures, you have to convince people with a lower and lower tolerance for risk:</p><blockquote><p>The early majority want to buy a  for existing operations. They are looking to minimize discontinuity with the old ways. They want evolution, not revolution. – from </p></blockquote><p>So what is  to people to try something new? The answer is seeing that others like them have succeeded.</p><p>You can see this at play in both the Amazon example and the Safety Critical Software example. Clearly seeing Rust used for network services doesn’t mean it’s ready to be used in your car’s steering column. And even within network services, seeing a group like S3 succeed with Rust may convince other groups building at-scale services to try Rust, but doesn’t necessarily persuade a team to use Rust for their next CRUD service. And frankly, it shouldn’t! They are likely to hit obstacles.</p><h2>Ubuntu is helping Rust “cross the (user-land linux) chasm”</h2><p>All of this was on my mind as I watched the keynote by Jon Seager, the VP of Engineering at Canonical, which is the company behind Ubuntu. Similar to Lars Bergstrom’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrrH2lcl9ew\">epic keynote from year’s past</a> on Rust adoption within Google, Jon laid out a pitch for why Canonical is adopting Rust that was at once  and yet .</p><p>“Visionary and yet deeply practical” is pretty much the textbook description of what we need to cross from  to . We need folks who care first and foremost about delivering the right results, but are open to new ideas that might help them do that better; folks who can stand on both sides of the chasm at once.</p><p>Jon described how Canonical focuses their own development on a small set of languages: Python, C/C++, and Go, and how they had recently brought in Rust and were using it as the language of choice for new <a href=\"https://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2025/03/10/rust-2025-intro/\">foundational efforts</a>, replacing C, C++, and (some uses of) Python.</p><h2>Ubuntu is building the bridge across the chasm</h2><p>Jon talked about how he sees it as part of Ubuntu’s job to “pay it forward” by supporting the construction of memory-safe foundational utilities. Jon meant support both in terms of finances – Canonical is sponsoring the <a href=\"https://trifectatech.org/\">Trifecta Tech Foundation’s</a> to develop <a href=\"https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/sudo-rs\">sudo-rs</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/pendulum-project/ntpd-rs\">ntpd-rs</a> and sponsoring the <a href=\"https://github.com/uutils/\">uutils org’s</a> work on <a href=\"https://uutils.github.io/coreutils/\">coreutils</a> – and in terms of reputation. Ubuntu can take on the risk of doing something new, prove that it works, and then let others benefit.</p><p>Remember how the Crossing the Chasm book described early majority people? They are “looking to minimize discontinuity with the old ways”. And what better way to do that than to have drop-in utilities that fit within their existing workflows.</p><h2>The challenge for Rust: listening to these new adopters</h2><p>With new adoption comes new perspectives. On Thursday night I was at dinner organized by Ernest Kissiedu. Jon Seager was there along with some other Rust adopters from various industries, as were a few others from the Rust Foundation and the open-source project.</p><p>Ernest asked them to give us their unvarnished takes on Rust. Jon made the provocative comment that we needed to revisit our policy around having a small standard library. He’s not the first to say something like that, it’s something we’ve been hearing for years and years – and I think he’s right! Though I don’t think the answer is just to ship a big standard library. In fact, it’s kind of a perfect lead-in to (what I hope will be) my next blog post, which is about a project I call “battery packs”.</p><h2>To grow, you have to change</h2><p>The broader point though is that shifting from targeting “pioneers” and “early adopters” to targeting “early majority” sometimes involves some uncomfortable changes:</p><blockquote><p>Transition between any two adoption segments is normally excruciatingly awkward because you must adopt new strategies just at the time you have become most comfortable with the old ones. [..] The situation can be further complicated if the high-tech company, fresh from its marketing success with visionaries, neglects to change its sales pitch. [..] <strong>The company may be saying “state-of-the-art” when the pragmatist wants to hear “industry standard”.</strong> – Crossing the Chasm (emphasis mine)</p></blockquote><p>Not everybody will remember it, but in 2016 there was a proposal called <a href=\"https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/proposal-the-rust-platform/3745\">the Rust Platform</a>. The idea was to bring in some crates and bless them as a kind of “extended standard library”. People  it. After all, they said, why not just add dependencies to your ? It’s easy enough. And to be honest, they were right – at least at the time.</p><p>I think the Rust Platform is a good example of something that was a poor fit for early adopters, who want the newest thing and don’t mind finding the best crates, but which could be a  fit for the Early Majority.</p><p>Anyway, I’m not here to argue for one thing or another in this post, but more for the concept that we have to be open to adapting our learned wisdom to new circumstances. In the past, we were trying to bootstrap Rust into the industry’s consciousness – and we have succeeded.</p><p>The task before us now is different: <strong>we need to make Rust the best option not just in terms of “what it ” but in terms of “what it ”</strong> – and sometimes those are in tension.</p><h2>Another challenge for Rust: turning adoption into investment</h2><p>Later in the dinner, the talk turned, as it often does, to money. Growing Rust adoption also comes with growing needs placed on the Rust project and its ecosystem. How can we connect the dots? This has been a big item on my mind, and I realize in writing this paragraph how many blog posts I have yet to write on the topic, but let me lay out a few interesting points that came up over this dinner and at other recent points.</p><h2>Investment can mean contribution, particularly for open-source orgs</h2><p>First, there are more ways to offer support than $$. For Canonical specifically, as they are an open-source organization through-and-through, what I would most want is to build stronger relationships between our organizations. With the Rust for Linux developers, early on Rust maintainers were prioritizing and fixing bugs on behalf of RfL devs, but more and more, RfL devs are fixing things themselves, with Rust maintainers serving as mentors. This is awesome!</p><p>Second, there’s an interesting trend about $$ that I’ve seen crop up in a few places. We often think of companies investing in the open-source dependencies that they rely upon. But there’s an entirely different source of funding, and one that might be even easier to tap, which is to look at companies that are  Rust but haven’t adopted it yet.</p><p>For those “would be” adopters, there are often  in the org who are trying to make the case for Rust adoption – these individuals are early adopters, people with a vision for how things could be, but they are trying to sell to their early majority company. And to do that, they often have a list of “table stakes” features that need to be supported; what’s more, they often have access to some budget to make these things happen.</p><p>This came up when I was talking to Alexandru Radovici, the Foundation’s Silver Member Directory, who said that many safety critical companies have money they’d like to spend to close various gaps in Rust, but they don’t know how to spend it. Jon’s investments in Trifecta Tech and the uutils org have the same character: he is looking to close the gaps that block Ubuntu from using Rust more.</p><p>Well, first of all, you should watch Jon’s talk. “Brilliant”, as the Brits have it.</p><p>But my other big thought is that this is a crucial time for Rust. We are clearly transitioning in a number of areas from visionaries and early adopters towards that pragmatic majority, and we need to be mindful that doing so may require us to change some of the way that we’ve always done things. I liked this paragraph from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossing_the_Chasm\">Crossing the Chasm</a>:</p><blockquote><p>To market successfully to pragmatists, one does not have to be one – just understand their values and work to serve them. To look more closely into these values, if the goal of visionaries is to take a quantum leap forward, the goal of pragmatists is to make a percentage improvement–incremental, measurable, predictable progress. [..] To market to pragmatists, you must be patient. You need to be conversant with the issues that dominate their particular business. You need to show up at the industry-specific conferences and trade shows they attend.</p></blockquote><p>Re-reading <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossing_the_Chasm\">Crossing the Chasm</a> as part of writing this blog post has really helped me square where Rust is – for the most part, I think we are still crossing the chasm, but we are well on our way. I think what we see is a consistent trend now where we have Rust  who fit the “visionary” profile of early adopters successfully advocating for Rust within companies that fit the pragmatist, early majority profile.</p><h3>Open source can be a great enabler to cross the chasm…</h3><p>It strikes me that open-source is just an amazing platform for doing this kind of marketing. Unlike a company, we don’t have to do everything ourselves. We have to leverage the fact that <em>open source helps those who help themselves</em> – find those visionary folks in industries that could really benefit from Rust, bring them into the Rust orbit, and then (most important!)  to adapt Rust to their needs.</p><h3>…but only if we don’t get too “middle school” about it</h3><p>This last part may sound obvious, but it’s harder than it sounds. When you’re embedded in open source, it seems like a friendly place where everyone is welcome. But the reality is that it can be a place full of cliques and “oral traditions” that “everybody knows”. People coming with an idea can get shutdown for using the wrong word. They can readily mistake the, um, “impassioned” comments from a random contributor (or perhaps just a troll…) for the official word from project leadership. It only takes one rude response to turn somebody away.</p><h3>What Rust needs most is empathy</h3><p>So what will ultimately help Rust the most to succeed? <a href=\"https://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2023/09/27/empathy-in-open-source/\">Empathy in Open Source</a>. Let’s get out there, find out where Rust can help people, and make it happen. Exciting times!</p>",

Because once you step into a “real job,” things get complicated by the minute. </p><p>At first, you might think, <em>Oh, we refine the task, put it in the next sprint, implement it, do a PR, testing… and it’ll be done in about two weeks.</em> No  this time, but it’s still fast… comparatively.</p><p>That speed reminds you of working alone (or with a small, familiar team) where ideas move almost as quickly as they appear. Code follows a thought, and suddenly it’s in the repo. </p><p>But once an idea crosses teams or touches parts you don’t own, time stretches. Days turn into weeks, weeks into months – <strong>not because the code is harder, but because communication is</strong>: unfamiliar code, processes, priorities, even languages.</p><h2></h2><p>Now I’m going to challenge you even more: <strong>how long would it take to implement a system‑wide feature</strong>? I’m not talking about some fancy, super‑complex, revolutionary refactor, just something that stretches across many components that aren’t yours. You don’t know them. You don’t even know the maintainers.</p><p>And let’s be honest, you don’t want to talk – you’re a programmer, after all, right? You think, <em>Well, a couple of sprints… maybe a few months…</em> if you’re feeling optimistic.</p><p>When you’re , the only communication is between your neurons, and that’s pretty fast, isn’t it?</p><p>The same goes when you <strong>collaborate with teammates you know well</strong>. You understand each other, don’t need to repeat much, and many things are already covered by your working agreements (whether written down or just implicit) so you barely have to mention them.</p><p>But step into a , and suddenly communication is full of obstacles. You don’t know the people, you don’t know how they work, they might speak another language – or worse, code in another language! Cooperation suddenly feels almost impossible.</p><p>It will take months, because you need to talk to the others, discuss multiple opinions, understand different perspectives and reach number of compromises. Implementation is easy-peasy.&nbsp;</p><h2></h2><p>Recently we’ve been <strong>implementing a very custom solution for a big client</strong>. We generally don’t provide custom solutions, but sometimes customers, especially big ones, manage to convince us s.&nbsp;</p><p>For most of our integrations, we rely on two key components:</p><ol><li> handles queuing, throttling, and light request processing.&nbsp;</li><li> handles more substantial model transformations and aligns our data with the external provider’s protocol.</li></ol><p>In this case, <strong>no major model manipulation was required</strong>. However, we couldn’t simply send data from A to the provider. We were aware of the configuration possibilities in Component A.</p><p>So the question arose: Should we stick to our usual A+B setup, following the well‑worn path? Or should we step outside our comfort zone, reconfigure Component A, and see if we can eliminate the need for Component B altogether?</p><p>If both were ours, the answer would be easy. But we didn’t know much about A – we didn’t even know the maintainers. </p><p>The temptation to stick with the usual path grew. Then someone had the clever idea to explore Component A using Claude Code. <em>Now we know it, we’re AI-powered! We can do anything, even talk to strangers! Bring them on!</em> we thought. This time, we did it the right way.</p><p>Jokes aside, Components A and B (and their ownership by different teams) are a classic example of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Conway’s Law</a>: the tendency to copy organizational structure into system design. <strong>The harder it is for two people or teams to collaborate, the more likely they are to build separate, siloed parts of the system </strong>(have you heard about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_silo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">silos</a>?).</p><p>Still doubt that poor communication shapes architecture? Reread the first paragraph – you probably didn’t even notice it the first time. Or check out the insightful presentation .</p><p>Still unconvinced? Here’s a knockout argument: think back to the last time you tried to sort something out at a government office. How many doors did you have to knock on? How many forms did you have to fill out? How many organizational units did you have to visit? And all for just one issue…</p><p>In a well-designed company, this doesn’t always need to be an issue. Why would a corporate lawyer need to talk to a DevOps engineer? Or an accountant to a UI tester?</p><p>But when it comes to software, the boundaries aren’t always so clear. In our example, <strong>the less we know about the people maintaining a given component, the more likely we are to misuse it and try to solve the problem on our own</strong>. That often leads first to overcomplicated architecture, and then to technical and organizational silos.</p><h2></h2><p>You’re probably thinking there must be a way around this, and you’re right. There’s an approach called the : if the organization shapes the architecture, why not design teams to build the system we want? </p><p>Sounds clever, but it’s not easy, especially in established companies. </p><blockquote><p>Management must be tech-savvy and understand the right architecture, and engineers need to grasp the target design and reasoning, since changes often involve reorganizing the codebase.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Organizational changes don’t have to impact the whole company</strong> and they can be applied on a smaller scale. Here’s a simple example from my experience. </p><p>We used to work on a product end-to-end and our area was defined by the product, not the architecture. Sounds nice, right?</p><p>However, <strong>we were backend developers, and </strong>since <strong>the product included front-end applications</strong>, we also had to develop and maintain the user-facing parts. We were never front-end experts, so we struggled a lot. We knew the product and its business specifics, but our tech gaps were a constant drag.</p><p>Eventually, we decided to hand it over to front-end experts. What a relief! Product Managers got what they wanted on time, backend developers could focus on our strengths, and frontend developers had fun fixing our mistakes.</p><p>We thought everything was sorted, until later, when we all got together in one room, despite being geographically distributed, to talk about the product. During that session, <strong>we uncovered a few weird issues we hadn’t noticed before</strong>. </p><blockquote><p>The key was sharing knowledge about how each part worked and how they worked together, which revealed bugs invisible when working in isolation. It was eye-opening, and I can’t overlook another benefit: building team spirit through shared activities and discoveries, which greatly improved our future collaboration.</p></blockquote><h2></h2><p>So here’s the thing: <strong>Conway’s Law isn’t going away</strong>. No matter how hard you try, no matter how many architecture diagrams you draw, your system will always reflect how your teams communicate… or don’t.</p><p>But before you panic, remember the government office analogy: you’re knocking on doors because that’s how the organization is structured, not because doors are inherently evil. The same applies here. Yes, your architecture will mirror organizational boundaries, but it’s on you whether you knock or find a workaround.</p><p>Every time you sit in a room with people from another team and actually listen, every time you take the time to understand how the system really works, <strong>you’re actively shaping the architecture</strong> – whether you realize it or not.</p>",

As far as I know, it's the first pure-Rust open-source modeling crate and CLI for preparing proteins and DNA/RNA. It basically takes raw experimental structures, cleans them, repairs missing heavy atoms, adds hydrogens based on pH, and builds water boxes around them.</p><p>Because it's Rust, the performance is honestly insane compared to what biologists normally use. I used rayon for the multithreading and nalgebra for the math. There are zero memory leaks and it literally never OOMs, even on massive systems. If you look at the benchmark in the second picture, the scaling is strictly O(n). It chews through a 3-million atom virus capsid in about 600 milliseconds.</p><p>Also, the best part about having no weird C-bindings is WASM.

      "content": "<p>Full Disclaimer: This is my own work.</p><p>TL;DR: We built a neural PDE solver entirely from learned coordinate warps (no fourier layers, no attention, (almost) no spatial convolutions). It easily outperforms all other models at a comparable scale on a wide selection of problems from The Well. For a visual TL;DR see the Project Page: <a href=\"https://till-m.github.io/flowers/\">link</a></p><p>My first PhD paper just appeared on ResearchGate (currently \"on hold\" at arxiv sadly...) and I'm really proud of it, so I wanted to share it here in the hopes that someone finds it as cool as I do!</p><p>The basic idea is that we want to learn a PDE solver, i.e. something that maps an input state to an output state of a PDE-governed physical system. Approaching this as a learning problem is not new, there have even been special architectures (Neural Operators, most notably Fourier Neural Operators) developed for this. Since you can frame it as an image-to-image problem, you can also use the usual stack of CV models (UNets, ViTs) for this problem. This means, that generally people use one of these three types of models (FNOs, Convolutional UNets, or ViTs). We propose a different primitive: learned spatial warps. At each location x, the model predicts a displacement and samples features from the displaced coordinate. This is the only mechanism for spatial interaction. We then do a whole lot of engineering around this, mostly borrowing ideas from transformers: multiple heads (each head is its own warp), value projections, skip connections, norms, and a U-Net scaffold for multiscale structure. (The only convolutions in the model are the strided 2×2s used to build the U-Net, all spatial mixing within a scale comes from warping.) Because the displacements are predicted pointwise, the cost is linear in grid points, which makes it efficient even in 3D. We call the resulting model Flower, and it performs extremely well (see e.g. <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/cA96D65.png\">this figure</a> or for full, raw numbers, Table 1 in the paper).</p><p>We originally set out to make an improved version of an <a href=\"https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2020/hash/5e98d23afe19a774d1b2dcbefd5103eb-Abstract.html\">older paper from our group</a> on neural network Fourier Integral Operators (FIOs). This model was extremely hard to train, but it also didn't \"look like\" a neural network. Our goal for this project was to create a light-weight FIO which we can stack as a layer and combine with non-linearities. In the end, we eliminated a lot more components, as we found them to be unnecessary, and were really only left with warping.</p><p>Why should this work for PDEs? We have some ideas, but they only cover part of the picture: Solutions to scalar conservation laws are constant along characteristics, and high-frequency waves propagate along rays, both of which are things warps can do naturally. We show more fleshed out versions of these ideas in the paper, in addition to a sketch of how stacking our basic component block becomes a Boltzmann-like equation in the limit (this is also interesting because my collaborators were able to construct a bridge between transformers and kinetic equations, yielding a Vlasov equation but not the full Boltzmann equation, see their <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25611\">paper</a> on the matter).</p><p>What's particularly satisfying is that the model actually discovers physically meaningful transport without being told to. On the shear flow dataset, the learned displacement fields align with the underlying fluid velocity, see this figure (Figure 6). In a sense, the model learns to predict what arrives at each point by looking \"upstream\", which is exactly we hoped for, based on the motivation!</p><p>We test on 16 datasets mostly from The Well (which is a collection of really cool problems, have a look at this <a href=\"https://polymathic-ai.org/the_well/assets/videos/background.mp4\">video</a>) covering a wide range of PDEs, both in 2D and 3D. We compare Flower against an FNO, a convolutional U-Net, and an attention-based model, all at roughly the same 15-20Mio parameter count. (We slightly modified The Well's benchmark protocol: larger wall-clock budget but fewer learning rates covered; see Appendix A for details.) Flower achieves the best next-step prediction on every dataset, often by a wide margin. Same story for autoregressive rollouts over 20 steps, except for one (where all models perform extremely poorly).</p><p>We also tried scaling the model up. At 150M parameters, Flower outperforms Poseidon (628M params) on compressible Euler, despite Poseidon being a foundation model pretrained on diverse PDE data. Even our tiny 17M model matches Poseidon on this dataset (until 20 autoregressive steps at least). Performance improves smoothly with size, which suggests there's headroom left. Here's <a href=\"https://pub-4782cd68fddd4ce0af349ef3d1c56b27.r2.dev/euler_multi_quadrants_periodicBC.mp4\">a video</a> showing a long roll-out.</p><p>Limits: The advantage over baselines generally shrinks on long rollouts compared to one-step prediction. I suspect part of this is that the pixel-wise nature of the VRMSE metric tends to reward blurrier predictions, but it may also be true that the model is more susceptible to noise (I need to re-run the validations with longer rollouts to find out). That said, I also observed genuine stability issues under specific conditions on very long rollouts for the Euler dataset used in the scaling study (I expect that this would be fixed by a little bit of auto-regressive fine-tuning). On other problems, e.g. shear flow we some to be more stable than other methods though.</p><p>Finally, a non-limitation: We also tried to add a failure case for our model, a time-independent PDE (which we should perform badly on, per our motivations from theory). However, the model also seems to perform well on this problem (see Table 6 and/or Figure 11) and we are not sure why.</p><p>If you read all of this, I really appreciate it (also if you just read the TL;DR and looked at the images)! If there's any feedback, be it for the model, the writing, the figures, etc. I'd also be happy to hear it :) Warps are a surprisingly rich primitive and there's a lot of design space left to explore and make these models stronger!</p><p><strong>E: My replies keep getting caught in the spam filter, sorry.</strong></p>",

      "content": "<p data-text=\"true\" font-size=\"m\" color=\"darkGrey\">Dictionary compression could completely change how applications send data over the web. It's recently gained broad support, and offers absurd real-world traffic reductions: initial testing shows YouTube JS download size for returning desktop users <a href=\"https://github.com/WICG/compression-dictionary-transport/blob/main/examples.md#youtube-desktop-player\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">shrinking up to 90%</a> (!!!) compared to existing best-practice compression, while the Google search results HTML (arguably the most optimized content on the internet) <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/blog/search-compression-dictionaries#the_results\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">shrinks nearly 50%</a>.</p><p data-text=\"true\" font-size=\"m\" color=\"darkGrey\">This works by initializing the (de)compression algorithm with a dictionary of data known in advance to both compressor &amp; decompressor, so that the compressed data can just be references to that directly (\"insert bytes 1 - 10,000 from the dictionary\") without having to include the original data at all. This is applicable in a surprising number of scenarios, because most data we send (especially on the web) isn't completely novel or unpredictable. Today's JavaScript bundle shares 99% of its content with yesterday's JavaScript bundle - if the browser already has the old one, using that as a dictionary means you can compress down to (approximately) just the differences.</p><p data-text=\"true\" font-size=\"m\" color=\"darkGrey\">This can work either using a previous response as the dictionary for the next response, or using an explicit custom dictionary; for many kinds of dynamic response, you do know large chunks of the data in advance, like all the keys in your API's JSON response, and many common values that might be included, and you can generate &amp; preload a dictionary defining exactly this to efficiently cover those. In either case, this can drastically shrink JS bundles, WebAssembly files, known-structure API responses, or many other kinds of incrementally updated &amp; diffable content - a lot of the worst offenders for bandwidth usage that have become very common on the modern web.</p><p data-text=\"true\" font-size=\"m\" color=\"darkGrey\">This is now widely usable, safe to deploy without compatibility concerns, and surprisingly easy to set up.</p><p data-text=\"true\" font-size=\"m\" color=\"darkGrey\">Here's a quick low-level demo for Node.js (v24.6+ or v22.19+) so you can play with the raw compression directly for yourself:</p><pre><div><div><pre aria-labelledby=\"code-label\" tabindex=\"0\"><code>const zlib = require('zlib');\n\n// A very basic dictionary - a previous API response\nconst dictionary = Buffer.from(\n  '{\"type\":\"event\",\"source\":\"server-2\",\"status\":\"active\"}'\n);\n\n// A new response we want to compress:\nconst dataToCompress = Buffer.from(\n  '{\"type\":\"event\",\"source\":\"server-1\",\"status\":\"inactive\"}'\n);\n\nconsole.log(\n    \"Compressed data size without dictionary\",\n    zlib.zstdCompressSync(dataToCompress).length\n);\n\nconsole.log(\n    \"Compressed data size with dictionary\",\n    zlib.zstdCompressSync(dataToCompress, { dictionary }).length\n);\n</code></pre></div></div></pre><p data-text=\"true\" font-size=\"m\" color=\"darkGrey\">Even in a toy example like this, that comes out to 65 bytes with normal Zstandard compression, vs 28 bytes when using the past response as a dictionary - .</p><p data-text=\"true\" font-size=\"m\" color=\"darkGrey\">You're welcome to <a href=\"https://httptoolkit.com/blog/dictionary-compression-performance-zstd-brotli/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog-post-dictionary-compression-is-finally-here-and-its-ridiculously-good#putting-compression-dictionaries-into-practice\" target=\"_self\">skip to the meat</a> to get this set up right now, but before we do, let's talk about how this works under the hood, the history and where this is supported today, and then pull back and look at practical setup.</p><p data-text=\"true\" font-size=\"m\" color=\"darkGrey\">We're going to focus on Zstandard here, just to keep things simple &amp; focused (and because it's great). When we do the compression from the example above, the output is:</p><pre><div><div><pre aria-labelledby=\"code-label\" tabindex=\"0\"><code>&gt; console.log(zlib.zstdCompressSync(dataToCompress, { dictionary }));\n&lt;Buffer 28 b5 2f fd 20 38 9d 00 00 58 31 69 6e 61 63 74 69 76 65 22 7d 02 00 80 93 3c 2a 20&gt;\n</code></pre></div></div></pre><p data-text=\"true\" font-size=\"m\" color=\"darkGrey\">What does this little string of hex actually mean?</p><ul><li> - Frame header description, with no dictionary id (we didn't include any dictionary name metadata) and the single-segment flag set.</li><li> - Hex 0x38 = 56 in decimal. This is the final size of the decompressed data.</li><li> - Data block header, telling us we're about to read the last (and only) block of data, and it's 19 bytes long.</li><li> - Start an 11 byte 'literals' section (raw content, which the decompression process will read from to build the output).</li><li><code data-text=\"true\" font-size=\"m\" color=\"white\">31 69 6e 61 63 74 69 76 65 22 7d</code> - in ASCII, this decodes as . <strong>This is the only actual data from the input included in the output.</strong></li><li> - The compression mode is FSE - this is how the following instructions are encoded.</li><li> - The decompression instructions. These are very complicated and tightly packed, but roughly work out as:<ul><li>Copy 33 bytes from the dictionary at offset 0: everything from the start to </li><li>Copy 1 byte from literals: </li><li>Copy 12 bytes from dictionary at offset 34: </li><li>Copy 10 bytes from literals: </li></ul></li></ul><p data-text=\"true\" font-size=\"m\" color=\"darkGrey\">(Somewhat simplified, but you get the gist)</p><p data-text=\"true\" font-size=\"m\" color=\"darkGrey\">I think there's two notable things here: firstly, compressed data comes with a disproportionally large amount of overhead in small examples like this, and secondly, very very little of the original data is included here, so despite that overhead it ends up tiny. By pulling data directly from a dictionary, the vast majority of the original content we're compressing never actually appears in the output at all.</p><p data-text=\"true\" font-size=\"m\" color=\"darkGrey\">As you might imagine, as data gets larger the proportional overhead reduces drastically, and you get asymptotically closer to just distributing a diff between your data and the dictionary. In this kind of scenario, this is effectively a mechanism to efficiently deliver deltas between data, that's already tightly optimized &amp; built-into browsers and backends you already use. Neat!</p><p data-text=\"true\" font-size=\"m\" color=\"darkGrey\">Compressing data with custom dictionaries like this isn't especially new as a concept. It's existed at least back to <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1950\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the zlib rfc</a> in 1996. However, until now use cases were relatively limited, as the DEFLATE (the compression algorithm that zlib wraps) comes with quite a few limitations like a tiny 32KB maximum sliding window, meaning you could only use a very small dictionary, and once you've processed another 32KB of data the original dictionary is out of the window &amp; unusable. Maybe OK back in 1996, but not practical for much recently.</p><p data-text=\"true\" font-size=\"m\" color=\"darkGrey\">The larger problem though was that zlib lost the HTTP encoding war. Both  (meaning gzip-wrapped deflate) and  (meaning zlib-wrapped deflate) were standardized as options for the  header in HTTP, but  was incorrectly implemented by Internet Explorer and IIS (thanks Bill) creating a compatibility mess, so everybody stuck with  which actually worked reliably everywhere (but didn't support custom dictionaries).</p><p data-text=\"true\" font-size=\"m\" color=\"darkGrey\">In 2008, Google made a shot at custom dictionaries on the web anyway, introducing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SDCH\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Shared Dictionary Compression for HTTP</a> (SDCH) powered by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCDIFF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">VCDIFF delta algorithm</a>, including it in the very first version of Chromium, and using it on their own sites. This didn't really go anywhere, with no other browser implementations and little other usage on the web. The main issues here were privacy &amp; security concerns, such as dictionary ids being used as a global cross-site tracking vector, and the uncertainty &amp; caution around new compression options at the time, as attacks like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRIME\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CRIME</a> were showing how compression could leak secrets in surprising ways. SDCH was also much more specialized, as VCDIFF is an algorithm for file deltas specifically, not a general purpose compression tool, and the lack of HTTPS usage meant middleboxes messing with headers &amp; recompressing content could cause enormous problems as well.</p><p data-text=\"true\" font-size=\"m\" color=\"darkGrey\">In addition to all those good technical reasons, the real killer for SDCH was the rise of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brotli\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brotli</a>. The Brotli RFC was published in 2016, and included a fixed dictionary specifically designed to cover many core web use cases, blowing gzip performance out of the water by compressing common web content 10-20% better (although slower to do it, so generally used for static pre-compressed content). My impression is this took the last gasps of energy away from SDCH, shifting the performance focus in Chromium fully onto Brotli instead, and nailing that coffin for good.</p><p data-text=\"true\" font-size=\"m\" color=\"darkGrey\">So now lastly, bringing us up to the current day, a new competitor emerged in the form of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zstd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zstandard</a>. Zstandard offers different state-of-the-art tradeoffs (almost as effective compression as Brotli, but much faster to do it) and with custom dictionary support from day 1, standardized in <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8478\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2018</a>. Brotli added its own official custom dictionary support in 2023 as well, and both algorithms now have standardized &amp; reasonably widespread browser support.</p><p data-text=\"true\" font-size=\"m\" color=\"darkGrey\">That means all of a sudden nowadays we have a great pair of compression algorithms (very-efficient but slow Brotli, and pretty-efficient but super-fast Zstandard) which are widely supported everywhere on the modern web, and most importantly: both support custom dictionaries.</p><p data-text=\"true\" font-size=\"m\" color=\"darkGrey\">To actually use this, you need two things:</p><ul><li>An implementation that supports custom dictionaries on both sides.</li><li>A way to coordinate both sides on the dictionary you're going to use.</li></ul><p data-text=\"true\" font-size=\"m\" color=\"darkGrey\">If you want to use this entirely within your own codebase, coordination is generally fairly simple, so you just need implementations. There's been some great progress there recently. My understanding of the current state of things is:</p><p data-text=\"true\" font-size=\"m\" color=\"darkGrey\">You do need support on the decompression side as well. If that's elsewhere within your systems, great, however if it's in a browser then for now this is only available in Chrome 130+ (and related browsers: Edge, Brave, etc). That said, both Safari &amp; Firefox have public plans (<a href=\"https://github.com/WebKit/standards-positions/issues/160\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1882979\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a> respectively) to support this as well so hopefully this will be universally supported soon.</p><p data-text=\"true\" font-size=\"m\" color=\"darkGrey\">Fortunately, you can start using it today even just for your Chrome users, because the browser proposal for this is designed around automatic negotiation of the dictionary to use. The standard for this is known as:</p><p data-text=\"true\" font-size=\"m\" color=\"darkGrey\">This is an <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9842\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">IETF standard</a> defining how clients &amp; servers should distribute and use custom dictionaries, with Zstandard and Brotli, over HTTP. In the minimal case, the key step looks like this:</p><pre><div><div><pre aria-labelledby=\"code-label\" tabindex=\"0\"><code>GET /some/content HTTP/1.1\n[...other headers...]\nAvailable-Dictionary: :abcdefabcdefabcdef:\nAccept-Encoding: br, zstd, dcb, dcz\n</code></pre></div></div></pre><ul><li>Here's the encodings I support, e.g. dictionary-compressed Brotli () and dictionary-compressed Zstandard ().</li></ul><p data-text=\"true\" font-size=\"m\" color=\"darkGrey\">Then, if the server agrees to use the requested dictionary, it might send:</p><pre><div><div><pre aria-labelledby=\"code-label\" tabindex=\"0\"><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Encoding: dcb\nVary: Accept-Encoding, Available-Dictionary\n\n...a stream of data compressed with Brotli\nusing the abcdefabcdefabcdef dictionary...\n</code></pre></div></div></pre><p data-text=\"true\" font-size=\"m\" color=\"darkGrey\">If the server doesn't have or doesn't want to use that dictionary, it can reply in any other normal way, just like today. It's entirely opt-in on both sides, so it's safe to deploy now.</p><p data-text=\"true\" font-size=\"m\" color=\"darkGrey\">Note though that the  header here is important - that is an existing standard that tells any caches en route that this response depends on the request headers listed, and so any future requests with different values there (e.g. any requests asking for a different dictionary) should not be given this response from the cache.</p><p data-text=\"true\" font-size=\"m\" color=\"darkGrey\">This leaves one open question though: how does the client get the dictionary? There's two options:</p><ol><li>The server can add a <code data-text=\"true\" font-size=\"m\" color=\"white\">Use-As-Dictionary: match=\"/file/pattern/*\"</code> to any existing response. This tells the client it should save this response as a dictionary, and offer it later for matching requests.</li></ol><p data-text=\"true\" font-size=\"m\" color=\"darkGrey\">The latter is largely relevant if you're planning to use a custom dictionary (building a custom file to maximize dictionary applicability &amp; efficiency, instead of reusing existing content). See the <a href=\"https://httptoolkit.com/blog/dictionary-compression-performance-zstd-brotli/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog-post-dictionary-compression-is-finally-here-and-its-ridiculously-good#building-your-own-custom-dictionary\" target=\"_self\">Building your own custom dictionary</a> section below for more details.</p><p data-text=\"true\" font-size=\"m\" color=\"darkGrey\">That's it! There's a few bonus things to note:</p><ul><li>You can add ids to dictionaries, in addition to just using the cache, with  in , in which case the client will send it back to you in a  header with the request.</li><li>This is all only usable on the same origin. This solves the privacy concerns with SDCH: you can't share dictionaries across origins in any way, so in terms of tracking they're only as capable as a first-party cookie.</li></ul><p data-text=\"true\" font-size=\"m\" color=\"darkGrey\">Ok, the important bit, how do you actually implement this right now?</p><p data-text=\"true\" font-size=\"m\" color=\"darkGrey\">Let's assume you're interested in the most obvious use case: JavaScript bundles. For simplicity, let's say you have one JavaScript bundle at <code data-text=\"true\" font-size=\"m\" color=\"white\">https://website.example/js/bundle.js</code> which frequently changes in small ways, and you'd like to use dictionary compression to avoid resending every single byte from scratch every time, reducing this download size by 80% or so for returning users. Here's an outline of the setup steps:</p><ol><li>Store your old bundles somewhere your backend can reach them. You need to organize them either by SHA-256 hash, or by some tightly linked id (e.g. git commit). This could be a folder on disk, an S3 bucket, or an internal cache service. You could keep the last few months, every version ever, or just the last few days depending on how often users generally return to your site.</li><li>Have your backend serve your JS bundle with <code data-text=\"true\" font-size=\"m\" color=\"white\">Use-As-Dictionary: match=\"/js/bundle.js\"</code>. Insert wildcards here () here if the name can vary (e.g. if you use a hash or version or similar in the filename). Append  if you want a distinct id for each dictionary for easier reference.</li><li>If you receive a request for this path with an  header, see if you have the matching bundle available (looking it up by hash, or use the id from the  header).</li><li>If you find a matching bundle, and you support a dictionary-compression ( or ) that the client has sent in their  header, then compress the content using this dictionary and send them the resulting tiny response.</li></ol><p data-text=\"true\" font-size=\"m\" color=\"darkGrey\">Here's a rough outline for Express &amp; Node.js, using Zstandard ():</p><pre><div><div><pre aria-labelledby=\"code-label\" tabindex=\"0\"><code>const express = require('express');\nconst fs = require('fs/promises');\nconst zlib = require('node:zlib');\nconst { promisify } = require('node:util');\n\nconst zstdCompress = promisify(zlib.zstdCompress);\nconst app = express();\n\nconst currentBundle = await fs.readFile('./dist/current/bundle.js');\n\nasync function getPreviousBundle(base64Hash) {\n  // ...Lookup past bundle version from the hash somehow...\n}\n\napp.get('/js/bundle.js', async (req, res) =&gt; {\n  const rawAvailableDict = req.get('Available-Dictionary') || '';\n  const acceptEncoding = req.get('Accept-Encoding') || '';\n\n  // Extract the base64 hash from the structured field (e.g. :hash:)\n  const hashMatch = rawAvailableDict.match(/^:(.+):$/);\n  const dictionaryHash = hashMatch ? hashMatch[1] : null;\n\n  let dictionary = null;\n  if (dictionaryHash) {\n    dictionary = await getPreviousBundle(dictionaryHash);\n  }\n\n  if (dictionary &amp;&amp; acceptEncoding.includes('dcz')) {\n    // If we have a matching dictionary, and the client supports it, use it to\n    // compress the content:\n    const compressedBundle = await zstdCompress(currentBundle, { dictionary });\n\n    res.set({\n        // Confirm that you're using the dictionary:\n        'Content-Encoding': 'dcz',\n        // Tell caches not to reuse this for requests without this dictionary:\n        'Vary': 'Available-Dictionary, Accept-Encoding',\n        // Tell the client it can use this as a dictionary as well later on:\n        'Use-As-Dictionary': 'match=\"/js/bundle.js\"'\n    });\n\n    return res.send(compressedBundle);\n  } else {\n    // No dictionary - just send as is. You probably want to do some other\n    // non-dictionary compression here depending on what the client supports.\n\n    // But still, tell the client they can use this as a dictionary in later\n    // requests for the same path:\n    res.set('Use-As-Dictionary', 'match=\"/js/bundle.js\"');\n\n    res.send(currentBundle);\n  }\n});\n</code></pre></div></div></pre><p data-text=\"true\" font-size=\"m\" color=\"darkGrey\">This should immediately reduce traffic for returning users using modern Chrome versions (<a href=\"https://caniuse.com/wf-compression-dictionary-transport\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">currently</a> about 70% of web clients) dramatically, improving loading times for users client side, and reducing any bandwidth costs or constraints on the server side.</p><p data-text=\"true\" font-size=\"m\" color=\"darkGrey\">The open question here of course is how to store &amp; access your old bundles. The easiest option is likely adding \"push the bundle to S3, keyed by hash\" to your deploy step, and then querying S3 for the hash here, with some limited caching in memory to skip the lookup entirely where possible. In time I expect this will become more standard practice with a clearly trodden path, but in the meantime that style of approach seems like a good starting point. Remember of course that the hash is a user-controlled value - don't just stick it in a URL and load the data without validation!</p><h2 data-heading=\"true\" font-size=\"m\" color=\"lightGrey\">Building your own custom dictionary</h2><p data-text=\"true\" font-size=\"m\" color=\"darkGrey\">For delta cases, where you're repeatedly delivering changing content and you really want to just transmit the changes, the easiest option is to use your past content as your dictionary as above. Simple and effective. I'm expecting CDNs will start to support this automatically in the not too distant future, since it's a quick win that they're very well positioned to enable (and charge for) to offer big performance boosts.</p><p data-text=\"true\" font-size=\"m\" color=\"darkGrey\">For other cases though, you may be able to do better than a simple delta: producing a smaller custom dictionary, that's relevant to more requests. Building the right dictionary however can be complex. Fundamentally it's just a bag of data that compressed output can reference without having to repeat it directly (\"insert data from dictionary bytes 500 - 10,000 here\"), but there are open questions about the efficient dictionary size and how to find and pack the relevant values for each use case. There's a few options for actually building this dataset:</p><ul><li>Generate a dictionary explicitly, using training functionality built into the  CLI tool with a large set of example values. This is the best option, if you have a good example dataset of values on hand. Install zstd, then run <code data-text=\"true\" font-size=\"m\" color=\"white\">zstd --train TrainingData/* -o dictionaryName</code>. Brotli doesn't appear to have an official equivalent, but you can reuse a Zstd dictionary (although there are some Zstd-specific tweaks, so it's a bit less efficient) or there are plenty of unofficial implementations floating around.</li><li>Use a known template or example value - if you have a lot of content all related to a single base value (many HTML pages sharing some core content, API responses which all have the same structure) you can use any fixed example of the output or empty template of the structure as the dictionary. The best example is one that contains as much as possible of the data of the other responses, but nothing else, and without internal duplication.</li><li>Write a custom dictionary manually. It's just raw data, no structure required, so if you know lots of values that are likely to appear in your data (e.g. JSON keys &amp; common repeated values) then you can just fill up a file with those directly and call it a day.</li></ul><p data-text=\"true\" font-size=\"m\" color=\"darkGrey\">In all cases, this is an advanced manoeuvre, and it's very important to test the results in practice and tweak and tune to optimize this. Use the general case Node example from the intro above to quickly compare the performance with &amp; without your dictionary, and test different examples of your data to confirm the dictionary really helps.</p><p data-text=\"true\" font-size=\"m\" color=\"darkGrey\">This is all early days (the RFC was officially finished in September 2025) but production rollouts and initial data are starting to appear, along with lots of published numbers from external testing of existing sites.</p><p data-text=\"true\" font-size=\"m\" color=\"darkGrey\">Digging into the <a href=\"https://httparchive.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">httparchive</a> data from February 2026, despite the early experimental status there's now real-world high-profile use including:</p><ul><li>Google.com, using a custom dictionary file covering all content on the origin ().</li><li>Pinterest, applying  to all JS on their  CDN domain.</li><li>Notion, applying  to all JS within the Notion app itself.</li><li>Speedkit, a \"website acceleration\" product used by people like Swarovski and Hyundai, generating &amp; publishing a custom dictionary file for each of their customers which covers all their assets collectively.</li><li>Connatix, a widely-used embedded video platform, in sites like the Huffington Post and El Tiempo, applying  to each JS file.</li><li>Shopify, embedded in sites across the web under  paths, using both their JS &amp; CSS files directly as dictionaries.</li><li>Doubleclick and similar 3rd-party ad services, using each of their embedded JS scripts directly as a dictionary.</li></ul><p data-text=\"true\" font-size=\"m\" color=\"darkGrey\">Most of these don't seem to have published much detailed info on how well it's working for them, except:</p><ul><li>Google, who <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/blog/search-compression-dictionaries#the_results\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">say</a> this results in a 23% drop in average HTML traffic for Chrome users on the search results page, when including first-time users as well and the overhead of downloading the custom dictionary, increasing to a 50% reduction for returning users.</li><li>Speed Kit, who are <a href=\"https://www.speedkit.com/blog/speed-kit-2025-the-shift-from-optimization-to-prediction\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reporting</a> to up 95% compression ratios through their custom trained dictionary approach on their customer sites.</li></ul><p data-text=\"true\" font-size=\"m\" color=\"darkGrey\">Beyond production deployments, there's plenty of public test results, where people have externally downloaded assets from a site over a period (e.g. two versions a week apart), and then tested the resulting dictionary compression that provides. Lots of these are listed in the original spec proposal <a href=\"https://github.com/WICG/compression-dictionary-transport/blob/main/examples.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>. Some notable examples include:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/WICG/compression-dictionary-transport/blob/main/examples.md#youtube-desktop-player\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Youtube's desktop video player's JavaScript bundle</a>: This is normally 10MB of JS, normally compressed with Brotli down to 1.8MB for transfer. Testing this with dictionary compression, assuming a user visited once and then again 2 months later, reduces that down to just 384KB (78% smaller than plain Brotli). Testing versions only a week apart reduced this even further down to 172KB (90% smaller than Brotli).</li><li>Yoni Feng ran <a href=\"https://yonifeng.com/blog/shared-compression-dictionaries/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a broad set of external tests</a> on various popular sites, and found multi-megabyte (!) reductions for WASM-based apps like Figma &amp; Google Earth, which often need to deliver large WASM bundles that frequently change in small ways, along with compression improvements of up to 95% for popular JS-heavy sites like Reddit and Excel online. On the flip side, this did show much smaller benefits for text-heavy minimal sites like Wikipedia, down to just 28% improvement over plain Brotli.</li><li>Loveholidays developed a <a href=\"https://tech.loveholidays.com/when-stroopwafels-meet-cutting-edge-tech-rum-and-compression-dictionaries-from-performance-now-eb05de8fff67\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">proof of concept</a> using the technique early on (before official browser support) showing up to 57% reductions in their JS bundle data transfer size using a custom dictionary - training a single dictionary on all past versions of their bundle, rather than using past bundles.</li></ul><p data-text=\"true\" font-size=\"m\" color=\"darkGrey\">On the flip side however: Discord <a href=\"https://discord.com/blog/how-discord-reduced-websocket-traffic-by-40-percent\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">explored</a> using custom dictionaries with Zstandard to compress websocket messages within their client, manually coordinating the dictionary configurations involved (not using the HTTP headers above, since those don't apply to WebSockets). They found reductions of up to 60% on some messages, but less than 1% on others, and that manual coordination and distribution of dictionaries added too much complexity &amp; overhead to be worthwhile - eventually rolling out plain Zstandard and tweaking their underlying protocol to communicate in deltas natively instead.</p><p data-text=\"true\" font-size=\"m\" color=\"darkGrey\">Hopefully that's all very interesting and exciting for the future of data transfer. There are a few important things to note here:</p><ul><li>In browsers, this is usable same-origin only. For tracking &amp; security protection, you can't share dictionaries between origins, and you can't load one from elsewhere. If you're hosting widely embedded content, this is still useful, but won't magically get reused across the web in the way you might want (in much the same way that loading your website's JS libraries from a public CDN is <a href=\"https://httptoolkit.com/blog/public-cdn-risks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">no longer helpful</a> either).</li><li>Caches can be tricky - be very careful that you don't accidentally cache dictionary-compressed data and use it in other cases. Recipients without access to the required dictionary won't be able to read the compressed data at all. When using the HTTP headers here, <code data-text=\"true\" font-size=\"m\" color=\"white\">Vary: Available-Dictionary</code> (meaning: only reuse this response for matching requests with the same  header) is your friend.</li><li>Although this is unlikely to make your compression worse, it does add complexity &amp; server processing time, and using your own custom dictionary has a bandwidth cost itself, since it needs to be downloaded separately. This isn't a free lunch, so you'll need to actually test the end results and compare the real bandwidth upsides to the extra complexity &amp; processing required to see if it's worthwhile for your scenario.</li><li>These compression algorithms can be  efficient - if you're decompressing data with dictionaries yourself, don't forget to add maximum size limits to the output to ensure an attacker can't send you some small data that expands to become truly enormous. That risk already exists with standard compression, but this only makes it worse.</li><li>This allows you to frequently deliver incrementally changing application bundles like JavaScript and WASM much more efficiently. That's great, but remember it only affects the amount of data on the network. It'll still unwrap to the same size at the other end, and the time to actually parse &amp; execute your enormous JavaScript bundle client-side won't change. Please please don't treat this as a license to deliver even bigger piles of JavaScript.</li></ul><p data-text=\"true\" font-size=\"m\" color=\"darkGrey\">Dictionary compression is potentially going to drive a huge change in network traffic, on the web and elsewhere. Our systems have effectively spent years sending the same bytes between the same computers over and over again, and this might just let us stop doing a very significant portion of that. It's very exciting!</p><p data-text=\"true\" font-size=\"m\" color=\"darkGrey\">Test it out for yourself and see how it works for you, and please do share any feedback or fixes back to this article (<a href=\"https://github.com/httptoolkit/httptoolkit-website/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PRs welcome</a>).</p><p data-text=\"true\" font-size=\"m\" color=\"darkGrey\">And of course, if you're working on this and you need great tools to debug and test HTTP up close, give  a go - fully open-source, one-click setup HTTP interception for browsers, Node, Docker and more, so you can see every header and byte that you're actually sending.</p>",

      "content": "<p>We’ve been searching for a memory-safe programming language to replace C++ in Ladybird for a while now. We previously explored Swift, but the C++ interop never quite got there, and platform support outside the Apple ecosystem was limited. Rust is a different story. The ecosystem is far more mature for systems programming, and many of our contributors already know the language. Going forward, we are rewriting parts of Ladybird in Rust.</p><p>When we originally evaluated Rust back in 2024, we rejected it because it’s not great at C++ style OOP. The web platform object model inherits a lot of 1990s OOP flavor, with garbage collection, deep inheritance hierarchies, and so on. Rust’s ownership model is not a natural fit for that.</p><p>But after another year of treading water, it’s time to make the pragmatic choice. Rust has the ecosystem and the safety guarantees we need. Both Firefox and Chromium have already begun introducing Rust into their codebases, and we think it’s the right choice for Ladybird too.</p><p>Our first target was , Ladybird’s JavaScript engine. The lexer, parser, AST, and bytecode generator are relatively self-contained and have extensive test coverage through <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/test262\">test262</a>, which made them a natural starting point.</p><p>I used <a href=\"https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code\">Claude Code</a> and <a href=\"https://openai.com/codex/\">Codex</a> for the translation. This was human-directed, not autonomous code generation. I decided what to port, in what order, and what the Rust code should look like. It was hundreds of small prompts, steering the agents where things needed to go. After the initial translation, I ran multiple passes of adversarial review, asking different models to analyze the code for mistakes and bad patterns.</p><p>The requirement from the start was byte-for-byte identical output from both pipelines. The result was about 25,000 lines of Rust, and the entire port took about two weeks. The same work would have taken me multiple months to do by hand. We’ve verified that every AST produced by the Rust parser is identical to the C++ one, and all bytecode generated by the Rust compiler is identical to the C++ compiler’s output. Zero regressions across the board:</p><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Ladybird regression tests</td></tr></tbody></table><p>No performance regressions on any of the JS benchmarks we track either.</p><p>Beyond the test suites, I’ve done extensive testing by browsing the web in a lockstep mode where both the C++ and Rust pipelines run simultaneously, verifying that output is identical for every piece of JavaScript that flows through them.</p><p>If you look at <a href=\"https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/8104\">the code</a>, you’ll notice it has a strong “translated from C++” vibe. That’s because it  translated from C++. The top priority for this first pass is compatibility with our C++ pipeline. The Rust code intentionally mimics things like the C++ register allocation patterns so that the two compilers produce identical bytecode. Correctness is a close second. We know the result isn’t idiomatic Rust, and there’s a lot that can be simplified once we’re comfortable retiring the C++ pipeline. That cleanup will come in time.</p><p>This is not becoming the main focus of the project. We will continue developing the engine in C++, and porting subsystems to Rust will be a sidetrack that runs for a long time. New Rust code will coexist with existing C++ through well-defined interop boundaries.</p><p>We want to be deliberate about which parts get ported and in what order, so the porting effort is managed by the core team. Please coordinate with us before starting any porting work so nobody wastes their time on something we can’t merge.</p><p>I know this will be a controversial move, but I believe it’s the right decision for Ladybird’s future. :^)</p>",

      "content": "<p>I once worked at an agency that took on an Android TV project.</p><p>At the time, it seemed like a fairly reasonable task. We already had a solid Android starter. The assumption was that we could reuse most of it, rely on Leanback for the TV specifics, and let design adjust the user experience as the product evolved.</p><p>That assumption turned out to be wrong.</p><p>Within the first few weeks, the project started to feel unstable in a way that was hard to explain at first. We would fix one issue, ship a build, and then immediately discover new problems that made the app feel broken again.</p><p>Every week brought a different kind of failure. Focus would get lost and menus would open seemingly at random. Text that looked fine in mockups was unreadable from the couch. Screens were overloaded with text and interactive elements. Startup and loading times felt unacceptably slow.</p><p>At first, it was tempting to treat these as unrelated bugs. Each one looked fixable in isolation.</p><p>They were not isolated at all.</p><p>They were all symptoms of the same underlying mistake. We were building a TV app while thinking like mobile developers.</p><p>A TV app is not a mobile app on a larger screen. The way users interact with it is different. The environment it lives in is different. The hardware is different. Even the development workflow has different failure modes.</p><p>Once we understood that, the problems stopped feeling mysterious and started forming a pattern.</p><h2>UI and UX: Why Mobile Patterns Collapse on TV</h2><p>If there is one thing that determines whether a TV app succeeds or fails, it is navigation clarity.</p><p>Mobile apps tolerate complexity because touch is a very high bandwidth input method. Users can tap anywhere on the screen, scroll freely, recover instantly from mistakes, and generally move through interfaces with little friction.</p><p>On TV, input works very differently. Users navigate with a remote. Movement is discrete. Every interaction requires intention. Each action is one step in a sequence.</p><p>That difference changes everything.</p><p>A design that looks clean on a laptop or phone can become unreadable when viewed from several meters away. Font sizes that feel modern on mobile often end up too small on TV. Thin font weights lose contrast. Subtle visual hierarchies disappear. Dense layouts turn into visual noise.</p><p>Designing for TV is not about scaling things up. It is about redesigning for distance.</p><p>On mobile, focus is mostly implicit. On TV, focus is the primary way users understand where they are and what they can do next.</p><p>That is why focus related bugs feel so strange. You press right and focus jumps somewhere unexpected. You press down and a menu opens even though you did not intend to open it. You press back and end up in a different part of the app than you expected. Sometimes focus disappears entirely and nothing responds.</p><p>When focus is not explicitly designed, it becomes emergent behavior. Emergent behavior is what users experience as randomness.</p><p>A good TV app does not simply render components. It defines a navigation system and treats focus as a first class concept.</p><h3>Density works against you on TV</h3><p>Mobile interfaces often benefit from density. Users are accustomed to scanning quickly and making fast decisions. Touch makes choice cheap.</p><p>On TV, density has the opposite effect. Too much text makes scanning difficult at a distance. Too many interactive elements slow navigation. Too many focusable components turn simple flows into long and frustrating journeys.</p><p>What saves time on mobile creates friction on TV.</p><p>This is why simply reusing mobile screens fails, even when the app technically runs.</p><h2>Hardware Reality: TVs Are Weak Devices</h2><p>Another common blind spot is hardware capability.</p><p>In practice, most TV devices are significantly less powerful than modern phones. Startup is slower. Rendering is less forgiving. Memory pressure appears sooner and more often.</p><p>This explains the feeling we had early in the project. Loading felt slow. Startup felt heavy. Everything felt slightly behind the user.</p><p>The reason is simple. Many assumptions that mobile apps make about performance do not hold on TV.</p><h3>Cold start matters more than expected</h3><p>On mobile, platforms and hardware have been heavily optimized for fast app switching and quick returns. Users are used to apps resuming almost instantly.</p><p>On TV, the context is different. Users are leaning back. When they open an app, they expect it to be ready. If they see a blank screen or a spinner that lingers, they do not interpret that as work being done. They interpret it as slowness.</p><p>When a TV app performs poorly, the cause is rarely a single inefficient function. More often, it is structural.</p><p>Too much work happens on the UI thread. Too many heavy views are rendered during the first frame. Images are loaded and decoded without regard for memory constraints. Animations and overdraw accumulate. State changes trigger unnecessary re renders. Network requests block the initial experience.</p><p>Because TV hardware is weaker, these costs become visible very quickly.</p><p>TV apps reward simple, predictable rendering paths and punish complexity that has not been validated on real devices.</p><h2>Developer Experience: Why TV Apps Feel Harder to Build</h2><p>Developing TV apps often feels harder in a very specific way. Problems are less deterministic. Feedback loops are slower. Bugs can look like user error until you reproduce them with a remote in your hand.</p><h3>Remote input changes how you think</h3><p>Touch is direct manipulation. Remote input is navigation.</p><p>That means you are not just building screens. You are defining how focus moves between states and how users travel through the interface.</p><p>Small mistakes compound quickly. One extra focusable element can add dozens of unnecessary button presses. One missing focus boundary can send users into an unexpected part of the app. One incorrect back behavior can trap them in a loop.</p><p>On mobile, gestures often mask these issues. On TV, navigation must be deliberate and consistent.</p><h3>Focus bugs depend on state</h3><p>Many TV bugs are not pure rendering issues. They are interaction problems that only appear under certain conditions.</p><p>They might surface when focus moves in a specific sequence, when a list updates while the user is navigating, when an overlay appears mid animation, when the system UI interrupts the app, or when the app resumes without restoring focus correctly.</p><p>This is why TV apps often look stable in demos but break down in real usage.</p><p>Emulators are useful, but for TV apps they provide a false sense of confidence.</p><p>Real devices differ in performance, input handling, operating system behavior, and memory management. An app that feels fine on one device can feel sluggish or unreliable on another.</p><p>This is why testing on real TV hardware is not optional.</p><p>Unlike mobile development, where a relatively small set of devices covers most real world behavior, the TV ecosystem is highly fragmented. Without regular testing on actual devices, teams inevitably ship regressions they cannot see during development.</p><p>Beyond development, TV platforms introduce friction in delivery and maintenance.</p><p>Each platform has its own quirks, quality expectations, and submission processes. Many issues only appear on hardware, which means testing is not just about correctness. It is about confidence that the app behaves consistently across devices.</p><p>Teams that underestimate this rarely fail to build the app. They fail to maintain it without slowing down every release.</p><h3>Frameworks matter differently on TV</h3><p>Framework debates often focus on native feel or animation performance. On TV, the priorities shift.</p><p>What matters more is whether focus and navigation are treated as first class concerns, whether tooling supports remote based testing, whether UI behavior is predictable across devices, and whether iteration is possible when bugs only appear on hardware.</p><p>Some stacks make it easier to reason about navigation. Others make it easy to accidentally build a touch oriented interface that happens to run on TV.</p><p>The cost of that choice shows up in engineering time rather than ideology.</p><p>Many of the hardest problems in TV development do not live in the code itself. They live in assumptions about how that code will behave once it reaches real hardware.</p><h2>When Should You Build a TV App?</h2><p>TV apps often feel attractive because they look like a natural expansion to a new platform. The more important question is whether TV is actually a good fit for the product.</p><p>TV apps make sense when the primary value lies in consumption, discovery, simple navigation, or shared experiences.</p><p>Streaming platforms, content catalogs, educational libraries designed for passive viewing, and companion experiences with minimal input tend to align well with the medium. In these cases, TV constraints support the product rather than fight it.</p><p>TV apps struggle when products require heavy text input, complex workflows, high frequency actions, speed, precision, or dense analytical interfaces.</p><p>It is possible to force these experiences onto TV, but doing so usually results in usability issues, increased development complexity, higher support costs, and user churn.</p><p>A good TV app embraces what TV is good at instead of resisting its limitations.</p><h2>A Mental Model for Decision Makers</h2><p>For anyone evaluating whether to build a TV app, a simple mental model helps.</p><p>Mobile apps optimize for interaction and speed.\nTV apps optimize for navigation and clarity.</p><p>Mobile is personal.\nTV is shared.</p><p>Mobile input is high bandwidth.\nTV input is constrained.</p><p>Mobile users tolerate complexity because interaction is cheap.\nTV users punish complexity because navigation is expensive.</p><p>The most common failure mode follows directly from ignoring these differences.</p><p>Teams build TV apps as if they were mobile apps and then spend the entire project reacting to problems that were inevitable from the start.</p><p>Most failed TV apps do not fail because of poor engineering. They fail because teams underestimate how different TV really is.</p><p>When TV is treated as its own platform from day one, the experience becomes predictable rather than painful. And once it becomes predictable, it becomes possible to build something people actually enjoy using from the couch.</p><p>The core lesson behind all of this is simple.</p><p>Most problems teams run into when building TV apps are not caused by bad code or lack of effort. They come from treating TV as a variant of mobile, rather than as a platform with its own rules.</p><p>TV changes how users interact, how interfaces need to be designed, how performance is perceived, and how applications must be tested and maintained. Navigation replaces direct interaction. Focus replaces touch. Hardware constraints surface architectural decisions much earlier. Development slows down when assumptions made on mobile no longer hold on real devices.</p><p>None of these differences are subtle once you encounter them, but many teams only discover them mid project, after the architecture and UX direction are already locked in.</p><p>Building a successful TV app is less about mastering a specific framework or SDK and more about respecting the medium from the start. When the product, design, and engineering decisions align with how TV is actually used, the platform stops feeling hostile and starts feeling predictable.</p><p>That is the difference between constantly fighting fires and building an app that feels calm, intentional, and natural to use from the couch.</p><p>If you have found this useful, make sure to like and follow for more content like this.

Note the definition of “Downtime Period”: the error rate must exceed 10%, and only minutes with 100+ requests count.</figcaption></figure><h3>When the service “works”… but nothing actually works</h3><p>Your API returns errors in bursts. Your users see blank pages. But on the provider’s side? Everything’s green. The service is “available.”</p><p>Because there’s an entire category of errors that the provider doesn’t consider as unavailability. These are errors “caused by you,” even though in practice they’re often linked to platform limitations.</p><p><strong>Throttling (rate limiting)</strong>: this is the most common case under load. Every cloud service imposes : a maximum number of requests per second, per minute, per account. When you exceed that quota, the service responds with . It doesn’t crash, it <strong>deliberately slows you down</strong>. It’s like a toll gate closing lanes during rush hour: the highway “works,” you just can’t access it anymore.</p><div data-astro-cid-7uyzto5v=\"\"><div data-astro-cid-7uyzto5v=\"\"><div data-astro-cid-7uyzto5v=\"\"><p>Your email sending API (Mailjet, SendGrid…) allows 100 calls/second.

Factor this risk into your budget and architecture, not into your refund hopes.</p></div></div></div><h2>Error budget: steering instead of suffering</h2><p>The concept comes from the Google SRE Book and changes how reliability is managed.</p><p>Until now, the SLO is a passive number: “we aim for 99.95%.” The error budget makes it . The principle: if your SLO is 99.95%, you  0.05% of unavailability. That 0.05% is your budget. Over a 30-day month, that’s .</p><p>Every incident, every failed deployment, every degraded latency  this budget. When there’s budget left, you have room to innovate. When it runs out, that’s the signal to consolidate.</p><p>The formula is straightforward:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Error budget = (1 - SLO) x measurement period</strong></p></blockquote><div data-astro-cid-zg6ajjo3=\"\"><table data-astro-cid-zg6ajjo3=\"\"><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody></tbody></table></div><div data-astro-cid-7uyzto5v=\"\"><div data-astro-cid-7uyzto5v=\"\"><div data-astro-cid-7uyzto5v=\"\"><p>The more ambitious your SLO, the tighter your budget. This is a conscious tradeoff: a 99.99% SLO leaves you less than 5 minutes of margin per month. Every deployment becomes a calculated risk.</p></div></div></div><p>The real value of the error budget is that it turns an abstract number into a  for teams:</p><div data-astro-cid-so7tgn4m=\"\"><ul><li> (&gt; 50% remaining): ship, experiment, take calculated risks</li></ul></div><div data-astro-cid-so7tgn4m=\"\"><ul><li> (&lt; 30% remaining): freeze non-critical deployments, focus on stability</li></ul></div><div data-astro-cid-so7tgn4m=\"\"><ul><li>: mandatory post-mortem, total deployment freeze, action plan before resuming</li></ul></div><div data-astro-cid-7uyzto5v=\"\"><div data-astro-cid-7uyzto5v=\"\"><div data-astro-cid-7uyzto5v=\"\"><p>Your SLO is 99.95%, giving you 22 minutes of budget this month. On Monday, a network incident eats 8 minutes. On Wednesday, a failed deployment adds 10 more. You have 4 minutes of margin left. The cart redesign is ready, but deploying it now risks draining the budget. Decision: wait until next month.</p><p>Without an error budget, this decision would be an opinion battle between the PM who wants to ship and the ops engineer who wants stability. With the budget, it’s a fact: 4 minutes left, don’t take the risk.</p></div></div></div><h3>How to manage it day-to-day</h3><p>The error budget isn’t tracked in a spreadsheet. SRE teams rely on monitoring tools that calculate the  (how fast the budget is being consumed) in real time:</p><div data-astro-cid-so7tgn4m=\"\"><ul><li>: SLO definitions with automatic burn rate alerts</li><li>: open source stack, ideal for getting started without a tooling budget</li><li>: predictive alerts that warn  the budget runs out</li></ul></div><p>The burn rate answers a simple question: “at this pace, when will the budget run out?” If the answer is “in 3 days” and you’re only on the 10th of the month, there’s a structural problem to address, not just an incident to resolve.</p><div data-astro-cid-7uyzto5v=\"\"><div data-astro-cid-7uyzto5v=\"\"><div data-astro-cid-7uyzto5v=\"\"><p>If you don’t have tooling yet, start with Prometheus + Grafana: it’s free and covers 80% of needs. What matters isn’t the tool, it’s making the budget visible to the entire team.</p></div></div></div><p>Ultimately, the error budget transforms the SLO from a passive number into a <strong>daily decision-making tool</strong> that aligns product and ops teams on a shared fact, not a gut feeling.</p><p>If you’re the one who needs to commit, flip the problem:</p><div data-astro-cid-so7tgn4m=\"\"><ul><li>: all the services your product depends on</li><li><strong>Calculate your composite SLA</strong>: multiply the SLAs of each component</li><li>: your chain gives 99.7%?

These are the same levers your providers use</li></ul></div><div data-astro-cid-7uyzto5v=\"\"><div data-astro-cid-7uyzto5v=\"\"><div data-astro-cid-7uyzto5v=\"\"><p>The SLA you promise can never be better than your weakest link, unless you invest in redundancy to strengthen it.</p></div></div></div><h2>Simulate it yourself: how much will you get refunded?</h2><p>Now that you know the exclusions, calculation formulas, and composite SLA pitfalls, test with your own numbers. Adjust the outage duration and your cloud bill to see how much each provider would refund, and compare with your actual losses.</p><div data-astro-cid-psrxbawm=\"\"><h3 data-astro-cid-psrxbawm=\"\">How much does your SLA refund?</h3></div><p>An SLA is neither comprehensive insurance nor a marketing claim to take at face value.

(role/context) - What do you need? (specific task) - Constraints (what's in/out of scope) - Output format (exactly how you want it delivered)</p><p><strong>Why \"creative\" prompts fail in enterprise:</strong></p><ol><li><p> : If a clever prompt works for me but my colleague can't modify it for their use case, it's useless at scale.</p></li><li><p> : When a structured prompt gives bad output, you can identify which section needs fixing. When a creative prompt fails, you're starting from scratch.</p></li><li><p><strong>They don't transfer across models</strong> : A prompt that exploits a specific model's quirks breaks when you switch from GPT-4.1 to Claude to Copilot. Structure-based prompts transfer cleanly.</p></li><li><p> : IT and compliance teams need to review and approve prompt templates. \"Just ask it creatively\" isn't a policy.</p></li></ol><p><strong>The boring truth about prompt engineering:</strong></p><p>It's not engineering and it's not an art. It's technical writing. The same skills that make good documentation make good prompts: clarity, specificity, structure, and knowing your audience.</p><p>The best prompt engineers I've met aren't AI researchers they're former technical writers, business analysts, and process designers.</p><p>Am I wrong to push for standardization over creativity?</p>",

ONE of the concerns of the third is that I didn't upload the results to an online benchmark in my field, I made the petition to the platform and I informed about this being done in the rebuttal.</p><p>They lowered to 4/2/2. The first said that yes he liked the method but the online submission should have been done. The second said he was not convinced on the response (although I addressed carefully his concerns!). And the third stayed. In my head I can't process that two of them, who liked the method, lowered! (I was expecting reviewer 2 to raise the score, maybe that wouldn't happen but lowering it??). The AC mentioned the benchmark issue, may he have influenced the rest of reviewers? Do you find it plausible?</p><p>Edit: Context: the benchmark matter was only mentioned by the third...</p>",
