Use any language or AI framework, and deliver agents faster to production.</p></p><p>Star ⭐️ the repo if you found Plano useful — new releases and updates land here first.</p></div><p>Building agentic demos is easy. Shipping agentic applications safely, reliably, and repeatably to production is hard. After the thrill of a quick hack, you end up building the “hidden middleware” to reach production: routing logic to reach the right agent, guardrail hooks for safety and moderation, evaluation and observability glue for continuous learning, and model/provider quirks scattered across frameworks and application code.</p><p>Plano solves this by moving core delivery concerns into a unified, out-of-process dataplane.</p><p>Plano pulls rote plumbing out of your framework so you can stay focused on what matters most: the core product logic of your agentic applications. Plano is backed by <a href=\"https://planoai.dev/research\">industry-leading LLM research</a> and built on <a href=\"https://envoyproxy.io\">Envoy</a> by its core contributors, who built critical infrastructure at scale for modern worklaods.</p><p> to learn how you can use Plano to improve the speed, safety and obervability of your agentic applications.</p><blockquote><p>[!IMPORTANT] Plano and the Arch family of LLMs (like Plano-Orchestrator-4B, Arch-Router, etc) are hosted free of charge in the US-central region to give you a great first-run developer experience of Plano. To scale and run in production, you can either run these LLMs locally or contact us on <a href=\"https://discord.gg/pGZf2gcwEc\">Discord</a> for API keys.</p></blockquote><h2>Build Agentic Apps with Plano</h2><p>Plano handles <strong>orchestration, model management, and observability</strong> as modular building blocks - letting you configure only what you need (edge proxying for agentic orchestration and guardrails, or LLM routing from your services, or both together) to fit cleanly into existing architectures. Below is a simple multi-agent travel agent built with Plano that showcases all three core capabilities</p><h3>1. Define Your Agents in YAML</h3><pre><code># config.yaml\nversion: v0.3.0\n\n# What you declare: Agent URLs and natural language descriptions\n# What you don't write: Intent classifiers, routing logic, model fallbacks, provider adapters, or tracing instrumentation\n\nagents:\n  - id: weather_agent\n    url: http://localhost:10510\n  - id: flight_agent\n    url: http://localhost:10520\n\nmodel_providers:\n  - model: openai/gpt-4o\n    access_key: $OPENAI_API_KEY\n    default: true\n  - model: anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet\n    access_key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\n\nlisteners:\n  - type: agent\n    name: travel_assistant\n    port: 8001\n    router: plano_orchestrator_v1  # Powered by our 4B-parameter routing model. You can change this to different models\n    agents:\n      - id: weather_agent\n        description: |\n          Gets real-time weather and forecasts for any city worldwide.\n          Handles: \"What's the weather in Paris?\", \"Will it rain in Tokyo?\"\n\n      - id: flight_agent\n        description: |\n          Searches flights between airports with live status and schedules.\n          Handles: \"Flights from NYC to LA\", \"Show me flights to Seattle\"\n\ntracing:\n  random_sampling: 100  # Auto-capture traces for evaluation\n</code></pre><h3>2. Write Simple Agent Code</h3><p>Your agents are just HTTP servers that implement the OpenAI-compatible chat completions endpoint. Use any language or framework:</p><pre><code># weather_agent.py\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI, Request\nfrom fastapi.responses import StreamingResponse\nfrom openai import AsyncOpenAI\n\napp = FastAPI()\n\n# Point to Plano's LLM gateway - it handles model routing for you\nllm = AsyncOpenAI(base_url=\"http://localhost:12001/v1\", api_key=\"EMPTY\")\n\n@app.post(\"/v1/chat/completions\")\nasync def chat(request: Request):\n    body = await request.json()\n    messages = body.get(\"messages\", [])\n    days = 7\n\n    # Your agent logic: fetch data, call APIs, run tools\n    # See demos/agent_orchestration/travel_agents/ for the full implementation\n    weather_data = await get_weather_data(request, messages, days)\n\n    # Stream the response back through Plano\n    async def generate():\n        stream = await llm.chat.completions.create(\n            model=\"openai/gpt-4o\",\n            messages=[{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": f\"Weather: {weather_data}\"}, *messages],\n            stream=True\n        )\n        async for chunk in stream:\n            yield f\"data: {chunk.model_dump_json()}\\n\\n\"\n\n    return StreamingResponse(generate(), media_type=\"text/event-stream\")\n</code></pre><h3>3. Start Plano &amp; Query Your Agents</h3><pre><code># Start Plano\nplanoai up config.yaml\n...\n\n# Query - Plano intelligently routes to both agents in a single conversation\ncurl http://localhost:8001/v1/chat/completions \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"model\": \"gpt-4o\",\n    \"messages\": [\n      {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"I want to travel from NYC to Paris next week. What is the weather like there, and can you find me some flights?\"}\n    ]\n  }'\n# → Plano routes to weather_agent for Paris weather ✓\n# → Then routes to flight_agent for NYC → Paris flights ✓\n# → Returns a complete travel plan with both weather info and flight options\n</code></pre><h3>4. Get Observability and Model Agility for Free</h3><p>Every request is traced end-to-end with OpenTelemetry - no instrumentation code needed.</p><h3>What You Didn't Have to Build</h3><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Write intent classifier + routing logic</td><td>Declare agent descriptions in YAML</td></tr><tr><td>Handle each provider's API quirks</td><td>Unified LLM APIs with state management</td></tr><tr><td>Instrument every service with OTEL</td><td>Automatic end-to-end traces and logs</td></tr><tr><td>Build pipeline to capture/export spans</td><td>Zero-code agentic signals</td></tr><tr><td>Update routing code, test, redeploy</td></tr></tbody></table><p> Plano uses purpose-built, lightweight LLMs (like our 4B-parameter orchestrator) instead of heavyweight frameworks or GPT-4 for routing - giving you production-grade routing at a fraction of the cost and latency.</p><p>To get in touch with us, please join our <a href=\"https://discord.gg/pGZf2gcwEc\">discord server</a>.

Since launch, developers have pushed it far beyond research: building data pipelines, generating slide decks, spinning up dashboards, automating content workflows. Things we never anticipated.</p><p>That told us something important: DeerFlow wasn't just a research tool. It was a  — a runtime that gives agents the infrastructure to actually get work done.</p><p>So we rebuilt it from scratch.</p><p>DeerFlow 2.0 is no longer a framework you wire together. It's a super agent harness — batteries included, fully extensible. Built on LangGraph and LangChain, it ships with everything an agent needs out of the box: a filesystem, memory, skills, sandboxed execution, and the ability to plan and spawn sub-agents for complex, multi-step tasks.</p><p>Use it as-is. Or tear it apart and make it yours.</p><p>Skills are what make DeerFlow do .</p><p>A standard Agent Skill is a structured capability module — a Markdown file that defines a workflow, best practices, and references to supporting resources. DeerFlow ships with built-in skills for research, report generation, slide creation, web pages, image and video generation, and more. But the real power is extensibility: add your own skills, replace the built-in ones, or combine them into compound workflows.</p><p>Skills are loaded progressively — only when the task needs them, not all at once. This keeps the context window lean and makes DeerFlow work well even with token-sensitive models.</p><p>Tools follow the same philosophy. DeerFlow comes with a core toolset — web search, web fetch, file operations, bash execution — and supports custom tools via MCP servers and Python functions. Swap anything. Add anything.</p><pre><code># Paths inside the sandbox container\n/mnt/skills/public\n├── research/SKILL.md\n├── report-generation/SKILL.md\n├── slide-creation/SKILL.md\n├── web-page/SKILL.md\n└── image-generation/SKILL.md\n\n/mnt/skills/custom\n└── your-custom-skill/SKILL.md      ← yours\n</code></pre><p>Complex tasks rarely fit in a single pass. DeerFlow decomposes them.</p><p>The lead agent can spawn sub-agents on the fly — each with its own scoped context, tools, and termination conditions. Sub-agents run in parallel when possible, report back structured results, and the lead agent synthesizes everything into a coherent output.</p><p>This is how DeerFlow handles tasks that take minutes to hours: a research task might fan out into a dozen sub-agents, each exploring a different angle, then converge into a single report — or a website — or a slide deck with generated visuals. One harness, many hands.</p><p>DeerFlow doesn't just  about doing things. It has its own computer.</p><p>Each task runs inside an isolated Docker container with a full filesystem — skills, workspace, uploads, outputs. The agent reads, writes, and edits files. It executes bash commands and codes. It views images. All sandboxed, all auditable, zero contamination between sessions.</p><p>This is the difference between a chatbot with tool access and an agent with an actual execution environment.</p><pre><code># Paths inside the sandbox container\n/mnt/user-data/\n├── uploads/          ← your files\n├── workspace/        ← agents' working directory\n└── outputs/          ← final deliverables\n</code></pre><p><strong>Isolated Sub-Agent Context</strong>: Each sub-agent runs in its own isolated context. This means that the sub-agent will not be able to see the context of the main agent or other sub-agents. This is important to ensure that the sub-agent is able to focus on the task at hand and not be distracted by the context of the main agent or other sub-agents.</p><p>: Within a session, DeerFlow manages context aggressively — summarizing completed sub-tasks, offloading intermediate results to the filesystem, compressing what's no longer immediately relevant. This lets it stay sharp across long, multi-step tasks without blowing the context window.</p><p>Most agents forget everything the moment a conversation ends. DeerFlow remembers.</p><p>Across sessions, DeerFlow builds a persistent memory of your profile, preferences, and accumulated knowledge. The more you use it, the better it knows you — your writing style, your technical stack, your recurring workflows. Memory is stored locally and stays under your control.</p><p>DeerFlow is model-agnostic — it works with any LLM that implements the OpenAI-compatible API. That said, it performs best with models that support:</p><ul><li> (100k+ tokens) for deep research and multi-step tasks</li><li> for adaptive planning and complex decomposition</li><li> for image understanding and video comprehension</li><li> for reliable function calling and structured outputs</li></ul><p>We welcome contributions!

As soon as it sees that you're building something, it  just jump into trying to write code. Instead, it steps back and asks you what you're really trying to do.</p><p>Once it's teased a spec out of the conversation, it shows it to you in chunks short enough to actually read and digest.</p><p>After you've signed off on the design, your agent puts together an implementation plan that's clear enough for an enthusiastic junior engineer with poor taste, no judgement, no project context, and an aversion to testing to follow. It emphasizes true red/green TDD, YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It), and DRY.</p><p>Next up, once you say \"go\", it launches a <em>subagent-driven-development</em> process, having agents work through each engineering task, inspecting and reviewing their work, and continuing forward. It's not uncommon for Claude to be able to work autonomously for a couple hours at a time without deviating from the plan you put together.</p><p>There's a bunch more to it, but that's the core of the system. And because the skills trigger automatically, you don't need to do anything special.

We provide a <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion/main/#reference-sampling-script\">reference script for sampling</a>, but there also exists a <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion/main/#diffusers-integration\">diffusers integration</a>, which we expect to see more active community development.</p><h4>Reference Sampling Script</h4><p>We provide a reference sampling script, which incorporates</p><pre><code>mkdir -p models/ldm/stable-diffusion-v1/\nln -s &lt;path/to/model.ckpt&gt; models/ldm/stable-diffusion-v1/model.ckpt \n</code></pre><pre><code>python scripts/txt2img.py --prompt \"a photograph of an astronaut riding a horse\" --plms \n</code></pre><p>By default, this uses a guidance scale of , <a href=\"https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion/pull/51\">Katherine Crowson's implementation</a> of the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09778\">PLMS</a> sampler, and renders images of size 512x512 (which it was trained on) in 50 steps. All supported arguments are listed below (type <code>python scripts/txt2img.py --help</code>).</p><pre></pre><p>Note: The inference config for all v1 versions is designed to be used with EMA-only checkpoints. For this reason  is set in the configuration, otherwise the code will try to switch from non-EMA to EMA weights. If you want to examine the effect of EMA vs no EMA, we provide \"full\" checkpoints which contain both types of weights. For these,  will load and use the non-EMA weights.</p><p>A simple way to download and sample Stable Diffusion is by using the <a href=\"https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main#new--stable-diffusion-is-now-fully-compatible-with-diffusers\">diffusers library</a>:</p><pre><code># make sure you're logged in with `huggingface-cli login`\nfrom torch import autocast\nfrom diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline\n\npipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(\n\t\"CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4\", \n\tuse_auth_token=True\n).to(\"cuda\")\n\nprompt = \"a photo of an astronaut riding a horse on mars\"\nwith autocast(\"cuda\"):\n    image = pipe(prompt)[\"sample\"][0]  \n    \nimage.save(\"astronaut_rides_horse.png\")\n</code></pre><h3>Image Modification with Stable Diffusion</h3><p>By using a diffusion-denoising mechanism as first proposed by <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01073\">SDEdit</a>, the model can be used for different tasks such as text-guided image-to-image translation and upscaling. Similar to the txt2img sampling script, we provide a script to perform image modification with Stable Diffusion.</p><p>The following describes an example where a rough sketch made in <a href=\"https://www.pinta-project.com/\">Pinta</a> is converted into a detailed artwork.</p><pre><code>python scripts/img2img.py --prompt \"A fantasy landscape, trending on artstation\" --init-img &lt;path-to-img.jpg&gt; --strength 0.8\n</code></pre><p>Here, strength is a value between 0.0 and 1.0, that controls the amount of noise that is added to the input image. Values that approach 1.0 allow for lots of variations but will also produce images that are not semantically consistent with the input. See the following example.</p><p>This procedure can, for example, also be used to upscale samples from the base model.</p><pre><code>@misc{rombach2021highresolution,\n      title={High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models}, \n      author={Robin Rombach and Andreas Blattmann and Dominik Lorenz and Patrick Esser and Björn Ommer},\n      year={2021},\n      eprint={2112.10752},\n      archivePrefix={arXiv},\n      primaryClass={cs.CV}\n}\n</code></pre>",

      "content": "<p>A comprehensive collection of Agent Skills for context engineering, multi-agent architectures, and production agent systems. Use when building, optimizing, or debugging agent systems that require effective context management.</p><p>A comprehensive, open collection of Agent Skills focused on context engineering principles for building production-grade AI agent systems. These skills teach the art and science of curating context to maximize agent effectiveness across any agent platform.</p><h2>What is Context Engineering?</h2><p>Context engineering is the discipline of managing the language model's context window. Unlike prompt engineering, which focuses on crafting effective instructions, context engineering addresses the holistic curation of all information that enters the model's limited attention budget: system prompts, tool definitions, retrieved documents, message history, and tool outputs.</p><p>The fundamental challenge is that context windows are constrained not by raw token capacity but by attention mechanics. As context length increases, models exhibit predictable degradation patterns: the \"lost-in-the-middle\" phenomenon, U-shaped attention curves, and attention scarcity. Effective context engineering means finding the smallest possible set of high-signal tokens that maximize the likelihood of desired outcomes.</p><p>This repository is cited in academic research as foundational work on static skill architecture:</p><blockquote><p>\"While static skills are well-recognized [Anthropic, 2025b; Muratcan Koylan, 2025], MCE is among the first to dynamically evolve them, bridging manual skill engineering and autonomous self-improvement.\"</p></blockquote><p>These skills establish the foundational understanding required for all subsequent context engineering work.</p><table><tbody><tr><td>Understand what context is, why it matters, and the anatomy of context in agent systems</td></tr><tr><td>Recognize patterns of context failure: lost-in-middle, poisoning, distraction, and clash</td></tr></tbody></table><p>These skills cover the patterns and structures for building effective agent systems.</p><table><tbody><tr><td>Design short-term, long-term, and graph-based memory architectures</td></tr><tr><td>Use filesystems for dynamic context discovery, tool output offloading, and plan persistence</td></tr><tr><td> Build background coding agents with sandboxed VMs, pre-built images, multiplayer support, and multi-client interfaces</td></tr></tbody></table><p>These skills address the ongoing operation and optimization of agent systems.</p><table><tbody><tr><td>Build evaluation frameworks for agent systems</td></tr><tr><td>Master LLM-as-a-Judge techniques: direct scoring, pairwise comparison, rubric generation, and bias mitigation</td></tr></tbody></table><p>These skills cover the meta-level practices for building LLM-powered projects.</p><table><tbody><tr><td>Design and build LLM projects from ideation through deployment, including task-model fit analysis, pipeline architecture, and structured output design</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Cognitive Architecture Skills</h3><p>These skills cover formal cognitive modeling for rational agent systems.</p><table><tbody><tr><td> Transform external RDF context into agent mental states (beliefs, desires, intentions) using formal BDI ontology patterns for deliberative reasoning and explainability</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Each skill is structured for efficient context use. At startup, agents load only skill names and descriptions. Full content loads only when a skill is activated for relevant tasks.</p><p>These skills focus on transferable principles rather than vendor-specific implementations.

      "content": "<p>Find and fix problems in your JavaScript code.</p><p>ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code. In many ways, it is similar to JSLint and JSHint with a few exceptions:</p><ul><li>ESLint uses <a href=\"https://github.com/eslint/js/tree/main/packages/espree\">Espree</a> for JavaScript parsing.</li><li>ESLint uses an AST to evaluate patterns in code.</li><li>ESLint is completely pluggable, every single rule is a plugin and you can add more at runtime.</li></ul><p>Prerequisites: <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/\">Node.js</a> (, , or ) built with SSL support. (If you are using an official Node.js distribution, SSL is always built in.)</p><p>You can install and configure ESLint using this command:</p><pre><code>npm init @eslint/config@latest\n</code></pre><p>After that, you can run ESLint on any file or directory like this:</p><p>To use ESLint with pnpm, we recommend setting up a  file with at least the following settings:</p><pre><code>auto-install-peers=true\nnode-linker=hoisted\n</code></pre><p>This ensures that pnpm installs dependencies in a way that is more compatible with npm and is less likely to produce errors.</p><p>You can configure rules in your  files as in this example:</p><pre><code>import { defineConfig } from \"eslint/config\";\n\nexport default defineConfig([\n\t{\n\t\tfiles: [\"**/*.js\", \"**/*.cjs\", \"**/*.mjs\"],\n\t\trules: {\n\t\t\t\"prefer-const\": \"warn\",\n\t\t\t\"no-constant-binary-expression\": \"error\",\n\t\t},\n\t},\n]);\n</code></pre><p>The names  and <code>\"no-constant-binary-expression\"</code> are the names of <a href=\"https://eslint.org/docs/rules\">rules</a> in ESLint. The first value is the error level of the rule and can be one of these values:</p><ul><li> or  - turn the rule off</li><li> or  - turn the rule on as a warning (doesn't affect exit code)</li><li> or  - turn the rule on as an error (exit code will be 1)</li></ul><p>The three error levels allow you fine-grained control over how ESLint applies rules (for more configuration options and details, see the <a href=\"https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure\">configuration docs</a>).</p><p>The ESLint team provides ongoing support for the current version and six months of limited support for the previous version. Limited support includes critical bug fixes, security issues, and compatibility issues only.</p><p>ESLint offers commercial support for both current and previous versions through our partners, <a href=\"https://tidelift.com/funding/github/npm/eslint\">Tidelift</a> and <a href=\"https://www.herodevs.com/support/eslint-nes?utm_source=ESLintWebsite&amp;utm_medium=ESLintWebsite&amp;utm_campaign=ESLintNES&amp;utm_id=ESLintNES\">HeroDevs</a>.</p><p>Before filing an issue, please be sure to read the guidelines for what you're reporting:</p><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><p>Yes, ESLint natively supports parsing JSX syntax (this must be enabled in <a href=\"https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure\">configuration</a>). Please note that supporting JSX syntax  the same as supporting React. React applies specific semantics to JSX syntax that ESLint doesn't recognize. We recommend using <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react\">eslint-plugin-react</a> if you are using React and want React semantics.</p><h3>Does Prettier replace ESLint?</h3><p>No, ESLint and Prettier have different jobs: ESLint is a linter (looking for problematic patterns) and Prettier is a code formatter. Using both tools is common, refer to <a href=\"https://prettier.io/docs/en/install#eslint-and-other-linters\">Prettier's documentation</a> to learn how to configure them to work well with each other.</p><h3>What ECMAScript versions does ESLint support?</h3><p>ESLint has full support for ECMAScript 3, 5, and every year from 2015 up until the most recent stage 4 specification (the default). You can set your desired ECMAScript syntax and other settings (like global variables) through <a href=\"https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure\">configuration</a>.</p><h3>What about experimental features?</h3><p>ESLint's parser only officially supports the latest final ECMAScript standard. We will make changes to core rules in order to avoid crashes on stage 3 ECMAScript syntax proposals (as long as they are implemented using the correct experimental ESTree syntax). We may make changes to core rules to better work with language extensions (such as JSX, Flow, and TypeScript) on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>In other cases (including if rules need to warn on more or fewer cases due to new syntax, rather than just not crashing), we recommend you use other parsers and/or rule plugins. If you are using Babel, you can use <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@babel/eslint-parser\">@babel/eslint-parser</a> and <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@babel/eslint-plugin\">@babel/eslint-plugin</a> to use any option available in Babel.</p><p>Once a language feature has been adopted into the ECMAScript standard (stage 4 according to the <a href=\"https://tc39.github.io/process-document/\">TC39 process</a>), we will accept issues and pull requests related to the new feature, subject to our <a href=\"https://eslint.org/docs/latest/contribute\">contributing guidelines</a>. Until then, please use the appropriate parser and plugin(s) for your experimental feature.</p><h3>Which Node.js versions does ESLint support?</h3><p>ESLint updates the supported Node.js versions with each major release of ESLint. At that time, ESLint's supported Node.js versions are updated to be:</p><ol><li>The most recent maintenance release of Node.js</li><li>The lowest minor version of the Node.js LTS release that includes the features the ESLint team wants to use.</li><li>The Node.js Current release</li></ol><p>ESLint is also expected to work with Node.js versions released after the Node.js Current release.</p><p>Refer to the <a href=\"https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/getting-started#prerequisites\">Quick Start Guide</a> for the officially supported Node.js versions for a given ESLint release.</p><h3>Why doesn't ESLint lock dependency versions?</h3><p>Lock files like  are helpful for deployed applications. They ensure that dependencies are consistent between environments and across deployments.</p><p>Packages like  that get published to the npm registry do not include lock files.  as a user will respect version constraints in ESLint's . ESLint and its dependencies will be included in the user's lock file if one exists, but ESLint's own lock file would not be used.</p><p>We intentionally don't lock dependency versions so that we have the latest compatible dependency versions in development and CI that our users get when installing ESLint in a project.</p><p>We have scheduled releases every two weeks on Friday or Saturday. You can follow a <a href=\"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Arelease\">release issue</a> for updates about the scheduling of any particular release.</p><p>ESLint takes security seriously. We work hard to ensure that ESLint is safe for everyone and that security issues are addressed quickly and responsibly. Read the full <a href=\"https://github.com/eslint/.github/raw/master/SECURITY.md\">security policy</a>.</p><h2>Semantic Versioning Policy</h2><p>ESLint follows <a href=\"https://semver.org\">semantic versioning</a>. However, due to the nature of ESLint as a code quality tool, it's not always clear when a minor or major version bump occurs. To help clarify this for everyone, we've defined the following semantic versioning policy for ESLint:</p><ul><li>Patch release (intended to not break your lint build) \n  <ul><li>A bug fix in a rule that results in ESLint reporting fewer linting errors.</li><li>A bug fix to the CLI or core (including formatters).</li><li>Improvements to documentation.</li><li>Non-user-facing changes such as refactoring code, adding, deleting, or modifying tests, and increasing test coverage.</li><li>Re-releasing after a failed release (i.e., publishing a release that doesn't work for anyone).</li></ul></li><li>Minor release (might break your lint build) \n  <ul><li>A bug fix in a rule that results in ESLint reporting more linting errors.</li><li>A new option to an existing rule that does not result in ESLint reporting more linting errors by default.</li><li>A new addition to an existing rule to support a newly-added language feature (within the last 12 months) that will result in ESLint reporting more linting errors by default.</li><li>An existing rule is deprecated.</li><li>A new CLI capability is created.</li><li>New capabilities to the public API are added (new classes, new methods, new arguments to existing methods, etc.).</li><li>A new formatter is created.</li><li> is updated and will result in strictly fewer linting errors (e.g., rule removals).</li></ul></li><li>Major release (likely to break your lint build) \n  <ul><li> is updated and may result in new linting errors (e.g., rule additions, most rule option updates).</li><li>A new option to an existing rule that results in ESLint reporting more linting errors by default.</li><li>An existing formatter is removed.</li><li>Part of the public API is removed or changed in an incompatible way. The public API includes: \n    <ul><li>Rule, formatter, parser, plugin APIs</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>According to our policy, any minor update may report more linting errors than the previous release (ex: from a bug fix). As such, we recommend using the tilde () in  e.g.  to guarantee the results of your builds.</p><p>Since ESLint is a CommonJS package, there are restrictions on which ESM-only packages can be used as dependencies.</p><p>Packages that are controlled by the ESLint team and have no external dependencies can be safely loaded synchronously using <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#loading-ecmascript-modules-using-require\"></a> and therefore used in any contexts.</p><p>For external packages, we don't use  because a package could add a top-level  and thus break ESLint. We can use an external ESM-only package only in case it is needed only in asynchronous code, in which case it can be loaded using dynamic .</p><p>Copyright OpenJS Foundation and other contributors, &lt;www.openjsf.org&gt;</p><p>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:</p><p>The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.</p><p>THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

The installer guides you through system checks, LLM provider setup, search engine configuration, and security hardening.</p><p><strong>Quick Installation (Linux amd64):</strong></p><pre><code># Create installation directory\nmkdir -p pentagi &amp;&amp; cd pentagi\n\n# Download installer\nwget -O installer.zip https://pentagi.com/downloads/linux/amd64/installer-latest.zip\n\n# Extract\nunzip installer.zip\n\n# Run interactive installer\n./installer\n</code></pre><p><strong>Prerequisites &amp; Permissions:</strong></p><p>The installer requires appropriate privileges to interact with the Docker API for proper operation. By default, it uses the Docker socket () which requires either:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Option 1 (Recommended for production):</strong> Run the installer as root:</p></li><li><p><strong>Option 2 (Development environments):</strong> Grant your user access to the Docker socket by adding them to the  group:</p><pre><code># Add your user to the docker group\nsudo usermod -aG docker $USER\n\n# Log out and log back in, or activate the group immediately\nnewgrp docker\n\n# Verify Docker access (should run without sudo)\ndocker ps\n</code></pre><p>⚠️  Adding a user to the  group grants root-equivalent privileges. Only do this for trusted users in controlled environments. For production deployments, consider using rootless Docker mode or running the installer with sudo.</p></li></ul><ol><li>: Verify Docker, network connectivity, and system requirements</li><li>: Create and configure  file with optimal defaults</li><li>: Set up LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Bedrock, Ollama, Custom)</li><li>: Configure DuckDuckGo, Google, Tavily, Traversaal, Perplexity, Searxng</li><li>: Generate secure credentials and configure SSL certificates</li><li>: Start PentAGI with docker-compose</li></ol><p><strong>For Production &amp; Enhanced Security:</strong></p><p>For production deployments or security-sensitive environments, we  using a distributed two-node architecture where worker operations are isolated on a separate server.

It answers you on the channels you already use (WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, Google Chat, Signal, iMessage, Microsoft Teams, WebChat), plus extension channels like BlueBubbles, Matrix, Zalo, and Zalo Personal. It can speak and listen on macOS/iOS/Android, and can render a live Canvas you control. The Gateway is just the control plane — the product is the assistant.</p><p>If you want a personal, single-user assistant that feels local, fast, and always-on, this is it.</p><p>Preferred setup: run the onboarding wizard () in your terminal. The wizard guides you step by step through setting up the gateway, workspace, channels, and skills. The CLI wizard is the recommended path and works on <strong>macOS, Linux, and Windows (via WSL2; strongly recommended)</strong>. Works with npm, pnpm, or bun. New install?

Read the docs to dive deeper: <a href=\"https://docs.openmercato.com/user-guide/encryption\">docs.openmercato.com/user-guide/encryption</a>.</p><p>We have migrated Open Mercato to a monorepo structure. If you're upgrading from a previous version, please note the following changes:</p><p>The codebase is now organized into:</p><ul><li> - Shared libraries and modules (, , , , , , , , , )</li><li> - Applications (main app in , docs in )</li></ul><p><strong>Important note on storage:</strong> The storage folder has been moved to the  folder as well. If you instance has got any attachments uploaded, please make sure you run:</p><pre><code>mv storage apps/mercato/storage\n</code></pre><p>... from the root Open Mercato folder.</p><p>Import aliases have changed from path-based to package-based imports:</p><ul><li>, , </li><li><code>@open-mercato/shared/lib/...</code>, <code>@open-mercato/ui/components/...</code>, <code>@open-mercato/core/modules/...</code>, etc.</li></ul><p>The  file now must live in  instead of the project root. The fastest way to start is to copy the example file:</p><pre><code>cp apps/mercato/.env.example apps/mercato/.env\n</code></pre><p>At minimum, set , , and  (or ) before bootstrapping.</p><p>Yarn 4 is now required. Ensure you have Yarn 4+ installed before proceeding.</p><p>This is a quickest way to get Open Mercato up and running on your localhost / server - ready for testing / demoing or for !</p><pre><code># macOS (Homebrew)\nbrew install node@24\n\n# Windows (Chocolatey)\nchoco install nodejs --version=24.x\n\n# Or use nvm (any platform)\nnvm install 24\nnvm use 24\n</code></pre><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/open-mercato/open-mercato.git\ncd open-mercato\ngit checkout develop\nyarn install\n\ncp apps/mercato/.env.example apps/mercato/.env # EDIT this file to set up your specific files\n#At minimum, set `DATABASE_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`, and `REDIS_URL` (or `EVENTS_REDIS_URL`) before bootstrapping.\n\nyarn generate\nyarn initialize # or yarn reinstall\nyarn dev\n</code></pre><p>For a fresh greenfield boot (build packages, generate registries, reinstall modules, then start dev), run:</p><p>Navigate to <code>http://localhost:3000/backend</code> and sign in with the default credentials printed by .</p><p>Open Mercato offers two Docker Compose configurations — one for  (with hot reload) and one for . Both run the full stack (app + PostgreSQL + Redis + Meilisearch) in containers. The dev mode is the <strong>recommended setup for Windows</strong> users.</p><p>Run the entire stack with source code mounted from the host. File changes trigger automatic rebuilds — no local Node.js or Yarn required.</p><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/open-mercato/open-mercato.git\ncd open-mercato\ngit checkout develop\ndocker compose -f docker-compose.fullapp.dev.yml up --build\n</code></pre><p> Ensure WSL 2 backend is enabled in Docker Desktop and clone with <code>git config --global core.autocrlf input</code> to avoid line-ending issues.</p><pre><code>docker compose -f docker-compose.fullapp.yml up --build\n</code></pre><ul><li>Start: <code>docker compose -f docker-compose.fullapp.yml up -d</code></li><li>Logs: <code>docker compose -f docker-compose.fullapp.yml logs -f app</code></li><li>Stop: <code>docker compose -f docker-compose.fullapp.yml down</code></li><li>Rebuild: <code>docker compose -f docker-compose.fullapp.yml up --build</code></li></ul><p>Navigate to <code>http://localhost:3000/backend</code> and sign in with the default credentials (<a href=\"mailto:admin@example.com\">admin@example.com</a>).</p><h3>Docker Environment Variables</h3><p>Before starting, you may want to configure the following environment variables. Create a  file in the project root or export them in your shell:</p><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Secret key for JWT token signing. <strong>Use a strong, unique value in production.</strong></td></tr><tr><td>PostgreSQL database password. <strong>Use a strong password in production.</strong></td></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr><td>Meilisearch API key. <strong>Use a strong key in production.</strong></td></tr><tr></tr><tr><td>OpenAI API key (enables AI features)</td></tr><tr><td>Anthropic API key (for opencode service)</td></tr><tr><td>Opencode service exposed port</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Example  file for production:</p><pre><code>JWT_SECRET=your-strong-secret-key-here\nPOSTGRES_PASSWORD=your-strong-db-password\nMEILISEARCH_MASTER_KEY=your-strong-meilisearch-key\nOPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...  # Optional, for AI features\n</code></pre><p>For production deployments, ensure strong , secure database credentials, and consider managed database services. See the <a href=\"https://docs.openmercato.com/installation/setup#docker-deployment-full-stack\">full Docker deployment guide</a> for detailed configuration and production tips.</p><h2>Standalone App &amp; Customization</h2><p>The <strong>recommended way to build on Open Mercato</strong> without modifying the core is to create a standalone app. This gives you a self-contained project that pulls Open Mercato packages from npm — your own modules, overrides, and customizations live in your repo while core stays untouched and upgradeable.</p><pre><code>npx create-mercato-app my-store\ncd my-store\ncp .env.example .env   # configure DATABASE_URL, JWT_SECRET, REDIS_URL\ndocker compose up -d   # start PostgreSQL, Redis, Meilisearch\nyarn install\nyarn initialize\nyarn dev\n</code></pre><p>Navigate to <code>http://localhost:3000/backend</code> and sign in with the credentials printed by .</p><p>Drop your own modules into  and register them in  with :</p><pre><code>export const enabledModules: ModuleEntry[] = [\n  // ... core modules\n  { id: 'inventory', from: '@app' },\n]\n</code></pre><p>Run  and  — your module's pages, APIs, and entities are auto-discovered.</p><h3>Eject core modules for deep customization</h3><p>When you need to change the internals of a core module (entities, business logic, UI),  it.

They only allow conversion between two formats in the same medium (images to images, videos to videos, etc.), and they require that you <em>upload your files to some server</em>.</p><p>This is not just terrible for privacy, it's also incredibly lame. What if you  need to convert an AVI video to a PDF document? Try to find an online tool for that, I dare you.</p><p><a href=\"https://convert.to.it/\">Convert.to.it</a> aims to be a tool that \"just works\". You're almost  to get an output - perhaps not always the one you expected, but it'll try its best to not leave you hanging.</p><ol><li>Click the big blue box to add your file (or just drag it on to the window).</li><li>An input format should have been automatically selected. If it wasn't, yikes! Try searching for it, or if it's really not there, see the \"Issues\" section below.</li><li>Select an output format from the second list. If you're on desktop, that's the one on the right side. If you're on mobile, it'll be somewhere lower down.</li><li>Hopefully, after a bit (or a lot) of thinking, the program will spit out the file you wanted. If not, see the \"Issues\" section below.</li></ol><p>Ever since the YouTube video released, we've been getting spammed with issues suggesting the addition of all kinds of niche file formats. To keep things organized, I've decided to specify what counts as a valid issue and what doesn't.</p><blockquote><p>[!IMPORTANT] <strong>SIMPLY ASKING FOR A FILE FORMAT TO BE ADDED IS NOT A MEANINGFUL ISSUE!</strong></p></blockquote><p>There are thousands of file formats out there. It can take hours to add support for just one. The math is simple - we can't possibly support every single file. As such, simply listing your favorite file formats is not helpful. We already know that there are formats we don't support, we don't need tickets to tell us that.</p><p>When suggesting a file format, you must :</p><ul><li>Make sure that there isn't already an issue about the same thing, and that we don't already support the format.</li><li>Explain what you expect the conversion to be like (what medium is it converting to/from). It's important to note here that simply parsing the underlying data is . Imagine if we only treated SVG images as raw XML data and didn't support converting them to raster images - that would defeat the point.</li><li>Provide links to existing browser-based solutions if possible, or at the very least a reference for implementing the format, and make sure the license is compatible with GPL-2.0.</li></ul><p>If this seems like a lot, please remember - a developer will have to do 100x more work to actually implement the format. Doing a bit of research not only saves them precious time, it also weeds out \"unserious\" proposals that would only bloat our to-do list.</p><p><strong>If you're submitting a bug report,</strong> you only need to do step 1 - check if the problem isn't already reported by someone else. Bug reports are generally quite important otherwise.</p><p>Though please note, \"converting X to Y doesn't work\" is  a bug report. However, \"converting X to Y works but not how I expected\" likely  a bug report.</p><h3>Local development (Bun + Vite)</h3><ol><li>Clone this repository . You can use <code>git clone --recursive https://github.com/p2r3/convert</code> for that. Omitting submodules will leave you missing a few dependencies.</li><li>Run  to install dependencies.</li><li>Run  to start the development server.</li></ol><p><em>The following steps are optional, but recommended for performance:</em></p><p>When you first open the page, it'll take a while to generate the list of supported formats for each tool. If you open the console, you'll see it complaining a bunch about missing caches.</p><p>After this is done (indicated by a <code>Built initial format list</code> message in the console), use <code>printSupportedFormatCache()</code> to get a JSON string with the cache data. You can then save this string to  to skip that loading screen on startup.</p><p>Docker compose files live in the  directory, so run compose with  from the repository root:</p><pre><code>docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d\n</code></pre><p>Alternatively download the  separately and start it by executing  in the same directory.</p><p>This runs the container on <code>http://localhost:8080/convert/</code>.</p><h3>Docker (local build for development)</h3><p>Use the override file to build the image locally:</p><pre><code>docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml -f docker/docker-compose.override.yml up --build -d\n</code></pre><p>The first Docker build is expected to be slow because Chromium and related system packages are installed in the build stage (needed for puppeteer in ). Later builds are usually much faster due to Docker layer caching.</p><p>The best way to contribute is by adding support for new file formats (duh). Here's how that works:</p><p>Each \"tool\" used for conversion has to be normalized to a standard form - effectively a \"wrapper\" that abstracts away the internal processes. These wrappers are available in <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/p2r3/convert/master/src/handlers/\">src/handlers</a>.</p><p>Below is a super barebones handler that does absolutely nothing. You can use this as a starting point for adding a new format:</p><pre><code>// file: dummy.ts\n\nimport type { FileData, FileFormat, FormatHandler } from \"../FormatHandler.ts\";\nimport CommonFormats from \"src/CommonFormats.ts\";\n\nclass dummyHandler implements FormatHandler {\n\n  public name: string = \"dummy\";\n  public supportedFormats?: FileFormat[];\n  public ready: boolean = false;\n\n  async init () {\n    this.supportedFormats = [\n      // Example PNG format, with both input and output disabled\n      CommonFormats.PNG.builder(\"png\")\n        .markLossless()\n        // .allowFrom()\n        // .allowTo()\n    ];\n    this.ready = true;\n  }\n\n  async doConvert (\n    inputFiles: FileData[],\n    inputFormat: FileFormat,\n    outputFormat: FileFormat\n  ): Promise&lt;FileData[]&gt; {\n    const outputFiles: FileData[] = [];\n    return outputFiles;\n  }\n\n}\n\nexport default dummyHandler;\n</code></pre><p>For more details on how all of these components work, refer to the doc comments in <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/p2r3/convert/master/src/FormatHandler.ts\">src/FormatHandler.ts</a>. You can also take a look at existing handlers to get a more practical example.</p><p>There are a few additional things that I want to point out in particular:</p><ul><li>Pay attention to the naming system. If your tool is called , then the class should be called , and the file should be called .</li><li>The handler is responsible for setting the output file's name. This is done to allow for flexibility in rare cases where the  file name matters. Of course, in most cases, you'll only have to swap the file extension.</li><li>The handler is also responsible for ensuring that any byte buffers that enter or exit the handler . If necessary, clone the buffer by wrapping it in .</li><li>When handling MIME types, run them through <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/p2r3/convert/master/src/normalizeMimeType.ts\">normalizeMimeType</a> first. One file can have multiple valid MIME types, which isn't great when you're trying to match them algorithmically.</li><li>When implementing a new file format, please treat the file as the media that it represents, not the data that it contains. For example, if you were making an SVG handler, you should treat the file as an , not as XML.</li></ul><p>If your tool requires an external dependency (which it likely does), there are currently two well-established ways of going about this:</p><ul><li>If it's an  package, just install it to the project like you normally would.</li><li>If it's a Git repository, add it as a submodule to <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/p2r3/convert/master/src/handlers\">src/handlers</a>.</li></ul><p><strong>Please try to avoid CDNs (Content Delivery Networks).</strong> They're really cool on paper, but they don't work well with TypeScript, and each one introduces a tiny bit of instability. For a project that leans heavily on external dependencies, those bits of instability can add up fast.</p><ul><li>If you need to load a WebAssembly binary (or similar), add its path to <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/p2r3/convert/master/vite.config.js\">vite.config.js</a> and target it under . <strong>Do not link to node_modules</strong>.</li></ul>",

Sign in via Qwen OAuth to use it directly, or get an API key from <a href=\"https://modelstudio.console.alibabacloud.com?tab=doc#/doc/?type=model&amp;url=2840914_2&amp;modelId=group-qwen3.5-plus\">Alibaba Cloud ModelStudio</a> to access it through the OpenAI-compatible API.</p></blockquote><p>Qwen Code is an open-source AI agent for the terminal, optimized for <a href=\"https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3-Coder\">Qwen3-Coder</a>. It helps you understand large codebases, automate tedious work, and ship faster.</p><ul><li><strong>Multi-protocol, OAuth free tier</strong>: use OpenAI / Anthropic / Gemini-compatible APIs, or sign in with Qwen OAuth for 1,000 free requests/day.</li><li>: both the framework and the Qwen3-Coder model are open-source—and they ship and evolve together.</li><li><strong>Agentic workflow, feature-rich</strong>: rich built-in tools (Skills, SubAgents) for a full agentic workflow and a Claude Code-like experience.</li><li><strong>Terminal-first, IDE-friendly</strong>: built for developers who live in the command line, with optional integration for VS Code, Zed, and JetBrains IDEs.</li></ul><h3>Quick Install (Recommended)</h3><pre><code>curl -fsSL https://qwen-code-assets.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/installation/install-qwen.sh | bash\n</code></pre><h4>Windows (Run as Administrator CMD)</h4><pre><code>curl -fsSL -o %TEMP%\\install-qwen.bat https://qwen-code-assets.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/installation/install-qwen.bat &amp;&amp; %TEMP%\\install-qwen.bat\n</code></pre><blockquote><p>: It's recommended to restart your terminal after installation to ensure environment variables take effect.</p></blockquote><p>Make sure you have Node.js 20 or later installed. Download it from <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/download\">nodejs.org</a>.</p><pre><code>npm install -g @qwen-code/qwen-code@latest\n</code></pre><pre><code># Start Qwen Code (interactive)\nqwen\n\n# Then, in the session:\n/help\n/auth\n</code></pre><p>On first use, you'll be prompted to sign in. You can run  anytime to switch authentication methods.</p><pre><code>What does this project do?\nExplain the codebase structure.\nHelp me refactor this function.\nGenerate unit tests for this module.\n</code></pre><p>Qwen Code supports two authentication methods:</p><ul><li><strong>Qwen OAuth (recommended &amp; free)</strong>: sign in with your  account in a browser.</li><li>: use an API key to connect to any supported provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google GenAI, Alibaba Cloud Bailian, and other compatible endpoints).</li></ul><p>Choose  and complete the browser flow. Your credentials are cached locally so you usually won't need to log in again.</p><blockquote><p> In non-interactive or headless environments (e.g., CI, SSH, containers), you typically  complete the OAuth browser login flow. In these cases, please use the API-KEY authentication method.</p></blockquote><p>Use this if you want more flexibility over which provider and model to use. Supports multiple protocols:</p><ul><li>: Alibaba Cloud Bailian, ModelScope, OpenAI, OpenRouter, and other OpenAI-compatible providers</li><li>: Gemini models</li></ul><p>The  way to configure models and providers is by editing  (create it if it doesn't exist). This file lets you define all available models, API keys, and default settings in one place.</p><p> Create or edit </p><p>Here is a complete example:</p><pre><code>{\n  \"modelProviders\": {\n    \"openai\": [\n      {\n        \"id\": \"qwen3-coder-plus\",\n        \"name\": \"qwen3-coder-plus\",\n        \"baseUrl\": \"https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1\",\n        \"description\": \"Qwen3-Coder via Dashscope\",\n        \"envKey\": \"DASHSCOPE_API_KEY\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  \"env\": {\n    \"DASHSCOPE_API_KEY\": \"sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxx\"\n  },\n  \"security\": {\n    \"auth\": {\n      \"selectedType\": \"openai\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"model\": {\n    \"name\": \"qwen3-coder-plus\"\n  }\n}\n</code></pre><p> Understand each field</p><table><tbody><tr><td>Declares which models are available and how to connect to them.

The  file is in your home directory and should stay private.</p></blockquote><p>As an open-source terminal agent, you can use Qwen Code in four primary ways:</p><ol><li>Interactive mode (terminal UI)</li><li>Headless mode (scripts, CI)</li><li>IDE integration (VS Code, Zed)</li></ol><p>Run  in your project folder to launch the interactive terminal UI. Use  to reference local files (for example ).</p><pre><code>cd your-project/\nqwen -p \"your question\"\n</code></pre><p>Use  to run Qwen Code without the interactive UI—ideal for scripts, automation, and CI/CD. Learn more: <a href=\"https://qwenlm.github.io/qwen-code-docs/en/users/features/headless\">Headless mode</a>.</p><p>Use Qwen Code inside your editor (VS Code, Zed, and JetBrains IDEs):</p><p>Build on top of Qwen Code with the TypeScript SDK:</p><ul><li> - Display available commands</li><li> - Clear conversation history</li><li> - Compress history to save tokens</li><li> - Show current session information</li><li> - Submit a bug report</li><li> or  - Exit Qwen Code</li></ul><ul><li> - Cancel current operation</li><li> - Exit (on empty line)</li><li> - Navigate command history</li></ul><blockquote><p>: In YOLO mode (), vision switching happens automatically without prompts when images are detected.

It has been created in order to structure, store, organize and visualize technical and non-technical information about cyber threats.</p> \n<p>The structuration of the data is performed using a knowledge schema based on the <a href=\"https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/\">STIX2 standards</a>. It has been designed as a modern web application including a <a href=\"https://graphql.org\">GraphQL API</a> and an UX oriented frontend. Also, OpenCTI can be integrated with other tools and applications such as <a href=\"https://github.com/MISP/MISP\">MISP</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/TheHive-Project/TheHive\">TheHive</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/mitre/cti\">MITRE ATT&amp;CK</a>, etc.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenCTI-Platform/opencti/master/.github/img/screenshot.png\" alt=\"Screenshot\" title=\"Screenshot\" /></p> \n<h2>Objective</h2> \n<p>The goal is to create a comprehensive tool allowing users to capitalize technical (such as TTPs and observables) and non-technical information (such as suggested attribution, victimology etc.) while linking each piece of information to its primary source (a report, a MISP event, etc.), with features such as links between each information, first and last seen dates, levels of confidence, etc. The tool is able to use the <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org\">MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework</a> (through a <a href=\"https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/connectors\">dedicated connector</a>) to help structure the data. The user can also choose to implement their own datasets.</p> \n<p>Once data has been capitalized and processed by the analysts within OpenCTI, new relations may be inferred from existing ones to facilitate the understanding and the representation of this information. This allows the user to extract and leverage meaningful knowledge from the raw data.</p> \n<p>OpenCTI not only allows <a href=\"https://docs.opencti.io/latest/usage/import-automated/\">imports</a> but also <a href=\"https://docs.opencti.io/latest/usage/feeds/\">exports of data</a> under different formats (CSV, STIX2 bundles, etc.). <a href=\"https://hub.filigran.io/cybersecurity-solutions/open-cti-integrations\">Connectors</a> are currently developed to accelerate interactions between the tool and other platforms.</p> \n<h2>Editions of the platform</h2> \n<p>OpenCTI platform has 2 different editions: Community (CE) and Enterprise (EE). The purpose of the Enterprise Edition is to provide <a href=\"https://filigran.io/offering/subscribe\">additional and powerful features</a> which require specific investments in research and development. You can enable the Enterprise Edition directly in the settings of the platform.</p> \n<ul> \n <li>OpenCTI Community Edition, licensed under the <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenCTI-Platform/opencti/master/LICENSE\">Apache 2, Version 2.0 license</a>.</li> \n <li>OpenCTI Enterprise Edition, licensed under the <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenCTI-Platform/opencti/master/LICENSE\">Enterprise Edition license</a>.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>To understand what OpenCTI Enterprise Edition brings in terms of features, just check the <a href=\"https://filigran.io/offering/subscribe\">Enterprise Editions page</a> on the Filigran website. You can also try this edition by enabling it in the settings of the platform.</p> \n<h2>Documentation and demonstration</h2> \n<p>If you want to know more on OpenCTI, you can read the <a href=\"https://docs.opencti.io\">documentation on the tool</a>. If you wish to discover how the OpenCTI platform is working, a <a href=\"https://demo.opencti.io\">demonstration instance</a> is available and open to everyone. This instance is reset every night and is based on reference data maintained by the OpenCTI developers.</p> \n<h2>Releases download</h2> \n<p>The releases are available on the <a href=\"https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/opencti/releases\">Github releases page</a>. You can also access the <a href=\"https://releases.opencti.io\">rolling release package</a> generated from the master branch of the repository.</p> \n<h2>Installation</h2> \n<p>All you need to install the OpenCTI platform can be found in the <a href=\"https://docs.opencti.io\">official documentation</a>. For installation, you can:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://docs.opencti.io/latest/deployment/installation/#using-docker\">Use Docker</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://docs.opencti.io/latest/deployment/installation/#install-manually\">Install manually</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://docs.opencti.io/latest/deployment/installation/#terraform\">Use Terraform (community)</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://docs.opencti.io/latest/deployment/installation/#helm-charts\">Use Helm charts (community)</a></li> \n</ul> \n<h2>Contributing</h2> \n<h3>Code of Conduct</h3> \n<p>OpenCTI has adopted a <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenCTI-Platform/opencti/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">Code of Conduct</a> that we expect project participants to adhere to. Please read the <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenCTI-Platform/opencti/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">full text</a> so that you can understand what actions will and will not be tolerated.</p> \n<h3>Contributing Guide</h3> \n<p>Read our <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenCTI-Platform/opencti/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\">contributing guide</a> to learn about our development process, how to propose bugfixes and improvements, and how to build and test your changes to OpenCTI.</p> \n<h3>Beginner friendly issues</h3> \n<p>To help you get you familiar with our contribution process, we have a list of <a href=\"https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/opencti/labels/beginner%20friendly%20issue\">beginner friendly issues</a> which are fairly easy to implement. This is a great place to get started.</p> \n<h3>Development</h3> \n<p>If you want to actively help OpenCTI, we created a <a href=\"https://docs.opencti.io/latest/development/environment_ubuntu/\">dedicated documentation</a> about the deployment of a development environment and how to start the source code modification.</p> \n<h2>Community</h2> \n<h3>Status &amp; bugs</h3> \n<p>Currently OpenCTI is under heavy development, if you wish to report bugs or ask for new features, you can directly use the <a href=\"https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/opencti/issues\">Github issues module</a>.</p> \n<h3>Discussion</h3> \n<p>If you need support or you wish to engage a discussion about the OpenCTI platform, feel free to join us on our <a href=\"https://community.filigran.io\">Slack channel</a>.

Connect via API keys.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Spot</strong>: Trading spot markets</li> \n   <li><strong>Perpetual</strong>: Trading perpetual futures markets</li> \n  </ul> </li> \n <li> <p><strong>CLOB DEX</strong>: Decentralized exchanges with on-chain central limit order books. Non-custodial, connect via wallet keys.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Spot</strong>: Trading spot markets on-chain</li> \n   <li><strong>Perpetual</strong>: Trading perpetual futures on-chain</li> \n  </ul> </li> \n <li> <p><strong>AMM DEX</strong>: Decentralized exchanges using Automated Market Maker protocols. Non-custodial, connect via Gateway middleware.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Router</strong>: DEX aggregators that find optimal swap routes</li> \n   <li><strong>AMM</strong>: Traditional constant product (x*y=k) pools</li> \n   <li><strong>CLMM</strong>: Concentrated Liquidity Market Maker pools with custom price ranges</li> \n  </ul> </li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Exchange Sponsors</h3> \n<p>We are

They offered a range of sizes, allowing developers to trade off compute and storage space against accuracy to fit their applications. Their biggest models, like Large v3, also gave accuracy scores that were higher than anything available outside of large tech companies like Google or Apple. At Moonshine we were early and enthusiastic adopters of Whisper, and we still remain big fans of the models and the great frameworks like <a href=\"https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper\">FasterWhisper</a> and others that have been built around them.</p> \n<p>However, as we built applications that needed a live voice interface we found we needed features that weren't available through Whisper:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Whisper always operates on a 30-second input window</strong>. This isn't an issue when you're processing audio in large batches, you can usually just look ahead in the file and find a 30-second-ish chunk of speech to apply it to. Voice interfaces can't look ahead to create larger chunks from their input stream, and phrases are seldom longer than five to ten seconds. This means there's a lot of wasted computation encoding zero padding in the encoder and decoder, which means longer latency in returning results. Since one of the most important requirements for any interface is responsiveness, usually defined as latency below 200ms, this hurts the user experience even on platforms that have compute to spare, and makes it unusable on more constrained devices.</li> \n <li><strong>Whisper doesn't cache anything</strong>. Another common requirement for voice interfaces is that they display feedback as the user is talking, so that they know the app is listening and understanding them. This means calling the speech to text model repeatedly over time as a sentence is spoken. Most of the audio input is the same, with only a short addition to the end. Even though a lot of the input is constant, Whisper starts from scratch every time, doing a lot of redundant work on audio that it has seen before. Like the fixed input window, this unnecessary latency impairs the user experience.</li> \n <li><strong>Whisper supports a lot of languages poorly</strong>. Whisper's multilingual support is an incredible feat of engineering, and demonstrated a single model could handle many languages, and even offer translations. This chart from OpenAI (<a href=\"https://cdn.openai.com/papers/whisper.pdf\">raw data in Appendix D-2.4</a>) shows the drop-off in Word Error Rate (WER) with the very largest 1.5 billion parameter model.</li> \n</ul> \n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/images/lang-chart.png\" alt=\"Language Chart\" /></p> \n<p>82 languages are listed, but only 33 have sub-20% WER (what we consider usable). For the Base model size commonly used on edge devices, only 5 languages are under 20% WER. Asian languages like Korean and Japanese stand out as the native tongue of large markets with a lot of tech innovation, but Whisper doesn't offer good enough accuracy to use in most applications The proprietary in-house versions of Whisper that are available through OpenAI's cloud API seem to offer better accuracy, but aren't available as open models.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Fragmented edge support</strong>. A fantastic ecosystem has grown up around Whisper, there are a lot of mature frameworks you can use to deploy the models. However these often tend to be focused on desktop-class machines and operating systems. There are projects you can use across edge platforms like iOS, Android, or Raspberry Pi OS, but they tend to have different interfaces, capabilities, and levels of optimization. This made building applications that need to run on a variety of devices unnecessarily difficult.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>All these limitations drove us to create our own family of models that better meet the needs of live voice interfaces. It took us some time since the combined size of the open speech datasets available is tiny compared to the amount of web-derived text data, but after extensive data-gathering work, we were able to release <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15608\">the first generation of Moonshine models</a>. These removed the fixed-input window limitation along with some other architectural improvements, and gave significantly lower latency than Whisper in live speech applications, often running 5x faster or more.</p> \n<p>However we kept encountering applications that needed even lower latencies on even more constrained platforms. We also wanted to offer higher accuracy than the Base-equivalent that was the top end of the initial models. That led us to this second generation of Moonshine models, which offer:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Flexible input windows</strong>. You can supply any length of audio (though we recommend staying below around 30 seconds) and the model will only spend compute on that input, no zero-padding required. This gives us a significant latency boost.</li> \n <li><strong>Caching for streaming</strong>. Our models now support incremental addition of audio over time, and they cache the input encoding and part of the decoder's state so that we're able to skip even more of the compute, driving latency down dramatically.</li> \n <li><strong>Language-specific models</strong>. We have gathered data and trained models for multiple languages, including Arabic, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, Ukrainian, Vietnamese, and Chinese. As we discuss in our <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02523\">Flavors of Moonshine paper</a>, we've found that we can get much higher accuracy for the same size and compute if we restrict a model to focus on just one language, compared to training one model across many.</li> \n <li><strong>Cross-platform library support</strong>. We're building applications ourselves, and needed to be able to deploy these models across Linux, MacOS, Windows, iOS, and Android, as well as use them from languages like Python, Swift, Java, and C++. To support this we architected a portable C++ core library that handles all of the processing, uses OnnxRuntime for good performance across systems, and then built native interfaces for all the required high-level languages. This allows developers to learn one API, and then deploy it almost anywhere they want to run.</li> \n <li><strong>Better accuracy than Whisper V3 Large</strong>. On <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/spaces/hf-audio/open_asr_leaderboard\">HuggingFace's OpenASR leaderboard</a>, our newest streaming model for English, Medium Streaming, achieves a lower word-error rate than the most-accurate Whisper model from OpenAI. This is despite Moonshine's version using 250 million parameters, versus Large v3's 1.5 billion, making it much easier to deploy on the edge.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Hopefully this gives you a good idea of how Moonshine compares to Whisper. If you're working with GPUs in the cloud on data in bulk where throughput is most important then Whisper (or Nvidia alternatives like Parakeet) offer advantages like batch processing, but we believe we can't be beat for live speech. We've built the framework and models we wished we'd had when we first started building applications with voice interfaces, so if you're working with live voice inputs, <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/#quickstart\">give Moonshine a try</a>.</p> \n<h2>Using the Library</h2> \n<p>The Moonshine API is designed to take care of the details around capturing and transcribing live speech, giving application developers a high-level API focused on actionable events. I'll use Python to illustrate how it works, but the API is consistent across all the supported languages.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/#architecture\">Architecture</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/#concepts\">Concepts</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/#getting-started-with-transcription\">Getting Started with Transcription</a> \n  <ul> \n   <li><a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/#transcription-event-flow\">Transcription Event Flow</a></li> \n  </ul> </li> \n <li><a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/#getting-started-with-command-recognition\">Getting Started with Command Recognition</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/#examples\">Examples</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/#adding-the-library-to-your-own-app\">Adding the Library to your own App</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/#python-1\">Python</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/#ios-or-macos\">iOS or MacOS</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/#android-1\">Android</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/#windowsc\">Windows</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/#debugging\">Debugging</a> \n  <ul> \n   <li><a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/#console-logs\">Console Logs</a></li> \n   <li><a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/#input-saving\">Input Saving</a></li> \n   <li><a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/#api-call-logging\">API Call Logging</a></li> \n  </ul> </li> \n <li><a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/#building-from-source\">Building from Source</a> \n  <ul> \n   <li><a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/#cmake\">Cmake</a></li> \n   <li><a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/#language-bindings\">Language Bindings</a></li> \n   <li><a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/#porting\">Porting</a></li> \n  </ul> </li> \n <li><a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/#downloading-models\">Downloading Models</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/#benchmarking\">Benchmarking</a></li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Architecture</h3> \n<p>Our goal is to build a framework that any developer can pick up and use, even with no previous experience of speech technologies. We've abstracted away a lot of the unnecessary details and provide a simple interface that lets you focus on building your application, and that's reflected in our system architecture.</p> \n<p>The basic flow is:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Create a <code>Transcriber</code> or <code>IntentRecognizer</code> object, depending on whether you want the text that's spoken, or just to know that a user has requested an action.</li> \n <li>Attach an <code>EventListener</code> that gets called when important things occur, like the end of a phrase or an action being triggered, so your application can respond.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Traditionally, adding a voice interface to an application or product required integrating a lot of different libraries to handle all the processing that's needed to capture audio and turn it into something actionable. The main steps involved are microphone capture, voice activity detection (to break a continuous stream of audio into sections of speech), speech to text, speaker identification, and intent recognition. Each of these steps typically involved a different framework, which greatly increased the complexity of integrating, optimizing, and maintaining these dependencies.</p> \n<p>Moonshine Voice includes all of these stages in a single library, and abstracts away everything but the essential information your application needs to respond to user speech, whether you want to transcribe it or trigger actions.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/images/moonshine-voice-architecture.png\" alt=\"Moonshine Voice Architecture\" /></p> \n<p>Most developers should be able to treat the library as a black box that tells them when something interesting has happened, using our event-based classes to implement application logic. Of course the framework is fully open source, so speech experts can dive as deep under the hood as they'd like, but it's not necessary to use it.</p> \n<h3>Concepts</h3> \n<p>A <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/python/src/moonshine_voice/transcriber.py#L66\"><strong>Transcriber</strong></a> takes in audio input and turns any speech into text. This is the first object you'll need to create to use Moonshine, and you'll give it a path to <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/#downloading-models\">the models you've downloaded</a>.</p> \n<p>A <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/python/src/moonshine_voice/mic_transcriber.py#L10\"><strong>MicTranscriber</strong></a> is a helper class based on the general transcriber that takes care of connecting to a microphone using your platform's built-in support (for example sounddevice in Python) and then feeding the audio in as it's captured.</p> \n<p>A <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/python/src/moonshine_voice/transcriber.py#L297\"><strong>Stream</strong></a> is a handler for audio input. The reason streams exist is because you may want to process multiple audio inputs at once, and a transcriber can support those through multiple streams, without duplicating the model resources. If you only have one input, the transcriber class includes the same methods (start/stop/add_audio) as a stream, and you can use that interface instead and forget about streams.</p> \n<p>A <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/python/src/moonshine_voice/moonshine_api.py#L51\"><strong>TranscriptLine</strong></a> is a data structure holding information about one line in the transcript. When someone is speaking, the library waits for short pauses (where punctuation might go in written language) and starts a new line. These aren't exactly sentences, since a speech pause isn't a sure sign of the end of a sentence, but this does break the spoken audio into segments that can be considered phrases. A line includes state such as whether the line has just started, is still being spoken, or is complete, along with its start time and duration.</p> \n<p>A <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/python/src/moonshine_voice/moonshine_api.py#67\"><strong>Transcript</strong></a> is a list of lines in time order holding information about what text has already been recognized, along with other state like when it was captured.</p> \n<p>A <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/python/src/moonshine_voice/transcriber.py#L22\"><strong>TranscriptEvent</strong></a> contains information about changes to the transcript. Events include a new line being started, the text in a line being updated, and a line being completed. The event object includes the transcript line it's referring to as a member, holding the latest state of that line.</p> \n<p>A <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/python/src/moonshine_voice/transcriber.py#L266\"><strong>TranscriptEventListener</strong></a> is a protocol that allows app-defined functions to be called when transcript events happen. This is the main way that most applications interact with the results of the transcription. When live speech is happening, applications usually need to respond or display results as new speech is recognized, and this approach allows you to handle those changes in a similar way to events from traditional user interfaces like touch screen gestures or mouse clicks on buttons.</p> \n<p>An <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/python/src/moonshine_voice/intent_recognizer.py#L44\"><strong>IntentRecognizer</strong></a> is a type of TranscriptEventListener that allows you to invoke different callback functions when preprogrammed intents are detected. This is useful for building voice command recognition features.</p> \n<h3>Getting Started with Transcription</h3> \n<p>We have <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/#examples\">examples</a> for most platforms so as a first step I recommend checking out what we have for the systems you're targeting.</p> \n<p>Next, you'll need to <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/#adding-the-library-to-your-own-app\">add the library to your project</a>. We aim to provide pre-built binaries for all major platforms using their native package managers. On Python this means a pip install, for Android it's a Maven package, and for MacOS and iOS we provide a Swift package through SPM.</p> \n<p>The transcriber needs access to the files for the model you're using, so after <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/#downloading-models\">downloading them</a> you'll need to place them somewhere the application can find them, and make a note of the path. This usually means adding them as resources in your IDE if you're planning to distribute the app, or you can use hard-wired paths if you're just experimenting. The download script gives you the location of the models and their architecture type on your drive after it completes.</p> \n<p>Now you can try creating a transcriber. Here's what that looks like in Python:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">transcriber = Transcriber(model_path=model_path, model_arch=model_arch)\n</code></pre> \n<p>If the model isn't found, or if there's any other error, this will throw an exception with information about the problem. You can also check the console for logs from the core library, these are printed to <code>stderr</code> or your system's equivalent.</p> \n<p>Now we'll create a listener that contains the app logic that you want triggered when the transcript updates, and attach it to your transcriber:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">class TestListener(TranscriptEventListener):\n    def on_line_started(self, event):\n        print(f\"Line started: {event.line.text}\")\n\n    def on_line_text_changed(self, event):\n        print(f\"Line text changed: {event.line.text}\")\n\n    def on_line_completed(self, event):\n        print(f\"Line completed: {event.line.text}\")\n\ntranscriber.add_listener(listener)\n</code></pre> \n<p>The transcriber needs some audio data to work with. If you want to try it with the microphone you can update your transcriber creation line to use a MicTranscriber instead, but if you want to start with a .wav file for testing purposes here's how you feed that in:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">    audio_data, sample_rate = load_wav_file(wav_path)\n\n    transcriber.start()\n\n    # Loop through the audio data in chunks to simulate live streaming\n    # from a microphone or other source.\n    chunk_duration = 0.1\n    chunk_size = int(chunk_duration * sample_rate)\n    for i in range(0, len(audio_data), chunk_size):\n        chunk = audio_data[i: i + chunk_size]\n        transcriber.add_audio(chunk, sample_rate)\n\n    transcriber.stop()\n</code></pre> \n<p>The important things to notice here are:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>We create an array of mono audio data from a wav file, using the convenience <code>load_wav_file()</code> function that's part of the Moonshine library.</li> \n <li>We start the transcriber to activate its processing code.</li> \n <li>The loop adds audio in chunks. These chunks can be any length and any sample rate, the library takes care of all the housekeeping.</li> \n <li>As audio is added, the event listener you added will be called, giving information about the latest speech.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>In a real application you'd be calling <code>add_audio()</code> from an audio handler that's receiving it from your source. Since the library can handle arbitrary durations and sample rates, just make sure it's mono and otherwise feed it in as-is.</p> \n<p>The transcriber analyses the speech at a default interval of every 500ms of input. You can change this with the <code>update_interval</code> argument to the transcriber constructor. For streaming models most of the work is done as the audio is being added, and it's automatically done at the end of a phrase, so changing this won't usually affect the workload or latency massively.</p> \n<p>The key takeaway is that you usually don't need to worry about the transcript data structure itself, the event system tells you when something important happens. You can manually trigger a transcript update by calling <code>update_transcription()</code> which returns a transcript object with all of the information about the current session if you do need to examine the state.</p> \n<p>By calling <code>start()</code> and <code>stop()</code> on a transcriber (or stream) we're beginning and ending a session. Each session has one transcript document associated with it, and it is started fresh on every <code>start()</code> call, so you should make copies of any data you need from the transcript object before that.</p> \n<p>The transcriber class also offers a simpler <code>transcribe_without_streaming()</code> method, for when you have an array of data from the past that you just want to analyse, such as a file or recording.</p> \n<p>We also offer a specialization of the base <code>Transcriber</code> class called <code>MicTranscriber</code>. How this is implemented will depend on the language and platform, but it should provide a transcriber that's automatically attached to the main microphone on the system. This makes it straightforward to start transcribing speech from that common source, since it supports all of the same listener callbacks as the base class.</p> \n<h4>Transcription Event Flow</h4> \n<p>The main communication channel between the library and your application is through events that are passed to any listener functions you have registered. There are four major event types:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><code>LineStarted</code>. This is sent to listeners when the beginning of a new speech segment is detected. It may or may not contain any text, but since it's dispatched near the start of an utterance, that text is likely to change over time.</li> \n <li><code>LineUpdated</code>. Called whenever any of the information about a line changes, including the duration, audio data, and text.</li> \n <li><code>LineTextChanged</code>. Called only when the text associated with a line is updated. This is a subset of <code>LineUpdated</code> that focuses on the common need to refresh the text shown to users as often as possible to keep the experience interactive.</li> \n <li><code>LineCompleted</code>. Sent when we detect that someone has paused speaking, and we've ended the current segment. The line data structure has the final values for the text, duration, and speaker ID.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>We offer some guarantees about these events:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><code>LineStarted</code> is always called exactly once for any segment.</li> \n <li><code>LineCompleted</code> is always called exactly once after <code>LineStarted</code> for any segment.</li> \n <li><code>LineUpdated</code> and <code>LineTextChanged</code> will only ever be called after the <code>LineStarted</code> and before the <code>LineCompleted</code> events for a segment.</li> \n <li>Those update events are not guaranteed to be called (and in practice can be disabled by setting <code>update_interval</code> to a very large value).</li> \n <li>There will only be one line active at any one time for any given stream.</li> \n <li>Once <code>LineCompleted</code> has been called, the library will never alter that line's data again.</li> \n <li>If <code>stop()</code> is called on a transcriber or stream, any active lines will have <code>LineCompleted</code> called.</li> \n <li>Each line has a 64-bit <code>lineId</code> that is designed to be unique enough to avoid collisions.</li> \n <li>This <code>lineId</code> remains the same for the line over time, from the first <code>LineStarted</code> event onwards.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Getting Started with Command Recognition</h3> \n<p>If you want your application to respond when users talk, you need to understand what they're saying. The previous generation of voice interfaces could only recognize speech that was phrased in exactly the form they expected. For example \"Alexa, turn on living-room lights\" might work, but \"Alexa, lights on in the living room please\" might not. The general problem of figuring out what a user wants from natural speech is known as intent recognition. There have been decades of research into this area, but the rise of transformer-based LLMs has given us new tools. We have integrated some of these advances into Moonshine Voice's command recognition API.</p> \n<p>The basic idea is that your application registers some general actions you're interested in, like \"Turn the lights on\" or \"Move left\", and then Moonshine sends an event when the user says something that matches the meaning of those phrases. It works a lot like a graphical user interface - you define a button (action) and an event callback that is triggered when the user presses that button.</p> \n<p>To give it a try for yourself, run this built-in example:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">python -m moonshine_voice.intent_recognizer\n</code></pre> \n<p>This will present you with a menu of command phrases, and then start listening to the microphone. If you say something that's a variant on one of the phrases you'll see a \"triggered\" log message telling you which action was matched, along with how confident the system is in the match.</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">📝 Let there be light.\n'TURN ON THE LIGHTS' triggered by 'Let there be light.' with 76% confidence\n</code></pre> \n<p>To show that you can modify these at run time, try supplying your own list of phrases as a comma-separated string argument to <code>--intents</code>.</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">python -m moonshine_voice.intent_recognizer --intents \"Turn left, turn right, go backwards, go forward\"\n</code></pre> \n<p>This could be the core command set to control a robot's movement for example. It's worth spending a bit of time experimenting with different wordings of the command phrases, and different variations on the user side, to get a feel for how the system works.</p> \n<p>Under the hood this is all accomplished using two main classes. We've met the <code>MicTranscriber</code> above, the new addition is <code>IntentRecognizer</code>. This listens to the results of the transcriber, fuzzily matches completed lines against any intents that have been registered with it, and calls back the client-supplied code.</p> \n<p>The fuzzy matching uses a sentence-embedding model based on Gemma300m, so the first step is downloading it and getting the path:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">embedding_model_path, embedding_model_arch = get_embedding_model(\n    args.embedding_model, args.quantization\n)\n</code></pre> \n<p>Once we have the model's location, we create an <code>IntentRecognizer</code> using that path. The only other argument is the <code>threshold</code> we use for fuzzy matching. It's between 0 and 1, with low numbers producing more matches but at the cost of less accuracy, and vice versa for high values.</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">intent_recognizer = IntentRecognizer(\n    model_path=embedding_model_path,\n    model_arch=embedding_model_arch,\n    model_variant=args.quantization,\n    threshold=args.threshold,\n)\n</code></pre> \n<p>Next we tell the recognizer what kinds of phrases to listen out for, and what to do when there's a match.</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">def on_intent_triggered_on(trigger: str, utterance: str, similarity: float):\n    print(f\"\\n'{trigger.upper()}' triggered by '{utterance}' with {similarity:.0%} confidence\")\n\nfor intent in intents:\n    intent_recognizer.register_intent(intent, on_intent_triggered_on)\n</code></pre> \n<p>The recognizer supports the transcript event listener interface, so the final stage is adding it as a listener to the <code>MicTranscriber</code>.</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">mic_transcriber.add_listener(intent_recognizer)\n</code></pre> \n<p>Once you start the transcriber, it will listen out for any variations on the supplied phrases, and call <code>on_intent_triggered_on()</code> whenever there's a match.</p> \n<p>The current intent recognition is designed for full-sentence matching, which works well for straightforward commands, but we will be expanding into more advanced \"slot filling\" techniques in the future, to handle extracting the quantity from \"I want ten bananas\" for example.</p> \n<h3>Examples</h3> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/examples/\"><code>examples</code></a> folder has code samples organized by platform. We offer these for <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/examples/android/\">Android</a>, <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/examples/c++/\">portable C++</a>, <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/examples/ios/\">iOS</a>, <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/examples/macos/\">MacOS</a>, <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/examples/python\">Python</a>, and <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/examples/windows/\">Windows</a>. We have tried to use the most common build system for each platform, so Android uses Android Studio and Maven, iOS and MacOS use Xcode and Swift, while Windows uses Visual Studio.</p> \n<p>The examples usually include one minimal project that just creates a transcriber and then feeds it data from a WAV file, and another that's pulling audio from a microphone using the platform's default framework for accessing audio devices.</p> \n<h3>Adding the Library to your own App</h3> \n<p>We distribute the library through the most widely-used package managers for each platform. Here's how you can use these to add the framework to an existing project on different systems.</p> \n<h4>Python</h4> \n<p>The Python package is <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/moonshine-voice/\">hosted on PyPi</a>, so all you should need to do to install it is <code>pip install moonshine-voice</code>, and then <code>import moonshine_voice</code> in your project.</p> \n<h4>iOS or MacOS</h4> \n<p>For iOS we use the Swift Package Manager, with <a href=\"https://github.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine-swift/\">an auto-updated GitHub repository</a> holding each version. To use this right-click on the file view sidebar in Xcode and choose \"Add Package Dependencies...\" from the menu. A dialog should open up, paste <code>https://github.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine-swift/</code> into the top search box and you should see <code>moonshine-swift</code>. Select it and choose \"Add Package\", and it should be added to your project. You should now be able to <code>import MoonshineVoice</code> and use the library. You will need to add any model files you use to your app bundle and ensure they're copied during the deployment phase, so they can be accessed on-device.</p> \n<p>For reference purposes you can find Xcode projects with these changes applied in <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/examples/ios/Transcriber\"><code>examples/ios/Transcriber</code></a> and <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/examples/macos/BasicTranscription/\"><code>examples/macos/BasicTranscription</code></a>.</p> \n<h4>Android</h4> \n<p>On Android we publish <a href=\"https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/ai.moonshine/moonshine-voice\">the package to Maven</a>. To include it in your project using Android Studio and Gradle, first add the version number you want to the <code>gradle/libs.versions.toml</code> file by inserting a line in the <code>[versions]</code> section, for example <code>moonshineVoice = \"0.0.48\"</code>. Then in the <code>[libraries]</code> part, add a reference to the package: <code>moonshine-voice = { group = \"ai.moonshine\", name = \"moonshine-voice\", version.ref = \"moonshineVoice\" }</code>.</p> \n<p>Finally, in your <code>app/build.gradle.kts</code> add the library to the <code>dependencies</code> list: <code>implementation(libs.moonshine.voice)</code>. You can find a working example of all these changes in [<code>examples/android/Transcriber</code>].</p> \n<h4>Windows/C++</h4> \n<p>We couldn't find a single package manager that is used by most Windows developers, so instead we've made the raw library and headers available as a download. The script in <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/examples/windows/cli-transcriber/download-lib.bat\"><code>examples/windows/cli-transcriber/download-lib.bat</code></a> will fetch these for you. You'll see an <code>include</code> folder that you should add to the include search paths in your project settings, and a <code>lib</code> directory that you should add to the include search paths. Then add all of the library files in the <code>lib</code> folder to your project's linker dependencies.</p> \n<p>The recommended interface to use on Windows is the C++ language binding. This is a header-only library that offers a higher-level API than the underlying C version. You can <code>#include \"moonshine-cpp.h\"</code> to access Moonshine from your C++ code. If you want to see an example of all these changes together, take a look at <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/examples/windows/cli-transcriber\"><code>examples/windows/cli-transcriber</code></a>.</p> \n<h3>Debugging</h3> \n<h4>Console Logs</h4> \n<p>The library is designed to help you understand what's going wrong when you hit an issue. If something isn't working as expected, the first place to look is the console for log messages. Whenever there's a failure point or an exception within the core library, you should see a message that adds more information about what went wrong. Your language bindings should also recognize when the core library has returned an error and raise an appropriate exception, but sometimes the logs can be helpful because they contain more details.</p> \n<h4>Input Saving</h4> \n<p>If no errors are being reported but the quality of the transcription isn't what you expect, it's worth ruling out an issue with the audio data that the transcriber is receiving. To make this easier, you can pass in the <code>save_input_wav_path</code> option when you create a transcriber. That will save any audio received into .wav files in the folder you specify. Here's a Python example:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">python -m moonshine_voice.transcriber --options='save_input_wav_path=.'\n</code></pre> \n<p>This will run test audio through a transcriber, and write out the audio it has received into an <code>input_1.wav</code> file in the current directory. If you're running multiple streams, you'll see <code>input_2.wav</code>, etc for each additional one. These wavs only contain the audio data from the latest session, and are overwritten after each one is started. Listening to these files should help you confirm that the input you're providing is as you expect it, and not distorted or corrupted.</p> \n<h4>API Call Logging</h4> \n<p>If you're running into errors it can be hard to keep track of the timeline of your interactions with the library. The <code>log_api_calls</code> option will print out the underlying API calls that have been triggered to the console, so you can investigate any ordering or timing issues.</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">uv run -m moonshine_voice.transcriber --options='log_api_calls=true'\n</code></pre> \n<h3>Building from Source</h3> \n<p>If you want to debug into the library internals, or add instrumentation to help understand its operation, or add improvements or customizations, all of the source is available for you to build it for yourself.</p> \n<h4>Cmake</h4> \n<p>The core engine of the library is contained in the <code>core</code> folder of this repo. It's written in C++ with a C interface for easy integration with other languages. We use cmake to build on all our platforms, and so the easiest way to get started is something like this:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">cd core\nmkdir -p build\ncd build\ncmake ..\ncmake --build .\n</code></pre> \n<p>After that completes you should have a set of binary executables you can run on your own system. These executables are all unit tests, and expect to be run from the <code>test-assets</code> folder. You can run the build and test process in one step using the <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/scripts/run-core-tests.sh\"><code>scripts/run-core-tests.sh</code></a>, or <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/scripts/run-core-tests.bat\"><code>scripts/run-core-tests.bat</code></a> for Windows. All tests should compile and run without any errors.</p> \n<h4>Language Bindings</h4> \n<p>There are various scripts for building for different platforms and languages, but to see examples of how to build for all of the supported systems you should look at <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/scripts/build-all-platforms.sh\"><code>scripts/build-all-platforms.sh</code></a>. This is the script we call for every release, and it builds all of the artifacts we upload to the various package manager systems.</p> \n<p>The different platforms and languages have a layer on top of the C interfaces to enable idiomatic use of the library within the different environments. The major systems have their own top-level folders in this repo, for example: <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/python/\"><code>python</code></a>, <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/android/\"><code>android</code></a>, and <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/swift/\"><code>swift</code></a> for iOS and MacOS. This is where you'll find the code that calls the underlying core library routines, and handles the event system for each platform.</p> \n<h4>Porting</h4> \n<p>If you have a device that isn't supported, you can try <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/#cmake\">building using cmake</a> on your system. The only major dependency that the C++ core library has is <a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime\">the Onnx Runtime</a>. We include <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/core/third-party/onnxruntime/lib/\">pre-built binary library files</a> for all our supported systems, but you'll need to find or build your own version if the libraries we offer don't cover your use case.</p> \n<p>If you want to call this library from a language we don't support, then you should take a look at <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/core/moonshine-c-api.h\">the C interface bindings</a>. Most languages have some way to call into C functions, so you can use these and the binding examples for other languages to guide your implementation.</p> \n<h3>Downloading Models</h3> \n<p>The easiest way to get the model files is using the Python module. After <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/#python\">installing it</a> run the downloader like this:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">python -m moonshine_voice.download --language en\n</code></pre> \n<p>You can use either the two-letter code or the English name for the <code>language</code> argument. If you want to see which languages are supported by your current version they're <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/#available-models\">listed below</a>, or you can supply a bogus language as the argument to this command:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">python -m moonshine_voice.download --language foo\n</code></pre> \n<p>You can also optionally request a specific model architecture using the <code>model-arch</code> flag, chosen from the numbers in <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/core/moonshine-c-api.h\">moonshine-c-api.h</a>. If no architecture is set, the script will load the highest-quality model available.</p> \n<p>The download script will log the location of the downloaded model files and the model architecture, for example:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">encoder_model.ort: 100%|███████████████████████████████████████████████████████| 29.9M/29.9M [00:00&lt;00:00, 34.5MB/s]\ndecoder_model_merged.ort: 100%|██████████████████████████████████████████████████| 104M/104M [00:02&lt;00:00, 52.6MB/s]\ntokenizer.bin: 100%|█████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████| 244k/244k [00:00&lt;00:00, 1.44MB/s]\nModel download url: https://download.moonshine.ai/model/base-en/quantized/base-en\nModel components: ['encoder_model.ort', 'decoder_model_merged.ort', 'tokenizer.bin']\nModel arch: 1\nDownloaded model path: /Users/petewarden/Library/Caches/moonshine_voice/download.moonshine.ai/model/base-en/quantized/base-en\n</code></pre> \n<p>The last two lines tell you which model architecture is being used, and where the model files are on disk. By default it uses your user cache directory, which is <code>~/Library/Caches/moonshine_voice</code> on MacOS, but you can use a different location by setting the <code>MOONSHINE_VOICE_CACHE</code> environment variable before running the script.</p> \n<h3>Benchmarks</h3> \n<p>The core library includes a benchmarking tool that simulates processing live audio by loading a .wav audio file and feeding it in chunks to the model. To run it:</p> \n<pre><code>cd core\nmd build\ncd build\ncmake ..\ncmake --build . --config Release\n./benchmark\n</code></pre> \n<p>This will report the absolute time taken to process the audio, what percentage of the audio file's duration that is, and the average latency for a response.</p> \n<p>The percentage is helpful because it approximates how much of a compute load the model will be on your hardware. For example, if it shows 20% then that means the speech processing will take a fifth of the compute time when running in your application, leaving 80% for the rest of your code.</p> \n<p>The latency metric needs a bit of explanation. What most applications care about is how soon they are notified about a phrase after the user has finished talking, since this determines how fast the product can respond. As with any user interface, the time between speech ending and the app doing something determines how responsive the voice interface feels, with a goal of keeping it below 200ms. The latency figure logged here is the average time between when the library determines the user has stopped talking and the delivery of the final transcript of that phrase to the client. This is where streaming models have the most impact, since they do a lot of their work upfront, while speech is still happening, so they can usually finish very quickly.</p> \n<p>By default the benchmark binary uses the Tiny English model that's embedded in the framework, but you can pass in the <code>--model-path</code> and <code>--model-arch</code> parameters to choose <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/#downloading-models\">one that you've downloaded</a>.</p> \n<p>You can also choose how often the transcript should be updated using the <code>--transcription-interval</code> argument. This defaults to 0.5 seconds, but the right value will depend on how fast your application needs updates. Longer intervals reduce the compute required a bit, at the cost of slower updates.</p> \n<h4>Whisper Comparisons</h4> \n<p>For platforms that support Python, you can run the <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/scripts/run-benchmarks.py\"><code>scripts/run-benchmarks.py</code></a> script which will evaluate similar metrics, with the advantage that it can also download the models so you don't need to worry about path handling.</p> \n<p>It also evaluates equivalent Whisper models. This is a pretty opinionated benchmark that looks at the latency and total compute cost of the two families of models in a situation that is representative of many common real-time voice applications' requirements:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Speech needs to be responded to as quickly as possible once a user completes a phrase.</li> \n <li>The phrases are of durations between a range of one to ten seconds.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>These are very different requirements from bulk offline processing scenarios, where the overall throughput of the system is more important, and so the latency on a single segment of speech is less important than the overall throughput of the system. This allows optimizations like batch processing.</p> \n<p>We are not claiming that Whisper is not a great model for offline processing, but we do want to highlight the advantages we that Moonshine offers for live speech applications with real-time latency requirements.</p> \n<p>The experimental setup is as follows:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>We use the two_cities.wav audio file as a test case, since it has a mix of short and long phrases. You can vary this by passing in your own audio file with the --wav_path argument.</li> \n <li>We use the Moonshine Tiny, Base, Tiny Streaming, Small Streaming, and Medium Streaming models.</li> \n <li>We compare these to the Whisper Tiny, Base, Small, and Large v3 models. Since the Moonshine Medium Streaming model achieves lower WER than Whisper Large v3 we compare those two, otherwise we compare each with their namesake.</li> \n <li>We use the Moonshine VAD segmenter to split the audio into phrases, and feed each phrase to Whisper for transcription.</li> \n <li>Response latency for both models is measured as the time between a phrase being identified as complete by the VAD segmenter and the transcribed text being returned. For Whisper this means the full transcription time, but since the Moonshine models are streaming we can do a lot of the work while speech is still happening, so the latency is much lower.</li> \n <li>We measure the total compute cost of the models by totalling the duration of the audio processing times for each model, and then expressing that as a percentage of the total audio duration. This is the inverse of the commonly used real-time factor (RTF) metric, but it reflects the compute load required for a real-time application.</li> \n <li>We're using faster-whisper for Whisper, since that seems to provide the best cross-platform performance. We're also sticking with the CPU, since most applications can't rely on GPU or NPU acceleration being present on all the platforms they target. We know there are a lot of great GPU/NPU-accelerated Whisper implementations out there, but these aren't portable enough to be useful for the applications we care about.</li> \n</ul> \n<h2>Models</h2> \n<p>Moonshine Voice is based on a family of speech to text models created by the team at Moonshine AI. If you want to download models to use with the framework, you can use <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/#downloading-models\">the Python package to access them</a>. This section contains more information about the history and characteristics of the models we offer.</p> \n<h3>Papers</h3> \n<p>These research papers are a good resource for understanding the architectures and performance strategies behind the models:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15608\"><strong>Moonshine: Speech Recognition for Live Transcription and Voice Commands</strong></a>: Describes the first-generation model architecture, which enabled flexible-duration input windows, improving on Whisper's fixed 30 second requirement.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02523\"><strong>Flavors of Moonshine: Tiny Specialized ASR Models for Edge Devices</strong></a>: How we improved accuracy for non-English languages by training mono-lingual models.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12241\"><strong>Moonshine v2: Ergodic Streaming Encoder ASR for Latency-Critical Speech Applications</strong></a>: Introduces our approach to streaming, and the advantages it offers for live voice applications.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Available Models</h3> \n<p>Here are the models currently available.

The other languages were evaluated using the FLEURS dataset and the <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/scripts/eval-model-accuracy.py\"><code>scripts/eval-model-accuracy</code></a> script, with the character or word error rate chosen per language.</p> \n<p>One common issue to watch out for if you're using models that don't use the Latin alphabet (so any languages except English and Spanish) is that you'll need to set the <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/#transcriber-options\"><code>max_tokens_per_second</code> option</a> to 13.0 when you create the transcriber. This is because the most common pattern for hallucinations is endlessly repeating the last few words, and our heuristic to detect this is to check if there's an unusually high number of tokens for the duration of a segment. Unfortunately the base number of tokens per second for non-Latin languages is much higher than for English, thanks to how we're tokenizing, so you have to manually set the threshold higher to avoid cutting off valid outputs.</p> \n<h3>Domain Customization</h3> \n<p>It's often useful to be able to calibrate a speech to text model towards certain words that you're expecting to hear in your application, whether it's technical terms, slang, or a particular dialect or accent. <a href=\"mailto:contact@moonshine.ai\">Moonshine AI offers full retraining using our internal dataset for customization as a commercial service</a> and we do hope to support free lighter-weight approaches in the future. You can find a community project working on this at <a href=\"https://github.com/pierre-cheneau/finetune-moonshine-asr\">github.com/pierre-cheneau/finetune-moonshine-asr</a>.</p> \n<h2>API Reference</h2> \n<p>This documentation covers the Python API, but the same functions and classes are present in all the other supported languages, just with native adaptations (for example CamelCase). You should be able to use this as a reference for all platforms the library runs on.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/#data-structures\">Data Structures</a> \n  <ul> \n   <li><a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/#transcriberline\">TranscriberLine</a></li> \n   <li><a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/#transcript\">Transcript</a></li> \n   <li><a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/#transcriptevent\">TranscriptEvent</a></li> \n   <li><a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/#intentmatch\">IntentMatch</a></li> \n  </ul> </li> \n <li><a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/#classes\">Classes</a> \n  <ul> \n   <li><a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/#transcriber\">Transcriber</a></li> \n   <li><a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/#mictranscriber\">MicTranscriber</a></li> \n   <li><a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/#stream\">Stream</a></li> \n   <li><a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/#transcripteventlistener\">TranscriptEventListener</a></li> \n   <li><a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/#intentrecognizer\">IntentRecognizer</a></li> \n  </ul> </li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Data Structures</h3> \n<h4>TranscriberLine</h4> \n<p>Represents a single \"line\" or speech segment in a transcript. It includes information about the timing, speaker, and text content of the utterance, as well as state such as whether the speech is ongoing or done. If you're building an application that involves transcription, this data structure has all of the information available about each line of speech. Be aware that each line can be updated multiple times with new text and other information as the user keeps speaking.</p> \n<ul> \n <li> <p><code>text</code>: A string containing the UTF-8 encoded text that has been extracted from the audio of this segment.</p> </li> \n <li> <p><code>start_time</code>: A float value representing the time in seconds since the start of the current session that the current utterance was first detected.</p> </li> \n <li> <p><code>duration</code>: A float that represents the duration in seconds of the current utterance.</p> </li> \n <li> <p><code>line_id</code>: An unsigned 64-bit integer that represents a line in a collision-resistant way, for use in storage and ensuring the application can keep track of lines as they change over time. See <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/#transcription-event-flow\">Transcription Event Flow</a> for more details.</p> </li> \n <li> <p><code>is_complete</code>: A boolean that is false until the segment has been completed, and true for the remainder of the line's lifetime.</p> </li> \n <li> <p><code>is_updated</code>: A boolean that's true if any information about the line has changed since the last time the transcript was updated. Since the transcript will be periodically updated internally by the library as you add audio chunks, you can't rely on polling this to detect changes. You should rely on the event/listener flow to catch modifications instead. This applies to all of the booleans below too.</p> </li> \n <li> <p><code>is_new</code>: A boolean indicating whether the line has been added to the transcript by the last update call.</p> </li> \n <li> <p><code>has_text_changed</code>: A boolean that's set if the contents of the line's text was modified by the last transcript update. If this is set, <code>is_updated</code> will always be set too, but if other properties of the line (for example the duration or the audio data) have changed but the text remains the same, then <code>is_updated</code> can be true while <code>has_text_changed</code> is false.</p> </li> \n <li> <p><code>has_speaker_id</code>: Whether a speaker has been identified for this line. Unless the <code>identify_speakers</code> option passed to the Transcriber is set to false, this will always be true by the time the line is complete, and potentially it may be set earlier. The speaker identification process is still experimental, so the current accuracy may not be reliable enough for some applications.</p> </li> \n <li> <p><code>speaker_id</code>: A unique-ish unsigned 64-bit integer that is designed for storage or used to identify the same speaker across multiple sessions.</p> </li> \n <li> <p><code>speaker_index</code>: An integer that represents the order in which the speaker appeared in the transcript, to make it easy to give speakers default names like \"Speaker 1:\", etc.</p> </li> \n <li> <p><code>audio_data</code>: An array of 32-bit floats representing the raw audio data that the line is based on, as 16KHz mono PCM data between 0.0 and 1.0. This can be useful for further processing (for example to drive a visual indicator or to feed into a specialized speech to text model after the line is complete).</p> </li> \n</ul> \n<h4>Transcript</h4> \n<p>A Transcript contains a list of TranscriberLines, arranged in descending time order. The transcript is reset at every <code>Transcriber.start()</code> call, so if you need to retain information from it, you should make explicit copies. Most applications won't work with this structure, since all of the same information is available through event callbacks.</p> \n<h4>TranscriptEvent</h4> \n<p>Contains information about a change to the transcript. It has four subclasses, which are explained in more detail in <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/#transcription-event-flow\">the transcription event flow section</a>. Most of the information is contained in the <code>line</code> member, but there's also a <code>stream_handle</code> that your application can use to tell the source of a line if you're running multiple streams.</p> \n<h4>IntentMatch</h4> \n<p>This event is sent to any listeners you have registered when an <code>IntentRecognizer</code> finds a match to a command you've specified.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><code>trigger_phrase</code>: The string representing the canonical command, exactly as you registered it with the recognizer.</li> \n <li><code>utterance</code>: The text of the utterance that triggered the match.</li> \n <li><code>similarity</code>: A float value that reflects how confident the recognizer is that the utterance has the same meaning as the command, with zero being the least confident and one the most.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Classes</h3> \n<h4>Transcriber</h4> \n<p>Handles the speech to text pipeline.</p> \n<ul> \n <li> <p><a id=\"transcriber-init\"></a><code>__init__()</code>: Loads and initializes the transcriber.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><code>model_path</code>: The path to the directory holding the component model files needed for the complete flow. Note that this is a path to the <strong>folder</strong>, not an individual <strong>file</strong>. You can download and get a path to a cached version of the standard models using the <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/#downloading-models\">download_model()</a> function.</li> \n   <li><code>model_arch</code>: The architecture of the model to load, from the selection defined in <code>ModelArch</code>.</li> \n   <li><code>update_interval</code>: By default the transcriber will periodically run text transcription as new audio data is fed, so that update events can be triggered. This value is how often the speech to text model should be run. You can set this to a large duration to suppress updates between a line starting and ending, but because the streaming models do a lot of their work before the final speech to text stage, this may not reduce overall latency by much.</li> \n   <li><a id=\"transcriber-options\"></a><code>options</code>: These are flags that affect how the transcription process works inside the library, often enabling performance optimizations or debug logging. They are passed as a dictionary mapping strings to strings, even if the values are to be interpreted as numbers - for example <code>{\"max_tokens_per_second\", \"15\"}</code>. \n    <ul> \n     <li><code>skip_transcription</code>: If you only want the voice-activity detection and segmentation, but want to do further processing in your app, you can set this to \"true\" and then use the <code>audioData</code> array in each line.</li> \n     <li><code>max_tokens_per_second</code>: The models occassionally get caught in an infinite decoder loop, where the same words are repeated over and over again. As a heuristic to catch this we compare the number of tokens in the current run to the duration of the audio, and if there seem to be too many tokens we truncate the decoding. By default this is set to 6.5, but for non-English languages where the models produce a lot more raw tokens per second, you may want to bump this to 13.0.</li> \n     <li><code>transcription_interval</code>: How often to run transcription, in seconds.</li> \n     <li><code>vad_threshold</code>: Controls the sensitivity of the initial voice-activity detection stage that decides how to break raw audio into segments. This defaults to 0.5, with lower values creating longer segments, potentially with more background noise sections, and higher values breaking up speech into smaller chunks, at the risk of losing some actual speech by clipping.</li> \n     <li><code>save_input_wav_path</code>: One of the most common causes of poor transcription quality is incorrect conversion or corruption of the audio that's fed into the pipeline. If you set this option to a folder path, the transcriber will save out exactly what it has received as 16KHz mono WAV files, so you can ensure that your input audio is as you expect.</li> \n     <li><code>log_api_calls</code>: Another debugging option, turning this on causes all calls to the C API entry points in the library to write out information on their arguments to stderr or the console each time they're run.</li> \n     <li><code>log_ort_runs</code>: Prints information about the ONNXRuntime inference runs and how long they take.</li> \n     <li><code>vad_window_duration</code>: The VAD runs every 30ms, but to get higher-confidence values we average the results over time. This value is the time in seconds to average over. The default is 0.5s, shorter durations will spot speech faster at the cost of lower accuracy, higher values may increase accuracy, but at the cost of missing shorter utterances.</li> \n     <li><code>vad_look_behind_sample_count</code>: Because we're averaging over time, the mean VAD signal will lag behind the initial speech detection. To compensate for that, when speech is detected we pull in some of the audio immediately before the average passed the threshold. This value is the number of samples to prepend, and defaults to 8192 (all at 16KHz).</li> \n     <li><code>vad_max_segment_duration</code>: It can be hard to find gaps in rapid-fire speech, but a lot of applications want their text in chunks that aren't endless. This option sets the longest duration a line can be before it's marked as complete and a new segment is started. The default is 15 seconds, and to increase the chance that a natural break is found, the <code>vad_threshold</code> is linearly decreased over time from two thirds of the maximum duration until the maximum is reached.</li> \n     <li><code>identify_speakers</code>: A boolean that controls whether to run the speaker identification stage in the pipeline.</li> \n    </ul> </li> \n  </ul> </li> \n <li> <p><a id=\"transcriber-transcribe-without-streaming\"></a><code>transcribe_without_streaming()</code>: A convenience function to extract text from a non-live audio source, such as a file. We optimize for streaming use cases, so you're probably better off using libraries that specialize in bulk, batched transcription if you use this a lot and have performance constraints. This will still call any registered event listeners as it processes the lines, so this can be useful to test your application using pre-recorded files, or to easily integrate offline audio sources.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><code>audio_data</code>: An array of 32-bit float values, representing mono PCM audio between -1.0 and 1.0, to be analyzed for speech.</li> \n   <li><code>sample_rate</code>: The number of samples per second. The library uses this to convert to its working rate (16KHz) internally.</li> \n   <li><code>flags</code>: Integer, currently unused.</li> \n  </ul> </li> \n <li> <p><a id=\"transcriber-start\"></a><code>start()</code>: Begins a new transcription session. You need to call this after you've created the <code>Transcriber</code> and before you add any audio.</p> </li> \n <li> <p><a id=\"transcriber-stop\"></a><code>stop()</code>: Ends a transcription session. If a speech segment was still active, it's marked as complete and the appropriate event handlers are called.</p> </li> \n <li> <p><a id=\"transcriber-add-audio\"></a><code>add_audio()</code>: Call this every time you have a new chunk of audio from your input, to begin processing. The size and sample rate of the audio should be whatever's natural for your source, since the library will handle all conversions.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><code>audio_data</code>: Array of 32-bit floats representing a mono PCM chunk of audio.</li> \n   <li><code>sample_rate</code>: How many samples per second are present in the input audio. The library uses this to convert the data to its preferred rate.</li> \n  </ul> </li> \n <li> <p><a id=\"transcriber-update-transcription\"></a><code>update_transcription</code>: The transcript is usually updated periodically as audio data is added, but if you need to trigger one yourself, for example when a user presses refresh, or want access to the complete transcript, you can call this manually.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><code>flags</code>: Integer holding flags that are combined using bitwise or (<code>|</code>). \n    <ul> \n     <li><code>MOONSHINE_FLAG_FORCE_UPDATE</code>: By default the transcriber returns a cached version of the transcript if less than 200ms of new audio has come in since the last transcription, but by setting this you can ensure that a transcription happens regardless.</li> \n    </ul> </li> \n  </ul> </li> \n <li> <p><a id=\"transcriber-create-stream\"></a><code>create_stream()</code>: If your application is taking audio input from multiple sources, for example a microphone and system audio, then you'll want to create multiple streams on a single transcriber to avoid loading multiple copies of the models. Each stream has its own transcript, and line events are tagged with the stream handle they came from. You don't need to worry about this if you only need to deal with a single input though, just use the <code>Transcriber</code> class's <code>start()</code>, <code>stop()</code>, etc. This function returns <code>Stream</code> class object.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><code>flags</code>: Integer, reserved for future expansion.</li> \n   <li><code>update_interval</code>: Period in seconds between transcription updates.</li> \n  </ul> </li> \n <li> <p><a id=\"transcriber-add-listener\"></a><code>add_listener()</code>: Registers a callable object with the transcriber. This object will be called back as audio is fed in and text is extracted.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><code>listener</code>: This is often a subclass of <code>TranscriptEventListener</code>, but can be a plain function. It defines what code is called when a speech event happens.</li> \n  </ul> </li> \n <li> <p><a id=\"transcriber-remove-listener\"></a><code>remove_listener()</code>: Deletes a listener so that it no longer receives events.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><code>listener</code>: An object you previously passed into <code>add_listener()</code>.</li> \n  </ul> </li> \n <li> <p><a id=\"transcriber-remove-all-listeners\"></a><code>remove_all_listeners()</code>: Deletes all registered listeners so than none of them receive events anymore.</p> </li> \n</ul> \n<h4>MicTranscriber</h4> \n<p>This class supports the []<code>start()</code>](#transcriber-start), <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/#transcriber-stop\"><code>stop()</code></a> and listener functions of <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/#transcriber\"><code>Transcriber</code></a>, but internally creates and attaches to the system's microphone input, so you don't need to call <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine/main/#transcriber-add-audio\"><code>add_audio()</code></a> yourself. In Python this uses the <a href=\"\"><code>sounddevice</code> library</a>, but in other languages the class uses the native audio API under the hood.</p> \n<h4>Stream</h4> \n<p>The access point for when you need to feed multiple audio inputs into a single transcriber.

Override any or all of <code>on_line_started()</code>, <code>on_line_updated()</code>, <code>on_line_text_changed()</code>, and <code>on_line_completed()</code>, and they'll be called back when the corresponding event occurs.</p> \n<h4>IntentRecognizer</h4> \n<p>A specialized kind of event listener that you add as a listener to a <code>Transcriber</code>, and it then analyzes the transcription results to determine if any of the specified commands have been spoken, using natural-language fuzzy matching.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a id=\"intentrecognizer-init\"></a><code>__init__()</code>: Constructs a new recognizer, loading required models. \n  <ul> \n   <li><code>model_path</code>: String holding a path to a folder that contains the required embedding model files.

In Google Workspace, a service account can impersonate a user via <strong>domain-wide delegation</strong> (admin-controlled) and access APIs like Gmail/Calendar/Drive as that user.</p> \n<p>In <code>gog</code>, service accounts are an <strong>optional auth method</strong> that can be configured per account email. If a service account key is configured for an account, it takes precedence over OAuth refresh tokens (see <code>gog auth list</code>).</p> \n<h4>1) Create a Service Account (Google Cloud)</h4> \n<ol> \n <li>Create (or pick) a Google Cloud project.</li> \n <li>Enable the APIs you’ll use (e.g. Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Sheets, Docs, People, Tasks, Cloud Identity).</li> \n <li>Go to <strong>IAM &amp; Admin → Service Accounts</strong> and create a service account.</li> \n <li>In the service account details, enable <strong>Domain-wide delegation</strong>.</li> \n <li>Create a key (<strong>Keys → Add key → Create new key → JSON</strong>) and download the JSON key file.</li> \n</ol> \n<h4>2) Allowlist scopes (Google Workspace Admin Console)</h4> \n<p>Domain-wide delegation is enforced by Workspace admin settings.</p> \n<ol> \n <li>Open <strong>Admin console → Security → API controls → Domain-wide delegation</strong>.</li> \n <li>Add a new API client: \n  <ul> \n   <li>Client ID: use the service account’s “Client ID” from Google Cloud.</li> \n   <li>OAuth scopes: comma-separated list of scopes you want to allow (copy from <code>gog auth services</code> and/or your <code>gog auth add --services ...</code> usage).</li> \n  </ul> </li> \n</ol> \n<p>If a scope is missing from the allowlist, service-account token minting can fail (or API calls will 403 with insufficient permissions).</p> \n<h4>3) Configure <code>gog</code> to use the service account</h4> \n<p>Store the key for the user you want to impersonate:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">gog auth service-account set you@yourdomain.com --key ~/Downloads/service-account.json\n</code></pre> \n<p>Verify <code>gog</code> is preferring the service account for that account:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">gog --account you@yourdomain.com auth status\ngog auth list\n</code></pre> \n<h3>Google Keep (Workspace only)</h3> \n<p>Keep requires Workspace + domain-wide delegation. You can configure it via the generic service-account command above (recommended), or the legacy Keep helper:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">gog auth service-account set you@yourdomain.com --key ~/Downloads/service-account.json\ngog keep list --account you@yourdomain.com\ngog keep get &lt;noteId&gt; --account you@yourdomain.com\n</code></pre> \n<h3>Environment Variables</h3> \n<ul> \n <li><code>GOG_ACCOUNT</code> - Default account email or alias to use (avoids repeating <code>--account</code>; otherwise uses keyring default or a single stored token)</li> \n <li><code>GOG_CLIENT</code> - OAuth client name (selects stored credentials + token bucket)</li> \n <li><code>GOG_JSON</code> - Default JSON output</li> \n <li><code>GOG_PLAIN</code> - Default plain output</li> \n <li><code>GOG_COLOR</code> - Color mode: <code>auto</code> (default), <code>always</code>, or <code>never</code></li> \n <li><code>GOG_TIMEZONE</code> - Default output timezone for Calendar/Gmail (IANA name, <code>UTC</code>, or <code>local</code>)</li> \n <li><code>GOG_ENABLE_COMMANDS</code> - Comma-separated allowlist of top-level commands (e.g., <code>calendar,tasks</code>)</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Config File (JSON5)</h3> \n<p>Find the actual config path in <code>gog --help</code> or <code>gog auth keyring</code>.</p> \n<p>Typical paths:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>macOS: <code>~/Library/Application Support/gogcli/config.json</code></li> \n <li>Linux: <code>~/.config/gogcli/config.json</code> (or <code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gogcli/config.json</code>)</li> \n <li>Windows: <code>%AppData%\\\\gogcli\\\\config.json</code></li> \n</ul> \n<p>Example (JSON5 supports comments and trailing commas):</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-json5\">{\n  // Avoid macOS Keychain prompts\n  keyring_backend: \"file\",\n  // Default output timezone for Calendar/Gmail (IANA, UTC, or local)\n  default_timezone: \"UTC\",\n  // Optional account aliases\n  account_aliases: {\n    work: \"work@company.com\",\n    personal: \"me@gmail.com\",\n  },\n  // Optional per-account OAuth client selection\n  account_clients: {\n    \"work@company.com\": \"work\",\n  },\n  // Optional domain -&gt; client mapping\n  client_domains: {\n    \"example.com\": \"work\",\n  },\n}\n</code></pre> \n<h3>Config Commands</h3> \n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">gog config path\ngog config list\ngog config keys\ngog config get default_timezone\ngog config set default_timezone UTC\ngog config unset default_timezone\n</code></pre> \n<h3>Account Aliases</h3> \n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">gog auth alias set work work@company.com\ngog auth alias list\ngog auth alias unset work\n</code></pre> \n<p>Aliases work anywhere you pass <code>--account</code> or <code>GOG_ACCOUNT</code> (reserved: <code>auto</code>, <code>default</code>).</p> \n<h3>Command Allowlist (Sandboxing)</h3> \n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\"># Only allow calendar + tasks commands for an agent\ngog --enable-commands calendar,tasks calendar events --today\n\n# Same via env\nexport GOG_ENABLE_COMMANDS=calendar,tasks\ngog tasks list &lt;tasklistId&gt;\n</code></pre> \n<h2>Security</h2> \n<h3>Credential Storage</h3> \n<p>OAuth credentials are stored securely in your system's keychain:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>macOS</strong>: Keychain Access</li> \n <li><strong>Linux</strong>: Secret Service (GNOME Keyring, KWallet)</li> \n <li><strong>Windows</strong>: Credential Manager</li> \n</ul> \n<p>The CLI uses <a href=\"https://github.com/99designs/keyring\">github.com/99designs/keyring</a> for secure storage.</p> \n<p>If no OS keychain backend is available (e.g., Linux/WSL/container), keyring can fall back to an encrypted on-disk store and may prompt for a password; for non-interactive runs set <code>GOG_KEYRING_PASSWORD</code>.</p> \n<h3>Keychain Prompts (macOS)</h3> \n<p>macOS Keychain may prompt more than you’d expect when the “app identity” keeps changing (different binary path, <code>go run</code> temp builds, rebuilding to new <code>./bin/gog</code>, multiple copies). Keychain treats those as different apps, so it asks again.</p> \n<p>Options:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Default (recommended):</strong> keep using Keychain (secure) and run a stable <code>gog</code> binary path to reduce repeat prompts.</li> \n <li><strong>Force Keychain:</strong> <code>GOG_KEYRING_BACKEND=keychain</code> (disables any file-backend fallback).</li> \n <li><strong>Avoid Keychain prompts entirely:</strong> <code>GOG_KEYRING_BACKEND=file</code> (stores encrypted entries on disk under your config dir). \n  <ul> \n   <li>To avoid password prompts too (CI/non-interactive): set <code>GOG_KEYRING_PASSWORD=...</code> (tradeoff: secret in env).</li> \n  </ul> </li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Best Practices</h3> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Never commit OAuth client credentials</strong> to version control</li> \n <li>Store client credentials outside your project directory</li> \n <li>Use different OAuth clients for development and production</li> \n <li>Re-authorize with <code>--force-consent</code> if you suspect token compromise</li> \n <li>Remove unused accounts with <code>gog auth remove &lt;email&gt;</code></li> \n</ul> \n<h3>OAuth Client IDs in Open Source</h3> \n<p>Some open source Google CLIs ship a pre-configured OAuth client ID/secret copied from other desktop apps to avoid OAuth consent verification, testing-user limits, or quota issues. This makes the consent screen/security emails show the other app’s name and can stop working at any time.</p> \n<p><code>gogcli</code> does not do this. Supported auth:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Your own OAuth Desktop client JSON via <code>gog auth credentials ...</code> + <code>gog auth add ...</code></li> \n <li>Google Workspace service accounts with domain-wide delegation (Workspace only)</li> \n</ul> \n<h2>Commands</h2> \n<p>Flag aliases:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><code>--out</code> also accepts <code>--output</code>.</li> \n <li><code>--out-dir</code> also accepts <code>--output-dir</code> (Gmail thread attachment downloads).</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Authentication</h3> \n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">gog auth credentials &lt;path&gt;

You can open this project directly or run <code>npm run ios_bootstrap -- --open_xcodeproj</code> to have it opened in Xcode. See the <a href=\"https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/iOS-Development-Environment#Building\">iOS Developer Environment</a> for more information on iOS builds.</p> \n<h3>Build Configurations</h3> \n<p>Running a release build with <code>npm run build Release</code> can be very slow and use a lot of RAM, especially on Linux with the Gold LLVM plugin.</p> \n<p>To run a statically linked build (takes longer to build, but starts faster):</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">npm run build -- Static\n</code></pre> \n<p>To run a debug build (Component build with is_debug=true):</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">npm run build -- Debug\n</code></pre> \n<p>NOTE: the build will take a while to complete. Depending on your processor and memory, it could potentially take a few hours.</p> \n<h2>Run Brave</h2> \n<p>To start the build:</p> \n<p><code>npm start [Release|Component|Static|Debug]</code></p> \n<h1>Update Brave</h1> \n<p><code>npm run sync -- [--force] [--init] [--create] [brave_core_ref]</code></p> \n<p><strong>This will attempt to stash your local changes in brave-core, but it's safer to commit local changes before running this</strong></p> \n<p><code>npm run sync</code> will (depending on the below flags):</p> \n<ol> \n <li>📥 Update sub-projects (chromium, brave-core) to latest commit of a git ref (e.g. tag or branch)</li> \n <li>🤕 Apply patches</li> \n <li>🔄 Update gclient DEPS dependencies</li> \n <li>⏩ Run hooks (e.g. to perform <code>npm install</code> on child projects)</li> \n</ol> \n<table> \n <thead> \n  <tr> \n   <th>flag</th> \n   <th>Description</th> \n  </tr> \n </thead> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td><code>[no flags]</code></td> \n   <td>updates chromium if needed and re-applies patches.

This helps to address the parity challenge of keeping the Python research/backtest environment consistent with the production live trading environment.</p> \n<p>NautilusTrader's design, architecture, and implementation philosophy prioritizes software correctness and safety at the highest level, with the aim of supporting Python-native, mission-critical, trading system backtesting and live deployment workloads.</p> \n<p>The platform is also universal, and asset-class-agnostic — with any REST API or WebSocket feed able to be integrated via modular adapters. It supports high-frequency trading across a wide range of asset classes and instrument types including FX, Equities, Futures, Options, Crypto, DeFi, and Betting — enabling seamless operations across multiple venues simultaneously.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://github.com/nautechsystems/nautilus_trader/raw/develop/assets/nautilus-trader.png\" alt=\"nautilus-trader\" title=\"nautilus-trader\" /></p> \n<h2>Features</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Fast</strong>: Core is written in Rust with asynchronous networking using <a href=\"https://crates.io/crates/tokio\">tokio</a>.</li> \n <li><strong>Reliable</strong>: Rust-powered type- and thread-safety, with optional Redis-backed state persistence.</li> \n <li><strong>Portable</strong>: OS independent, runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

The idea is that this can be translated to the aesthetics of design and architecture.</em></p> \n</blockquote> \n<h2>Why NautilusTrader?</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Highly performant event-driven Python</strong>: Native binary core components.</li> \n <li><strong>Parity between backtesting and live trading</strong>: Identical strategy code.</li> \n <li><strong>Reduced operational risk</strong>: Enhanced risk management functionality, logical accuracy, and type safety.</li> \n <li><strong>Highly extendable</strong>: Message bus, custom components and actors, custom data, custom adapters.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Traditionally, trading strategy research and backtesting might be conducted in Python using vectorized methods, with the strategy then needing to be reimplemented in a more event-driven way using C++, C#, Java or other statically typed language(s). The reasoning here is that vectorized backtesting code cannot express the granular time and event dependent complexity of real-time trading, where compiled languages have proven to be more suitable due to their inherently higher performance, and type safety.</p> \n<p>One of the key advantages of NautilusTrader here, is that this reimplementation step is now circumvented - as the critical core components of the platform have all been written entirely in <a href=\"https://www.rust-lang.org/\">Rust</a> or <a href=\"https://cython.org/\">Cython</a>. This means we're using the right tools for the job, where systems programming languages compile performant binaries, with CPython C extension modules then able to offer a Python-native environment, suitable for professional quantitative traders and trading firms.</p> \n<h2>Why Python?</h2> \n<p>Python was originally created decades ago as a simple scripting language with a clean straightforward syntax. It has since evolved into a fully fledged general purpose object-oriented programming language. Based on the TIOBE index, Python is currently the most popular programming language in the world. Not only that, Python has become the <em>de facto lingua franca</em> of data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.</p> \n<h2>Why Rust?</h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.rust-lang.org/\">Rust</a> is a multi-paradigm programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe concurrency. Rust is \"blazingly fast\" and memory-efficient (comparable to C and C++) with no garbage collector. It can power mission-critical systems, run on embedded devices, and easily integrates with other languages.</p> \n<p>Rust's rich type system and ownership model guarantee memory-safety and thread-safety in safe code, eliminating many classes of bugs at compile-time. Overall safety in this project also depends on correctly upheld invariants in unsafe blocks and FFI boundaries.</p> \n<p>The project utilizes Rust for core performance-critical components. Python bindings are implemented via Cython and <a href=\"https://pyo3.rs\">PyO3</a>—no Rust toolchain is required at install time.</p> \n<p>This project makes the <a href=\"https://raphlinus.github.io/rust/2020/01/18/soundness-pledge.html\">Soundness Pledge</a>:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>“The intent of this project is to be free of soundness bugs. The developers will do their best to avoid them, and welcome help in analyzing and fixing them.”</p> \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote> \n <p>[!NOTE]</p> \n <p><strong>MSRV:</strong> NautilusTrader relies heavily on improvements in the Rust language and compiler. As a result, the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is generally equal to the latest stable release of Rust.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<h2>Integrations</h2> \n<p>NautilusTrader is modularly designed to work with <em>adapters</em>, enabling connectivity to trading venues and data providers by translating their raw APIs into a unified interface and normalized domain model.</p> \n<p>The following integrations are currently supported; see <a href=\"https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/integrations/\">docs/integrations/</a> for details:</p> \n<table> \n <thead> \n  <tr> \n   <th

\n<p>The <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nautechsystems/nautilus_trader/develop/ROADMAP.md\">Roadmap</a> outlines NautilusTrader's strategic direction. Current priorities include porting the core to Rust, improving documentation, and enhancing code ergonomics.</p> \n<p>The open-source project focuses on single-node backtesting and live trading for individual and small-team quantitative traders. UI dashboards, distributed orchestration, and built-in AI/ML tooling are out of scope to maintain focus on the core engine and ecosystem sustainability.</p> \n<p>New integration proposals should start with an RFC issue to discuss suitability before submitting a PR. See <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nautechsystems/nautilus_trader/develop/ROADMAP.md#community-contributed-integrations\">Community-contributed integrations</a> for guidelines.</p> \n<h2>Versioning and releases</h2> \n<blockquote> \n <p>[!WARNING]</p> \n <p><strong>NautilusTrader is still under active development</strong>. Some features may be incomplete, and while the API is becoming more stable, breaking changes can occur between releases. We strive to document these changes in the release notes on a <strong>best-effort basis</strong>.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>We aim to follow a <strong>bi-weekly release schedule</strong>, though experimental or larger features may cause delays.</p> \n<h3>Branches</h3> \n<p>We aim to maintain a stable, passing build across all branches.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><code>master</code>: Reflects the source code for the latest released version; recommended for production use.</li> \n <li><code>nightly</code>: Daily snapshots of the <code>develop</code> branch for early testing; merged at <strong>14:00 UTC</strong> and as required.</li> \n <li><code>develop</code>: Active development branch for contributors and feature work.</li> \n</ul> \n<blockquote> \n <p>[!NOTE]</p> \n <p>Our <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nautechsystems/nautilus_trader/develop/ROADMAP.md\">roadmap</a> aims to achieve a <strong>stable API for version 2.x</strong> (likely after the Rust port). Once this milestone is reached, we plan to implement a formal deprecation process for any API changes. This approach allows us to maintain a rapid development pace for now.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<h2>Precision mode</h2> \n<p>NautilusTrader supports two precision modes for its core value types (<code>Price</code>, <code>Quantity</code>, <code>Money</code>), which differ in their internal bit-width and maximum decimal precision.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>High-precision</strong>: 128-bit integers with up to 16 decimals of precision, and a larger value range.</li> \n <li><strong>Standard-precision</strong>: 64-bit integers with up to 9 decimals of precision, and a smaller value range.</li> \n</ul> \n<blockquote> \n <p>[!NOTE]</p> \n <p>By default, the official Python wheels ship in high-precision (128-bit) mode on Linux and macOS. On Windows, only standard-precision (64-bit) Python wheels are available because MSVC's C/C++ frontend does not support <code>__int128</code>, preventing the Cython/FFI layer from handling 128-bit integers.</p> \n <p>For pure Rust crates, high-precision works on all platforms (including Windows) since Rust handles <code>i128</code>/<code>u128</code> via software emulation. The default is standard-precision unless you explicitly enable the <code>high-precision</code> feature flag.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>See the <a href=\"https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/getting_started/installation\">Installation Guide</a> for further details.</p> \n<p><strong>Rust feature flag</strong>: To enable high-precision mode in Rust, add the <code>high-precision</code> feature to your Cargo.toml:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-toml\">[dependencies]\nnautilus_model = { version = \"*\", features = [\"high-precision\"] }\n</code></pre> \n<h2>Installation</h2> \n<p>We recommend using the latest supported version of Python and installing <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/nautilus_trader/\">nautilus_trader</a> inside a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.</p> \n<p><strong>There are two supported ways to install</strong>:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>Pre-built binary wheel from PyPI <em>or</em> the Nautech Systems package index.</li> \n <li>Build from source.</li> \n</ol> \n<blockquote> \n <p>[!TIP]</p> \n <p>We highly recommend installing using the <a href=\"https://docs.astral.sh/uv\">uv</a> package manager with a \"vanilla\" CPython.</p> \n <p>Conda and other Python distributions <em>may</em> work but aren’t officially supported.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<h3>From PyPI</h3> \n<p>To install the latest binary wheel (or sdist package) from PyPI using Python's pip package manager:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">pip install -U nautilus_trader\n</code></pre> \n<p>Install optional dependencies as 'extras' for specific integrations (e.g., <code>betfair</code>, <code>docker</code>, <code>dydx</code>, <code>ib</code>, <code>polymarket</code>, <code>visualization</code>):</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">pip install -U \"nautilus_trader[docker,ib]\"\n</code></pre> \n<p>See the <a href=\"https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/getting_started/installation#extras\">Installation Guide</a> for the full list of available extras.</p> \n<h3>From the Nautech Systems package index</h3> \n<p>The Nautech Systems package index (<code>packages.nautechsystems.io</code>) complies with <a href=\"https://peps.python.org/pep-0503/\">PEP-503</a> and hosts both stable and development binary wheels for <code>nautilus_trader</code>. This enables users to install either the latest stable release or pre-release versions for testing.</p> \n<h4>Stable wheels</h4> \n<p>Stable wheels correspond to official releases of <code>nautilus_trader</code> on PyPI, and use standard versioning.</p> \n<p>To install the latest stable release:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">pip install -U nautilus_trader --index-url=https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple\n</code></pre> \n<blockquote> \n <p>[!TIP]</p> \n <p>Use <code>--extra-index-url</code> instead of <code>--index-url</code> if you want pip to fall back to PyPI automatically.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<h4>Development wheels</h4> \n<p>Development wheels are published from both the <code>nightly</code> and <code>develop</code> branches, allowing users to test features and fixes ahead of stable releases.</p> \n<p>This process also helps preserve compute resources and provides easy access to the exact binaries tested in CI pipelines, while adhering to <a href=\"https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/\">PEP-440</a> versioning standards:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><code>develop</code> wheels use the version format <code>dev{date}+{build_number}</code> (e.g., <code>1.208.0.dev20241212+7001</code>).</li> \n <li><code>nightly</code> wheels use the version format <code>a{date}</code> (alpha) (e.g., <code>1.208.0a20241212</code>).</li> \n</ul> \n<table> \n <thead> \n  <tr> \n   <th align=\"left\">Platform</th> \n   <th align=\"left\">Nightly</th> \n   <th align=\"left\">Develop</th> \n  </tr> \n </thead> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td align=\"left\"><code>Linux (x86_64)</code></td> \n   <td align=\"left\">✓</td> \n   <td align=\"left\">✓</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td align=\"left\"><code>Linux (ARM64)</code></td> \n   <td align=\"left\">✓</td> \n   <td align=\"left\">-</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td align=\"left\"><code>macOS (ARM64)</code></td> \n   <td align=\"left\">✓</td> \n   <td align=\"left\">✓</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td align=\"left\"><code>Windows (x86_64)</code></td> \n   <td align=\"left\">✓</td> \n   <td align=\"left\">✓</td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p><strong>Note</strong>: Development wheels from the <code>develop</code> branch publish for every supported platform except Linux ARM64.

Instead of working in independent sessions, you work with a persisted agent that learns over time and is portable across models (Claude Sonnet/Opus 4.5, GPT-5.2-Codex, Gemini 3 Pro, GLM-4.7, and more).</p> \n<p><strong>Read more about how to use Letta Code on the <a href=\"https://docs.letta.com/letta-code\">official docs page</a>.</strong></p> \n<p><img src=\"https://github.com/letta-ai/letta-code/raw/main/assets/letta-code-demo.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p> \n<h2>Get started</h2> \n<p>Install the package via <a href=\"https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm\">npm</a>:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">npm install -g @letta-ai/letta-code\n</code></pre> \n<p>Navigate to your project directory and run <code>letta</code> (see various command-line options <a href=\"https://docs.letta.com/letta-code/commands\">on the docs</a>).</p> \n<p>Run <code>/connect</code> to configure your own LLM API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.), and use <code>/model</code> to swap models.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>[!NOTE] By default, Letta Code will to connect to the <a href=\"https://app.letta.com/\">Letta API</a>. Use <code>/connect</code> to use your own LLM API keys and coding plans (Codex, zAI, Minimax) for free. Set <code>LETTA_BASE_URL</code> to connect to an external <a href=\"https://docs.letta.com/letta-code/docker\">Docker server</a>.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<h2>Philosophy</h2> \n<p>Letta Code is built around long-lived agents that persist across sessions and improve with use. Rather than working in independent sessions, each session is tied to a persisted agent that learns.</p> \n<p><strong>Claude Code / Codex / Gemini CLI</strong> (Session-Based)</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Sessions are independent</li> \n <li>No learning between sessions</li> \n <li>Context = messages in the current session + <code>AGENTS.md</code></li> \n <li>Relationship: Every conversation is like meeting a new contractor</li> \n</ul> \n<p><strong>Letta Code</strong> (Agent-Based)</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Same agent across sessions</li> \n <li>Persistent memory and learning over time</li> \n <li><code>/clear</code> starts a new conversation (aka \"thread\" or \"session\"), but memory persists</li> \n <li>Relationship: Like having a coworker or mentee that learns and remembers</li> \n</ul> \n<h2>Agent Memory &amp; Learning</h2> \n<p>If you’re using Letta Code for the first time, you will likely want to run the <code>/init</code> command to initialize the agent’s memory system:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">&gt; /init\n</code></pre> \n<p>Over time, the agent will update its memory as it learns. To actively guide your agents memory, you can use the <code>/remember</code> command:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">&gt; /remember [optional instructions on what to remember]\n</code></pre> \n<p>Letta Code works with skills (reusable modules that teach your agent new capabilities in a <code>.skills</code> directory), but additionally supports <a href=\"https://www.letta.com/blog/skill-learning\">skill learning</a>. You can ask your agent to learn a skill from it's current trajectory with the command:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">&gt; /skill [optional instructions on what skill to learn]\n</code></pre> \n<p>Read the docs to learn more about <a href=\"https://docs.letta.com/letta-code/skills\">skills and skill learning</a>.</p> \n<p>Community maintained packages are available for Arch Linux users on the <a href=\"https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/letta-code\">AUR</a>:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">yay -S letta-code # release\nyay -S letta-code-git # nightly\n</code></pre> \n<hr /> \n<p>Made with 💜 in San Francisco</p>",

We encourage the community to remix, redesign, and reshare MinIO under the terms of the AGPLv3 license.</p> \n<p>All usage of MinIO in your application stack requires validation against AGPLv3 obligations, which include but are not limited to the release of modified code to the community from which you have benefited. Any commercial/proprietary usage of the AGPLv3 software, including repackaging or reselling services/features, is done at your own risk.</p> \n<p>The AGPLv3 provides no obligation by any party to support, maintain, or warranty the original or any modified work. All support is provided on a best-effort basis through Github and our <a href=\"https://slack.min.io\">Slack</a> channel, and any member of the community is welcome to contribute and assist others in their usage of the software.</p> \n<p>MinIO <a href=\"https://www.min.io/product/aistor\">AIStor</a> includes enterprise-grade support and licensing for workloads which require commercial or proprietary usage and production-level SLA/SLO-backed support. For more information, <a href=\"https://min.io/pricing\">reach out for a quote</a>.</p> \n<h2>Source-Only Distribution</h2> \n<p><strong>Important:</strong> The MinIO community edition is now distributed as source code only. We will no longer provide pre-compiled binary releases for the community version.</p> \n<h3>Installing Latest MinIO Community Edition</h3> \n<p>To use MinIO community edition, you have two options:</p> \n<ol> \n <li><strong>Install from source</strong> using <code>go install github.com/minio/minio@latest</code> (recommended)</li> \n <li><strong>Build a Docker image</strong> from the provided Dockerfile</li> \n</ol> \n<p>See the sections below for detailed instructions on each method.</p> \n<h3>Legacy Binary Releases</h3> \n<p>Historical pre-compiled binary releases remain available for reference but are no longer maintained:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>GitHub Releases: <a href=\"https://github.com/minio/minio/releases\">https://github.com/minio/minio/releases</a></li> \n <li>Direct downloads: <a href=\"https://dl.min.io/server/minio/release/\">https://dl.min.io/server/minio/release/</a></li> \n</ul> \n<p><strong>These legacy binaries will not receive updates.</strong> We strongly recommend using source builds for access to the latest features, bug fixes, and security updates.</p> \n<h2>Install from Source</h2> \n<p>Use the following commands to compile and run a standalone MinIO server from source. If you do not have a working Golang environment, please follow <a href=\"https://golang.org/doc/install\">How to install Golang</a>. Minimum version required is <a href=\"https://golang.org/dl/#stable\">go1.24</a></p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">go install github.com/minio/minio@latest\n</code></pre> \n<p>You can alternatively run <code>go build</code> and use the <code>GOOS</code> and <code>GOARCH</code> environment variables to control the OS and architecture target. For example:</p> \n<pre><code>env GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64 go build\n</code></pre> \n<p>Start MinIO by running <code>minio server PATH</code> where <code>PATH</code> is any empty folder on your local filesystem.</p> \n<p>The MinIO deployment starts using default root credentials <code>minioadmin:minioadmin</code>. You can test the deployment using the MinIO Console, an embedded web-based object browser built into MinIO Server. Point a web browser running on the host machine to <a href=\"http://127.0.0.1:9000\">http://127.0.0.1:9000</a> and log in with the root credentials. You can use the Browser to create buckets, upload objects, and browse the contents of the MinIO server.</p> \n<p>You can also connect using any S3-compatible tool, such as the MinIO Client <code>mc</code> commandline tool:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">mc alias set local http://localhost:9000 minioadmin minioadmin\nmc admin info local\n</code></pre> \n<p>See <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/minio/minio/master/#test-using-minio-client-mc\">Test using MinIO Client <code>mc</code></a> for more information on using the <code>mc</code> commandline tool. For application developers, see <a href=\"https://docs.min.io/enterprise/aistor-object-store/developers/sdk/\">https://docs.min.io/enterprise/aistor-object-store/developers/sdk/</a> to view MinIO SDKs for supported languages.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>[!NOTE] Production environments using compiled-from-source MinIO binaries do so at their own risk. The AGPLv3 license provides no warranties nor liabilities for any such usage.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<h2>Build Docker Image</h2> \n<p>You can use the <code>docker build .</code> command to build a Docker image on your local host machine. You must first <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/minio/minio/master/#install-from-source\">build MinIO</a> and ensure the <code>minio</code> binary exists in the project root.</p> \n<p>The following command builds the Docker image using the default <code>Dockerfile</code> in the root project directory with the repository and image tag <code>myminio:minio</code></p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">docker build -t myminio:minio .\n</code></pre> \n<p>Use <code>docker image ls</code> to confirm the image exists in your local repository. You can run the server using standard Docker invocation:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">docker run -p 9000:9000 -p 9001:9001 myminio:minio server /tmp/minio --console-address :9001\n</code></pre> \n<p>Complete documentation for building Docker containers, managing custom images, or loading images into orchestration platforms is out of scope for this documentation. You can modify the <code>Dockerfile</code> and <code>dockerscripts/docker-entrypoint.sh</code> as-needed to reflect your specific image requirements.</p> \n<p>See the <a href=\"https://docs.min.io/community/minio-object-store/operations/deployments/baremetal-deploy-minio-as-a-container.html#deploy-minio-container\">MinIO Container</a> documentation for more guidance on running MinIO within a Container image.</p> \n<h2>Install using Helm Charts</h2> \n<p>There are two paths for installing MinIO onto Kubernetes infrastructure:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Use the <a href=\"https://github.com/minio/operator\">MinIO Operator</a></li> \n <li>Use the community-maintained <a href=\"https://github.com/minio/minio/tree/master/helm/minio\">Helm charts</a></li> \n</ul> \n<p>See the <a href=\"https://docs.min.io/community/minio-object-store/operations/deployments/kubernetes.html\">MinIO Documentation</a> for guidance on deploying using the Operator. The Community Helm chart has instructions in the folder-level README.</p> \n<h2>Test MinIO Connectivity</h2> \n<h3>Test using MinIO Console</h3> \n<p>MinIO Server comes with an embedded web based object browser. Point your web browser to <a href=\"http://127.0.0.1:9000\">http://127.0.0.1:9000</a> to ensure your server has started successfully.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>[!NOTE] MinIO runs console on random port by default, if you wish to choose a specific port use <code>--console-address</code> to pick a specific interface and port.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<h3>Test using MinIO Client <code>mc</code></h3> \n<p><code>mc</code> provides a modern alternative to UNIX commands like ls, cat, cp, mirror, diff etc. It supports filesystems and Amazon S3 compatible cloud storage services.</p> \n<p>The following commands set a local alias, validate the server information, create a bucket, copy data to that bucket, and list the contents of the bucket.</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">mc alias set local http://localhost:9000 minioadmin minioadmin\nmc admin info\nmc mb data\nmc cp ~/Downloads/mydata data/\nmc ls data/\n</code></pre> \n<p>Follow the MinIO Client <a href=\"https://docs.min.io/community/minio-object-store/reference/minio-mc.html#quickstart\">Quickstart Guide</a> for further instructions.</p> \n<h2>Explore Further</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://docs.min.io/community/minio-object-store/index.html\">The MinIO documentation website</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://docs.min.io/community/minio-object-store/operations/concepts/erasure-coding.html\">MinIO Erasure Code Overview</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://docs.min.io/community/minio-object-store/reference/minio-mc.html\">Use <code>mc</code> with MinIO Server</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://docs.min.io/enterprise/aistor-object-store/developers/sdk/go/\">Use <code>minio-go</code> SDK with MinIO Server</a></li> \n</ul> \n<h2>Contribute to MinIO Project</h2> \n<p>Please follow MinIO <a href=\"https://github.com/minio/minio/raw/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\">Contributor's Guide</a> for guidance on making new contributions to the repository.</p> \n<h2>License</h2> \n<ul> \n <li>MinIO source is licensed under the <a href=\"https://github.com/minio/minio/raw/master/LICENSE\">GNU AGPLv3</a>.</li> \n <li>MinIO <a href=\"https://github.com/minio/minio/tree/master/docs\">documentation</a> is licensed under <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\">CC BY 4.0</a>.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://github.com/minio/minio/raw/master/COMPLIANCE.md\">License Compliance</a></li> \n</ul>",

\n<p>If you encounter build errors like <code>error unsupported Swift architecture</code> or <code>DebugSwift.framework only contains x86_64 slice for simulator</code> on Apple Silicon Macs:</p> \n<h4>Solution 1: Update to Latest Version</h4> \n<p>Ensure you're using the latest version of DebugSwift which includes full Apple Silicon support:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-ruby\"># CocoaPods\npod 'DebugSwift', '~&gt; 1.8.1'\n\n# Swift Package Manager - update to latest\n</code></pre> \n<h4>Solution 2: Use XCFramework Distribution (Recommended)</h4> \n<p>For faster builds and guaranteed architecture compatibility:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-ruby\">pod 'DebugSwift', :http =&gt; 'https://github.com/DebugSwift/DebugSwift/releases/latest/download/DebugSwift.xcframework.zip'\n</code></pre> \n<h4>Solution 3: Remove Architecture Exclusions</h4> \n<p>If you have custom architecture exclusions in your project, remove them:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-ruby\"># Remove this from your Podfile or target configuration:\n# config.build_settings['EXCLUDED_ARCHS[sdk=iphonesimulator*]'] = 'arm64'\n</code></pre> \n<h4>Solution 4: Clean Build</h4> \n<p>Clean your build folder and derived data:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\"># Xcode\nProduct → Clean Build Folder (⌘⇧K)\n\n# Command line\nrm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData\n</code></pre> \n<h3>Build Performance</h3> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>XCFramework Distribution</strong>: Up to 50% faster build times</li> \n <li><strong>Source Distribution</strong>: Full source access and debugging capabilities</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Choose XCFramework for production builds, source for active development.</p> \n<h2>Examples</h2> \n<h3>Enhanced Hierarchy Tree for Deeper Application Insights (Beta)</h3> \n<p>Harness the Power of Visual

     ])\n    ]\n}\n</code></pre> \n<h3>Manual URLSessionConfiguration Injection</h3> \n<p>If you create <code>URLSessionConfiguration</code> instances <strong>before</strong> calling <code>DebugSwift.setup()</code>, you can manually inject the network monitoring protocol:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-swift\">// Option 1: Inject into existing configuration\nlet config = URLSessionConfiguration.default\nDebugSwift.Network.shared.injectIntoConfiguration(config)\nlet session = URLSession(configuration: config)\n\n// Option 2: Get pre-configured default configuration\nlet config = DebugSwift.Network.shared.defaultConfiguration()\nlet session = URLSession(configuration: config)\n\n// Option 3: Get pre-configured ephemeral configuration\nlet config = DebugSwift.Network.shared.ephemeralConfiguration()\nlet session = URLSession(configuration: config)\n\n// Option 4: Direct protocol class injection (advanced)\nvar config = URLSessionConfiguration.default\nvar protocolClasses = config.protocolClasses ?? []\nprotocolClasses.insert(CustomHTTPProtocol.self, at: 0)\nconfig.protocolClasses = protocolClasses\n</code></pre> \n<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is particularly useful when migrating from other network debugging tools like Netfox or when working with pre-existing URLSession configurations.</p> \n<h3>Network Encryption/Decryption</h3> \n<p>DebugSwift supports automatic decryption of encrypted API responses, making it easier to debug apps with end-to-end encryption.</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-swift\">// Enable decryption feature\nDebugSwift.Network.shared.setDecryptionEnabled(true)\n\n// Register decryption key for specific API endpoints\nif let key = \"your-32-byte-aes-key-here-123456\".data(using: .utf8) {\n    DebugSwift.Network.shared.registerDecryptionKey(for: \"api.example.com\", key: key)\n}\n\n// Register custom decryptor for complex encryption schemes\nDebugSwift.Network.shared.registerCustomDecryptor(for: \"api.myapp.com\") { encryptedData in\n    // Your custom decryption logic here\n    return customDecrypt(encryptedData)\n}\n</code></pre> \n<h3>Selective Features</h3> \n<pre><code class=\"language-swift\">debugSwift.setup(\n    hideFeatures: [.performance, .interface], // Hide specific tabs\n    disable: [.leaksDetector, .console]       // Disable specific monitoring\n)\n</code></pre> \n<h3>Beta Features</h3> \n<pre><code class=\"language-swift\">// Enable beta features (disabled by default)\ndebugSwift.setup(\n    enableBetaFeatures: [.swiftUIRenderTracking] // Enable experimental SwiftUI render tracking\n)\n</code></pre> \n<h3>App Group Configuration</h3> \n<pre><code class=\"language-swift\">// Configure app groups for file browser access\nDebugSwift.Resources.shared.configureAppGroups([\n    \"group.com.yourcompany.yourapp\"\n])\n</code></pre> \n<h3>Performance Monitoring</h3> \n<pre><code class=\"language-swift\">// Configure memory leak detection\nDebugSwift.Performance.shared.onLeakDetected { leakData in\n    print(\"🔴 Memory leak detected: \\(leakData.message)\")\n}\n</code></pre> \n<h3>Push Notification Simulation</h3> \n<pre><code class=\"language-swift\">// Enable push notification simulation\nDebugSwift.PushNotification.enableSimulation()\n\n// Simulate a notification\nDebugSwift.PushNotification.simulate(\n    title: \"Test Notification\",\n    body: \"This is a test notification\"\n)\n</code></pre> \n<h3>SwiftUI Render Tracking (Beta)</h3> \n<p>⚠️ <strong>Beta Feature</strong>: SwiftUI render tracking is experimental and must be enabled explicitly.</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-swift\">// First enable the beta feature in setup\ndebugSwift.setup(enableBetaFeatures: [.swiftUIRenderTracking])\n\n// Then enable SwiftUI render tracking\nDebugSwift.SwiftUIRender.shared.isEnabled = true\n\n// Configure persistent overlays (stay visible until manually cleared)\nDebugSwift.SwiftUIRender.shared.persistentOverlays = true\n\n// Set overlay style (border, borderWithCount, none)\nDebugSwift.SwiftUIRender.shared.overlayStyle = .borderWithCount\n\n// Configure overlay duration\nDebugSwift.SwiftUIRender.shared.overlayDuration = 1.0\n\n// Enable console logging\nDebugSwift.SwiftUIRender.shared.loggingEnabled = true\n\n// Clear render statistics\nDebugSwift.SwiftUIRender.shared.clearStats()\n\n// Clear persistent overlays\nDebugSwift.SwiftUIRender.shared.clearPersistentOverlays()\n</code></pre> \n<hr /> \n<h2>⭐ Support the Project</h2> \n<p>If you find DebugSwift helpful, please consider giving us a star on GitHub!

Here are some notable examples:</p> \n<h3>⚛️ P1: Mastering Physics Olympiads with Reinforcement Learning</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://prime-rl.github.io/P1/\"><strong>P1</strong></a> is a family of open-source physics reasoning models trained entirely through reinforcement learning. P1 leverages slime as the RL post training framework, and introduces a multi-stage RL training algorithm that progressively enhances reasoning ability through adaptive learnability adjustment and stabilization mechanisms. Enpowered by this training paradigm, P1 delivers breakthrough performance in open-source physics reasoning.</p> \n<h3>📈RLVE: Scaling LM RL with Adaptive Verifiable Environments</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Zhiyuan-Zeng/RLVE\"><strong>RLVE</strong></a> introduces an approach using verifiable environments that procedurally generate problems and provide algorithmically verifiable rewards, to scale up RL for language models (LMs). With joint training across 400 verifiable environments, RLVE enables each environment to dynamically adapt its problem difficulty distribution to the policy model's capabilities as training progresses.</p> \n<h3>⚡ TritonForge: Agentic RL Training Framework for Kernel Generation</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/RLsys-Foundation/TritonForge\"><strong>TritonForge</strong></a> leverages slime's SFT &amp; RL capabilities to train LLMs that automatically generate optimized GPU kernels. By using a two-stage training approach—supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning with multi-turn compilation feedback—TritonForge achieves remarkable results in converting PyTorch operations into high-performance Triton kernels.</p> \n<h3>🚀 APRIL: Accelerating RL Training with Active Partial Rollouts</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/RLsys-Foundation/APRIL\"><strong>APRIL</strong></a> introduces a system-level optimization that seamlessly integrates with slime to accelerate the rollout generation phase in RL training. By intelligently over-provisioning requests and actively managing partial completions, APRIL addresses the long-tail generation bottleneck that typically consumes over 90% of RL training time.</p> \n<h3>🏟️ qqr: Scaling Open-Ended Agents with ArenaRL &amp; MCP</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Alibaba-NLP/qqr\"><strong>qqr</strong></a> (a.k.a. hilichurl) is a lightweight extension for slime designed to evolve open-ended agents. It implements the <strong>ArenaRL</strong> algorithm to tackle discriminative collapse through tournament-based relative ranking (<strong>e.g., Seeded Single-Elimination, Round-Robin</strong>) and seamlessly integrates the <strong>Model Context Protocol (MCP)</strong>. qqr leverages slime's high-throughput training capabilities to enable scalable, distributed evolution of agents in standardized, decoupled tool environments.</p> \n<p>These projects showcase slime's versatility—from training code-generation models to optimizing RL training systems—making it a powerful foundation for both research and production deployments.</p> \n<h2>Arguments Walkthrough</h2> \n<p>Arguments in slime are divided into three categories:</p> \n<ol> \n <li><strong>Megatron arguments</strong>: slime reads all arguments in Megatron. You can configure Megatron by passing arguments like <code>--tensor-model-parallel-size 2</code>.</li> \n <li><strong>SGLang arguments</strong>: All arguments for the installed SGLang are supported. These arguments must be prefixed with <code>--sglang-</code>. For example, <code>--mem-fraction-static</code> should be passed as <code>--sglang-mem-fraction-static</code>.</li> \n <li><strong>slime-specific arguments</strong>: Please refer to: <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THUDM/slime/main/slime/utils/arguments.py\">slime/utils/arguments.py</a></li> \n</ol> \n<p>For complete usage instructions, please refer to the <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THUDM/slime/main/docs/en/get_started/usage.md\">Usage Documentation</a>.</p> \n<h2>Developer Guide</h2> \n<ul> \n <li> <p><strong>Contributions are welcome!</strong> If you have suggestions for new features, performance tuning, or feedback on user experience, feel free to submit an Issue or PR 😊</p> </li> \n <li> <p>Use <a href=\"https://pre-commit.com/\">pre-commit</a> to ensure code style consistency for your commits:</p> </li> \n</ul> \n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">apt install pre-commit -y\npre-commit install\n\n# run pre-commit to ensure code style consistency\npre-commit run --all-files --show-diff-on-failure --color=always\n</code></pre> \n<ul> \n <li>For debugging tips, please refer to the <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THUDM/slime/main/docs/en/developer_guide/debug.md\">Debugging Guide</a></li> \n</ul> \n<h2>FAQ &amp; Acknowledgements</h2> \n<ul> \n <li>For frequently asked questions, please see the <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THUDM/slime/main/docs/en/get_started/qa.md\">Q&amp;A</a></li> \n <li>Special thanks to the following projects &amp; communities: SGLang, Megatron‑LM, mbridge, OpenRLHF, veRL, Pai-Megatron-Patch and others.</li> \n <li>To quote slime, please use:</li> \n</ul> \n<pre><code class=\"language-bibtex\">@misc{slime_github,\n  author       = {Zilin Zhu and Chengxing Xie and Xin Lv and slime Contributors},\n  title        = {slime: An LLM post-training framework for RL Scaling},\n  year         = {2025},\n  howpublished = {\\url{https://github.com/THUDM/slime}},\n  note         = {GitHub repository.

Planejamento Agêntico:</strong> Agentes dedicados (analyst, pm, architect) colaboram com você para criar documentos de PRD e Arquitetura detalhados e consistentes. Através de engenharia avançada de prompts e refinamento com human-in-the-loop, estes agentes de planejamento produzem especificações abrangentes que vão muito além da geração genérica de tarefas de IA.</p> \n<p><strong>2. Desenvolvimento Contextualizado por Engenharia:</strong> O agente sm (Scrum Master) então transforma estes planos detalhados em histórias de desenvolvimento hiperdetalhadas que contêm tudo que o agente dev precisa - contexto completo, detalhes de implementação e orientação arquitetural incorporada diretamente nos arquivos de histórias.</p> \n<p>Esta abordagem de duas fases elimina tanto a <strong>inconsistência de planejamento</strong> quanto a <strong>perda de contexto</strong> - os maiores problemas no desenvolvimento assistido por IA. Seu agente dev abre um arquivo de história com compreensão completa do que construir, como construir e por quê.</p> \n<p><strong>📖 <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SynkraAI/aios-core/main/docs/guides/user-guide.md\">Veja o fluxo de trabalho completo no Guia do Usuário</a></strong> -

1%.</h1> \n</div> \n<h2>The Purpose of This Project</h2> \n<p><strong>PAI exists to solve what I believe is the <a href=\"https://danielmiessler.com/telos\">P0 problem</a> in the world:</strong></p> \n<h3>Only a tiny fraction of humanity's creative potential is activated on Earth.</h3> \n<p>Most people don't believe they have valuable contributions to make. They think there are \"special\" people—and they aren't one of them. They've never asked who they are, what they're about, and have never articulated or written it down. This makes them catastrophically vulnerable to AI displacement. Without activation, there is no high-agency.</p> \n<p>So our goal with PAI is to activate people.</p> \n<p><strong>PAI's mission is twofold:</strong></p> \n<ol> \n <li><strong>Activate as many people as possible</strong> — Help people identify, articulate, and pursue their own purpose in life through AI-augmented self-discovery</li> \n <li><strong>Make the best AI available in the world accessible to everyone</strong> — Ensure this quality of AI infrastructure isn't reserved for just the rich or technical elite.</li> \n</ol> \n<p>That's why this is an open-source project instead of private.</p> \n<hr /> \n<h2>New to This? Start Here</h2> \n<p>You've probably used ChatGPT or Claude. Type a question, get an answer. Simple.</p> \n<p>You can think of AI systems as <strong>three levels</strong>:</p> \n<p align=\"center\"> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielmiessler/Personal_AI_Infrastructure/main/images/pai-eli5-diagram.png\" alt=\"The AI Evolution - From chatbots to your personal AI system\" width=\"800\" /> </p> \n<h3>Chatbots</h3> \n<p>ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini—you ask something, it answers, and then it forgets everything. Next conversation starts fresh. No memory of you, your preferences, or what you talked about yesterday.</p> \n<p><strong>The pattern:</strong> Ask → Answer → Forget</p> \n<h3>Agentic Platforms</h3> \n<p>Tools like Claude Code, Cursor, and Windsurf. The AI can actually <em>do</em> things—write code, browse the web, edit files, run commands.</p> \n<p><strong>The pattern:</strong> Ask → Use tools → Get result</p> \n<p>More capable, but it still doesn't know <em>you</em>—your goals, your preferences, your history.</p> \n<h3>PAI (Personal AI Infrastructure)</h3> \n<p>Now your DA <strong>learns and improves</strong>:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Captures every signal</strong> — Ratings, sentiment, verification outcomes</li> \n <li><strong>Learns from mistakes</strong> — Failures get analyzed and fixed</li> \n <li><strong>Gets better over time</strong> — Success patterns get reinforced</li> \n <li><strong>Upgrades itself</strong> — Skills, workflows, even the core behavior evolves</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Plus it knows:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Your goals</strong> — What you're working toward</li> \n <li><strong>Your preferences</strong> — How you like things done</li> \n <li><strong>Your history</strong> — Past decisions and learnings</li> \n</ul> \n<p><strong>The pattern:</strong> Observe → Think → Plan → Execute → Verify → <strong>Learn</strong> → Improve</p> \n<p>The key difference: <strong>PAI learns from feedback</strong>. Every interaction makes it better at helping <em>you</em> specifically.</p> \n<hr /> \n<h2>What is PAI?</h2> \n<p>PAI is a Personalized AI Platform designed to magnify your capabilities.</p> \n<p>It's designed for humans most of all, but can be used by teams, companies, or Federations of Planets desiring to be better versions of themselves.</p> \n<p>The scale of the entity doesn't matter: It's a system for understanding, articulating, and realizing its principal's goals using a full-featured Agentic AI Platform.</p> \n<h3>Who is PAI for?</h3> \n<p><strong>Everyone, full stop.</strong> It's the anti-gatekeeping AI project.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Small business owners</strong> who aren't technical but want AI to handle invoicing, scheduling, customer follow-ups, and marketing</li> \n <li><strong>Companies</strong> who want to understand their data, optimize operations, and make better decisions</li> \n <li><strong>Managers</strong> who want to run their teams more effectively—tracking projects, preparing for reviews, and communicating clearly</li> \n <li><strong>Artists and creatives</strong> who want to find local events, galleries, and opportunities to showcase their work</li> \n <li><strong>Everyday people</strong> who want to improve their lives—better fitness routines, stronger social connections, personal finance, or just getting organized</li> \n <li><strong>Developers</strong> using AI coding assistants who want persistent memory and custom workflows</li> \n <li><strong>Power users</strong> who want their AI to know their goals, preferences, and context</li> \n <li><strong>Teams</strong> building shared AI infrastructure with consistent capabilities</li> \n <li><strong>Experimenters</strong> interested in AI system design and personal AI patterns</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>What makes PAI different?</h3> \n<p>The first thing people ask is:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>How is this different from Claude Code, or any of the other agentic systems?</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Most agentic systems are built around tools with the user being an afterthought. They are also mostly task-based instead of being goal-based using all the context available to them. PAI is the opposite.</p> \n<p><strong>Three core differentiators:</strong></p> \n<ol> \n <li> <p><strong>Goal Orientation</strong> — PAI's primary focus is on the human running it and what they're trying to do in the world, not the tech. This is built into how the system executes all tasks.</p> </li> \n <li> <p><strong>Pursuit of Optimal Output</strong> — The system's outer loop and everything it does is trying to produce the exact right output given the current situation and all the contexts around it.</p> </li> \n <li> <p><strong>Continuous Learning</strong> — The system constantly captures signals about what was done, what changes were made, what outputs were produced for each request, and then how you liked or disliked the results.</p> </li> \n</ol> \n<hr /> \n<h2>The PAI Principles</h2> \n<p>These principles guide how PAI systems are designed and built. <strong><a href=\"https://danielmiessler.com/blog/personal-ai-infrastructure\">Full breakdown →</a></strong></p> \n<table> \n <thead> \n  <tr> \n   <th>#</th> \n   <th>Principle</th> \n   <th>Summary</th> \n  </tr> \n </thead> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td>1</td> \n   <td><strong>User Centricity</strong></td> \n   <td>PAI is built around you, not tooling.

An assistant knows your goals, remembers your preferences, and improves over time. An agent executes commands and forgets.</p> \n<hr /> \n<p align=\"center\"> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielmiessler/Personal_AI_Infrastructure/main/images/pai-primitive-telos.png\" alt=\"TELOS - Deep Goal Understanding\" width=\"700\" /> </p> \n<h3>TELOS (Deep Goal Understanding)</h3> \n<p>10 files that capture who you are: MISSION.md, GOALS.md, PROJECTS.md, BELIEFS.md, MODELS.md, STRATEGIES.md, NARRATIVES.md, LEARNED.md, CHALLENGES.md, IDEAS.md.

Start with defaults, customize when needed.</p> \n<hr /> \n<p align=\"center\"> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielmiessler/Personal_AI_Infrastructure/main/images/pai-component-2-skill-system.png\" alt=\"Skill System\" width=\"700\" /> </p> \n<h3>Skill System</h3> \n<p>Highly focused on consistent results.

You don't have to run with <code>--dangerously-skip-permissions</code> to have an uninterrupted experience. PAI's security hooks validate commands before execution, blocking dangerous operations while allowing normal workflows to proceed smoothly.</p> \n<hr /> \n<p align=\"center\"> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielmiessler/Personal_AI_Infrastructure/main/images/pai-component-4-ai-installation.png\" alt=\"AI-Based Installation\" width=\"700\" /> </p> \n<h3>AI-Based Installation</h3> \n<p>Your AI assistant reads the packs, understands your system, and installs everything for you.

Claude Code gives you an AI that can read files, write code, and execute commands. But it's generic. It doesn't know your goals, your preferred workflows, your history, or your specific context.</p> \n<p>PAI provides the scaffolding to make that generic AI <em>yours</em>:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Persistent memory</strong> — Your DA remembers past sessions, decisions, and learnings</li> \n <li><strong>Custom skills</strong> — Specialized capabilities for the things you do most</li> \n <li><strong>Your context</strong> — Goals, contacts, preferences—all available without re-explaining</li> \n <li><strong>Intelligent routing</strong> — Say \"research this\" and the right workflow triggers automatically</li> \n <li><strong>Self-improvement</strong> — The system modifies itself based on what it learns</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Think of it this way: Claude Code is the engine. PAI is everything else that makes it <em>your</em> car.</p> \n<h3>Do I need to install everything?</h3> \n<p>No. PAI v2 is modular by design:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Packs are independent</strong> — Install one, install ten, install none</li> \n <li><strong>Start small</strong> — Begin with the Hook System, add more when you need it</li> \n <li><strong>No dependencies on the whole</strong> — Each pack declares its dependencies explicitly</li> \n <li><strong>Incremental adoption</strong> — Use PAI alongside your existing setup</li> \n</ul> \n<p>The best way to start: pick ONE pack that solves a problem you have today.</p> \n<h3>What's the difference between PAI and Anthropic's plugin system?</h3> \n<p>Anthropic's plugin system (Skills, slash commands, MCP servers) provides discrete functionality—individual tools your DA can use.</p> \n<p><strong>Anthropic's plugins</strong> = Individual pieces of functionality that don't understand overall context</p> \n<p><strong>PAI</strong> = A complete system where everything understands the context—your goals, your workflows, how pieces work together</p> \n<p>The plugin system offers building blocks. PAI offers a complete system.</p> \n<h3>Is PAI only for Claude Code?</h3> \n<p>No. PAI packs are designed to be platform-agnostic. While the examples use Claude Code, the packs work with OpenCode, Cursor, Windsurf, and custom systems. The code is TypeScript, Python, and Bash—the concepts are universal.</p> \n<h3>How is this different from fabric?</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric\">Fabric</a> is a collection of AI prompts (patterns) for specific tasks. It's focused on <em>what to ask AI</em>.</p> \n<p>PAI is infrastructure for <em>how your DA operates</em>—memory, skills, routing, context, self-improvement. They're complementary. Many PAI users integrate Fabric patterns into their skills.</p> \n<h3>What if I break something?</h3> \n<p>The modular design makes recovery easy:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Packs are isolated</strong> — Breaking one doesn't affect others</li> \n <li><strong>History is preserved</strong> — Your DA's memory survives mistakes</li> \n <li><strong>Git-backed</strong> — Version control everything, roll back when needed</li> \n <li><strong>DA can fix it</strong> — Your DA helped build it, it can help repair it</li> \n</ul> \n<hr /> \n<h2>🎯 Roadmap</h2> \n<table> \n <thead> \n  <tr> \n   <th>Feature</th> \n   <th>Description</th> \n  </tr> \n </thead> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>Local Model Support</strong></td> \n   <td>Run PAI with local models (Ollama, llama.cpp) for privacy and cost control</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>Granular Model Routing</strong></td> \n   <td>Route different tasks to different models based on complexity</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>Remote Access</strong></td> \n   <td>Access your PAI from anywhere—mobile, web, other devices</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>Outbound Phone Calling</strong></td> \n   <td>Voice capabilities for outbound calls</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>External Notifications</strong></td> \n   <td>Robust notification system for Email, Discord, Telegram, Slack</td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<hr /> \n<h2>🌐 Community</h2> \n<p><strong>GitHub Discussions:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/danielmiessler/PAI/discussions\">Join the conversation</a></p> \n<p><strong>UL Community Discord:</strong> PAI is discussed in the <a href=\"https://danielmiessler.com/upgrade\">Unsupervised Learning community</a> along with other AI projects</p> \n<p><strong>Twitter/X:</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/danielmiessler\">@danielmiessler</a></p> \n<p><strong>Blog:</strong> <a href=\"https://danielmiessler.com\">danielmiessler.com</a></p> \n<h3>Star History</h3> \n<a href=\"https://star-history.com/#danielmiessler/PAI&amp;Date\"> \n <picture> \n  <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=danielmiessler/PAI&amp;type=Date&amp;theme=dark\" /> \n  <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=danielmiessler/PAI&amp;type=Date\" /> \n  <img alt=\"Star History Chart\" src=\"https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=danielmiessler/PAI&amp;type=Date\" /> \n </picture> </a> \n<hr /> \n<h2>🤝 Contributing</h2> \n<h3>Submit a Pack</h3> \n<ol> \n <li><strong>Fork the repository</strong></li> \n <li><strong>Create your pack</strong> using <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielmiessler/Personal_AI_Infrastructure/main/Tools/PAIPackTemplate.md\">PAIPackTemplate.md</a></li> \n <li><strong>Test it</strong> — Install in a fresh system with AI assistance</li> \n <li><strong>Submit a PR</strong> with examples and testing evidence</li> \n</ol> \n<p>Packs are reviewed for completeness, code quality, security, and usefulness.

To use this locally, you can build the container like so:</p> \n<pre><code>docker build -t cinny:latest .\n</code></pre> \n<p>You can then run the container you've built with a command similar to this:</p> \n<pre><code>docker run -p 8080:80 cinny:latest\n</code></pre> \n<p>This will forward your <code>localhost</code> port 8080 to the container's port 80. You can visit the app in your browser by navigating to <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>",

The agent picks the right one and streams the props so users can interact with them. \"Show me sales by region\" renders your <code>&lt;Chart&gt;</code>. \"Add a task\" updates your <code>&lt;TaskBoard&gt;</code>.</p> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tambo-ai/tambo/main/#get-started\">Get started in 5 minutes →</a></strong></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8381d607-b878-4823-8b24-ecb8053bef23\">https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8381d607-b878-4823-8b24-ecb8053bef23</a></p> \n<h3>What's Included</h3> \n<p>Tambo is a fullstack solution for adding generative UI to your app. You get a React SDK plus a backend that handles conversation state and agent execution.</p> \n<p><strong>1. Agent included</strong> — Tambo runs the LLM conversation loop for you. Bring your own API key (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Mistral, or any OpenAI-compatible provider). Works with agent frameworks like LangChain and Mastra, but they're not required.</p> \n<p><strong>2. Streaming infrastructure</strong> — Props stream to your components as the LLM generates them. Cancellation, error recovery, and reconnection are handled for you.</p> \n<p><strong>3. Tambo Cloud or self-host</strong> — Cloud is a hosted backend that manages conversation state and agent orchestration. Self-hosted runs the same backend on your infrastructure via Docker.</p> \n<p>Most software is built around a one-size-fits-all mental model. We built Tambo to help developers build software that adapts to users.</p> \n<h2>Get Started</h2> \n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">npm create tambo-app my-tambo-app  # auto-initializes git + tambo setup\ncd my-tambo-app\nnpm run dev\n</code></pre> \n<p><a href=\"https://tambo.link/yXkF0hQ\"><strong>Tambo Cloud</strong></a> is a hosted backend, free to get started with plenty of credits to start building. <strong>Self-hosted</strong> runs on your own infrastructure.</p> \n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://ui.tambo.co\">pre-built component library</a> for agent and generative UI primitives:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6cbc103b-9cc7-40f5-9746-12e04c976dff\">https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6cbc103b-9cc7-40f5-9746-12e04c976dff</a></p> \n<p>Or fork a template:</p> \n<table> \n <thead> \n  <tr> \n   <th>Template</th> \n   <th>Description</th> \n  </tr> \n </thead> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td><a href=\"https://github.com/tambo-ai/tambo-template\">AI Chat with Generative UI</a></td> \n   <td>Chat interface with dynamic component generation</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><a href=\"https://github.com/tambo-ai/analytics-template\">AI Analytics Dashboard</a></td> \n   <td>Analytics dashboard with AI-powered visualization</td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<h2>How It Works</h2> \n<p>Tell the AI which components it can use. Zod schemas define the props. These schemas become LLM tool definitions—the agent calls them like functions and Tambo renders the result.</p> \n<h3>Generative Components</h3> \n<p>Render once in response to a message. Charts, summaries, data visualizations.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3bd340e7-e226-4151-ae40-aab9b3660d8b\">https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3bd340e7-e226-4151-ae40-aab9b3660d8b</a></p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-tsx\">const components: TamboComponent[] = [\n  {\n    name: \"Graph\",\n    description: \"Displays data as charts using Recharts library\",\n    component: Graph,\n    propsSchema: z.object({\n      data: z.array(z.object({ name: z.string(), value: z.number() })),\n      type: z.enum([\"line\", \"bar\", \"pie\"]),\n    }),\n  },\n];\n</code></pre> \n<h3>Interactable Components</h3> \n<p>Persist and update as users refine requests.

Use <code>userToken</code> (OAuth access token) for client-side apps where the token contains the user identity.

privately, on your machine.</p> \n<p>You can do things like:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><code>Build me a deck about our next quarter roadmap</code> → generates a PDF using context from your knowledge graph</li> \n <li><code>Prep me for my meeting with Alex</code> → pulls past decisions, open questions, and relevant threads into a crisp brief (or a voice note)</li> \n <li>Visualize, edit, and update your knowledge graph anytime (it’s just Markdown)</li> \n <li>Record voice memos that automatically capture and update key takeaways in the graph</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Download latest for Mac/Windows/Linux: <a href=\"https://www.rowboatlabs.com/downloads\">Download</a></p> \n<h2>Demo</h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AWoGo-L16I\"><img src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f560bcf-d93c-4064-81eb-75a9fae31742\" alt=\"Demo\" /></a></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AWoGo-L16I\">Watch the full video</a></p> \n<hr /> \n<h2>Installation</h2> \n<p><strong>Download latest for Mac/Windows/Linux:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.rowboatlabs.com/downloads\">Download</a></p> \n<p><strong>All release files:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/rowboatlabs/rowboat/releases/latest\">https://github.com/rowboatlabs/rowboat/releases/latest</a></p> \n<h3>Google setup</h3> \n<p>To connect Google services (Gmail, Calendar, and Drive), follow <a href=\"https://github.com/rowboatlabs/rowboat/raw/main/google-setup.md\">Google setup</a>.</p> \n<h3>Voice notes</h3> \n<p>To enable voice notes (optional), add a Deepgram API key in ~/.rowboat/config/deepgram.json:</p> \n<pre><code>{\n  \"apiKey\": \"&lt;key&gt;\"\n}\n</code></pre> \n<h3>Web search</h3> \n<p>To use Brave web search (optional), add the Brave API key in ~/.rowboat/config/brave-search.json.</p> \n<p>To use Exa research search (optional), add the Exa API key in ~/.rowboat/config/exa-search.json.</p> \n<p>(same format as above)</p> \n<h2>What it does</h2> \n<p>Rowboat is a <strong>local-first AI coworker</strong> that can:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Remember</strong> the important context you don’t want to re-explain (people, projects, decisions, commitments)</li> \n <li><strong>Understand</strong> what’s relevant right now (before a meeting, while replying to an email, when writing a doc)</li> \n <li><strong>Help you act</strong> by drafting, summarizing, planning, and producing real artifacts (briefs, emails, docs, PDF slides)</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Under the hood, Rowboat maintains an <strong>Obsidian-compatible vault</strong> of plain Markdown notes with backlinks — a transparent “working memory” you can inspect and edit.</p> \n<h2>Integrations</h2> \n<p>Rowboat builds memory from the work you already do, including:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Gmail</strong> (email)</li> \n <li><strong>Granola</strong> (meeting notes)</li> \n <li><strong>Fireflies</strong> (meeting notes)</li> \n</ul> \n<h2>How it’s different</h2> \n<p>Most AI tools reconstruct context on demand by searching transcripts or documents.</p> \n<p>Rowboat maintains <strong>long-lived knowledge</strong> instead:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>context accumulates over time</li> \n <li>relationships are explicit and inspectable</li> \n <li>notes are editable by you, not hidden inside a model</li> \n <li>everything lives on your machine as plain Markdown</li> \n</ul> \n<p>The result is memory that compounds, rather than retrieval that starts cold every time.</p> \n<h2>What you can do with it</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Meeting prep</strong> from prior decisions, threads, and open questions</li> \n <li><strong>Email drafting</strong> grounded in history and commitments</li> \n <li><strong>Docs &amp; decks</strong> generated from your ongoing context (including PDF slides)</li> \n <li><strong>Follow-ups</strong>: capture decisions, action items, and owners so nothing gets dropped</li> \n <li><strong>On-your-machine help</strong>: create files, summarize into notes, and run workflows using local tools (with explicit, reviewable actions)</li> \n</ul> \n<h2>Background agents</h2> \n<p>Rowboat can spin up <strong>background agents</strong> to do repeatable work automatically - so routine tasks happen without you having to ask every time.</p> \n<p>Examples:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Draft email replies in the background (grounded in your past context and commitments)</li> \n <li>Generate a daily voice note each morning (agenda, priorities, upcoming meetings)</li> \n <li>Create recurring project updates from the latest emails/notes</li> \n <li>Keep your knowledge graph up to date as new information comes in</li> \n</ul> \n<p>You control what runs, when it runs, and what gets written back into your local Markdown vault.</p> \n<h2>Bring your own model</h2> \n<p>Rowboat works with the model setup you prefer:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Local models</strong> via Ollama or LM Studio</li> \n <li><strong>Hosted models</strong> (bring your own API key/provider)</li> \n <li>Swap models anytime — your data stays in your local Markdown vault</li> \n</ul> \n<h2>Extend Rowboat with tools (MCP)</h2> \n<p>Rowboat can connect to external tools and services via <strong>Model Context Protocol (MCP)</strong>. That means you can plug in (for example) search, databases, CRMs, support tools, and automations - or your own internal tools.</p> \n<p>Examples: Exa (web search), Twitter/X, ElevenLabs (voice), Slack, Linear/Jira, GitHub, and more.</p> \n<h2>Local-first by design</h2> \n<ul> \n <li>All data is stored locally as plain Markdown</li> \n <li>No proprietary formats or hosted lock-in</li> \n <li>You can inspect, edit, back up, or delete everything at any time</li> \n</ul> \n<h2>Looking for Rowboat Web Studio?</h2> \n<p>If you’re looking for Rowboat web Studio, start <a href=\"https://docs.rowboatlabs.com/\">here</a>.</p> \n<hr /> \n<div align=\"center\"> \n <p><a href=\"https://discord.gg/wajrgmJQ6b\">Discord</a> · <a href=\"https://x.com/intent/user?screen_name=rowboatlabshq\">Twitter</a></p> \n</div>",

It acts as a Model-Context-Protocol (MCP) server, giving your AI coding assistant access to the full power of Chrome DevTools for reliable automation, in-depth debugging, and performance analysis.</p> \n<h2><a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChromeDevTools/chrome-devtools-mcp/main/docs/tool-reference.md\">Tool reference</a> | <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChromeDevTools/chrome-devtools-mcp/main/CHANGELOG.md\">Changelog</a> | <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChromeDevTools/chrome-devtools-mcp/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\">Contributing</a> | <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChromeDevTools/chrome-devtools-mcp/main/docs/troubleshooting.md\">Troubleshooting</a> | <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChromeDevTools/chrome-devtools-mcp/main/docs/design-principles.md\">Design Principles</a></h2> \n<h2>Key features</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Get performance insights</strong>: Uses <a href=\"https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/devtools-frontend\">Chrome DevTools</a> to record traces and extract actionable performance insights.</li> \n <li><strong>Advanced browser debugging</strong>: Analyze network requests, take screenshots and check browser console messages (with source-mapped stack traces).</li> \n <li><strong>Reliable automation</strong>. Uses <a href=\"https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer\">puppeteer</a> to automate actions in Chrome and automatically wait for action results.</li> \n</ul> \n<h2>Disclaimers</h2> \n<p><code>chrome-devtools-mcp</code> exposes content of the browser instance to the MCP clients allowing them to inspect, debug, and modify any data in the browser or DevTools. Avoid sharing sensitive or personal information that you don't want to share with MCP clients.</p> \n<p>Performance tools may send trace URLs to the Google CrUX API to fetch real-user experience data. This helps provide a holistic performance picture by presenting field data alongside lab data. This data is collected by the <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/crux\">Chrome User Experience Report (CrUX)</a>. To disable this, run with the <code>--no-performance-crux</code> flag.</p> \n<h2><strong>Usage statistics</strong></h2> \n<p>Google collects usage statistics (such as tool invocation success rates, latency, and environment information) to improve the reliability and performance of Chrome DevTools MCP.</p> \n<p>Data collection is <strong>enabled by default</strong>. You can opt-out by passing the <code>--no-usage-statistics</code> flag when starting the server:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-json\">\"args\": [\"-y\", \"chrome-devtools-mcp@latest\", \"--no-usage-statistics\"]\n</code></pre> \n<p>Google handles this data in accordance with the <a href=\"https://policies.google.com/privacy\">Google Privacy Policy</a>.</p> \n<p>Google's collection of usage statistics for Chrome DevTools MCP is independent from the Chrome browser's usage statistics. Opting out of Chrome metrics does not automatically opt you out of this tool, and vice-versa.</p> \n<p>Collection is disabled if CHROME_DEVTOOLS_MCP_NO_USAGE_STATISTICS or CI env variables are set.</p> \n<h2>Requirements</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://nodejs.org/\">Node.js</a> v20.19 or a newer <a href=\"https://github.com/nodejs/Release#release-schedule\">latest maintenance LTS</a> version.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.google.com/chrome/\">Chrome</a> current stable version or newer.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/\">npm</a>.</li> \n</ul> \n<h2>Getting started</h2> \n<p>Add the following config to your MCP client:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-json\">{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"chrome-devtools\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"chrome-devtools-mcp@latest\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> \n<blockquote> \n <p>[!NOTE]<br /> Using <code>chrome-devtools-mcp@latest</code> ensures that your MCP client will always use the latest version of the Chrome DevTools MCP server.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<h3>MCP Client configuration</h3> \n<details> \n <summary>Amp</summary> Follow https://ampcode.com/manual#mcp and use the config provided above. You can also install the Chrome DevTools MCP server using the CLI: \n <pre><code class=\"language-bash\">amp mcp add chrome-devtools -- npx chrome-devtools-mcp@latest\n</code></pre> \n</details> \n<details> \n <summary>Antigravity</summary> \n <p>To use the Chrome DevTools MCP server follow the instructions from <a href=\"https://antigravity.google/docs/mcp\">Antigravity's docs</a> to install a custom MCP server. Add the following config to the MCP servers config:</p> \n <pre><code class=\"language-bash\">{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"chrome-devtools\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"chrome-devtools-mcp@latest\",\n        \"--browser-url=http://127.0.0.1:9222\",\n        \"-y\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> \n <p>This will make the Chrome DevTools MCP server automatically connect to the browser that Antigravity is using. If you are not using port 9222, make sure to adjust accordingly.</p> \n <p>Chrome DevTools MCP will not start the browser instance automatically using this approach as as the Chrome DevTools MCP server runs in Antigravity's built-in browser. If the browser is not already running, you have to start it first by clicking the Chrome icon at the top right corner.</p> \n</details> \n<details> \n <summary>Claude Code</summary> \n <p><strong>Install via CLI (MCP only)</strong></p> \n <p>Use the Claude Code CLI to add the Chrome DevTools MCP server (<a href=\"https://code.claude.com/docs/en/mcp\">guide</a>):</p> \n <pre><code class=\"language-bash\">claude mcp add chrome-devtools --scope user npx chrome-devtools-mcp@latest\n</code></pre> \n <p><strong>Install as a Plugin (MCP + Skills)</strong></p> \n <p>To install Chrome DevTools MCP with skills, add the marketplace registry in Claude Code:</p> \n <pre><code class=\"language-sh\">/plugin marketplace add ChromeDevTools/chrome-devtools-mcp\n</code></pre> \n <p>Then, install the plugin:</p> \n <pre><code class=\"language-sh\">/plugin install chrome-devtools-mcp\n</code></pre> \n <p>Restart Claude Code to have the MCP server and skills load (check with <code>/skills</code>).</p> \n</details> \n<details> \n <summary>Cline</summary> Follow https://docs.cline.bot/mcp/configuring-mcp-servers and use the config provided above. \n</details> \n<details> \n <summary>Codex</summary> Follow the \n <a href=\"https://github.com/openai/codex/raw/main/docs/advanced.md#model-context-protocol-mcp\">configure MCP guide</a> using the standard config from above.

Set the <code>isolated</code> option to <code>true</code> to use a temporary user data dir instead which will be cleared automatically after the browser is closed.</p> \n<h3>Connecting to a running Chrome instance</h3> \n<p>By default, the Chrome DevTools MCP server will start a new Chrome instance with a dedicated profile. This might not be ideal in all situations:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>If you would like to maintain the same application state when alternating between manual site testing and agent-driven testing.</li> \n <li>When the MCP needs to sign into a website. Some accounts may prevent sign-in when the browser is controlled via WebDriver (the default launch mechanism for the Chrome DevTools MCP server).</li> \n <li>If you're running your LLM inside a sandboxed environment, but you would like to connect to a Chrome instance that runs outside the sandbox.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>In these cases, start Chrome first and let the Chrome DevTools MCP server connect to it. There are two ways to do so:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Automatic connection (available in Chrome 144)</strong>: best for sharing state between manual and agent-driven testing.</li> \n <li><strong>Manual connection via remote debugging port</strong>: best when running inside a sandboxed environment.</li> \n</ul> \n<h4>Automatically connecting to a running Chrome instance</h4> \n<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Set up remote debugging in Chrome</p> \n<p>In Chrome (&gt;= M144), do the following to set up remote debugging:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>Navigate to <code>chrome://inspect/#remote-debugging</code> to enable remote debugging.</li> \n <li>Follow the dialog UI to allow or disallow incoming debugging connections.</li> \n</ol> \n<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Configure Chrome DevTools MCP server to automatically connect to a running Chrome Instance</p> \n<p>To connect the <code>chrome-devtools-mcp</code> server to the running Chrome instance, use <code>--autoConnect</code> command line argument for the MCP server.</p> \n<p>The following code snippet is an example configuration for gemini-cli:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-json\">{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"chrome-devtools\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"chrome-devtools-mcp@latest\", \"--autoConnect\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> \n<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Test your setup</p> \n<p>Make sure your browser is running. Open gemini-cli and run the following prompt:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-none\">Check the performance of https://developers.chrome.com\n</code></pre> \n<blockquote> \n <p>[!NOTE]<br /> The <code>autoConnect</code> option requires the user to start Chrome. If the user has multiple active profiles, the MCP server will connect to the default profile (as determined by Chrome). The MCP server has access to all open windows for the selected profile.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>The Chrome DevTools MCP server will try to connect to your running Chrome instance. It shows a dialog asking for user permission.</p> \n<p>Clicking <strong>Allow</strong> results in the Chrome DevTools MCP server opening <a href=\"http://developers.chrome.com\">developers.chrome.com</a> and taking a performance trace.</p> \n<h4>Manual connection using port forwarding</h4> \n<p>You can connect to a running Chrome instance by using the <code>--browser-url</code> option. This is useful if you are running the MCP server in a sandboxed environment that does not allow starting a new Chrome instance.</p> \n<p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to connect to a running Chrome instance:</p> \n<p><strong>Step 1: Configure the MCP client</strong></p> \n<p>Add the <code>--browser-url</code> option to your MCP client configuration. The value of this option should be the URL of the running Chrome instance. <code>http://127.0.0.1:9222</code> is a common default.</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-json\">{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"chrome-devtools\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"chrome-devtools-mcp@latest\",\n        \"--browser-url=http://127.0.0.1:9222\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> \n<p><strong>Step 2: Start the Chrome browser</strong></p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>[!WARNING]<br /> Enabling the remote debugging port opens up a debugging port on the running browser instance. Any application on your machine can connect to this port and control the browser. Make sure that you are not browsing any sensitive websites while the debugging port is open.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Start the Chrome browser with the remote debugging port enabled. Make sure to close any running Chrome instances before starting a new one with the debugging port enabled. The port number you choose must be the same as the one you specified in the <code>--browser-url</code> option in your MCP client configuration.</p> \n<p>For security reasons, <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/blog/remote-debugging-port\">Chrome requires you to use a non-default user data directory</a> when enabling the remote debugging port. You can specify a custom directory using the <code>--user-data-dir</code> flag. This ensures that your regular browsing profile and data are not exposed to the debugging session.</p> \n<p><strong>macOS</strong></p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">/Applications/Google\\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\\ Chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir=/tmp/chrome-profile-stable\n</code></pre> \n<p><strong>Linux</strong></p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">/usr/bin/google-chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir=/tmp/chrome-profile-stable\n</code></pre> \n<p><strong>Windows</strong></p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">\"C:\\Program Files\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe\" --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir=\"%TEMP%\\chrome-profile-stable\"\n</code></pre> \n<p><strong>Step 3: Test your setup</strong></p> \n<p>After configuring the MCP client and starting the Chrome browser, you can test your setup by running a simple prompt in your MCP client:</p> \n<pre><code>Check the performance of https://developers.chrome.com\n</code></pre> \n<p>Your MCP client should connect to the running Chrome instance and receive a performance report.</p> \n<p>If you hit VM-to-host port forwarding issues, see the “Remote debugging between virtual machine (VM) and host fails” section in <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChromeDevTools/chrome-devtools-mcp/main/docs/troubleshooting.md#remote-debugging-between-virtual-machine-vm-and-host-fails\"><code>docs/troubleshooting.md</code></a>.</p> \n<p>For more details on remote debugging, see the <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/remote-debugging/\">Chrome DevTools documentation</a>.</p> \n<h3>Debugging Chrome on Android</h3> \n<p>Please consult <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChromeDevTools/chrome-devtools-mcp/main/docs/debugging-android.md\">these instructions</a>.</p> \n<h2>Known limitations</h2> \n<p>See <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChromeDevTools/chrome-devtools-mcp/main/docs/troubleshooting.md\">Troubleshooting</a>.</p>",

Follow our step-by-step <a href=\"https://github.github.com/gh-aw/setup/quick-start/\">Quick Start Guide</a> to install the extension, add a sample workflow, and see it in action.</p> \n<h2>Overview</h2> \n<p>Learn about the concepts behind agentic workflows, explore available workflow types, and understand how AI can automate your repository tasks. See <a href=\"https://github.github.com/gh-aw/introduction/how-they-work/\">How It Works</a>.</p> \n<h2>Guardrails</h2> \n<p>Guardrails, safety and security are foundational to GitHub Agentic Workflows. Workflows run with read-only permissions by default, with write operations only allowed through sanitized <code>safe-outputs</code>. The system implements multiple layers of protection including sandboxed execution, input sanitization, network isolation, supply chain security (SHA-pinned dependencies), tool allow-listing, and compile-time validation. Access can be gated to team members only, with human approval gates for critical operations, ensuring AI agents operate safely within controlled boundaries. See the <a href=\"https://github.github.com/gh-aw/introduction/architecture/\">Security Architecture</a> for comprehensive details on threat modeling, implementation guidelines, and best practices.</p> \n<p>Using agentic workflows in your repository requires careful attention to security considerations and careful human supervision, and even then things can still go wrong. Use it with caution, and at your own risk.</p> \n<h2>Documentation</h2> \n<p>For complete documentation, examples, and guides, see the <a href=\"https://github.github.com/gh-aw/\">Documentation</a>.</p> \n<h2>Contributing</h2> \n<p>For development setup and contribution guidelines, see <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gh-aw/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\">CONTRIBUTING.md</a>.</p> \n<h2>Share Feedback</h2> \n<p>We welcome your feedback on GitHub Agentic Workflows!</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/186451\">Community Feedback Discussions</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://gh.io/next-discord\">GitHub Next Discord</a></li> \n</ul> \n<h2>Peli's Agent Factory</h2> \n<p>See the <a href=\"https://github.github.com/gh-aw/blog/2026-01-12-welcome-to-pelis-agent-factory/\">Peli's Agent Factory</a> for a guided tour through many uses of agentic workflows.</p> \n<h2>Related Projects</h2> \n<p>GitHub Agentic Workflows is supported by companion projects that provide additional security and integration capabilities:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/github/gh-aw-firewall\">Agent Workflow Firewall (AWF)</a></strong> - Network egress control for AI agents, providing domain-based access controls and activity logging for secure workflow execution</li> \n <li><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/github/gh-aw-mcpg\">MCP Gateway</a></strong> - Routes Model Context Protocol (MCP) server calls through a unified HTTP gateway for centralized access management</li> \n</ul>",

It processes materials such as clinical notes or reports, identifying and organizing key details while ensuring the extracted data corresponds to the source text.</p> \n<h2>Why LangExtract?</h2> \n<ol> \n <li><strong>Precise Source Grounding:</strong> Maps every extraction to its exact location in the source text, enabling visual highlighting for easy traceability and verification.</li> \n <li><strong>Reliable Structured Outputs:</strong> Enforces a consistent output schema based on your few-shot examples, leveraging controlled generation in supported models like Gemini to guarantee robust, structured results.</li> \n <li><strong>Optimized for Long Documents:</strong> Overcomes the \"needle-in-a-haystack\" challenge of large document extraction by using an optimized strategy of text chunking, parallel processing, and multiple passes for higher recall.</li> \n <li><strong>Interactive Visualization:</strong> Instantly generates a self-contained, interactive HTML file to visualize and review thousands of extracted entities in their original context.</li> \n <li><strong>Flexible LLM Support:</strong> Supports your preferred models, from cloud-based LLMs like the Google Gemini family to local open-source models via the built-in Ollama interface.</li> \n <li><strong>Adaptable to Any Domain:</strong> Define extraction tasks for any domain using just a few examples. LangExtract adapts to your needs without requiring any model fine-tuning.</li> \n <li><strong>Leverages LLM World Knowledge:</strong> Utilize precise prompt wording and few-shot examples to influence how the extraction task may utilize LLM knowledge. The accuracy of any inferred information and its adherence to the task specification are contingent upon the selected LLM, the complexity of the task, the clarity of the prompt instructions, and the nature of the prompt examples.</li> \n</ol> \n<h2>Quick Start</h2> \n<blockquote> \n <p><strong>Note:</strong> Using cloud-hosted models like Gemini requires an API key. See the <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/langextract/main/#api-key-setup-for-cloud-models\">API Key Setup</a> section for instructions on how to get and configure your key.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Extract structured information with just a few lines of code.</p> \n<h3>1. Define Your Extraction Task</h3> \n<p>First, create a prompt that clearly describes what you want to extract. Then, provide a high-quality example to guide the model.</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">import langextract as lx\nimport textwrap\n\n# 1. Define the prompt and extraction rules\nprompt = textwrap.dedent(\"\"\"\\\n    Extract characters, emotions, and relationships in order of appearance.\n    Use exact text for extractions. Do not paraphrase or overlap entities.\n    Provide meaningful attributes for each entity to add context.\"\"\")\n\n# 2. Provide a high-quality example to guide the model\nexamples = [\n    lx.data.ExampleData(\n        text=\"ROMEO. But soft! What light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.\",\n        extractions=[\n            lx.data.Extraction(\n                extraction_class=\"character\",\n                extraction_text=\"ROMEO\",\n                attributes={\"emotional_state\": \"wonder\"}\n            ),\n            lx.data.Extraction(\n                extraction_class=\"emotion\",\n                extraction_text=\"But soft!\",\n                attributes={\"feeling\": \"gentle awe\"}\n            ),\n            lx.data.Extraction(\n                extraction_class=\"relationship\",\n                extraction_text=\"Juliet is the sun\",\n                attributes={\"type\": \"metaphor\"}\n            ),\n        ]\n    )\n]\n</code></pre> \n<blockquote> \n <p><strong>Note:</strong> Examples drive model behavior. Each <code>extraction_text</code> should ideally be verbatim from the example's <code>text</code> (no paraphrasing), listed in order of appearance. LangExtract raises <code>Prompt alignment</code> warnings by default if examples don't follow this pattern—resolve these for best results.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<h3>2. Run the Extraction</h3> \n<p>Provide your input text and the prompt materials to the <code>lx.extract</code> function.</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-python\"># The input text to be processed\ninput_text = \"Lady Juliet gazed longingly at the stars, her heart aching for Romeo\"\n\n# Run the extraction\nresult = lx.extract(\n    text_or_documents=input_text,\n    prompt_description=prompt,\n    examples=examples,\n    model_id=\"gemini-2.5-flash\",\n)\n</code></pre> \n<blockquote> \n <p><strong>Model Selection</strong>: <code>gemini-2.5-flash</code> is the recommended default, offering an excellent balance of speed, cost, and quality. For highly complex tasks requiring deeper reasoning, <code>gemini-2.5-pro</code> may provide superior results. For large-scale or production use, a Tier 2 Gemini quota is suggested to increase throughput and avoid rate limits. See the <a href=\"https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/rate-limits#tier-2\">rate-limit documentation</a> for details.</p> \n <p><strong>Model Lifecycle</strong>: Note that Gemini models have a lifecycle with defined retirement dates. Users should consult the <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/model-versions\">official model version documentation</a> to stay informed about the latest stable and legacy versions.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<h3>3. Visualize the Results</h3> \n<p>The extractions can be saved to a <code>.jsonl</code> file, a popular format for working with language model data. LangExtract can then generate an interactive HTML visualization from this file to review the entities in context.</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-python\"># Save the results to a JSONL file\nlx.io.save_annotated_documents([result], output_name=\"extraction_results.jsonl\", output_dir=\".\")\n\n# Generate the visualization from the file\nhtml_content = lx.visualize(\"extraction_results.jsonl\")\nwith open(\"visualization.html\", \"w\") as f:\n    if hasattr(html_content, 'data'):\n        f.write(html_content.data)  # For Jupyter/Colab\n    else:\n        f.write(html_content)\n</code></pre> \n<p>This creates an animated and interactive HTML file:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/langextract/main/docs/_static/romeo_juliet_basic.gif\" alt=\"Romeo and Juliet Basic Visualization \" /></p> \n<blockquote> \n <p><strong>Note on LLM Knowledge Utilization:</strong> This example demonstrates extractions that stay close to the text evidence - extracting \"longing\" for Lady Juliet's emotional state and identifying \"yearning\" from \"gazed longingly at the stars.\" The task could be modified to generate attributes that draw more heavily from the LLM's world knowledge (e.g., adding <code>\"identity\": \"Capulet family daughter\"</code> or <code>\"literary_context\": \"tragic heroine\"</code>). The balance between text-evidence and knowledge-inference is controlled by your prompt instructions and example attributes.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<h3>Scaling to Longer Documents</h3> \n<p>For larger texts, you can process entire documents directly from URLs with parallel processing and enhanced sensitivity:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-python\"># Process Romeo &amp; Juliet directly from Project Gutenberg\nresult = lx.extract(\n    text_or_documents=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1513/1513-0.txt\",\n    prompt_description=prompt,\n    examples=examples,\n    model_id=\"gemini-2.5-flash\",\n    extraction_passes=3,    # Improves recall through multiple passes\n    max_workers=20,         # Parallel processing for speed\n    max_char_buffer=1000    # Smaller contexts for better accuracy\n)\n</code></pre> \n<p>This approach can extract hundreds of entities from full novels while maintaining high accuracy. The interactive visualization seamlessly handles large result sets, making it easy to explore hundreds of entities from the output JSONL file. <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/google/langextract/raw/main/docs/examples/longer_text_example.md\">See the full <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> extraction example →</a></strong> for detailed results and performance insights.</p> \n<h3>Vertex AI Batch Processing</h3> \n<p>Save costs on large-scale tasks by enabling Vertex AI Batch API: <code>language_model_params={\"vertexai\": True, \"batch\": {\"enabled\": True}}</code>.</p> \n<p>See an example of the Vertex AI Batch API usage in <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/langextract/main/docs/examples/batch_api_example.md\">this example</a>.</p> \n<h2>Installation</h2> \n<h3>From PyPI</h3> \n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">pip install langextract\n</code></pre> \n<p><em>Recommended for most users. For isolated environments, consider using a virtual environment:</em></p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">python -m venv langextract_env\nsource langextract_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: langextract_env\\Scripts\\activate\npip install langextract\n</code></pre> \n<h3>From Source</h3> \n<p>LangExtract uses modern Python packaging with <code>pyproject.toml</code> for dependency management:</p> \n<p><em>Installing with <code>-e</code> puts the package in development mode, allowing you to modify the code without reinstalling.</em></p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">git clone https://github.com/google/langextract.git\ncd langextract\n\n# For basic installation:\npip install -e .\n\n# For development (includes linting tools):\npip install -e \".[dev]\"\n\n# For testing (includes pytest):\npip install -e \".[test]\"\n</code></pre> \n<h3>Docker</h3> \n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">docker build -t langextract .\ndocker run --rm -e LANGEXTRACT_API_KEY=\"your-api-key\" langextract python your_script.py\n</code></pre> \n<h2>API Key Setup for Cloud Models</h2> \n<p>When using LangExtract with cloud-hosted models (like Gemini or OpenAI), you'll need to set up an API key. On-device models don't require an API key. For developers using local LLMs, LangExtract offers built-in support for Ollama and can be extended to other third-party APIs by updating the inference endpoints.</p> \n<h3>API Key Sources</h3> \n<p>Get API keys from:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey\">AI Studio</a> for Gemini models</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/sdks/overview\">Vertex AI</a> for enterprise use</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/api-keys\">OpenAI Platform</a> for OpenAI models</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Setting up API key in your environment</h3> \n<p><strong>Option 1: Environment Variable</strong></p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">export LANGEXTRACT_API_KEY=\"your-api-key-here\"\n</code></pre> \n<p><strong>Option 2: .env File (Recommended)</strong></p> \n<p>Add your API key to a <code>.env</code> file:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\"># Add API key to .env file\ncat &gt;&gt; .env &lt;&lt; 'EOF'\nLANGEXTRACT_API_KEY=your-api-key-here\nEOF\n\n# Keep your API key secure\necho '.env' &gt;&gt; .gitignore\n</code></pre> \n<p>In your Python code:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">import langextract as lx\n\nresult = lx.extract(\n    text_or_documents=input_text,\n    prompt_description=\"Extract information...\",\n    examples=[...],\n    model_id=\"gemini-2.5-flash\"\n)\n</code></pre> \n<p><strong>Option 3: Direct API Key (Not Recommended for Production)</strong></p> \n<p>You can also provide the API key directly in your code, though this is not recommended for production use:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">result = lx.extract(\n    text_or_documents=input_text,\n    prompt_description=\"Extract information...\",\n    examples=[...],\n    model_id=\"gemini-2.5-flash\",\n    api_key=\"your-api-key-here\"  # Only use this for testing/development\n)\n</code></pre> \n<p><strong>Option 4: Vertex AI (Service Accounts)</strong></p> \n<p>Use <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/start/introduction-unified-platform\">Vertex AI</a> for authentication with service accounts:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">result = lx.extract(\n    text_or_documents=input_text,\n    prompt_description=\"Extract information...\",\n    examples=[...],\n    model_id=\"gemini-2.5-flash\",\n    language_model_params={\n        \"vertexai\": True,\n        \"project\": \"your-project-id\",\n        \"location\": \"global\"  # or regional endpoint\n    }\n)\n</code></pre> \n<h2>Adding Custom Model Providers</h2> \n<p>LangExtract supports custom LLM providers via a lightweight plugin system. You can add support for new models without changing core code.</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Add new model support independently of the core library</li> \n <li>Distribute your provider as a separate Python package</li> \n <li>Keep custom dependencies isolated</li> \n <li>Override or extend built-in providers via priority-based resolution</li> \n</ul> \n<p>See the detailed guide in <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/langextract/main/langextract/providers/README.md\">Provider System Documentation</a> to learn how to:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Register a provider with <code>@registry.register(...)</code></li> \n <li>Publish an entry point for discovery</li> \n <li>Optionally provide a schema with <code>get_schema_class()</code> for structured output</li> \n <li>Integrate with the factory via <code>create_model(...)</code></li> \n</ul> \n<h2>Using OpenAI Models</h2> \n<p>LangExtract supports OpenAI models (requires optional dependency: <code>pip install langextract[openai]</code>):</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">import langextract as lx\n\nresult = lx.extract(\n    text_or_documents=input_text,\n    prompt_description=prompt,\n    examples=examples,\n    model_id=\"gpt-4o\",  # Automatically selects OpenAI provider\n    api_key=os.environ.get('OPENAI_API_KEY'),\n    fence_output=True,\n    use_schema_constraints=False\n)\n</code></pre> \n<p>Note: OpenAI models require <code>fence_output=True</code> and <code>use_schema_constraints=False</code> because LangExtract doesn't implement schema constraints for OpenAI yet.</p> \n<h2>Using Local LLMs with Ollama</h2> \n<p>LangExtract supports local inference using Ollama, allowing you to run models without API keys:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">import langextract as lx\n\nresult = lx.extract(\n    text_or_documents=input_text,\n    prompt_description=prompt,\n    examples=examples,\n    model_id=\"gemma2:2b\",  # Automatically selects Ollama provider\n    model_url=\"http://localhost:11434\",\n    fence_output=False,\n    use_schema_constraints=False\n)\n</code></pre> \n<p><strong>Quick setup:</strong> Install Ollama from <a href=\"https://ollama.com/\">ollama.com</a>, run <code>ollama pull gemma2:2b</code>, then <code>ollama serve</code>.</p> \n<p>For detailed installation, Docker setup, and examples, see <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/langextract/main/examples/ollama/\"><code>examples/ollama/</code></a>.</p> \n<h2>More Examples</h2> \n<p>Additional examples of LangExtract in action:</p> \n<h3><em>Romeo and Juliet</em> Full Text Extraction</h3> \n<p>LangExtract can process complete documents directly from URLs. This example demonstrates extraction from the full text of <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> from Project Gutenberg (147,843 characters), showing parallel processing, sequential extraction passes, and performance optimization for long document processing.</p> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/google/langextract/raw/main/docs/examples/longer_text_example.md\">View <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> Full Text Example →</a></strong></p> \n<h3>Medication Extraction</h3> \n<blockquote> \n <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This demonstration is for illustrative purposes of LangExtract's baseline capability only.

This project is still in development, and not ready for the prime time.</p> \n<p>A minimal, secure Python interpreter written in Rust for use by AI.</p> \n<p>Monty avoids the cost, latency, complexity and general faff of using a full container based sandbox for running LLM generated code.</p> \n<p>Instead, it lets you safely run Python code written by an LLM embedded in your agent, with startup times measured in single digit microseconds not hundreds of milliseconds.</p> \n<p>What Monty <strong>can</strong> do:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Run a reasonable subset of Python code - enough for your agent to express what it wants to do</li> \n <li>Completely block access to the host environment: filesystem, env variables and network access are all implemented via external function calls the developer can control</li> \n <li>Call functions on the host - only functions you give it access to</li> \n <li>Run typechecking - monty supports full modern python type hints and comes with <a href=\"https://docs.astral.sh/ty/\">ty</a> included in a single binary to run typechecking</li> \n <li>Be snapshotted to bytes at external function calls, meaning you can store the interpreter state in a file or database, and resume later</li> \n <li>Startup extremely fast (&lt;1μs to go from code to execution result), and has runtime performance that is similar to CPython (generally between 5x faster and 5x slower)</li> \n <li>Be called from Rust, Python, or Javascript - because Monty has no dependencies on cpython, you can use it anywhere you can run Rust</li> \n <li>Control resource usage - Monty can track memory usage, allocations, stack depth, and execution time and cancel execution if it exceeds preset limits</li> \n <li>Collect stdout and stderr and return it to the caller</li> \n <li>Run async or sync code on the host via async or sync code on the host</li> \n</ul> \n<p>What Monty <strong>cannot</strong> do:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Use the standard library (except a few select modules: <code>sys</code>, <code>typing</code>, <code>asyncio</code>, <code>dataclasses</code> (soon), <code>json</code> (soon))</li> \n <li>Use third party libraries (like Pydantic), support for external python library is not a goal</li> \n <li>define classes (support should come soon)</li> \n <li>use match statements (again, support should come soon)</li> \n</ul> \n<hr /> \n<p>In short, Monty is extremely limited and designed for <strong>one</strong> use case:</p> \n<p><strong>To run code written by agents.</strong></p> \n<p>For motivation on why you might want to do this, see:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/code-mode/\">Codemode</a> from Cloudflare</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/programmatic-tool-calling\">Programmatic Tool Calling</a> from Anthropic</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/code-execution-with-mcp\">Code Execution with MCP</a> from Anthropic</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents\">Smol Agents</a> from Hugging Face</li> \n</ul> \n<p>In very simple terms, the idea of all the above is that LLMs can work faster, cheaper and more reliably if they're asked to write Python (or Javascript) code, instead of relying on traditional tool calling. Monty makes that possible without the complexity of a sandbox or risk of running code directly on the host.</p> \n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Monty will (soon) be used to implement <code>codemode</code> in <a href=\"https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai\">Pydantic AI</a></p> \n<h2>Usage</h2> \n<p>Monty can be called from Python, JavaScript/TypeScript or Rust.</p> \n<h3>Python</h3> \n<p>To install:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">uv add pydantic-monty\n</code></pre> \n<p>(Or <code>pip install pydantic-monty</code> for the boomers)</p> \n<p>Usage:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">from typing import Any\n\nimport pydantic_monty\n\ncode = \"\"\"\nasync def agent(prompt: str, messages: Messages):\n    while True:\n        print(f'messages so far: {messages}')\n        output = await call_llm(prompt, messages)\n        if isinstance(output, str):\n            return output\n        messages.extend(output)\n\nawait agent(prompt, [])\n\"\"\"\n\ntype_definitions = \"\"\"\nfrom typing import Any\n\nMessages = list[dict[str, Any]]\n\nasync def call_llm(prompt: str, messages: Messages) -&gt; str | Messages:\n    raise NotImplementedError()\n\nprompt: str = ''\n\"\"\"\n\nm = pydantic_monty.Monty(\n    code,\n    inputs=['prompt'],\n    external_functions=['call_llm'],\n    script_name='agent.py',\n    type_check=True,\n    type_check_stubs=type_definitions,\n)\n\n\nMessages = list[dict[str, Any]]\n\n\nasync def call_llm(prompt: str, messages: Messages) -&gt; str | Messages:\n    if len(messages) &lt; 2:\n        return [{'role': 'system', 'content': 'example response'}]\n    else:\n        return f'example output, message count {len(messages)}'\n\n\nasync def main():\n    output = await pydantic_monty.run_monty_async(\n        m,\n        inputs={'prompt': 'testing'},\n        external_functions={'call_llm': call_llm},\n    )\n    print(output)\n    #&gt; example output, message count 2\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    import asyncio\n\n    asyncio.run(main())\n</code></pre> \n<h4>Iterative Execution with External Functions</h4> \n<p>Use <code>start()</code> and <code>resume()</code> to handle external function calls iteratively, giving you control over each call:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">import pydantic_monty\n\ncode = \"\"\"\ndata = fetch(url)\nlen(data)\n\"\"\"\n\nm = pydantic_monty.Monty(code, inputs=['url'], external_functions=['fetch'])\n\n# Start execution - pauses when fetch() is called\nresult = m.start(inputs={'url': 'https://example.com'})\n\nprint(type(result))\n#&gt; &lt;class 'pydantic_monty.MontySnapshot'&gt;\nprint(result.function_name)  # fetch\n#&gt; fetch\nprint(result.args)\n#&gt; ('https://example.com',)\n\n# Perform the actual fetch, then resume with the result\nresult = result.resume(return_value='hello world')\n\nprint(type(result))\n#&gt; &lt;class 'pydantic_monty.MontyComplete'&gt;\nprint(result.output)\n#&gt; 11\n</code></pre> \n<h4>Serialization</h4> \n<p>Both <code>Monty</code> and <code>MontySnapshot</code> can be serialized to bytes and restored later.

Oddly often these responses are combined, suggesting people have not yet found an alternative that works for them, but are incredulous that there's really no good alternative to creating an entire Python implementation from scratch.</p> \n<p>I'll try to run through the most obvious alternatives, and why there aren't right for what we wanted.</p> \n<p>NOTE: all these technologies are impressive and have widespread uses, this commentary on their limitations for our use case should not be seen as a criticism. Most of these solutions were not conceived with the goal of providing an LLM sandbox, which is why they're not necessary great at it.</p> \n<table> \n <thead> \n  <tr> \n   <th>Tech</th> \n   <th>Language completeness</th> \n   <th>Security</th> \n   <th>Start latency</th> \n   <th>FOSS</th> \n   <th>Setup complexity</th> \n   <th>File mounting</th> \n   <th>Snapshotting</th> \n  </tr> \n </thead> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td>Monty</td> \n   <td>partial</td> \n   <td>strict</td> \n   <td>0.06ms</td> \n   <td>free / OSS</td> \n   <td>easy</td> \n   <td>easy</td> \n   <td>easy</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td>Docker</td> \n   <td>full</td> \n   <td>good</td> \n   <td>195ms</td> \n   <td>free / OSS</td> \n   <td>intermediate</td> \n   <td>easy</td> \n   <td>intermediate</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td>Pyodide</td> \n   <td>full</td> \n   <td>poor</td> \n   <td>2800ms</td> \n   <td>free / OSS</td> \n   <td>intermediate</td> \n   <td>easy</td> \n   <td>hard</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td>starlark-rust</td> \n   <td>very limited</td> \n   <td>good</td> \n   <td>1.7ms</td> \n   <td>free / OSS</td> \n   <td>easy</td> \n   <td>not available?</td> \n   <td>impossible?</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td>WASI / Wasmer</td> \n   <td>partial, almost full</td> \n   <td>strict</td> \n   <td>66ms</td> \n   <td>free *</td> \n   <td>intermediate</td> \n   <td>easy</td> \n   <td>intermediate</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td>sandboxing service</td> \n   <td>full</td> \n   <td>strict</td> \n   <td>1033ms</td> \n   <td>not free</td> \n   <td>intermediate</td> \n   <td>hard</td> \n   <td>intermediate</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td>YOLO Python</td> \n   <td>full</td> \n   <td>non-existent</td> \n   <td>0.1ms / 30ms</td> \n   <td>free / OSS</td> \n   <td>easy</td> \n   <td>easy / scary</td> \n   <td>hard</td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p>See <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pydantic/monty/main/scripts/startup_performance.py\">./scripts/startup_performance.py</a> for the script used to calculate the startup performance numbers.</p> \n<p>Details on each row below:</p> \n<h3>Monty</h3> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Language completeness</strong>: No classes (yet), limited stdlib, no third-party libraries</li> \n <li><strong>Security</strong>: Explicitly controlled filesystem, network, and env access, strict limits on execution time and memory usage</li> \n <li><strong>Start latency</strong>: Starts in microseconds</li> \n <li><strong>Setup complexity</strong>: just <code>pip install pydantic-monty</code> or <code>npm install @pydantic/monty</code>, ~4.5MB download</li> \n <li><strong>File mounting</strong>: Strictly controlled, see <a href=\"https://github.com/pydantic/monty/pull/85\">#85</a></li> \n <li><strong>Snapshotting</strong>: Monty's pause and resume functionality with <code>dump()</code> and <code>load()</code> makes it trivial to pause, resume and fork execution</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Docker</h3> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Language completeness</strong>: Full CPython with any library</li> \n <li><strong>Security</strong>: Process and filesystem isolation, network policies, but container escapes exist, memory limitation is possible</li> \n <li><strong>Start latency</strong>: Container startup overhead (~195ms measured)</li> \n <li><strong>Setup complexity</strong>: Requires Docker daemon, container images, orchestration, <code>python:3.14-alpine</code> is 50MB - docker can't be installed from PyPI</li> \n <li><strong>File mounting</strong>: Volume mounts work well</li> \n <li><strong>Snapshotting</strong>: Possible with durable execution solutions like Temporal, or snapshotting an image and saving it as a Docker image.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Pyodide</h3> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Language completeness</strong>: Full CPython compiled to WASM, almost all libraries available</li> \n <li><strong>Security</strong>: Relies on browser/WASM sandbox - not designed for server-side isolation, python code can run arbitrary code in the JS runtime, only deno allows isolation, memory limits are hard/impossible to enforce with deno</li> \n <li><strong>Start latency</strong>: WASM runtime loading is slow (~2800ms cold start)</li> \n <li><strong>Setup complexity</strong>: Need to load WASM runtime, handle async initialization, pyodide NPM package is ~12MB, deno is ~50MB - Pyodide can't be called with just PyPI packages</li> \n <li><strong>File mounting</strong>: Virtual filesystem via browser APIs</li> \n <li><strong>Snapshotting</strong>: Possible with durable execution solutions like Temporal presumably, but hard</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>starlark-rust</h3> \n<p>See <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/starlark-rust\">starlark-rust</a>.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Language completeness</strong>: Configuration language, not Python - no classes, exceptions, async</li> \n <li><strong>Security</strong>: Deterministic and hermetic by design</li> \n <li><strong>Start latency</strong>: runs embedded in the process like Monty, hence impressive startup time</li> \n <li><strong>Setup complexity</strong>: Usable in python via <a href=\"https://github.com/inducer/starlark-pyo3\">starlark-pyo3</a></li> \n <li><strong>File mounting</strong>: No file handling by design AFAIK?</li> \n <li><strong>Snapshotting</strong>: Impossible AFAIK?</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>WASI / Wasmer</h3> \n<p>Running Python in WebAssembly via <a href=\"https://wasmer.io/\">Wasmer</a>.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Language completeness</strong>: Full CPython, pure Python external packages work via mounting, external packages with C bindings don't work</li> \n <li><strong>Security</strong>: In principle WebAssembly should provide strong sandboxing guarantees.</li> \n <li><strong>Start latency</strong>: The <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/wasmer/\">wasmer</a> python package hasn't been updated for 3 years and I couldn't find docs on calling Python in wasmer from Python, so I called it via subprocess. Start latency was 66ms.</li> \n <li><strong>Setup complexity</strong>: wasmer download is 100mb, the \"python/python\" package is 50mb.</li> \n <li><strong>FOSS</strong>: I marked this as \"free *\" since the cost is zero but not everything seems to be open source. As of 2026-02-10 the <a href=\"https://wasmer.io/python/python\"><code>python/python</code> wasmer package</a> package has no readme, no license, no source link and no indication of how it's built, the recently uploaded versions show size as \"0B\" although the download is ~50MB - the build process for the Python binary is not clear and transparent. <em>(If I'm wrong here, please create an issue to correct correct me)</em></li> \n <li><strong>File mounting</strong>: Supported</li> \n <li><strong>Snapshotting</strong>: Supported via journaling</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>sandboxing service</h3> \n<p>Services like <a href=\"https://daytona.io\">Daytona</a>, <a href=\"https://e2b.dev\">E2B</a>, <a href=\"https://modal.com\">Modal</a>.</p> \n<p>There are similar challenges, more setup complexity but lower network latency for setting up your own sandbox setup with k8s.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Language completeness</strong>: Full CPython with any library</li> \n <li><strong>Security</strong>: Professionally managed container isolation</li> \n <li><strong>Start latency</strong>: Network round-trip and container startup time. I got ~1s cold start time with Daytona EU from London, Daytona advertise sub 90ms latency, presumably that's for an existing container, not clear if it includes network latency</li> \n <li><strong>FOSS</strong>: Pay per execution or compute time, some implementations are open source</li> \n <li><strong>Setup complexity</strong>: API integration, auth tokens - fine for startups but generally a non-start for enterprises</li> \n <li><strong>File mounting</strong>: Upload/download via API calls</li> \n <li><strong>Snapshotting</strong>: Possible with durable execution solutions like Temporal, also the services offer some solutions for this, I think based con docker containers</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>YOLO Python</h3> \n<p>Running Python directly via <code>exec()</code> (~0.1ms) or subprocess (~30ms).</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Language completeness</strong>: Full CPython with any library</li> \n <li><strong>Security</strong>: None - full filesystem, network, env vars, system commands</li> \n <li><strong>Start latency</strong>: Near-zero for <code>exec()</code>, ~30ms for subprocess</li> \n <li><strong>Setup complexity</strong>: None</li> \n <li><strong>File mounting</strong>: Direct filesystem access (that's the problem)</li> \n <li><strong>Snapshotting</strong>: Possible with durable execution solutions like Temporal</li> \n</ul>",

It runs on MacOS, Linux, and Windows.</p> \n<p>Modern development involves constantly switching between terminals and browsers - checking documentation, previewing files, monitoring systems, and using AI tools. Wave brings these graphical tools directly into the terminal, letting you control them from the command line. This means you can stay in your terminal workflow while still having access to the visual interfaces you need.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wavetermdev/waveterm/main/assets/wave-screenshot.webp\" alt=\"WaveTerm Screenshot\" /></p> \n<h2>Key Features</h2> \n<ul> \n <li>Flexible drag &amp; drop interface to organize terminal blocks, editors, web browsers, and AI assistants</li> \n <li>Built-in editor for seamlessly editing remote files with syntax highlighting and modern editor features</li> \n <li>Rich file preview system for remote files (markdown, images, video, PDFs, CSVs, directories)</li> \n <li>Quick full-screen toggle for any block - expand terminals, editors, and previews for better visibility, then instantly return to multi-block view</li> \n <li>Wave AI - Context-aware terminal assistant that reads your terminal output, analyzes widgets, and performs file operations</li> \n <li>AI chat widget with support for multiple models (OpenAI, Claude, Azure, Perplexity, Ollama)</li> \n <li>Command Blocks for isolating and monitoring individual commands with auto-close options</li> \n <li>One-click remote connections with full terminal and file system access</li> \n <li>Secure secret storage using native system backends - store API keys and credentials locally, access them across SSH sessions</li> \n <li>Rich customization including tab themes, terminal styles, and background images</li> \n <li>Powerful <code>wsh</code> command system for managing your workspace from the CLI and sharing data between terminal sessions</li> \n <li>Connected file management with <code>wsh file</code> - seamlessly copy and sync files between local, remote SSH hosts, Wave filesystem, and S3</li> \n</ul> \n<h2>Wave AI</h2> \n<p>Wave AI is your context-aware terminal assistant with access to your workspace:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Terminal Context</strong>: Reads terminal output and scrollback for debugging and analysis</li> \n <li><strong>File Operations</strong>: Read, write, and edit files with automatic backups and user approval</li> \n <li><strong>CLI Integration</strong>: Use <code>wsh ai</code> to pipe output or attach files directly from the command line</li> \n <li><strong>Free Beta</strong>: Included AI credits while we refine the experience</li> \n <li><strong>Coming Soon</strong>: Command execution (with approval), local model support, and alternate AI providers (BYOK)</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Learn more in our <a href=\"https://docs.waveterm.dev/waveai\">Wave AI documentation</a>.</p> \n<h2>Installation</h2> \n<p>Wave Terminal works on macOS, Linux, and Windows.</p> \n<p>Platform-specific installation instructions can be found <a href=\"https://docs.waveterm.dev/gettingstarted\">here</a>.</p> \n<p>You can also install Wave Terminal directly from: <a href=\"https://www.waveterm.dev/download\">www.waveterm.dev/download</a>.</p> \n<h3>Minimum requirements</h3> \n<p>Wave Terminal runs on the following platforms:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>macOS 11 or later (arm64, x64)</li> \n <li>Windows 10 1809 or later (x64)</li> \n <li>Linux based on glibc-2.28 or later (Debian 10, RHEL 8, Ubuntu 20.04, etc.) (arm64, x64)</li> \n</ul> \n<p>The WSH helper runs on the following platforms:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>macOS 11 or later (arm64, x64)</li> \n <li>Windows 10 or later (arm64, x64)</li> \n <li>Linux Kernel 2.6.32 or later (x64), Linux Kernel 3.1 or later (arm64)</li> \n</ul> \n<h2>Roadmap</h2> \n<p>Wave is constantly improving!

The models can now take image, video, text, and audio as inputs and provide high-quality text and speech outputs in an end-to-end fashion. The model series is designed for <strong>strong performance and efficient deployment</strong>. The most notable models in the series currently include:</p> \n<ul> \n <li> <p><strong>MiniCPM-o 4.5</strong>: 🔥🔥🔥 The latest and most capable model in the series. With a total of 9B parameters, this end-to-end model <strong>approaches Gemini 2.5 Flash in vision, speech, and full-duplex multimodal live streaming</strong>, making it one of the most versatile and performant models in the open-source community. The new full-duplex multimodal live streaming capability means that the output streams (speech and text), and the real-time input streams (video and audio) do not block each other. This <strong>enables MiniCPM-o 4.5 to see, listen, and speak simultaneously</strong> in a real-time omnimodal conversation, and perform <strong>proactive interactions</strong> such as proactive reminding. The improved voice mode supports bilingual real-time speech conversation in a more natural, expressive, and stable way, and also allows for voice cloning. It also advances MiniCPM-V's visual capabilities such as strong OCR capability, trustworthy behavior and multilingual support, etc. We also rollout a <strong>high-performing llama.cpp-omni inference framework together with a WebRTC Demo</strong>, to bring this full-duplex multimodal live streaming experience <a href=\"https://github.com/OpenSQZ/MiniCPM-V-CookBook/raw/main/demo/web_demo/WebRTC_Demo/README.md\">available on local devices such as Macs</a>.</p> </li> \n <li> <p><strong>MiniCPM-V 4.0</strong>: ⭐️⭐️⭐️ An efficient model in the MiniCPM-V series. With a total of 4B parameters, the model surpasses GPT-4.1-mini-20250414 in image understanding on the OpenCompass evaluation. With its small parameter-size and efficient architecure, MiniCPM-V 4.0 is an ideal choice for on-device deployment on the phone.</p> </li> \n</ul> \n<h2>News \n <!-- omit in toc --></h2> \n<h4>📌 Pinned</h4> \n<blockquote> \n <p>[!NOTE] [2026.02.06] 🥳 🥳 🥳 MiniCPM-o 4.5 Local &amp; Ready-to-Run!

The model is built in an end-to-end fashion based on SigLip2, Whisper-medium, CosyVoice2, and Qwen3-8B with a total of 9B parameters. It exhibits a significant performance improvement, and introduces new features for full-duplex multimodal live streaming. Notable features of MiniCPM-o 4.5 include:</p> \n<ul> \n <li> <p>🔥 <strong>Leading Visual Capability.</strong> MiniCPM-o 4.5 achieves an average score of 77.6 on OpenCompass, a comprehensive evaluation of 8 popular benchmarks. <strong>With only 9B parameters, it surpasses widely used proprietary models like GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Pro, and approaches Gemini 2.5 Flash</strong> for vision-language capabilities. It supports instruct and thinking modes in a single model, better covering efficiency and performance trade-offs in different user scenarios.</p> </li> \n <li> <p>🎙 <strong>Strong Speech Capability.</strong> MiniCPM-o 4.5 supports <strong>bilingual real-time speech conversation with configurable voices</strong> in English and Chinese. It features <strong>more natural, expressive and stable speech conversation</strong>. The model also allows for fun features such as <strong>voice cloning and role play via a simple reference audio clip</strong>, where the cloning performance surpasses strong TTS tools such as CosyVoice2.</p> </li> \n <li> <p>🎬 <strong>New Full-Duplex and Proactive Multimodal Live Streaming Capability.</strong> As a new feature, MiniCPM-o 4.5 can process real-time, continuous video and audio input streams simultaneously while generating concurrent text and speech output streams in an end-to-end fashion, without mutual blocking. This <strong>allows MiniCPM-o 4.5 to see, listen, and speak simultaneously</strong>, creating a fluid, real-time omnimodal conversation experience. Beyond reactive responses, the model can also perform <strong>proactive interaction</strong>, such as initiating reminders or comments based on its continuous understanding of the live scene.</p> </li> \n <li> <p>💪 <strong>Strong OCR Capability, Efficiency and Others.</strong> Advancing popular visual capabilities from MiniCPM-V series, MiniCPM-o 4.5 can process <strong>high-resolution images</strong> (up to 1.8 million pixels) and <strong>high-FPS videos</strong> (up to 10fps) in any aspect ratio efficiently. It achieves <strong>state-of-the-art peformance for end-to-end English document parsing</strong> on OmniDocBench, outperforming proprietary models such as Gemini-3 Flash and GPT-5, and specialized tools such as DeepSeek-OCR 2. It also features <strong>trustworthy behaviors</strong>, matching Gemini 2.5 Flash on MMHal-Bench, and supports <strong>multilingual capabilities</strong> on more than 30 languages.</p> </li> \n <li> <p>💫 <strong>Easy Usage.</strong> MiniCPM-o 4.5 can be easily used in various ways: (1) <a href=\"https://github.com/OpenSQZ/MiniCPM-V-CookBook/raw/main/deployment/llama.cpp/minicpm-o4_5_llamacpp.md\">llama.cpp</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/OpenSQZ/MiniCPM-V-CookBook/raw/main/deployment/ollama/minicpm-o4_5_ollama.md\">Ollama</a> support for efficient CPU inference on local devices, (2) <a href=\"https://github.com/OpenSQZ/MiniCPM-V-CookBook/raw/main/quantization/awq/minicpm-o4_5_awq_quantize.md\">int4</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/OpenSQZ/MiniCPM-V-CookBook/raw/main/quantization/gguf/minicpm-o4_5_gguf_quantize.md\">GGUF</a> format quantized models in 16 sizes, (3) <a href=\"https://github.com/OpenSQZ/MiniCPM-V-CookBook/raw/main/deployment/vllm/minicpm-o4_5_vllm.md\">vLLM</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/OpenSQZ/MiniCPM-V-CookBook/raw/main/deployment/sglang/MiniCPM-o4_5_sglang.md\">SGLang</a> support for high-throughput and memory-efficient inference, (4) <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenBMB/MiniCPM-o/main/#flagos\">FlagOS</a> support for the unified multi-chip backend plugin, (5) fine-tuning on new domains and tasks with <a href=\"https://github.com/OpenSQZ/MiniCPM-V-CookBook/raw/main/finetune/llama-factory/finetune_llamafactory.md\">LLaMA-Factory</a>, and (6) online web demo on <a href=\"https://github.com/OpenSQZ/MiniCPM-V-CookBook/raw/main/demo/web_demo/gradio/README_o45.md\">server</a>. We also rollout a high-performing <a href=\"https://github.com/tc-mb/llama.cpp-omni\">llama.cpp-omni</a> inference framework together with a <a href=\"https://minicpm-omni.openbmb.cn/\">WebRTC Demo</a>, which <strong>enables the full-duplex multimodal live streaming experience on local devices</strong> such as <a href=\"https://github.com/tc-mb/llama.cpp-omni/raw/master/README.md\">PCs</a> (e.g., on a MacBook).</p> </li> \n</ul> \n<p><strong>Model Architecture.</strong></p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>End-to-end Omni-modal Architecture.</strong> The modality encoders/decoders and LLM are densely connected via hidden states in an end-to-end fashion. This enables better information flow and control, and also facilitates full exploitation of rich multimodal knowledge during training.</li> \n <li><strong>Full-Duplex Omni-modal Live Streaming Mechanism.</strong> (1) We turn the offline modality encoder/decoders into online and full-duplex ones for streaming inputs/outputs. The speech token decoder models text and speech tokens in an interleaved fashion to support full-duplex speech generation (i.e., sync timely with new input). This also facilitates more stable long speech generation (e.g., &gt; 1min). (2) <strong>We sync all the input and output streams on timeline in milliseconds</strong>, which are jointly modeled by a time-division multiplexing (TDM) mechanism for omni-modality streaming processing in the LLM backbone. It divides parallel omni-modality streams into sequential info groups within small periodic time slices.</li> \n <li><strong>Proactive Interaction Mechanism.</strong> The LLM continuously monitors the input video and audio streams, and decides at a frequency of 1Hz to speak or not. This high decision-making frequency together with full-duplex nature are curcial to enable the proactive interaction capability.</li> \n <li><strong>Configurable Speech Modeling Design.</strong> We inherent the multimodal system prompt design of MiniCPM-o 2.6, which includes a traditional text system prompt, and a new audio system prompt to determine the assistant voice. This enables cloning new voices and role play in inference time for speech conversation.</li> \n</ul> \n<div align=\"center\"> \n <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenBMB/MiniCPM-o/main/assets/minicpm-o-45-framework.png\" , width=\"100%\" /> \n</div> \n<h3>Evaluation \n <!-- omit in toc --></h3> \n<div align=\"center\"> \n <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenBMB/MiniCPM-o/main/assets/radar_minicpmo4.5.png\" , width=\"80%\" /> \n</div> \n<div align=\"center\"> \n <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenBMB/MiniCPM-o/main/assets/minicpm_o_45_main_exp_table.png\" , width=\"90%\" /> \n</div> \n<strong>Note</strong>: Scores marked with ∗ are from our evaluation; others are cited from referenced reports. n/a indicates that the model does not support the corresponding modality.

The model is built based on SigLIP2-400M and MiniCPM4-3B with a total of 4.1B parameters. It inherits the strong single-image, multi-image and video understanding performance of MiniCPM-V 2.6 with largely improved efficiency. Notable features of MiniCPM-V 4.0 include:</p> \n<ul> \n <li> <p>🔥 <strong>Leading Visual Capability.</strong> With only 4.1B parameters, MiniCPM-V 4.0 achieves an average score of 69.0 on OpenCompass, a comprehensive evaluation of 8 popular benchmarks, <strong>outperforming GPT-4.1-mini-20250414, MiniCPM-V 2.6 (8.1B params, OpenCompass 65.2) and Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct (3.8B params, OpenCompass 64.5)</strong>. It also shows good performance in multi-image understanding and video understanding.</p> </li> \n <li> <p>🚀 <strong>Superior Efficiency.</strong> Designed for on-device deployment, MiniCPM-V 4.0 runs smoothly on end devices. For example, it devlivers <strong>less than 2s first token delay and more than 17 token/s decoding on iPhone 16 Pro Max</strong>, without heating problems. It also shows superior throughput under concurrent requests.</p> </li> \n <li> <p>💫 <strong>Easy Usage.</strong> MiniCPM-V 4.0 can be easily used in various ways including <strong>llama.cpp, Ollama, vLLM, SGLang, LLaMA-Factory and local web demo</strong> etc. We also open-source iOS App that can run on iPhone and iPad.

It autonomously hunts for attack vectors in your code, then uses its built-in browser to execute real exploits, such as injection attacks, and auth bypass, to prove the vulnerability is actually exploitable.</p> \n<p><strong>What Problem Does Shannon Solve?</strong></p> \n<p>Thanks to tools like Claude Code and Cursor, your team ships code non-stop. But your penetration test? That happens once a year. This creates a <em>massive</em> security gap. For the other 364 days, you could be unknowingly shipping vulnerabilities to production.</p> \n<p>Shannon closes this gap by acting as your on-demand whitebox pentester.

It leverages Anthropic's Claude Agent SDK as its core reasoning engine, but its true strength lies in the sophisticated multi-agent architecture built around it. This architecture combines the deep context of <strong>white-box source code analysis</strong> with the real-world validation of <strong>black-box dynamic exploitation</strong>, managed by an orchestrator through four distinct phases to ensure a focus on minimal false positives and intelligent context management.</p> \n<hr /> \n<h4><strong>Phase 1: Reconnaissance</strong></h4> \n<p>The first phase builds a comprehensive map of the application's attack surface. Shannon analyzes the source code and integrates with tools like Nmap and Subfinder to understand the tech stack and infrastructure. Simultaneously, it performs live application exploration via browser automation to correlate code-level insights with real-world behavior, producing a detailed map of all entry points, API endpoints, and authentication mechanisms for the next phase.</p> \n<h4><strong>Phase 2: Vulnerability Analysis</strong></h4> \n<p>To maximize efficiency, this phase operates in parallel. Using the reconnaissance data, specialized agents for each OWASP category hunt for potential flaws in parallel. For vulnerabilities like Injection and SSRF, agents perform a structured data flow analysis, tracing user input to dangerous sinks. This phase produces a key deliverable: a list of <strong>hypothesized exploitable paths</strong> that are passed on for validation.</p> \n<h4><strong>Phase 3: Exploitation</strong></h4> \n<p>Continuing the parallel workflow to maintain speed, this phase is dedicated entirely to turning hypotheses into proof. Dedicated exploit agents receive the hypothesized paths and attempt to execute real-world attacks using browser automation, command-line tools, and custom scripts. This phase enforces a strict <strong>\"No Exploit, No Report\"</strong> policy: if a hypothesis cannot be successfully exploited to demonstrate impact, it is discarded as a false positive.</p> \n<h4><strong>Phase 4: Reporting</strong></h4> \n<p>The final phase compiles all validated findings into a professional, actionable report. An agent consolidates the reconnaissance data and the successful exploit evidence, cleaning up any noise or hallucinated artifacts. Only verified vulnerabilities are included, complete with <strong>reproducible, copy-and-paste Proof-of-Concepts</strong>, delivering a final pentest-grade report focused exclusively on proven risks.</p> \n<h2>📋 Coverage and Roadmap</h2> \n<p>For detailed information about Shannon's security testing coverage and development roadmap, see our <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KeygraphHQ/shannon/main/COVERAGE.md\">Coverage and Roadmap</a> documentation.</p> \n<h2>⚠️ Disclaimers</h2> \n<h3>Important Usage Guidelines &amp; Disclaimers</h3> \n<p>Please review the following guidelines carefully before using Shannon (Lite). As a user, you are responsible for your actions and assume all liability.</p> \n<h4><strong>1. Potential for Mutative Effects &amp; Environment Selection</strong></h4> \n<p>This is not a passive scanner. The exploitation agents are designed to <strong>actively execute attacks</strong> to confirm vulnerabilities. This process can have mutative effects on the target application and its data.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>[!WARNING] <strong>⚠️ DO NOT run Shannon on production environments.</strong></p> \n <ul> \n  <li>It is intended exclusively for use on sandboxed, staging, or local development environments where data integrity is not a concern.</li> \n  <li>Potential mutative effects include, but are not limited to: creating new users, modifying or deleting data, compromising test accounts, and triggering unintended side effects from injection attacks.</li> \n </ul> \n</blockquote> \n<h4><strong>2. Legal &amp; Ethical Use</strong></h4> \n<p>Shannon is designed for legitimate security auditing purposes only.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>[!CAUTION] <strong>You must have explicit, written authorization</strong> from the owner of the target system before running Shannon.</p> \n <p>Unauthorized scanning and exploitation of systems you do not own is illegal and can be prosecuted under laws such as the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA). Keygraph is not responsible for any misuse of Shannon.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<h4><strong>3. LLM &amp; Automation Caveats</strong></h4> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Verification is Required</strong>: While significant engineering has gone into our \"proof-by-exploitation\" methodology to eliminate false positives, the underlying LLMs can still generate hallucinated or weakly-supported content in the final report. <strong>Human oversight is essential</strong> to validate the legitimacy and severity of all reported findings.</li> \n <li><strong>Comprehensiveness</strong>: The analysis in Shannon Lite may not be exhaustive due to the inherent limitations of LLM context windows. For a more comprehensive, graph-based analysis of your entire codebase, <strong>Shannon Pro</strong> leverages its advanced data flow analysis engine to ensure deeper and more thorough coverage.</li> \n</ul> \n<h4><strong>4. Scope of Analysis</strong></h4> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Targeted Vulnerabilities</strong>: The current version of Shannon Lite specifically targets the following classes of <em>exploitable</em> vulnerabilities: \n  <ul> \n   <li>Broken Authentication &amp; Authorization</li> \n   <li>Injection</li> \n   <li>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</li> \n   <li>Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)</li> \n  </ul> </li> \n <li><strong>What Shannon Lite Does Not Cover</strong>: This list is not exhaustive of all potential security risks. Shannon Lite's \"proof-by-exploitation\" model means it will not report on issues it cannot actively exploit, such as vulnerable third-party libraries or insecure configurations. These types of deep static-analysis findings are a core focus of the advanced analysis engine in <strong>Shannon Pro</strong>.</li> \n</ul> \n<h4><strong>5. Cost &amp; Performance</strong></h4> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Time</strong>: As of the current version, a full test run typically takes <strong>1 to 1.5 hours</strong> to complete.</li> \n <li><strong>Cost</strong>: Running the full test using Anthropic's Claude 4.5 Sonnet model may incur costs of approximately <strong>$50 USD</strong>. Costs vary based on model pricing and application complexity.</li> \n</ul> \n<h4><strong>6. Windows Antivirus False Positives</strong></h4> \n<p>Windows Defender may flag files in <code>xben-benchmark-results/</code> or <code>deliverables/</code> as malware. These are false positives caused by exploit code in the reports.

It combines an advanced implementation of directional ablation, also known as \"abliteration\" (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11717\">Arditi et al. 2024</a>, Lai 2025 (<a href=\"https://huggingface.co/blog/grimjim/projected-abliteration\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/blog/grimjim/norm-preserving-biprojected-abliteration\">2</a>)), with a TPE-based parameter optimizer powered by <a href=\"https://optuna.org/\">Optuna</a>.</p> \n<p>This approach enables Heretic to work <strong>completely automatically.</strong> Heretic finds high-quality abliteration parameters by co-minimizing the number of refusals and the KL divergence from the original model. This results in a decensored model that retains as much of the original model's intelligence as possible. Using Heretic does not require an understanding of transformer internals. In fact, anyone who knows how to run a command-line program can use Heretic to decensor language models.</p> \n<img width=\"650\" height=\"715\" alt=\"Screenshot\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d71a5efa-d6be-4705-a817-63332afb2d15\" /> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Running unsupervised with the default configuration, Heretic can produce decensored models that rival the quality of abliterations created manually by human experts:</p> \n<table> \n <thead> \n  <tr> \n   <th align=\"left\">Model</th> \n   <th align=\"right\">Refusals for \"harmful\" prompts</th> \n   <th align=\"right\">KL divergence from original model for \"harmless\" prompts</th> \n  </tr> \n </thead> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td align=\"left\"><a href=\"https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-3-12b-it\">google/gemma-3-12b-it</a> (original)</td> \n   <td align=\"right\">97/100</td> \n   <td align=\"right\">0 <em>(by definition)</em></td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td align=\"left\"><a href=\"https://huggingface.co/mlabonne/gemma-3-12b-it-abliterated-v2\">mlabonne/gemma-3-12b-it-abliterated-v2</a></td> \n   <td align=\"right\">3/100</td> \n   <td align=\"right\">1.04</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td align=\"left\"><a href=\"https://huggingface.co/huihui-ai/gemma-3-12b-it-abliterated\">huihui-ai/gemma-3-12b-it-abliterated</a></td> \n   <td align=\"right\">3/100</td> \n   <td align=\"right\">0.45</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td align=\"left\"><strong><a href=\"https://huggingface.co/p-e-w/gemma-3-12b-it-heretic\">p-e-w/gemma-3-12b-it-heretic</a> (ours)</strong></td> \n   <td align=\"right\"><strong>3/100</strong></td> \n   <td align=\"right\"><strong>0.16</strong></td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p>The Heretic version, generated without any human effort, achieves the same level of refusal suppression as other abliterations, but at a much lower KL divergence, indicating less damage to the original model's capabilities. <em>(You can reproduce those numbers using Heretic's built-in evaluation functionality, e.g. <code>heretic --model google/gemma-3-12b-it --evaluate-model p-e-w/gemma-3-12b-it-heretic</code>. Note that the exact values might be platform- and hardware-dependent. The table above was compiled using PyTorch 2.8 on an RTX 5090.)</em></p> \n<p>Of course, mathematical metrics and automated benchmarks never tell the whole story, and are no substitute for human evaluation. Models generated with Heretic have been well-received by users (links and emphasis added):</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>\"I was skeptical before, but I just downloaded <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/p-e-w/gpt-oss-20b-heretic\"><strong>GPT-OSS 20B Heretic</strong></a> model and holy shit.

It does not yet support SSMs/hybrid models, models with inhomogeneous layers, and certain novel attention systems.</p> \n<p>You can find a small collection of models that have been decensored using Heretic <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/collections/p-e-w/the-bestiary\">on Hugging Face</a>, and the community has created and published <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/models?other=heretic\">well over 1,000</a> Heretic models in addition to those.</p> \n<h2>Usage</h2> \n<p>Prepare a Python 3.10+ environment with PyTorch 2.2+ installed as appropriate for your hardware. Then run:</p> \n<pre><code>pip install -U heretic-llm\nheretic Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507\n</code></pre> \n<p>Replace <code>Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507</code> with whatever model you want to decensor.</p> \n<p>The process is fully automatic and does not require configuration; however, Heretic has a variety of configuration parameters that can be changed for greater control. Run <code>heretic --help</code> to see available command-line options, or look at <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/p-e-w/heretic/master/config.default.toml\"><code>config.default.toml</code></a> if you prefer to use a configuration file.</p> \n<p>At the start of a program run, Heretic benchmarks the system to determine the optimal batch size to make the most of the available hardware. On an RTX 3090, with the default configuration, decensoring Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct takes about 45 minutes. Note that Heretic supports model quantization with bitsandbytes, which can drastically reduce the amount of VRAM required to process models. Set the <code>quantization</code> option to <code>bnb_4bit</code> to enable quantization.</p> \n<p>After Heretic has finished decensoring a model, you are given the option to save the model, upload it to Hugging Face, chat with it to test how well it works, or any combination of those actions.</p> \n<h2>Research features</h2> \n<p>In addition to its primary function of removing model censorship, Heretic also provides features designed to support research into the semantics of model internals (interpretability). To use those features, you need to install Heretic with the optional <code>research</code> extra:</p> \n<pre><code>pip install -U heretic-llm[research]\n</code></pre> \n<p>This gives you access to the following functionality:</p> \n<h3>Generate plots of residual vectors by passing <code>--plot-residuals</code></h3> \n<p>When run with this flag, Heretic will:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>Compute residual vectors (hidden states) for the first output token, for each transformer layer, for both \"harmful\" and \"harmless\" prompts.</li> \n <li>Perform a <a href=\"https://github.com/YingfanWang/PaCMAP\">PaCMAP projection</a> from residual space to 2D-space.</li> \n <li>Left-right align the projections of \"harmful\"/\"harmless\" residuals by their geometric medians to make projections for consecutive layers more similar. Additionally, PaCMAP is initialized with the previous layer's projections for each new layer, minimizing disruptive transitions.</li> \n <li>Scatter-plot the projections, generating a PNG image for each layer.</li> \n <li>Generate an animation showing how residuals transform between layers, as an animated GIF.</li> \n</ol> \n<img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" alt=\"Plot of residual vectors\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/981aa6ed-5ab9-48f0-9abf-2b1a2c430295\" /> \n<p>See <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/p-e-w/heretic/master/config.default.toml\">the configuration file</a> for options that allow you to control various aspects of the generated plots.</p> \n<p>Note that PaCMAP is an expensive operation that is performed on the CPU. For larger models, it can take an hour or more to compute projections for all layers.</p> \n<h3>Print details about residual geometry by passing <code>--print-residual-geometry</code></h3> \n<p>If you are interested in a quantitative analysis of how residual vectors for \"harmful\" and \"harmless\" prompts relate to each other, this flag gives you the following table, packed with metrics that can facilitate understanding the same (for <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-3-270m-it\">gemma-3-270m-it</a> in this case):</p> \n<pre><code>┏━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━┓\n┃ Layer ┃ S(g,b) ┃ S(g*,b*) ┃  S(g,r) ┃ S(g*,r*) ┃  S(b,r) ┃ S(b*,r*) ┃      |g| ┃     |g*| ┃      |b| ┃     |b*| ┃     |r| ┃    |r*| ┃   Silh ┃\n┡━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━┩\n│     1 │ 1.0000 │   1.0000 │ -0.4311 │  -0.4906 │ -0.4254 │  -0.4847 │   170.29 │   170.49 │   169.78 │   169.85 │    1.19 │    1.31 │ 0.0480 │\n│     2 │ 1.0000 │   1.0000 │  0.4297 │   0.4465 │  0.4365 │   0.4524 │   768.55 │   768.77 │   771.32 │   771.36 │    6.39 │    5.76 │ 0.0745 │\n│     3 │ 0.9999 │   1.0000 │ -0.5699 │  -0.5577 │ -0.5614 │  -0.5498 │  1020.98 │  1021.13 │  1013.80 │  1014.71 │   12.70 │   11.60 │ 0.0920 │\n│     4 │ 0.9999 │   1.0000 │  0.6582 │   0.6553 │  0.6659 │   0.6627 │  1356.39 │  1356.20 │  1368.71 │  1367.95 │   18.62 │   17.84 │ 0.0957 │\n│     5 │ 0.9987 │   0.9990 │ -0.6880 │  -0.6761 │ -0.6497 │  -0.6418 │   766.54 │   762.25 │   731.75 │   732.42 │   51.97 │   45.24 │ 0.1018 │\n│     6 │ 0.9998 │   0.9998 │ -0.1983 │  -0.2312 │ -0.1811 │  -0.2141 │  2417.35 │  2421.08 │  2409.18 │  2411.40 │   43.06 │   43.47 │ 0.0900 │\n│     7 │ 0.9998 │   0.9997 │ -0.5258 │  -0.5746 │ -0.5072 │  -0.5560 │  3444.92 │  3474.99 │  3400.01 │  3421.63 │   86.94 │   94.38 │ 0.0492 │\n│     8 │ 0.9990 │   0.9991 │  0.8235 │   0.8312 │  0.8479 │   0.8542 │  4596.54 │  4615.62 │  4918.32 │  4934.20 │  384.87 │  377.87 │ 0.2278 │\n│     9 │ 0.9992 │   0.9992 │  0.5335 │   0.5441 │  0.5678 │   0.5780 │  5322.30 │  5316.96 │  5468.65 │  5466.98 │  265.68 │  267.28 │ 0.1318 │\n│    10 │ 0.9974 │   0.9973 │  0.8189 │   0.8250 │  0.8579 │   0.8644 │  5328.81 │  5325.63 │  5953.35 │  5985.15 │  743.95 │  779.74 │ 0.2863 │\n│    11 │ 0.9977 │   0.9978 │  0.4262 │   0.4045 │  0.4862 │   0.4645 │  9644.02 │  9674.06 │  9983.47 │  9990.28 │  743.28 │  726.99 │ 0.1576 │\n│    12 │ 0.9904 │   0.9907 │  0.4384 │   0.4077 │  0.5586 │   0.5283 │ 10257.40 │ 10368.50 │ 11114.51 │ 11151.21 │ 1711.18 │ 1664.69 │ 0.1890 │\n│    13 │ 0.9867 │   0.9874 │  0.4007 │   0.3680 │  0.5444 │   0.5103 │ 12305.12 │ 12423.75 │ 13440.31 │ 13432.47 │ 2386.43 │ 2282.47 │ 0.1293 │\n│    14 │ 0.9921 │   0.9922 │  0.3198 │   0.2682 │  0.4364 │   0.3859 │ 16929.16 │ 17080.37 │ 17826.97 │ 17836.03 │ 2365.23 │ 2301.87 │ 0.1282 │\n│    15 │ 0.9846 │   0.9850 │  0.1198 │   0.0963 │  0.2913 │   0.2663 │ 16858.58 │ 16949.44 │ 17496.00 │ 17502.88 │ 3077.08 │ 3029.60 │ 0.1611 │\n│    16 │ 0.9686 │   0.9689 │ -0.0029 │  -0.0254 │  0.2457 │   0.2226 │ 18912.77 │ 19074.86 │ 19510.56 │ 19559.62 │ 4848.35 │ 4839.75 │ 0.1516 │\n│    17 │ 0.9782 │   0.9784 │ -0.0174 │  -0.0381 │  0.1908 │   0.1694 │ 27098.09 │ 27273.00 │ 27601.12 │ 27653.12 │ 5738.19 │ 5724.21 │ 0.1641 │\n│    18 │ 0.9184 │   0.9196 │  0.1343 │   0.1430 │  0.5155 │   0.5204 │   190.16 │   190.35 │   219.91 │   220.62 │   87.82 │   87.59 │ 0.1855 │\n└───────┴────────┴──────────┴─────────┴──────────┴─────────┴──────────┴──────────┴──────────┴──────────┴──────────┴─────────┴─────────┴────────┘\ng = mean of residual vectors for good prompts\ng* = geometric median of residual vectors for good prompts\nb = mean of residual vectors for bad prompts\nb* = geometric median of residual vectors for bad prompts\nr = refusal direction for means (i.e., b - g)\nr* = refusal direction for geometric medians (i.e., b* - g*)\nS(x,y) = cosine similarity of x and y\n|x| = L2 norm of x\nSilh = Mean silhouette coefficient of residuals for good/bad clusters\n</code></pre> \n<h2>How Heretic works</h2> \n<p>Heretic implements a parametrized variant of directional ablation. For each supported transformer component (currently, attention out-projection and MLP down-projection), it identifies the associated matrices in each transformer layer, and orthogonalizes them with respect to the relevant \"refusal direction\", inhibiting the expression of that direction in the result of multiplications with that matrix.</p> \n<p>Refusal directions are computed for each layer as a difference-of-means between the first-token residuals for \"harmful\" and \"harmless\" example prompts.</p> \n<p>The ablation process is controlled by several optimizable parameters:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><code>direction_index</code>: Either the index of a refusal direction, or the special value <code>per layer</code>, indicating that each layer should be ablated using the refusal direction associated with that layer.</li> \n <li><code>max_weight</code>, <code>max_weight_position</code>, <code>min_weight</code>, and <code>min_weight_distance</code>: For each component, these parameters describe the shape and position of the ablation weight kernel over the layers. The following diagram illustrates this:</li> \n</ul> \n<img width=\"800\" height=\"500\" alt=\"Explanation\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82e4b84e-5a82-4faf-b918-ac642f9e4892\" /> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Heretic's main innovations over existing abliteration systems are:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>The shape of the ablation weight kernel is highly flexible, which, combined with automatic parameter optimization, can improve the compliance/quality tradeoff. Non-constant ablation weights were previously explored by Maxime Labonne in <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/mlabonne/gemma-3-12b-it-abliterated-v2\">gemma-3-12b-it-abliterated-v2</a>.</li> \n <li>The refusal direction index is a float rather than an integer. For non-integral values, the two nearest refusal direction vectors are linearly interpolated. This unlocks a vast space of additional directions beyond the ones identified by the difference-of-means computation, and often enables the optimization process to find a better direction than that belonging to any individual layer.</li> \n <li>Ablation parameters are chosen separately for each component. I have found that MLP interventions tend to be more damaging to the model than attention interventions, so using different ablation weights can squeeze out some extra performance.</li> \n</ul> \n<h2>Prior art</h2> \n<p>I'm aware of the following publicly available implementations of abliteration techniques:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://huggingface.co/posts/mlabonne/714992455492422\">AutoAbliteration</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://github.com/FailSpy/abliterator\">abliterator.py</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://github.com/wassname/abliterator\">wassname's Abliterator</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://github.com/Tsadoq/ErisForge\">ErisForge</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://github.com/Sumandora/remove-refusals-with-transformers\">Removing refusals with HF Transformers</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://github.com/AUGMXNT/deccp\">deccp</a></li> \n</ul> \n<p>Note that Heretic was written from scratch, and does not reuse code from any of those projects.</p> \n<h2>Acknowledgments</h2> \n<p>The development of Heretic was informed by:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11717\">The original abliteration paper (Arditi et al. 2024)</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://huggingface.co/blog/mlabonne/abliteration\">Maxime Labonne's article on abliteration</a>, as well as some details from the model cards of his own abliterated models (see above)</li> \n <li>Jim Lai's articles describing <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/blog/grimjim/projected-abliteration\">\"projected abliteration\"</a> and <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/blog/grimjim/norm-preserving-biprojected-abliteration\">\"norm-preserving biprojected abliteration\"</a></li> \n</ul> \n<h2>Citation</h2> \n<p>If you use Heretic for your research, please cite it using the following BibTeX entry:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"language-bibtex\">@misc{heretic,\n  author = {Weidmann, Philipp Emanuel},\n  title = {Heretic: Fully automatic censorship removal for language models},\n  year = {2025},\n  publisher = {GitHub},\n  journal = {GitHub repository},\n  howpublished = {\\url{https://github.com/p-e-w/heretic}}\n}\n</code></pre> \n<h2>License</h2> \n<p>Copyright © 2025-2026 Philipp Emanuel Weidmann (<a href=\"mailto:pew@worldwidemann.com\">pew@worldwidemann.com</a>) + contributors</p> \n<p>This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.</p> \n<p>This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
