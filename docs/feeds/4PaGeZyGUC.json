The conversation explores how Java programming has evolved from Java 5 to Java 25, covering major shifts like the move toward immutability, the introduction of sequenced collections, streams, and unmodifiable collections.\n\nThey delve into critical design topics including encapsulation of collections, the anemic domain model anti-pattern, the controversial unsupported operation exception, and the challenges of null handling. The book includes new chapters on usage guidance and design retrospectives that reflect decades of accumulated wisdom about the Collections Framework.\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n01:19 A 19-year journey from Java 5 to Java 25\n04:41 The shift toward immutability &amp; unmodifiable collections\n07:08 Usage guidance: Ownership &amp; the anemic domain model\n17:58 Extension points &amp; the fragile base class problem\n20:41 Design retrospective: The unsupported operation exception controversy\n27:11 The Null handling mess\n29:09 A lasting achievement\n30:21 Outro\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nMaurice Naftalin &amp; Philip Wadler ‚Ä¢ Java Generics and Collections 2nd ed ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/47dOp9t\nMaurice Naftalin &amp; Philip Wadler ‚Ä¢ Java Generics and Collections 1st ed ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/42JI03i\nJoshua Bloch ‚Ä¢ Effective Java ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/4oFbdoi\nVictor Grazi &amp; Jeanne Boyarsky ‚Ä¢ Real-World Java ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/4oCEeBR\nKevlin Henney &amp; Trisha Gee ‚Ä¢ 97 Things Every Java Programmer Should Know ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3kiTwJJ\nChristian Clausen ‚Ä¢ Five Lines of Code ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3s2zjyg\nNicolai Parlog ‚Ä¢ The Java Module System ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3xFggR4\n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.instagram.com/goto_con\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#Java #JavaGenerics #JavaCollections #Immutability #Unmodifiability #Encapsulation #Java25 #Java5 #Null #NullHandling #Getters #Setters #AnemicDomainModel #JavaProgramming #TodayInTech #SoftwareDevelopment #SoftwareEngineering #Programming #MauriceNaftalin #StuartMarks #PhilipWadler #BookClub\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

      "content": "<article>On September 15, Jimmy Kimmel‚Äôs late-night show opening monologue included comments about the shooting of right-wing media figure Charlie Kirk, and how the \"Maga gang\" was \"desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them.‚Äù \n\nSoon after, Brendan Carr, the chair of the FCC and an appointee of President Donald Trump, appeared on a conservative podcast and threatened to act against ABC and its parent company, Disney, for Kimmel‚Äôs remarks. On September 17, ABC and Disney suspended ‚ÄúJimmy Kimmel Live!‚Äù \n\nKimmel‚Äôs suspension launched a national debate and protest around freedom of speech and satire. From celebrities like Wanda Sykes to Republicans like Sen. Ted Cruz, people from across the spectrum weighed in on the decision. The show returned days later on September 23, but the FCC‚Äôs actions left many questioning whether Kimmel‚Äôs First Amendment rights were violated.\n\nThis incident is just one of many instances of the gray areas of free speech making its way into the news cycle. In this video, we take a look at the origins of the ‚Äúinalienable right‚Äù to free speech, how the Supreme Court has determined the boundaries of speech (including hate speech), and where free speech might be headed next with a six-justice majority of Republican appointees. As this issue continues to evolve, social media is one of the latest modes of communication adding new layers of complexity to this age-old debate.\n\nSubscribe to our channel and turn on notifications (üîî) so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

      "content": "<article>Shepherds in the Alps have been guiding their sheep through the mountains for 6,000 years. They have to climb 3,000 meters and cross rivers and glaciers. Known as Alpine transhumance, this tradition has been recognized by UNESCO as Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.  \n\nWith 1,400 sheep, Markus and his colleagues make the journey from South Tyrol to Austria every spring. Like his ancestors, Markus spends the whole summer taking care of the animals in the alpine meadows.  \n\nBut they can't make a living from farming alone. Shepherds need to find other sources of income or even change jobs altogether. Still, they say what matters to them is that the next generation can carry on this tradition.  \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

More and more families and schools are setting clear boundaries to counter the constant distraction of social media.\n\nStudies have linked excessive smartphone use to depression, anxiety, and difficulties concentrating. This documentary follows several families and schools that greatly restrict smartphone use for children and young people. Martin and Ursula Novotny in Sevelen, Switzerland, are convinced that phones and social media are just as addictive as alcohol or drugs. They waited until their children were older before giving them a cell phone of their own. The Lyceum Alpinum boarding school in Switzerland is equally strict: During the day, all devices remain locked away; older students get their cell phones back after class, while younger students only get them for two hours in the evening. The result: The children are significantly less distracted in class and have actual conversations at breaktime. How much screen time is healthy, and at what age does it make sense to give a child a smartphone? Child and adolescent psychotherapist Nady Mirian explains which parental rules work for social media. The schools and families featured in the documentary are not opposed to new technologies, but they advocate responsible use. Is it still realistic for children today to grow up without a smartphone ‚Äî and could it actually be preferable?\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #smartphones #kids #socialmedia \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Software engineer Flavia Circiumaru and host Hannes Lowette dive deep into how this London-based regulatory compliance company transformed from a support-free-for-all to a streamlined powerhouse.\n\nFlavia Circiumaru reveals the behind-the-scenes story of building a three-desk support system that turned their support team into the ultimate connector, bridging customers, developers, and business teams like never before. From battling context-switching nightmares to creating communication magic, Flavia and Hannes explore actionable insights on scaling support without losing your sanity.\n\nThe twist? Their ultimate goal is to make support so seamless that dedicated teams won't even be needed. Talk about engineering your way out of a job!\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nJacqui Read ‚Ä¢ Communication Patterns ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3E37lvv\nSaleem Siddiqui ‚Ä¢ Learning Test-Driven Development ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/35OMb3n\nBen Goldacre ‚Ä¢ Bad Science ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/4lqNLKN\nBen Goldacre ‚Ä¢ Bad Pharma ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3G15Mz7\nJeet Pattanaik ‚Ä¢ Ethics in AI ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/4jXyQXw\nInspiring Tech Leaders - The Technology Podcast (https://www.priceroberts.com/) \nInterviews with Tech Leaders and insights on the latest emerging technology trends.\n\n\nListen on: Apple Podcasts (https://podcasts.apple.com/podcast/id1563026924)  &nbsp; Spotify (https://open.spotify.com/show/5ihWZxxIa2rEnzbx5tdKfH) \n\n\nBluesky (https://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com) \nTwitter (https://twitter.com/GOTOcon) \nInstagram (https://www.instagram.com/goto_con) \nLinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-) \nFacebook (https://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences) \n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
