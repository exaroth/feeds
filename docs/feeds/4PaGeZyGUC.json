      "content": "<article>Vox senior technology correspondent Adam Clark Estes has a cautionary tale about chatbots.\n\nWhat started as using AI for tedious chores — meal plans, grocery lists, quick research — quietly morphed into hours talking to a chatbot. And Adam isn’t alone. As chatbots get better at flattery, emotional support, and companionship, researchers are seeing more users (including teens) slip into dependency without realizing it.\n\nAdam unpacks how chatbots are designed to keep us coming back, why young people are especially vulnerable, and what happens when adults can’t walk away — in some cases, leading to severe mental health crises. \n\nThis is the first episode of Reporter Extras, a new Patreon-exclusive Vox video series that gives you a behind-the-scenes look at how our journalists create their work.\n\nIf you value this kind of in-depth journalism, join Vox on Patreon to unlock the full episode, get unlimited access to Vox.com, and support the reporting that makes it possible. https://www.patreon.com/posts/144397104?pr=true\n\nSubscribe to our channel and turn on notifications (🔔) so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Support your local PBS station here: https://www.pbs.org/donate\n\nThe soldier, who went by the call sign “Sheva,”  was part of the Ukrainian platoon at the heart of \"2000 Meters to Andriivka,\" the new feature documentary from FRONTLINE, The Associated Press and the Academy Award-winning team behind \"20 Days in Mariupol.\"\n\nWeaving together quiet moments of reflection, like this one with Sheva, and vivid battle footage, \"2000 Meters to Andriivka\" documents the toll of the Russia-Ukraine war from a personal and devastating vantage point. The film follows Ukraine’s 3rd Assault Brigade as it carries out a grueling, meter-by-meter counteroffensive that aims to retake the strategic Ukrainian town of Andriivka from Russia -- and as the soldiers realize that for them, the war may never end.\n\nSheva would be killed in a battle and die in a hospital five months after this scene was filmed. Read more about Sheva's story at pbs.org/frontline, and watch the full documentary on @frontline starting Nov. 25, 2025.\n\n“2000 Meters to Andriivka” is written, filmed and directed by filmmaker and Associated Press journalist Mstyslav Chernov. It is produced by Chernov, FRONTLINE’s senior documentary editor and producer Michelle Mizner and FRONTLINE’s editor-in-chief and executive producer Raney Aronson-Rath. It is edited by Michelle Mizner. The film is co-produced and includes additional cinematography by AP journalist Alex Babenko; is composed by two-time Grammy Award®-winning composer and music-producer Sam Slater; and is executive produced by Raney Aronson-Rath and the AP's Derl McCrudden. Distributed domestically by PBS Distribution and internationally by Dogwoof, “2000 Meters to Andriivka” is a FRONTLINE FEATURES and The Associated Press production.\n\n#ukraine #ukrainewar #ukrainerussiawar #documentaryexcerpt</article>",

      "content": "<article>Fentanyl is estimated to be fifty times as potent as heroin and is extremely addictive. The number of people in Poland abusing this powerful painkiller is growing. There have been dozens of fatalities.\n\nMichal lives in a small town south of Gdansk. Because of the stigma surrounding people with addiction, he prefers to remain anonymous. Every two weeks, he travels to Święciec to take methadone, a substitute drug, at the addiction clinic of the psychiatric hospital. After using various drugs, he started taking fentanyl, the strongest of all opiates. \nFentanyl is used to treat people with severe pain and as an anesthetic. Addicts remove the gel from pain patches and inject it directly into their bloodstream. There have been dozens of fatal overdoses in Poland. Michal has also lost one of his close friends. Corrupt pharmacists are believed to have sold large quantities of fentanyl patches to dealers. The authorities have since put a stop to this.  \nIn Żuromin, Jadwiga Karpinska lost her son Pawel to a fatal overdose. Their town, a two-hour drive from the capital Warsaw, was known as the country’s unofficial fentanyl capital in 2024. That changed when police detained a well-known local dealer. The drug continues to be available there, but in smaller quantities.\nElementary school teacher Adam Ejnik believes in prevention. He wants to keep his students away from the drug by raising awareness about its dangers. \nArtur from Łódź has managed to get off fentanyl. A few years ago, he was so addicted, he had lost the will to live. Today, his girlfriend Agnieszka helps him stay clean. His goal: he hopes to finish his psychology degree and work as a therapist to help other addicts get off the extremely powerful drug.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #poland #fentanyl \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

They build their bodies from thin air, move water with pressures that would crush a human, and grow using a fascinating system of living cables wrapped in layers of corpses. Under their bark lies a razor-thin strip of living cells, working endlessly to move water hundreds of meters, build indestructible wood, and coordinate millions of functions. \nHow do trees work, and what are they even made of? What makes these ancient giants so resilient, and maybe even immortal?\n\n\nOUR CHANNELS\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nGerman:        https://kgs.link/youtubeDE\nSpanish:        https://kgs.link/youtubeES\nFrench:          https://kgs.link/youtubeFR\nPortuguese:  https://kgs.link/youtubePT\nArabic:           https://kgs.link/youtubeAR\nHindi:             https://kgs.link/youtubeHI\nJapanese:     https://kgs.link/youtubeJA\nKorean:          https://kgs.link/youtubeKO\n\n\nHOW CAN YOU SUPPORT US?\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nThis is how we make our living and it would be a pleasure if you support us!\n\nGet Products designed with ❤️ https://shop.kgs.link\nJoin the Patreon Bird Army 🐧  https://kgs.link/patreon  \n\n\nDISCUSSIONS &amp; SOCIAL MEDIA\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nInstagram:     https://kgs.link/instagram\nTikTok:           https://kgs.link/tiktok\nReddit:            https://kgs.link/reddit\nDiscord:          https://kgs.link/discord\nTwitter:           https://kgs.link/twitter\nBluesky:          https://kgs.link/bluesky\nFacebook:      https://kgs.link/facebook\nNewsletter:    https://kgs.link/newsletter\n\n\nOUR VOICE\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nThe kurzgesagt voice is from \nSteve Taylor:  https://kgs.link/youtube-voice\n\n\nOUR MUSIC ♬♪\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\n700+ minutes of kurzgesagt soundtracks by Epic Mountain:\n\nSpotify:            https://kgs.link/music-spotify\nSoundcloud:   https://kgs.link/music-soundcloud\nBandcamp:     https://kgs.link/music-bandcamp\nYoutube:          https://kgs.link/music-youtube\nFacebook:       https://kgs.link/music-facebook\n\nThe soundtrack of this video:\nSoundCloud: https://bit.ly/4riwGp9\nBandcamp: https://bit.ly/44uVxMG\n\nIf you want to help us caption this video, please send subtitles to subtitle@kurzgesagt.org\nYou can find info on what subtitle files work on YouTube here:\nhttps://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2734698?hl=en-GB&amp;ref_topic=7296214\nThank you!\n\n\n🐦🐧🐤 PATREON BIRD ARMY 🐤🐧🐦\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nMany thanks to our wonderful Patreons (from http://kgs.link/patreon) who support us every month and made this video possible:\nAcácio Correia, AeryaRia, aforsberg, Ahmad Seet, Alexander, Alexander Devlin, amia, Andres Ramos, Anna Duwenig, Anthony Hanson, Anton Abrahamsson, AonReo, Armond Aghanian, Asaf Yishai, Benjamin R., Bharath Ron, Brendan Ryan-Lewis, Christoph Lurz, Christoph Rau, Clay, Cliff Hudson, ConsterCoaster, Corbin Meier, Dale Kipple, Delano Stijns, dotvhs, Dylan Gafner, eddie k, Ela Yohannan, Enigma66, Eran Aviram, Erwin Heckler, Eva Markiewicz, Evil Cookie, FeelinaraIRL, Frankie Ennis, G, Geoff Evans, George Hutter, hazardx, Hugh Mungus, Inigo vd, Ireleigh, Isabelll, Ishaan Varma, Jack Sparrow, James Emmitt Zugar, James Pinkerton, james trotta, Jason Desrosiers, Jason Murley, Jens Begemann, Jesse, Jesus Mayo, Joann Taijala, Joseph Gauthier, jurd, Justin, KawasakiDragonno, Keddan, KekzL, Lauren Woolsey LeGrandAnanas, Lulidine, LumpyMammot, manchicken, Mark A Vargas, MasterOfTree, Matthew Brady, Matthew Brodeur, Maximilian Schons, Mead Landis, Ms. Ewing, Mykola Balakin, Nathaniel Bauernfeind, Nicholas McCalla, Owen, PaladinSpartac, Phoenix_Flames, Primalis, Quinn Wilson, Rath Robin, Robert Cudinski, Robin Hockett, Ryan Snead, Ryan Staunch, Ryan Thompson, SentinelD20, Siddharth Chaini, Sindre Nistad, Soko Divanovic, Spleens, Stacey Nicholson, Stephen Conlon, Strudy, Syi, Sérgio P., Thomas Mitchell, Thomas Stokes, Thomas Toombes, Tom Kocmi, Warren MacEvoy, William Lingenfelter</article>",

The approach has proven successful even in traditional corporate environments, ultimately creating more maintainable code bases where development teams actually enjoy working and can respond effectively to changing requirements.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOK\nAndrew Harmel-Law • Facilitating Software Architecture • https://amzn.eu/d/5kZKVfU\nInspiring Tech Leaders - The Technology Podcast (https://www.priceroberts.com/) \nInterviews with Tech Leaders and insights on the latest emerging technology trends.\n\n\nListen on: Apple Podcasts (https://podcasts.apple.com/podcast/id1563026924)  &nbsp; Spotify (https://open.spotify.com/show/5ihWZxxIa2rEnzbx5tdKfH) \n\n\nBluesky (https://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com) \nTwitter (https://twitter.com/GOTOcon) \nInstagram (https://www.instagram.com/goto_con) \nLinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-) \nFacebook (https://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences) \n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

Support your local PBS station here: https://www.pbs.org/donate​.\n\n“2000 Meters to Andriivka” documents the toll of the Russia-Ukraine war from a personal and devastating vantage point. Following his historic account of the civilian toll in Mariupol, Ukrainian filmmaker and Associated Press journalist Mstyslav Chernov turns his lens towards Ukrainian soldiers — who they are, where they came from, and the impossible decisions they face in the trenches as they fight for every inch of their land.\n\nThe documentary follows a Ukrainian brigade battling through approximately one mile of a heavily fortified forest on their mission to liberate the Russian-occupied village of Andriivka amid a failing counteroffensive in 2023. \n\nWeaving together original footage, intensive Ukrainian Army bodycam video and powerful moments of reflection with haunting intimacy, the documentary reveals how the farther the soldiers advance through their destroyed homeland, the more they realize that, for them, this war may never end.\n\n“2000 Meters to Andriivka” is written, filmed and directed by filmmaker and Associated Press journalist Mstyslav Chernov. It is produced by Chernov, FRONTLINE’s senior documentary editor and producer Michelle Mizner and FRONTLINE’s editor-in-chief and executive producer Raney Aronson-Rath. It is edited by Michelle Mizner. The film is co-produced and includes additional cinematography by AP journalist Alex Babenko, and is composed by two-time Grammy Award®-winning composer and music-producer Sam Slater. Distributed domestically by PBS Distribution and internationally by Dogwoof, “2000 Meters to Andriivka” is a FRONTLINE FEATURES and The Associated Press production.</article>",

      "content": "<article>The Houthi militia has been fighting for supremacy in Yemen for years. The conflict has become a civil war, with international involvement. The Middle East conflict has further escalated the situation and exacerbated Yemen’s humanitarian crisis.\n\nYemen, at the southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula, is one of the poorest countries in the world. After many years of civil war, the country is in dire condition. Cities have been destroyed, supplies are lacking, and there is political repression. A lost generation of children is growing up without schooling, medical care or proper nutrition. Aid supplies are blocked, looted or sold on the black market.\n\nThe conflict in Yemen began in 2004 with the uprising of the Shiite Houthis against the Sunni-dominated Yemeni government. In 2014, the Houthis occupied the capital Sanaa - allegedly with the support of Iran. The response was a military intervention, led by Saudi Arabia. \n\nA proxy war, in which the people suffer: So far, there have been over 400,000 fatalities. More than 20 million people - around half the population - are now dependent on humanitarian aid.\n\nFollowing Hamas's terrorist attack on Israel in October, 2023 and the subsequent Israeli ground offensive in Gaza, the conflict is spreading. Houthi militias are not only attacking Israel, but also ships in the Red Sea - and thus international trade. The US and its allies have responded with air strikes. The civilian population, already suffering, is bearing the brunt of the continuing violence.\nBetween blockades, war and geopolitics, is Yemen in danger of being torn apart?\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #yemen #houthi \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

      "content": "<article>Afghanistan has risen from sporting outsider to one of the world's top cricket nations. The unlikely journey has brought hope to a country with rare reason to celebrate while illuminating the complex politics of the Taliban's relationship to cricket.\n\nCricket has grown into a vital part of life in Afghanistan - offering glimmers of joy and excitement to the countless Afghans that play and watch the game. And while the stunning achievements of the men's national team have fostered unity and hope, the Taliban's return to power means half of the country is barred from the festivities and many female players were forced to flee their homeland. \n\nIn a crisis-ridden country like Afghanistan, cricketing success is both deeply meaningful to its people and a complex political challenge, presenting the Taliban government with an opportunity to use the sport at home and abroad. Cricket has offered star players like Gulbadin Naib a path from childhood refugee camps to international acclaim, while all over the country young players like Jamal Stanikzai dream of one day taking part in the team's success. For Afghan refugees like former women's national team player Firooza Amiri, cricket is both a beloved sport and a form of resistance. Deutsche Welle accompanies current and former players and fans in Afghanistan, Australia and Dubai to tell the intertwined stories of Afghan cricket.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #cricket #afghanistan #dwsports\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

For a long time, scientists believed insects acted mostly out of instinct and weren’t particularly intelligent, in part, because most of them only live for a few weeks. But it turns out, the insect world is far more complex than we previously thought.  \n\nMany insect species have brains the size of a grain of rice, but are still able to store images, shapes, colors and experiences, and can even learn new skills and work with tools.  \n\nIn many species, individual insects even develop unique traits and personalities, like bravery or aggressiveness. One reason for this could be that species with diverse individuals can better adapt to environmental changes, giving them an evolutionary advantage for survival. \n\nWatch the full documentary “Smart insects - The astonishing intelligence of bumblebees, wasps &amp; co.” on the DW Documentary YouTube channel.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #insects \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.
