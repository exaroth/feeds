      "content": "<article>The Rise of the Seljuk Turks chronicles how a Turko-Persian frontier confederation grew into one of the medieval world’s most influential empires. Emerging from the steppes of Central Asia, the Seljuks united inner-city Persia with Turkic cavalry might, transforming political and cultural landscapes across Iran, Iraq, and Anatolia. Under Tughril Beg, they consolidated power in the early 11th century, capturing Ray and routing rival dynasties to establish the Great Seljuk state. The empire expanded under Alp Arslan, whose victory at Manzikert in 1071 shattered Byzantium’s frontier and opened Anatolia to Turkish settlement, setting the stage for the Turkic-ruled Sultanate of Rum. Malik Shah I presided over a prosperous era, supported by the brilliant vizier Nizam al-Mulk and a thriving network of madrasas that fused Sunni scholarship with Persian administrative sophistication. The Seljuks pioneered a centralized yet adaptive governance model, blending military prowess with a sophisticated bureaucratic system that influenced governance across the region for centuries. As they defended eastern borders against rival powers and fostered a rich cultural milieu, their rise also created the conditions for Crusades to enter the Levant. This video unpacks the key figures, battles, and institutions that defined the Seljuk ascent, and traces their enduring legacy in Anatolia, Iran, and the broader Islamic world. If you love medieval history and the fusion of Turkic and Persian influences, subscribe for more on the rise and legacy of the Seljuk Turks. \n\n#SeljukEmpire #SeljukTurks #MedievalHistory #Manzikert #Crusades #IslamicHistory #TurkishHistory #epichistory</article>",

      "content": "<article>For many single parents, everyday life can be a challenge. But a number of projects offer assistance and encouragement. Affordable housing, social networking, and childcare services are designed to ease the burden.\n\nSingle parents in Europe can increasingly rely on help and support from people, associations, and institutions to help them balance raising children with work, financial issues, and mental overload. \n\n\"A secure, affordable living situation - that's such a key issue in the lives of single parents,” says Sarah Zeller. A few years ago, she found herself confronting this issue when, along with another friend and her child, she decided to set up a shared apartment for the two single parent families. But they searched in vain for an affordable apartment with enough space. \n\nThis predicament gave rise to an innovative approach. In 2015, the German native founded the non-profit association JUNO in Vienna. Working with property developers, the association plans and develops compact and affordable apartments for single parents. With her idea, the founder has now helped over 160 families find a suitable apartment. \n\nThe Belgian region of Wallonia has set itself the goal of strengthening the social position of single parents. Amandine Dedoncker is a social worker involved in the \"Relais Familles Mono” program, creating services tailored to the needs of single parents. The government program enables single parents to learn practical skills, meet other mothers or fathers, and be part of a community. As a population group particularly affected by loneliness, this is extremely important for single parents‘ mental health. \nWhen other families have free time, on Saturdays Bianka Baumann is at work: in a supermarket in Rostock. The single mother and sales assistant works weekends. But who looks after her son Linus, during a time when most daycare centers are closed? An innovative daycare center here makes her weekend work possible by offering overnight care for parents who work night shifts. \nAll of this is financed by the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. A model that supports single parents - and makes it possible to truly balance work and family life.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

This documentary explores the remarkable life of the woman who served as the longest-serving Princess of Wales and eventually Queen Consort to King Edward VII.\n\nWhile the Edwardian era is often remembered for its lavish parties and the \"Marlborough House Set,\" Alexandra’s private reality was defined by her battle with progressive deafness and the \"Alexandra Limp\"—a physical disability caused by rheumatic fever that, bizarrely, became a viral fashion trend among the Victorian elite. From her \"rags-to-riches\" journey as a Danish princess to her complicated marriage to a \"Playboy King,\" we reveal how she navigated his high-profile mistresses (including Alice Keppel) and the strict demands of Queen Victoria.\n\nPlease subscribe here. https://www.youtube.com/@PeopleProfiles?sub_confirmation=1\nOur second channel. https://www.youtube.com/@PeopleProfilesExtra\nFollow us on Spotify. https://open.spotify.com/show/7fKALbrzEO9Q4VVvAwWHqL\nSupport us on Patreon https://patreon.com/thepeopleprofiles\nFollow us on Twitter. https://twitter.com/tpprofiles\n\nThanks for watching!

Maps, documents, and eyewitness accounts from French and Algerian veterans document the dimension of this warfare, as well as the human suffering it caused. \n\nInterviews with experts on nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons explain how military and political decision-makers organized these secret attacks. In addition to the torture and displacement of entire population groups, the use of chemical weapons constituted a huge breach of France's international obligations.

The only problem for its supporters? It doesn't officially exist. \n\nAfter the Yugoslav Wars, the border between Serbia and Croatia along the Danube River remained unresolved. Vit Jedlička, a former politician from the Czech Republic, saw an opportunity. In 2015, he declared the “Free Republic of Liberland” on a 7-square-kilometer piece of land. \n\nThe Liberland experiment may seem like an oddity, but it also raises serious questions: Cryptocurrencies and decentralized networks are undermining traditional national borders, and radical market ideas are gaining influence. Parallel structures are emerging.

Use code BOYLE at the link below and get 60% off an annual plan: https://incogni.com/boyle\n\nThis video explores the 2026 \"Deep Freeze\" of the crypto market, analyzing why the \"digital gold\" thesis has failed to protect investors as Bitcoin lags behind the S&amp;P 500 total returns. We dive into the \"Victory Paradox\"—the irony that Bitcoin’s institutional acceptance through Wall Street ETFs and a \"crypto-friendly\" presidency has tethered it to traditional financial risks, destroying its status as an uncorrelated asset. From the $12 billion losses at Michael Saylor’s Strategy Inc. and the liquidity crisis at institutional prime broker BlockFills to the Great AI Pivot in the mining industry, we break down the structural traps currently paralyzing the ecosystem. Featuring insights on \"Financial Nihilism\" from Demetri Kofinas, the \"Juggalo Theory\" of crypto subcultures from Zeke Faux, and the massive migration toward prediction markets like Kalshi and Polymarket, we ask the ultimate forward-looking question: now that Bitcoin is fully financialized, will it ever be an independent asset again?\n\nPatrick's Books:\nStatistics For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3eerLA0\nDerivatives For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3cjsyPF\nCorporate Finance:  https://amzn.to/3fn3rvC \n\nWays To Support The Channel\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/PatrickBoyleOnFinance\nBuy Me a Coffee: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/patrickboyle\n\nVisit our website: https://www.onfinance.org\nFollow Patrick on Twitter Here: https://bsky.app/profile/pboyle.bsky.social\n\nBusiness Inquiries ➡️ sponsors@onfinance.org\n\nPatrick Boyle On Finance Podcast:\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/7uhrWlDvxzy9hLoW0EYf0b\nApple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/patrick-boyle-on-finance/id1547740313\nGoogle Podcasts: https://tinyurl.com/62862nve\n\nJoin this channel to support making this content:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCASM0cgfkJxQ1ICmRilfHLw/join</article>",

      "content": "<article>Jeffrey Epstein remained a thriving member of the elite for decades, even when everyone seemed to know what he was doing. His sphere of influence included top political officials, CEOs, corporate executives, finance managers, and even a member of the British royal family. How did he manage it? It turns out it was by establishing an elaborate network of influence and access that went well beyond the norms and expectations of the rich and famous.\n\nWhat were the tipping points that nearly brought Epstein to justice in the 14 years before his first conviction and his final 2019 arrest? What were the structures and systems that failed to stop him from abusing and exploiting young women and girls in those 14 years? In this episode, we tick through the guest lists and institutions that continued to profit from relationships with Jeffrey Epstein — and which helped him remain free, in turn.\n\nWe will also talk about many of the conspiracy theories that have popped up since the latest tranche of Epstein documents came out. Was Epstein a national security asset? Did he actually kill himself?\n\nIndependent journalist Tara Palmeri, author of the Red Letter Substack and host of The Tara Palmeri Show, argues that conspiracies are important to help the public understand the extent and scope of the Epstein scandal — since for so long, so much about the story was covered up. We’ll make sense of which conspiracies have validity and which are tinfoil hat material, in this interview with a journalist who has long advocated for and written about the Epstein survivors.\n\n00:00 Intro: What we do and do not know about Epstein\n03:31 The stories of the Epstein survivors\n07:56 The conspiracy theories around Epstein\n11:21 The elite enablers around Epstein\n17:08 The political cover-up over Epstein\n19:13 The conspiracy theorizing around Epstein\n22:13 The elite lies around Epstein\n\nToday, Explained publishes compelling interviews with key figures in politics and culture every Saturday.

We know that ICE was created in 2003. So what exactly do they mean by that? To unpack this claim, Vox producer Nate Krieger examines the history of immigration enforcement in the US. \n\nThe story of American immigration is one of gradual change. Over time, the role of the immigration services slowly changed, morphing from an agency that managed labor and benefits to one that saw itself as law enforcement, with a focus on national security. \n\nAnd with that shift came a growth in capacity. The first federal immigration agency was created in 1891 with a total staff of 4 people. Today, with ICE, that number is over 22,000.\n\nSo how did immigration restrictions and enforcement change over the span of American history? By examining the centuries of events that culminated in the creation of ICE, we can begin to understand the context that created this modern agency. \n\nSources and further reading: \n\nFor more context, images, and written accounts of Ellis Island, see this page on the National Park Service’s website: https://www.nps.gov/elis/learn/historyculture/index.htm\n\nFor this story, Nate Krieger focused on the history leading up to 2003 and the creation of ICE, so the piece does not delve into more recent developments. But detailed information and data on deportation in President Donald Trump’s second term can be found here: https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/immigration-detention-report.pdf and https://deportationdata.org/analysis/immigration-enforcement-first-nine-months-trump\n\nAnd more information on ICE’s arrests in the interior, which are a relatively recent phenomenon, can be found here: https://www.migrationpolicy.org/content/ice-arrests-deportations-interior\n\nThis piece only touched on Japanese incarceration during the Second World War. For more information — and first-hand accounts — about this important subject, Densho is a fantastic resource: https://ddr.densho.org/\n\n\"Immigration: How the Past Shapes The Present\" by the sociologist Nancy Foner, who was interviewed for this piece, is a comprehensive look into why the past is critical to understanding modern immigration: https://www.politybooks.com/bookdetail?book_slug=immigration-how-the-past-shapes-the-present--9781509557912\n\nIf you enjoy our reporting and want to hear more from Vox journalists, sign up for our Patreon at patreon.com/vox.

He dedicated it to Sacha Guitry, the famous French actor and screenwriter, who loved crayfish butter. I've adapted it for the home kitchen using cooked prawns.\nA compound butter is a flavoured butter made by blending softened butter with other ingredients — in this case, cooked prawns with their shells and coral. What makes this dish unique is that the compound butter is not just served on top. It is used as a cooking fat, and then whisked into the sauce at the end to give it a rich, silky shellfish finish.\n\nIn this video you will learn how to:\n\nMake a prawn compound butter from scratch using a stick blender\nCook chicken breasts à blanc (with minimal colour)\nWhite-cook mushrooms in butter, lemon and water\nBuild a French cream sauce using Madeira wine\nUse compound butter as a sauce thickener and enrichment\nPrepare and sauté dried morels\n\nThis is Part 1 of a 3-part series on compound butters in French cooking.\n\nFULL RECIPE\nAvailable on our website: https://www.thefrenchcookingacademy.com/recipes/poulet-sacha-guitry\n\nLEARN FRENCH COOKING WITH US\nJoin the FCA Club for full access to structured French cooking courses, a private community and more: https://www.thefrenchcookingacademy.com\n\nABOUT THIS CHANNEL\nThe French Cooking Academy teaches classical French cooking techniques for the home kitchen.

The culprit behind the acceleration is unknown, so we live with a stand-in term \"dark energy\". Our modern cosmological model assumes that dark energy has a constant density--always the same amount of the outward-shoving stuff per volume. But there's recent evidence to the contrary--which may be why our primary efforts to measure the expansion rate of the universe disagree with each other.\n\n\nSign Up on Patreon to get access to the Space Time Discord!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/pbsspacetime\n\nCheck out the Space Time Merch Store\nhttps://www.pbsspacetime.com/shop\n\nSign up for the mailing list to get episode notifications and hear special announcements!\nhttps://mailchi.mp/1a6eb8f2717d/spacetime\n\nSearch the Entire Space Time Library Here: https://search.pbsspacetime.com/\n\nHosted by Matt O'Dowd\nWritten by Matt O'Dowd \nPost Production by Leonardo Scholzer\nDirected by Andrew Kornhaber\nAssociate Producer: Bahar Gholipour\nExecutive Producer: Andrew Kornhaber\nExecutive in Charge for PBS: Maribel Lopez\nDirector of Programming for PBS: Gabrielle Ewing\nAssistant Director of Programming for PBS: Mike Martin\n\nSpacetime is a production of Kornhaber Brown for PBS Digital Studios.\nThis program is produced by Kornhaber Brown, which is solely responsible for its content.\n© 2026 PBS.
