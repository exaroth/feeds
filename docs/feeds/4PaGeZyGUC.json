Use my link https://www.tailorstore.com/patrickboyle so you can take a look whenever it suits you.\n\nIn a highly unusual move - the Department of Justice has opened a criminal investigation into Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell. As America faces a high-stakes standoff over the future of the Federal Reserve, the traditional independence of the nation’s central bank is under direct attack. This video explores the intensifying war between the White House and Fed Chair, over a $2.5 billion headquarters renovation. We break down why many experts believe this probe is a mere pretext intended to bully the Fed into slashing interest rates to rock-bottom levels, potentially putting the long-term stability of the U.S. economy at risk for short-term political gains.\n\nWe also take a closer look at the \"agents of chaos\" Bill Pulte, Judge Jeanine Pirro and the \"shadow\" economic strategies currently in play, from the FHFA’s controversial bond-buying programs to the proposed 10% cap on credit card interest rates. From the strategic blockade in the Senate by Senator Thom Tillis to the \"Miran Limbo\" on the Fed’s Board of Governors, we unpack the technical and political maneuvers being used to bypass Jerome Powell. Is the U.S. headed toward a \"banana republic\" risk premium, or can its institutional guardrails hold firm? Join us as we examine the true price of a political Fed and what it means for the future of the dollar.\n\nPatrick's Books:\nStatistics For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3eerLA0\nDerivatives For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3cjsyPF\nCorporate Finance:  https://amzn.to/3fn3rvC \n\nWays To Support The Channel\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/PatrickBoyleOnFinance\nBuy Me a Coffee: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/patrickboyle\n\nVisit our website: https://www.onfinance.org\nFollow Patrick on Twitter Here: https://bsky.app/profile/pboyle.bsky.social\n\nBusiness Inquiries ➡️ sponsors@onfinance.org\n\nPatrick Boyle On Finance Podcast:\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/7uhrWlDvxzy9hLoW0EYf0b\nApple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/patrick-boyle-on-finance/id1547740313\nGoogle Podcasts: https://tinyurl.com/62862nve\n\nJoin this channel to support making this content:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCASM0cgfkJxQ1ICmRilfHLw/join</article>",

      "content": "<article>More and more city dwellers are collecting food in the asphalt jungle. They harvest herbs by the roadside and grow wild vegetables in cracks in the concrete. For these modern foragers and hunters, the food is free, tasty and more varied than in the supermarket.\n\nChristian Amys is an urban foraging professional. He forages for fresh food in his hometown of Brighton. For him, the English coastal city is an urban Garden of Eden. Christian finds wild vegetables and herbs in places where most people would never expect to find food. The 42-year-old only spends a few pounds a week on food from the supermarket: \"I want to be independent and don't like to rely on the supermarket. I like to forage on my doorstep because it's nice to know where my food comes from.\"\n\nChristian Amys worked as a top chef for 20 years before becoming an urban forager. Today, he shows others where to find wild fennel, hogweed, pineapple weed and dandelion heads and how to use them in food preparation. Christian now even supplies top restaurants and cocktail bars with his wild delicacies.\n\nAlexis Goertz also looks for her food on the roadside and in parks. The Canadian has lived in Berlin for over 10 years. She preserves what she collects using the centuries-old technique of fermentation. Whether it's evening primrose capers, wild garlic kimchi or goutweed sauerkraut - for Alexis, fermentation is about more than just preservation: \"Above all, fermentation makes food tastier and easier to digest. And I've just become addicted to it.\"\n\nAlexis regularly invites people to join her on urban herb walks and explains what’s edible - and what’s poisonous. The 33-year-old is all about rediscovering nature in the city: \"Berlin is fantastic for foraging for food. The diversity is immense. Not just among the people, but also in nature.\"\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #urbanforaging #food \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

      "content": "<article>In the summer of 2014, fields and coal mines in eastern Ukraine became a crime scene. The wreckage of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was scattered across 12 square kilometers. Evidence of a war crime that remains unpunished to this day.\n\nOn July 17, 2014, the Malaysian Boeing 777 with flight number MH17 was en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, carrying 283 passengers and 15 crew members. The plane was shot down by a Russian BUK missile as it flew over eastern Ukraine, where war broke out in 2014. \n\nThis documentary reflects on the tragedy of MH17. The film consists of archive material, intercepted telephone conversations, open-source material, excerpts from television broadcasts, and staged fictional episodes. By combining different materials into a comprehensive collage, the film sheds light on the crash and examines the connections between propaganda, justice, punishment, and the far-reaching consequences of actions. \n\nWhile the film revolves around the story of MH17, it also approaches the subject on a very personal level — including a meeting with a Dutch relative of one of the victims on the plane. By making connections to what is happening in Ukraine today, the film sheds light on the global repercussions of this crime. \n\nThe film views the tragic events of July 17, 2014 from different perspectives and at different points in time, linking the crimes of the past with the present.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #flight #boeing777 \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

For Soviet naval planners, a nightmare scenario was unfolding. If war broke out, American submarines could find and destroy Soviet submarines before they had a chance to strike back.\n\nSimply catching up to American stealth wasn't an option. It wasn't a technology that could easily be copied, it was the result of decades of precision manufacturing, relentless quality control, advances in materials science, and industrial discipline that the Soviet system couldn't support at the time. It would take decades to catch up.\n\nFaced with a widening stealth technology gap, Soviet planners stopped trying to play hide and seek under the oceans, and instead chose raw power. They would bet everything on speed, depth, maneuverability and brute force.\n\nIn 1960, the Soviet Union launched their most ambitious submarine programs in history. Project 705 ‘Lira’, later designated as the ‘Alfa Class’ submarine by NATO, was a nuclear-powered attack submarine capable of outrunning torpedoes, executing extreme maneuvers, and diving deeper than anything the world had ever seen. Built with a revolutionary liquid-metal nuclear reactor, advanced automation, and a titanium hull, this machine represented a generational leap in engineering.\nIt wasn’t just a faster submarine, it was a radical attempt to rewrite the rules of underwater warfare.\n\nWhen Western intelligence realized what the Soviets were building, it caused immediate panic. A submarine that could outrun torpedoes and dive beyond existing weapons threatened to upend NATO’s entire anti-submarine strategy, forcing the West into a sudden scramble to catch up.\n\nBut Project 705, a super submarine meant to restore balance beneath the seas, would prove to be far more than the Soviets ever bargained for.\n\nThanks for watching!</article>",

Two days later, he died. The alleged perpetrator, a 19-year-old Syrian, was arrested.\n\nA summer evening that ended in disaster. After his sister's high school graduation party, 20-year-old Philippos was brutally attacked in the German town of Bad Oeynhausen.\n\nAs his mother Joanna was mourning her son, Philippos became headline news. Before long, his death was used to reignite the debate on Germany’s asylum policy. Both in the German parliament, and in the media. \n\nPhilippos' mother did not participate in this discussion. For her, the nationality of the perpetrator was irrelevant. \"The doctor who fought for my child's life is Syrian,\" she said. \"So is my hairdresser. And me? I'm Polish.”\n\nInstead, Joanna, who is deeply religious, tried to find a way to deal with her anger, rage, despair, and grief. She sought advice from a prison psychologist and a priest: Why did Philippos have to die? Am I allowed to be angry with the perpetrator? Do I have to forgive him?\n\nShe sat opposite the defendant at the Bielefeld Regional Court, endured the police reports and witness statements, listened to the autopsy results from the forensic pathologists, and witnessed the images of her dead child on the dissection table.\n\n\"Even hearing the incomprehensible, the painful, knowing how Philippos died... I owe that to my child,\" she said. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

But history is only half the story. The real question is why the United States cares so much about Greenland right now.\n\nAs climate change melts Arctic ice, Greenland is no longer just the world’s largest island—it’s a strategic goldmine. New shipping routes, untapped rare earth minerals, and massive energy potential are turning the Arctic into the next great power competition zone. The U.S., China, and Russia are all watching closely, but America’s interest in Greenland goes back decades, from Cold War military bases to recent, very public attempts to increase influence.\n\n0:00 Introduction \n1:23 Prehistory \n2:50 Viking Age\n7:50 Rediscovery\n9:21 Polar Exploration\n11:30 World War Two\n13:35 The Cold War\n19:14 Modern Era\n\nYou can now become a History Hit member right here on YouTube!

      "content": "<article>Filmed in secret, this documentary is a behind-the-scenes look at the \"Woman, Life, Freedom” uprising in Iran. The story begins a few weeks after the death of Jina Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish student who died on 16 September 2022.\n\nShe had allowed a few strands of hair to escape from her veil. Members of the Iranian morality police beat her so severely that she died of her injuries. The regime in Tehran has denied all responsibility for her death, which triggered nationwide mass protests under a slogan that echoed all around the world: \"Woman, Life, Freedom”.\n\nIranian filmmaker Shorresh Afkari filmed in secret, smuggling the footage out of the country to a colleague in France. His documentary gives a voice to people who, like large sections of the Iranian population, have run out of strength and patience.\n\nFor example, the film observes a young couple who dream of being able to express their love openly and in complete freedom. We also meet a taxi driver, who ends up in prison as a bitter opponent of the regime. His mother tries to protect him at all costs. A painter continues to practise her art despite censorship; a doctor secretly treats demonstrators. A young man is prepared to do anything for cash, even sell one of his kidneys. Just like men who dare to protest, women who show their hair in public and publicly oppose the regime still face harsh punishment, including the death penalty. For this reason, many interviewees speak off-camera to protect their anonymity.\n\nThe widespread protests and mass demonstrations that began shortly before the end of 2025 and continue to this day show that large parts of the population no longer support the regime in Tehran — a regime that continues to respond with brutality against the people of Iran.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #iran #protest #womanlifefreedom \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

A holy man stopped by and told them of a Magic Mountain, east of north and north of east, where they’d find their most meaningful treasures. But, he said, only a true hero could complete the journey. Malay Bera shares the Bengali tale of Kiranmala's quest.\n\nLesson by Malay Bera, directed by Héloïse Dorsan-Rachet.\n\nAlthough this folktale exists in multiple oral variants across the Bengali-speaking world, this video is based on a variant akin to the better-known literary version, “Kironmala\", from Thakurmar Jhuli (1907), an anthology of Bengali folktales collected by Dakshinaranjan Mitra Majumdar in the early 20th century.\n\nSupport Our Non-Profit Mission\n----------------------------------------------\nSupport us on Patreon: http://bit.ly/TEDEdPatreon\nCheck out our merch: http://bit.ly/TEDEDShop\n----------------------------------------------\n\nConnect With Us\n----------------------------------------------\nSign up for our newsletter: http://bit.ly/TEDEdNewsletter\nFollow us on Facebook: http://bit.ly/TEDEdFacebook\nFind us on Twitter: http://bit.ly/TEDEdTwitter\nPeep us on Instagram: http://bit.ly/TEDEdInstagram\n----------------------------------------------\n\nKeep Learning\n----------------------------------------------\nView full lesson: https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-princess-who-conquered-magic-mountain-malay-bera\nDig deeper with additional resources: \n\nAnimator's website: https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-princess-who-conquered-magic-mountain-malay-bera/digdeeper\n----------------------------------------------\n\nThank you so much to our patrons for your support!
