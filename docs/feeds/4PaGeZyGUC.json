Faced with what it views as transactional coercion, Brussels is readying an arsenal of economic countermeasures, ranging from a \"trade bazooka\" targeting U.S. tech firms to the highly publicized \"financial nuclear option\"—the threat of dumping trillions in U.S. Treasuries. But before we panic about a bond market collapse, we need to examine the hard financial realities: Is weaponizing sovereign debt a viable strategy, or is it merely a macroeconomic suicide pact?

      "content": "<article>The Neretva in Bosnia and Herzegovina is one of Europe's last wild rivers. Its unique ecosystem is threatened with destruction. Despite objections, politicians and entrepreneurs are allowing hydroelectric power plants to be built here. But resistance to the plans remains strong.\n\nOver the past millennia, the Neretva has developed into a globally unique ecosystem. It is home to animal and plant species that exist nowhere else. But the \"Blue Heart of Europe,” as the Neretva is also known, is threatened with collapse.\n\nPoliticians and entrepreneurs see new power plants as opportunities to generate sustainable energy — and rake in big money. Local residents and scientists, on the other hand, have serious doubts about the projects. This is because the construction of a dam changes the natural environment forever.\n\nBoban Škrtar lives a few kilometers above the planned main dam in the village of Ulog. On the riverbank, he explains the devastating impact of the construction project to date: \"Everything here used to be forest. It was cleared for the dam, and you can see that now everything is destroyed. There used to be a swimming area and a campsite there, but now everything is gone forever.\"\nOn the other side of the dam, Austrian aquatic ecologist Kurt Pinter is searching for the softmouth trout—a fish thought to live in just four river systems, including the Neretva. His hope is that if the softmouth trout is declared an endangered endemic species in this part of the river system, the construction of some 70 new power plants along the Neretva may be prevented.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #bosnia #neretva #bosniaandherzegovina \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

This is a film about the power of listening.\n\nWhen Dori Laub began recording the stories of other survivors in the late 1970s, he was preserving memory. But he was also pioneering a radical act of listening. He recognized the power of listening to life stories as a way of helping survivors cope with trauma. His work led to the creation of the world’s first video testimony archive and shaped a unique therapeutic approach centered on presence, empathy, and witness.  \n\nThe documentary follows the final four years of Laub’s life (2015-2018), interweaving powerful archival testimonies with intimate glimpses into his own story: a childhood in Romanian camps, a love affair with the daughter of a former Nazi officer, and the moment his own children hear his testimony for the first time.

      "content": "<article>Minnesota has become ground zero for the biggest federal immigration operation in US history. Thousands of immigration officers are patrolling the streets of Minneapolis, leading to the death of one anti-ICE protester, Renee Nicole Good, and setting off a massive swirl of protests. \n\nVice President JD Vance visited Minneapolis late this week — showing his support for law enforcement, and sending a political message at the same time: that this White House is doubling down on its war against blue cities, and Minneapolis specifically.\n\nNow, President Trump has subpoenaed the state’s top Democratic officials, alleging they were impeding federal immigration enforcement actions. The Justice Department has promised to arrest anyone who impedes the immigration enforcement actions, and a Trump official accused some state officials of “terrorism.” With Minnesota now in a full-blown conflict with the Trump administration, the Democratic state leadership is front and center in the standoff.\n\nIn this video episode of Vox’s Today, Explained podcast, host Astead Herndon interviews Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison about the Somali fraud scandal that first brought on the ICE surge in his state. Did Democratic officials do enough to staunch the fraud? What more could they have done to cut the fraud off at its knees? And now that ICE is in Minnesota, what more can they do? Are the courts the only recourse, if President Trump does as he has been threatening, and invokes the Insurrection Act? \n\n00:00 Intro \n01:21 The fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good \n03:26 The DOJ going after Democratic state officials\n07:38  Minneapolis protests against ICE\n10:17 Trump's threat to impose the Insurrection Act in Minneapolis\n12:30 \"Defund the Police\" and \"Abolish ICE\"\n16:41: Is Minneapolis a sanctuary city?\n19:19 The fallout of the Somali fraud scandal in Minnesota\n23:40 The fallout from the scandal on Democratic leadership\n24:29 Pushing back on the Trump administration\n\nToday, Explained is a daily news podcast from Vox that explains one story in the news or culture each day, while doing their best not to bum you out.

Barbara.\n\nFor well over 100 years, birthright citizenship has been enshrined in the Constitution,with the understanding that anyone born on US soil is granted citizenship. \n\nBut in Trump v. Barbara, the administration claims that the law applies to those who are not just born in the United States but also “owe allegiance” to it.\n\nThe plaintiffs represent a group of people affected by Trump’s executive order, and their argument is simple: Leave birthright citizenship alone. \n\nWatch the full second episode of The Docket exclusively on Vox's Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/posts/docket-trumps-on-148945751\n\nSubscribe to our channel and turn on notifications (🔔) so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Initial tests are promising. Is success a genuine possibility?\n\nOver half of humanity lives near the coast. But in many places, flooding is a constant threat, forcing entire populations to search for new habitats. Paradoxically, these could be located directly on the water. \n\nCities, floating on the ocean. It sounds like science fiction, but could soon become reality. International research has long been developing concepts for life on water. Now, new designs — from temporary huts to affordable student dormitories to smart high-tech villas — seem to hold promise. Could huge numbers of people soon be living in \"floating cities”?\n\nThis futuristic living concept could have some real perks. Artificial islands can adjust to changing water levels. Modular city ‘fleets’ can change location like ships. Flexible floating neighborhoods can expand or move closer together. Efficient water management systems could supply the city with food and energy. \n\nBut where floating cities drop anchor, questions arise: What laws do they fall under? What about environmental protection? How do they interact with the ecosystem? And how can they be protected from tsunamis? The search for answers has led to the creation of floating homes in Copenhagen and the Maldives; smart islands in the heart of Seoul; and the world's first underwater greenhouse. \n\nOne thing is certain: in the face of climate change, we need to rethink our urbanized way of life. Will we succeed in making \"floating cities” innovative, safe, and sustainable? Could we soon be experiencing a \"blue revolution”?\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

      "content": "<article>In 1099, during the First Crusade, a multinational force of about 12,000 Christian warriors—led by figures like Godfrey of Bouillon and Raymond of Toulouse—besieged Jerusalem, then controlled by the Fatimid Caliphate. The city's formidable walls, over 50 feet high and defended by 60,000 inhabitants, posed a massive challenge. Starved of resources after a grueling march, the Crusaders turned to innovative siege warfare: massive wooden siege towers.\n\nThese wheeled behemoths, up to 60 feet tall, were constructed from scavenged timber, including dismantled ships from Jaffa. Covered in animal hides soaked in vinegar to resist fire arrows and Greek fire, the towers shielded archers and allowed troops to approach the walls undetected. The Crusaders built three: one for Raymond's southern assault and two for Godfrey's northern push.\n\nOn July 13-14, after failed initial attacks, the towers rolled forward under cover of night. Godfrey's tower, repositioned stealthily, reached the northwest wall at dawn on July 15. From its top platform, knights like Lethold of Tournai leaped onto the battlements using a drawbridge, overwhelming defenders. This breach allowed Crusaders to pour in, leading to the city's fall after 40 days of siege. The victory resulted in a brutal massacre, claiming up to 70,000 lives, and established the Kingdom of Jerusalem.\n\nSiege towers exemplified medieval engineering, turning a desperate siege into a triumph. They overcame Jerusalem's defenses through mobility, protection, and height, symbolizing the Crusaders' determination and tactical ingenuity in their quest to reclaim the Holy City.\n\n#crusader #siegewarfare #epichistory #epichistorytv</article>",
