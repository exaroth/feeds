This comprehensive biography explores one man's incredible journey through the hardship of the Cultural Revolution, to become one of the most powerful people in the world as the Supreme Leader of China.\n\nFrom his early life in Liangjiahe to his political rise through the provinces (Fujian, Zhejiang, Shanghai), we trace the key moments that shaped his governance. Learn about the seismic shifts defining the Xi Jinping era: the massive Anti-Corruption Campaign (\"Tigers and Flies\"), the abolition of term limits (2018), and the codification of Xi Jinping Thought in the constitution.\n\nGlobally, Xi Jinping is known as the architect of the ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a new Silk Road connecting Asia, Europe, and Africa. Domestically, his focus has been on Common Prosperity, tightening regulations on the Chinese tech sector (Alibaba, Tencent), and major military reforms of the People's Liberation Army (PLA).\n\nOur video examines the crucial geopolitical challenges: the South China Sea, Hong Kong National Security Law, and the intensifying tensions with the United States over Taiwan and trade. Understand the Chinese Dream and the pursuit of a global superpower status under the fifth generation of Chinese leadership. Don't miss this essential look at the modern history of the People's Republic of China (PRC).\n\nPlease subscribe here. https://www.youtube.com/@PeopleProfiles?sub_confirmation=1\nOur second channel. https://www.youtube.com/@PeopleProfilesExtra\nFollow us on Spotify. https://open.spotify.com/show/7fKALbrzEO9Q4VVvAwWHqL\nSupport us on Patreon https://patreon.com/thepeopleprofiles\nFollow us on Twitter. https://twitter.com/tpprofiles\n\nThanks for watching!

The region's economy is dominated by a powerful network of oligarchs. Critics speak of a system of mutual protection between business, politics and pro-Russian power structures. \n\nUntil the beginning of 2025, Transnistria's economy was reliant on gas from Russia. A fragile balancing act ‚Äì as some 80 percent of Transnistria's exports go to the EU. But the energy crisis that followed the gas freeze has exacerbated tensions in the region.  \n\nWhile pro-Russian actors want to expand their power, supporters of a pro-European course are focusing on greater integration into the EU. \n\nWatch the full documentary ‚ÄúTransnistria: Caught between Russia and the EU‚Äù on the DW Documentary YouTube channel. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #Russia #Moldova #Transnistria #EU  \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Largely dismissed at the time of publication, and mostly mocked by students in the fields of Political Science and IR, the book has nevertheless remained relevant. From various figures in the MAGA movement to a new generation of rightwing politicians in Europe, Huntington's theory of a world in conflict between different civilisations defined by different cultures, continues to be cited in proposals of policy and to set the agendas.\n\nIn this video I examine Huntington's theory of a clash of civilisations caused by differences in culture, and try my best to present you with a critique.\n\nThe Channel to which I will upload my conversation with Francis Fukuyama: @LesLiberables \n\nHere is a link to a pdf of Politics as a Vocation by Max Weber.

      "content": "<article>The combat school in the rainforest. It‚Äòs one of the toughest training programs run by the Foreign Legion. In the 3rd Regiment, legionnaires and the special units of friendly armies are trained under particularly harsh conditions.\n\nThe soldiers camp in the rainforest, food is rationed and there are no sanitary facilities. Unconditional obedience is mandatory, and even the smallest mistakes are severely punished. \nThe 3rd Infantry Regiment of the French Foreign Legion (3e R√©giment √âtranger d'Infanterie) has been stationed in French Guiana since 1973. It is a region that consists of 90 percent forest and is one of the rainiest areas in the world - inhospitable conditions for both the legionnaires and their equipment. \nThe fight against illegal gold prospecting is known as the \"Harpie mission\". Legionnaires comb through the rainforest before sunrise, often in the pouring rain, to track down the prospectors, who are organized in mafia-like structures and sometimes heavily armed.\nA second mission in French Guiana is called \"Titan\". In this mission, legionnaires protect the international spaceport in Kourou. They have been carrying out this task since 2008.  \nAt the training center, the CEFE (Centre d'entra√Ænement en for√™t √©quatoriale), legionnaires as well as soldiers from friendly armies are trained in combat. There are usually around 40 participants on a course, most of whom do not make it to the end. Injuries occur on a daily basis and many participants drop out due to total exhaustion or dehydration. The documentary accompanies a legionnaire and a female officer candidate in the French military as they face increasingly tough challenges every day, which repeatedly push them to their physical and mental limits. The documentary offers insights into a world that is very rarely seen by outsiders.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #rainforest #foreignlegion \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

The conversation explores how Java programming has evolved from Java 5 to Java 25, covering major shifts like the move toward immutability, the introduction of sequenced collections, streams, and unmodifiable collections.\n\nThey delve into critical design topics including encapsulation of collections, the anemic domain model anti-pattern, the controversial unsupported operation exception, and the challenges of null handling. The book includes new chapters on usage guidance and design retrospectives that reflect decades of accumulated wisdom about the Collections Framework.\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n01:19 A 19-year journey from Java 5 to Java 25\n04:41 The shift toward immutability &amp; unmodifiable collections\n07:08 Usage guidance: Ownership &amp; the anemic domain model\n17:58 Extension points &amp; the fragile base class problem\n20:41 Design retrospective: The unsupported operation exception controversy\n27:11 The Null handling mess\n29:09 A lasting achievement\n30:21 Outro\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nMaurice Naftalin &amp; Philip Wadler ‚Ä¢ Java Generics and Collections 2nd ed ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/47dOp9t\nMaurice Naftalin &amp; Philip Wadler ‚Ä¢ Java Generics and Collections 1st ed ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/42JI03i\nJoshua Bloch ‚Ä¢ Effective Java ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/4oFbdoi\nVictor Grazi &amp; Jeanne Boyarsky ‚Ä¢ Real-World Java ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/4oCEeBR\nKevlin Henney &amp; Trisha Gee ‚Ä¢ 97 Things Every Java Programmer Should Know ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3kiTwJJ\nChristian Clausen ‚Ä¢ Five Lines of Code ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3s2zjyg\nNicolai Parlog ‚Ä¢ The Java Module System ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3xFggR4\n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.instagram.com/goto_con\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#Java #JavaGenerics #JavaCollections #Immutability #Unmodifiability #Encapsulation #Java25 #Java5 #Null #NullHandling #Getters #Setters #AnemicDomainModel #JavaProgramming #TodayInTech #SoftwareDevelopment #SoftwareEngineering #Programming #MauriceNaftalin #StuartMarks #PhilipWadler #BookClub\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

In this episode of An Optimist‚Äôs Guide to the Planet, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau travels the world to meet people transforming waste into creation. From state-of-the-art incinerators to mushrooms that eat construction material and an effort to clean one of the world‚Äôs most sacred rivers, they are changing the narrative to show how waste is actually a valuable raw material.\n\n--------\nLike this video?

      "content": "<article>On September 15, Jimmy Kimmel‚Äôs late-night show opening monologue included comments about the shooting of right-wing media figure Charlie Kirk, and how the \"Maga gang\" was \"desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them.‚Äù \n\nSoon after, Brendan Carr, the chair of the FCC and an appointee of President Donald Trump, appeared on a conservative podcast and threatened to act against ABC and its parent company, Disney, for Kimmel‚Äôs remarks. On September 17, ABC and Disney suspended ‚ÄúJimmy Kimmel Live!‚Äù \n\nKimmel‚Äôs suspension launched a national debate and protest around freedom of speech and satire. From celebrities like Wanda Sykes to Republicans like Sen. Ted Cruz, people from across the spectrum weighed in on the decision. The show returned days later on September 23, but the FCC‚Äôs actions left many questioning whether Kimmel‚Äôs First Amendment rights were violated.\n\nThis incident is just one of many instances of the gray areas of free speech making its way into the news cycle. In this video, we take a look at the origins of the ‚Äúinalienable right‚Äù to free speech, how the Supreme Court has determined the boundaries of speech (including hate speech), and where free speech might be headed next with a six-justice majority of Republican appointees. As this issue continues to evolve, social media is one of the latest modes of communication adding new layers of complexity to this age-old debate.\n\nSubscribe to our channel and turn on notifications (üîî) so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.
