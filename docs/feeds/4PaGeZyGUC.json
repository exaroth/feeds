      "content": "<article>Minnesota has become ground zero for the biggest federal immigration operation in US history. Thousands of immigration officers are patrolling the streets of Minneapolis, leading to the death of one anti-ICE protester, Renee Nicole Good, and setting off a massive swirl of protests. \n\nVice President JD Vance visited Minneapolis late this week — showing his support for law enforcement, and sending a political message at the same time: that this White House is doubling down on its war against blue cities, and Minneapolis specifically.\n\nNow, President Trump has subpoenaed the state’s top Democratic officials, alleging they were impeding federal immigration enforcement actions. The Justice Department has promised to arrest anyone who impedes the immigration enforcement actions, and a Trump official accused some state officials of “terrorism.” With Minnesota now in a full-blown conflict with the Trump administration, the Democratic state leadership is front and center in the standoff.\n\nIn this video episode of Vox’s Today, Explained podcast, host Astead Herndon interviews Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison about the Somali fraud scandal that first brought on the ICE surge in his state. Did Democratic officials do enough to staunch the fraud? What more could they have done to cut the fraud off at its knees? And now that ICE is in Minnesota, what more can they do? Are the courts the only recourse, if President Trump does as he has been threatening, and invokes the Insurrection Act? \n\n00:00 Intro \n01:21 The fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good \n03:26 The DOJ going after Democratic state officials\n07:38  Minneapolis protests against ICE\n10:17 Trump's threat to impose the Insurrection Act in Minneapolis\n12:30 \"Defund the Police\" and \"Abolish ICE\"\n16:41: Is Minneapolis a sanctuary city?\n19:19 The fallout of the Somali fraud scandal in Minnesota\n23:40 The fallout from the scandal on Democratic leadership\n24:29 Pushing back on the Trump administration\n\nToday, Explained is a daily news podcast from Vox that explains one story in the news or culture each day, while doing their best not to bum you out.

And now, it’s headed to the Supreme Court in a case called Trump v. Barbara.\n\nFor well over 100 years, birthright citizenship has been enshrined in the Constitution,with the understanding that anyone born on US soil is granted citizenship. \n\nBut in Trump v. Barbara, the administration claims that the law applies to those who are not just born in the United States but also “owe allegiance” to it.\n\nThe plaintiffs represent a group of people affected by Trump’s executive order, and their argument is simple: Leave birthright citizenship alone. \n\nWatch the full second episode of The Docket exclusively on Vox's Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/posts/docket-trumps-on-148945751\n\nSubscribe to our channel and turn on notifications (🔔) so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

      "content": "<article>Cities, floating on the ocean. It sounds like science fiction, but could soon become reality. Researchers are developing concepts for life on water - on a grand scale. Initial tests are promising. Is success a genuine possibility?\n\nOver half of humanity lives near the coast. But in many places, flooding is a constant threat, forcing entire populations to search for new habitats. Paradoxically, these could be located directly on the water. \n\nCities, floating on the ocean. It sounds like science fiction, but could soon become reality. International research has long been developing concepts for life on water. Now, new designs — from temporary huts to affordable student dormitories to smart high-tech villas — seem to hold promise. Could huge numbers of people soon be living in \"floating cities”?\n\nThis futuristic living concept could have some real perks. Artificial islands can adjust to changing water levels. Modular city ‘fleets’ can change location like ships. Flexible floating neighborhoods can expand or move closer together. Efficient water management systems could supply the city with food and energy. \n\nBut where floating cities drop anchor, questions arise: What laws do they fall under? What about environmental protection? How do they interact with the ecosystem? And how can they be protected from tsunamis? The search for answers has led to the creation of floating homes in Copenhagen and the Maldives; smart islands in the heart of Seoul; and the world's first underwater greenhouse. \n\nOne thing is certain: in the face of climate change, we need to rethink our urbanized way of life. Will we succeed in making \"floating cities” innovative, safe, and sustainable? Could we soon be experiencing a \"blue revolution”?\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

But the 40th Army (officially \"Limited Contingent of Soviet Troops in Afghanistan\") soon found themselves embroiled in a counter insurgency which they weren't prepared for. The tactical successes and increasingly brutal methods against the guerilla mujahedeen tactics didn't win hearts and minds of the Afghan population, however. \n\n» SUPPORT US \nhttps://patreon.com/realtimehistory \nhttps://nebula.tv/realtimehistory \n\n» THANK YOU TO OUR CO-PRODUCERS \nMike Gloudemans, George Durrett, Luis Gonzalez, Mike Cumings, Jr., Charles Shananaquet II, Joel Sanchez, shane cawthon, Andrew Thomas Mooney, Chris Rohde, Bruce D, Jim Frame, Glenn Sugden, Lisa Anderson, George Haramundanis, G S, Kempf Mario, jhgBo8jigr hzufjkl, Gayle Elizabeth, Glenn G Webb, Stephen D Nugent PsyD, Daniel L Garza, Chris Daley, Simen Røste, Amy Williams, Jim F Barlow, Taylor Allen, Adam Smith, Josh Bruder, Konstantin Bredyuk, Richard L Benkin, Matt, Rob Carle, Murray Godfrey, Jan, Gage Manthey, Theodore Patrick Shannon, Bruce G.

The discussion reveals that effects are composable operations that encapsulate side effects and defer execution, giving developers the right handles to manage unpredictability through compiler-checked types.\nThe authors explain how ZIO tracks three critical types: outputs, failures, and environmental requirements, enabling better testing with mock clocks and random number generators.\n\nThey share their intentional avoidance of intimidating functional programming terminology like \"monads\" proving you don't need mathematical foundations to understand effects. The conversation covers effect systems' expansion beyond Scala into TypeScript, Kotlin, and new languages like Unison and Roc, and how their collaborative writing process with strict constraints like 47-character line limits - created a coherent 100-page book readable in portrait mode on your phone.\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n03:33 From 250 pages to 100: The art of distillation\n09:38 What are effects, really?\n13:58 Managing unpredictability with the right tools\n18:37 Beyond Scala: The growing effect oriented ecosystem\n29:58 Forbidden words &amp; mathematical foundations\n33:08 Collaboration &amp; constraints\n36:08 Outro\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nBill Frasure, Bruce Eckel, James Ward • Effect Oriented Programming • https://amzn.to/4sO6wLV\nBruce Eckel &amp; Svetlana Isakova • Atomic Kotlin • https://amzn.to/4qT1gEQ\nBruce Eckel • Thinking in C++ • https://amzn.to/4qnrIGW\nAndrew Harmel-Law • Facilitating Software Architecture • https://amzn.eu/d/5kZKVfU\nSam Keen • Clean Architecture with Python • https://amzn.to/4pBT5g0\nEric Evans • Domain-Driven Design • https://amzn.to/3tnGhwm\nMaciej «MJ» Jedrzejewski • Master Software Architecture • https://leanpub.com/master-software-architecture\n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.instagram.com/goto_con\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#EffectOrientedProgramming #Scala #ZIO #Kotlin #Roclang #Unisonlang #TypeScript #SoftwareEngineering #FunctionalProgramming #Programming #TodayInTech #BillFrasure #BruceEckel #JamesWard #AndrewHarmelLaw #BookClub\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

      "content": "<article>When the sun goes down, India's megacity most intense side comes to light. Queer subculture, everyday slum life and spiritual celebrity culture - Mumbai nightlife could hardly be more diverse. Anything is possible, here!\n\nMumbai: India's financial, commercial and entertainment center. This is the New York of South Asia, according to many of its inhabitants. Here, they say, anything is possible and hard work pays off. Like New York City, Mumbai is a melting pot of different cultures and lifestyles - and a city that never sleeps. Between red carpets and slums, this documentary shows a city full of contrasts.\n\nReporter Johannes Hano explores the night with a motorcycle gang. He experiences Bollywood glamour, celebrates an Indian wedding and immerses himself in the harsh life of the slums. He rides through the chaotic night-time streets in a three-wheeler with queer Muslim drag artist Zeesh, and talks to him on a red carpet. Zeesh speaks openly about his initially difficult relationship with his mother after coming out, diversity in India and his path to the cover of Indian Vogue. Rochelle Pinto from Vogue India describes the fashion industry’s take on what Zeesh embodies in his nightly stage shows: the shift towards more diversity and a different set of attitudes.\n  \nBut change is also a question of self-empowerment. Take Amruta Mane, for example: at the age of 21, she founded a motorcycle driving school for women called Women on Wheels. In doing so, she's creating spaces for independence - in a society where self-determination is often not a given.\n\nRadhe Maa has a somewhat different community. Her followers say she's a deity (godwoman) and she's as revered as she is controversial. She's omnipresent in Mumbai: posters bearing her image look down on the city streets.\n\nBut not all faces are so visible, especially at night when most people are asleep. In Dharavi, one of the largest slums in the world, reporter Johannes Hano meets a baker. And in Dhobi Ghat, the largest open-air laundry in the world, he visits a laundry worker at home - and looks on, as he goes about his tough job.\n \nMumbai - encounters with people whose courage, creativity and diversity are inspiring.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #india #mumbai \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.
