The discussion reveals that effects are composable operations that encapsulate side effects and defer execution, giving developers the right handles to manage unpredictability through compiler-checked types.\nThe authors explain how ZIO tracks three critical types: outputs, failures, and environmental requirements, enabling better testing with mock clocks and random number generators.\n\nThey share their intentional avoidance of intimidating functional programming terminology like \"monads\" proving you don't need mathematical foundations to understand effects. The conversation covers effect systems' expansion beyond Scala into TypeScript, Kotlin, and new languages like Unison and Roc, and how their collaborative writing process with strict constraints like 47-character line limits - created a coherent 100-page book readable in portrait mode on your phone.\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n03:33 From 250 pages to 100: The art of distillation\n09:38 What are effects, really?\n13:58 Managing unpredictability with the right tools\n18:37 Beyond Scala: The growing effect oriented ecosystem\n29:58 Forbidden words &amp; mathematical foundations\n33:08 Collaboration &amp; constraints\n36:08 Outro\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nBill Frasure, Bruce Eckel, James Ward • Effect Oriented Programming • https://amzn.to/4sO6wLV\nBruce Eckel &amp; Svetlana Isakova • Atomic Kotlin • https://amzn.to/4qT1gEQ\nBruce Eckel • Thinking in C++ • https://amzn.to/4qnrIGW\nAndrew Harmel-Law • Facilitating Software Architecture • https://amzn.eu/d/5kZKVfU\nSam Keen • Clean Architecture with Python • https://amzn.to/4pBT5g0\nEric Evans • Domain-Driven Design • https://amzn.to/3tnGhwm\nMaciej «MJ» Jedrzejewski • Master Software Architecture • https://leanpub.com/master-software-architecture\n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.instagram.com/goto_con\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#EffectOrientedProgramming #Scala #ZIO #Kotlin #Roclang #Unisonlang #TypeScript #SoftwareEngineering #FunctionalProgramming #Programming #TodayInTech #BillFrasure #BruceEckel #JamesWard #AndrewHarmelLaw #BookClub\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

      "content": "<article>Dive into the life of Michelangelo Buonarroti, the Renaissance genius whose “divine hands” transformed the history of art. This full-length biography documentary explores the man behind the Sistine Chapel ceiling, the David sculpture, and some of the most powerful religious art ever created.\n\nFrom his harsh upbringing in Florence to his rise as the most sought-after artist in Renaissance Italy, this Michelangelo documentary reveals the struggles, obsessions, and rivalries that shaped his masterpieces. Discover how he battled popes, princes and patrons, endured exhausting physical labour on the Sistine Chapel, and pushed sculpture and painting to new extremes.\n\nLearn the secrets of Michelangelo’s artistic techniques, his revolutionary understanding of human anatomy, and the deep faith and inner turmoil that drove his greatest works. We uncover the politics of the Vatican, the pressures of working for powerful popes, and the personal cost of his relentless pursuit of perfection.\n\nIf you’re interested in Renaissance history, art history, Catholic Church history, or in-depth biography documentaries, this Michelangelo film is for you.\n\nPlease subscribe here. https://www.youtube.com/@PeopleProfiles?sub_confirmation=1\nOur second channel. https://www.youtube.com/@PeopleProfilesExtra\nFollow us on Spotify. https://open.spotify.com/show/7fKALbrzEO9Q4VVvAwWHqL\nSupport us on Patreon https://patreon.com/thepeopleprofiles\nFollow us on Twitter. https://twitter.com/tpprofiles\n\nThanks for watching!

      "content": "<article>When the sun goes down, India's megacity most intense side comes to light. Queer subculture, everyday slum life and spiritual celebrity culture - Mumbai nightlife could hardly be more diverse. Anything is possible, here!\n\nMumbai: India's financial, commercial and entertainment center. This is the New York of South Asia, according to many of its inhabitants. Here, they say, anything is possible and hard work pays off. Like New York City, Mumbai is a melting pot of different cultures and lifestyles - and a city that never sleeps. Between red carpets and slums, this documentary shows a city full of contrasts.\n\nReporter Johannes Hano explores the night with a motorcycle gang. He experiences Bollywood glamour, celebrates an Indian wedding and immerses himself in the harsh life of the slums. He rides through the chaotic night-time streets in a three-wheeler with queer Muslim drag artist Zeesh, and talks to him on a red carpet. Zeesh speaks openly about his initially difficult relationship with his mother after coming out, diversity in India and his path to the cover of Indian Vogue. Rochelle Pinto from Vogue India describes the fashion industry’s take on what Zeesh embodies in his nightly stage shows: the shift towards more diversity and a different set of attitudes.\n  \nBut change is also a question of self-empowerment. Take Amruta Mane, for example: at the age of 21, she founded a motorcycle driving school for women called Women on Wheels. In doing so, she's creating spaces for independence - in a society where self-determination is often not a given.\n\nRadhe Maa has a somewhat different community. Her followers say she's a deity (godwoman) and she's as revered as she is controversial. She's omnipresent in Mumbai: posters bearing her image look down on the city streets.\n\nBut not all faces are so visible, especially at night when most people are asleep. In Dharavi, one of the largest slums in the world, reporter Johannes Hano meets a baker. And in Dhobi Ghat, the largest open-air laundry in the world, he visits a laundry worker at home - and looks on, as he goes about his tough job.\n \nMumbai - encounters with people whose courage, creativity and diversity are inspiring.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #india #mumbai \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Donate to FRONTLINE now: https://bit.ly/47DFzCb\n\nAnd support your local PBS station here: https://www.pbs.org/donate\n\nThe Emmy Award-winning documentary “The Luanda Leaks” — part of a worldwide investigation with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists that drew on a trove of more than 700,000 leaked documents — revealed how Isabel dos Santos made hundreds of millions of dollars thanks in part to her father’s longtime control of Angola’s government.\n\nDespite a history of favorable deals with the Angolan government, dos Santos said she made her fortune on her own merit — and that corruption charges that were levied against her were part of a politically motivated “witch hunt.”\n\nAs part of the ICIJ’s reporting, 120 journalists from 36 media organizations in 20 countries spent months examining and verifying dos Santos’ leaked financial and business records, and revealed a paper trail of how she benefited from her position — and how big-name American accounting and consulting firms helped make it possible.\n\nRead more about developments in the U.S. after the film aired: https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/luanda-leaks-isabel-dos-santos-barred-from-us/ \n“The Luanda Leaks” is a BBC Current Affairs production for WGBH/FRONTLINE and BBC.

      "content": "<article>Greenland should become part of the United States — at least, that’s the opinion of US President Donald Trump. Talk of the US acquiring, or perhaps even seizing, the world's largest island with its vast mineral wealth has been causing concern not only among Greenlanders.\n\nDenmark is outraged, as Greenland — a former colony — is still a semi-autonomous territory of the Danish Realm. But for how long? Many Greenlanders want to take control of their own future.\nNukannguaq Zeeb was born on the island and feels deeply connected to the island’s cultural traditions of hunting and fishing. He also coaches Greenland’s national soccer team, a sport introduced by Danish colonialists. He’s critical of Denmark’s ongoing influence. \"To be honest, we are currently under Danish rule and not an independent country,” he says. Trump's neocolonial ambitions came as a shock to him.\n\nGreenland did not gain any autonomy until 1953, when it became a Danish district. To this day, it remains closely associated with Denmark, both politically and economically. Many Greenlanders are pinning their hopes on the rich natural resources still hidden beneath the ice. As global warming accelerates, they could soon become accessible — drawing attention not only from the US administration.\n\nThe White Mountain mine lies north of the capital Nuuk and can only be reached by boat or helicopter. International investors are extracting anorthosite, a mineral used to produce insulation material and glass fiber, among other things.\n\nNiels Ole is one of the few Greenlandic foremen in the mine — many skilled workers here come from abroad. Greenland’s weak education system means that many young people drop out before graduating. Social worker Ane Pipaluk looks after them. They live in shared housing and often come from families struggling with unemployment and alcoholism.\n\nNegotiating a path between old and new dependencies poses a major challenge for Greenland. Niels Ole dreams of more autonomy for his homeland. He says, \"It's the dream of many Greenlanders.”\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #greenland #trump #denmark \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Use my link https://www.tailorstore.com/patrickboyle so you can take a look whenever it suits you.\n\nIn a highly unusual move - the Department of Justice has opened a criminal investigation into Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell. As America faces a high-stakes standoff over the future of the Federal Reserve, the traditional independence of the nation’s central bank is under direct attack. This video explores the intensifying war between the White House and Fed Chair, over a $2.5 billion headquarters renovation. We break down why many experts believe this probe is a mere pretext intended to bully the Fed into slashing interest rates to rock-bottom levels, potentially putting the long-term stability of the U.S. economy at risk for short-term political gains.\n\nWe also take a closer look at the \"agents of chaos\" Bill Pulte, Judge Jeanine Pirro and the \"shadow\" economic strategies currently in play, from the FHFA’s controversial bond-buying programs to the proposed 10% cap on credit card interest rates. From the strategic blockade in the Senate by Senator Thom Tillis to the \"Miran Limbo\" on the Fed’s Board of Governors, we unpack the technical and political maneuvers being used to bypass Jerome Powell. Is the U.S. headed toward a \"banana republic\" risk premium, or can its institutional guardrails hold firm? Join us as we examine the true price of a political Fed and what it means for the future of the dollar.\n\nPatrick's Books:\nStatistics For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3eerLA0\nDerivatives For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3cjsyPF\nCorporate Finance:  https://amzn.to/3fn3rvC \n\nWays To Support The Channel\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/PatrickBoyleOnFinance\nBuy Me a Coffee: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/patrickboyle\n\nVisit our website: https://www.onfinance.org\nFollow Patrick on Twitter Here: https://bsky.app/profile/pboyle.bsky.social\n\nBusiness Inquiries ➡️ sponsors@onfinance.org\n\nPatrick Boyle On Finance Podcast:\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/7uhrWlDvxzy9hLoW0EYf0b\nApple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/patrick-boyle-on-finance/id1547740313\nGoogle Podcasts: https://tinyurl.com/62862nve\n\nJoin this channel to support making this content:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCASM0cgfkJxQ1ICmRilfHLw/join</article>",

      "content": "<article>More and more city dwellers are collecting food in the asphalt jungle. They harvest herbs by the roadside and grow wild vegetables in cracks in the concrete. For these modern foragers and hunters, the food is free, tasty and more varied than in the supermarket.\n\nChristian Amys is an urban foraging professional. He forages for fresh food in his hometown of Brighton. For him, the English coastal city is an urban Garden of Eden. Christian finds wild vegetables and herbs in places where most people would never expect to find food. The 42-year-old only spends a few pounds a week on food from the supermarket: \"I want to be independent and don't like to rely on the supermarket. I like to forage on my doorstep because it's nice to know where my food comes from.\"\n\nChristian Amys worked as a top chef for 20 years before becoming an urban forager. Today, he shows others where to find wild fennel, hogweed, pineapple weed and dandelion heads and how to use them in food preparation. Christian now even supplies top restaurants and cocktail bars with his wild delicacies.\n\nAlexis Goertz also looks for her food on the roadside and in parks. The Canadian has lived in Berlin for over 10 years. She preserves what she collects using the centuries-old technique of fermentation. Whether it's evening primrose capers, wild garlic kimchi or goutweed sauerkraut - for Alexis, fermentation is about more than just preservation: \"Above all, fermentation makes food tastier and easier to digest. And I've just become addicted to it.\"\n\nAlexis regularly invites people to join her on urban herb walks and explains what’s edible - and what’s poisonous. The 33-year-old is all about rediscovering nature in the city: \"Berlin is fantastic for foraging for food. The diversity is immense. Not just among the people, but also in nature.\"\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #urbanforaging #food \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), nearly half of all American adults now live with diet-related chronic diseases.   \n\nMore than half the average diet in the U.S. now consists of ultra-processed food. But for some younger, lower-income communities, ultra-processed food can typically make up as much as 80% of their diet. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #mediterraneandiet \n______\n\nWe kindly ask viewers to read and stick to the DW netiquette policy on our channel: https://p.dw.com/p/MF1G</article>",

      "content": "<article>In the summer of 2014, fields and coal mines in eastern Ukraine became a crime scene. The wreckage of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was scattered across 12 square kilometers. Evidence of a war crime that remains unpunished to this day.\n\nOn July 17, 2014, the Malaysian Boeing 777 with flight number MH17 was en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, carrying 283 passengers and 15 crew members. The plane was shot down by a Russian BUK missile as it flew over eastern Ukraine, where war broke out in 2014. \n\nThis documentary reflects on the tragedy of MH17. The film consists of archive material, intercepted telephone conversations, open-source material, excerpts from television broadcasts, and staged fictional episodes. By combining different materials into a comprehensive collage, the film sheds light on the crash and examines the connections between propaganda, justice, punishment, and the far-reaching consequences of actions. \n\nWhile the film revolves around the story of MH17, it also approaches the subject on a very personal level — including a meeting with a Dutch relative of one of the victims on the plane. By making connections to what is happening in Ukraine today, the film sheds light on the global repercussions of this crime. \n\nThe film views the tragic events of July 17, 2014 from different perspectives and at different points in time, linking the crimes of the past with the present.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #flight #boeing777 \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

For Soviet naval planners, a nightmare scenario was unfolding. If war broke out, American submarines could find and destroy Soviet submarines before they had a chance to strike back.\n\nSimply catching up to American stealth wasn't an option. It wasn't a technology that could easily be copied, it was the result of decades of precision manufacturing, relentless quality control, advances in materials science, and industrial discipline that the Soviet system couldn't support at the time. It would take decades to catch up.\n\nFaced with a widening stealth technology gap, Soviet planners stopped trying to play hide and seek under the oceans, and instead chose raw power. They would bet everything on speed, depth, maneuverability and brute force.\n\nIn 1960, the Soviet Union launched their most ambitious submarine programs in history. Project 705 ‘Lira’, later designated as the ‘Alfa Class’ submarine by NATO, was a nuclear-powered attack submarine capable of outrunning torpedoes, executing extreme maneuvers, and diving deeper than anything the world had ever seen. Built with a revolutionary liquid-metal nuclear reactor, advanced automation, and a titanium hull, this machine represented a generational leap in engineering.\nIt wasn’t just a faster submarine, it was a radical attempt to rewrite the rules of underwater warfare.\n\nWhen Western intelligence realized what the Soviets were building, it caused immediate panic. A submarine that could outrun torpedoes and dive beyond existing weapons threatened to upend NATO’s entire anti-submarine strategy, forcing the West into a sudden scramble to catch up.\n\nBut Project 705, a super submarine meant to restore balance beneath the seas, would prove to be far more than the Soviets ever bargained for.\n\nThanks for watching!</article>",
