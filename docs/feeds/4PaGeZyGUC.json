      "content": "<article>In June 2024, Joanna lost her 20-year-old son Philippos. He was beaten up by another young man, following his sister's high school graduation party. Two days later, he died. The alleged perpetrator, a 19-year-old Syrian, was arrested.\n\nA summer evening that ended in disaster. After his sister's high school graduation party, 20-year-old Philippos was brutally attacked in the German town of Bad Oeynhausen.\n\nAs his mother Joanna was mourning her son, Philippos became headline news. Before long, his death was used to reignite the debate on Germany’s asylum policy. Both in the German parliament, and in the media. \n\nPhilippos' mother did not participate in this discussion. For her, the nationality of the perpetrator was irrelevant. \"The doctor who fought for my child's life is Syrian,\" she said. \"So is my hairdresser. And me? I'm Polish.”\n\nInstead, Joanna, who is deeply religious, tried to find a way to deal with her anger, rage, despair, and grief. She sought advice from a prison psychologist and a priest: Why did Philippos have to die? Am I allowed to be angry with the perpetrator? Do I have to forgive him?\n\nShe sat opposite the defendant at the Bielefeld Regional Court, endured the police reports and witness statements, listened to the autopsy results from the forensic pathologists, and witnessed the images of her dead child on the dissection table.\n\n\"Even hearing the incomprehensible, the painful, knowing how Philippos died... I owe that to my child,\" she said. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

They explore what SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) is and why it enables dramatic performance improvements for specific computational tasks, discuss when assembly language programming is justified versus using compiler intrinsics, and examine the challenges of writing vectorized algorithms. Dan shares insights from his career optimizing image analysis software and explains how understanding low-level architecture can improve code quality even when writing in higher-level languages.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nDaniel Kusswurm • Modern X86 Assembly Language Programming v3 • https://amzn.to/44hIVZf\nDaniel Kusswurm • Modern X86 Assembly Language Programming v2 • https://amzn.to/3LJlMIZ\nDaniel Kusswurm • Modern X86 Assembly Language Programming v1 • https://amzn.to/43DPANj\nDaniel Kusswurm • Modern Arm Assembly Language Programming • https://amzn.to/4rbyH6M\nDaniel Kusswurm • Practical C++ STL Programming • https://amzn.to/4ickAdq\nDaniel Kusswurm • Modern Parallel Programming with C++ and Assembly Language • https://amzn.to/4o5J3SF\n\n\nBluesky (https://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com) \nTwitter (https://twitter.com/GOTOcon) \nInstagram (https://www.instagram.com/goto_con) \nLinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-) \nFacebook (https://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences) \n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

But history is only half the story. The real question is why the United States cares so much about Greenland right now.\n\nAs climate change melts Arctic ice, Greenland is no longer just the world’s largest island—it’s a strategic goldmine. New shipping routes, untapped rare earth minerals, and massive energy potential are turning the Arctic into the next great power competition zone. The U.S., China, and Russia are all watching closely, but America’s interest in Greenland goes back decades, from Cold War military bases to recent, very public attempts to increase influence.\n\n0:00 Introduction \n1:23 Prehistory \n2:50 Viking Age\n7:50 Rediscovery\n9:21 Polar Exploration\n11:30 World War Two\n13:35 The Cold War\n19:14 Modern Era\n\nYou can now become a History Hit member right here on YouTube!

      "content": "<article>Filmed in secret, this documentary is a behind-the-scenes look at the \"Woman, Life, Freedom” uprising in Iran. The story begins a few weeks after the death of Jina Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish student who died on 16 September 2022.\n\nShe had allowed a few strands of hair to escape from her veil. Members of the Iranian morality police beat her so severely that she died of her injuries. The regime in Tehran has denied all responsibility for her death, which triggered nationwide mass protests under a slogan that echoed all around the world: \"Woman, Life, Freedom”.\n\nIranian filmmaker Shorresh Afkari filmed in secret, smuggling the footage out of the country to a colleague in France. His documentary gives a voice to people who, like large sections of the Iranian population, have run out of strength and patience.\n\nFor example, the film observes a young couple who dream of being able to express their love openly and in complete freedom. We also meet a taxi driver, who ends up in prison as a bitter opponent of the regime. His mother tries to protect him at all costs. A painter continues to practise her art despite censorship; a doctor secretly treats demonstrators. A young man is prepared to do anything for cash, even sell one of his kidneys. Just like men who dare to protest, women who show their hair in public and publicly oppose the regime still face harsh punishment, including the death penalty. For this reason, many interviewees speak off-camera to protect their anonymity.\n\nThe widespread protests and mass demonstrations that began shortly before the end of 2025 and continue to this day show that large parts of the population no longer support the regime in Tehran — a regime that continues to respond with brutality against the people of Iran.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #iran #protest #womanlifefreedom \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

A holy man stopped by and told them of a Magic Mountain, east of north and north of east, where they’d find their most meaningful treasures. But, he said, only a true hero could complete the journey. Malay Bera shares the Bengali tale of Kiranmala's quest.\n\nLesson by Malay Bera, directed by Héloïse Dorsan-Rachet.\n\nAlthough this folktale exists in multiple oral variants across the Bengali-speaking world, this video is based on a variant akin to the better-known literary version, “Kironmala\", from Thakurmar Jhuli (1907), an anthology of Bengali folktales collected by Dakshinaranjan Mitra Majumdar in the early 20th century.\n\nSupport Our Non-Profit Mission\n----------------------------------------------\nSupport us on Patreon: http://bit.ly/TEDEdPatreon\nCheck out our merch: http://bit.ly/TEDEDShop\n----------------------------------------------\n\nConnect With Us\n----------------------------------------------\nSign up for our newsletter: http://bit.ly/TEDEdNewsletter\nFollow us on Facebook: http://bit.ly/TEDEdFacebook\nFind us on Twitter: http://bit.ly/TEDEdTwitter\nPeep us on Instagram: http://bit.ly/TEDEdInstagram\n----------------------------------------------\n\nKeep Learning\n----------------------------------------------\nView full lesson: https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-princess-who-conquered-magic-mountain-malay-bera\nDig deeper with additional resources: \n\nAnimator's website: https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-princess-who-conquered-magic-mountain-malay-bera/digdeeper\n----------------------------------------------\n\nThank you so much to our patrons for your support!

      "content": "<article>Malcolm X remains one of the most powerful and controversial figures in American history. This full Malcolm X documentary explores his life, ideas and legacy, from his troubled early years and prison conversion to his rise as a leading voice in the civil rights movement and the emergence of Black Power.\n\nIn this in depth biographical documentary, we trace how Malcolm X transformed from an outspoken Nation of Islam minister into a global human rights activist who challenged America’s racial order. Featuring archival footage, expert historical analysis and detailed biography, the film examines his most important speeches, his break with the Nation of Islam, his pilgrimage to Mecca, and his evolving views on race, Black nationalism and unity.\n\nWe investigate how Malcolm X’s radical message helped shape the Black Power movement, influenced groups like the Black Panther Party, and forced America to confront its history of racism, segregation and violence. This Malcolm X biography places his story within the wider struggle for Black freedom and civil rights in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nIf you are interested in Black history, racial politics and the people who changed the world, this Malcolm X and Black Power documentary offers a comprehensive, historically grounded account of a revolutionary life.\n\nPlease subscribe here. https://www.youtube.com/@PeopleProfiles?sub_confirmation=1\nOur second channel. https://www.youtube.com/@PeopleProfilesExtra\nFollow us on Spotify. https://open.spotify.com/show/7fKALbrzEO9Q4VVvAwWHqL\nSupport us on Patreon https://patreon.com/thepeopleprofiles\nFollow us on Twitter. https://twitter.com/tpprofiles\n\nThanks for watching!

      "content": "<article>Carsten Breuer is Inspector General of the German Armed Forces, and thus the highest-ranking soldier in Germany. He says that Russia will be ready for a military conflict with the West in just a few years.\n\nThe documentary follows Carsten Breuer on camera for nine months. Filmmakers accompany him to a meeting with Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD), as well as on trips to southern Lebanon, Ukraine, and the USA. The result is a portrait of the German government's top military advisor that also provides deep insights into the German security apparatus.\n\nWhere the military meets politics, Carsten Breuer is redefining the role of Inspector General. Unlike his predecessors, he seeks out the public eye to get his messages across. In detailed newspaper interviews, on talk shows, in conversations with citizens, he drives his points home: The Bundeswehr and society must get ready for war.\n\nMeanwhile, the German Armed Forces are taking part in defense exercises in Lithuania designed to strengthen NATO’s eastern flank. A German brigade there is expected to grow to around 5,000 soldiers by 2027 - posted as a deterrent against Russia.\n\nAt the brigade headquarters in Vilnius, General Breuer receives a military briefing and inspects a military exercise from the hatch of an armored personnel carrier. Suddenly, the exercise is interrupted, and military radio communications are cut off. \n\nA Russian reconnaissance aircraft has apparently been spotted in the airspace above. Incidents like this have been increasing in recent months. Cyberattacks, sabotage of military facilities, destroyed undersea cables, and drone flights - according to Breuer, these are all Putin's tests to gauge defense capabilities and resilience. From Russia's perspective, war with the West has long been underway.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

      "content": "<article>The Matterhorn is one of the world’s most famous mountains — and amongst the deadliest. Since it was first ascended in 1865, over 600 climbers have lost their lives on the peak.\n\nDespite modern infrastructure and global awareness of the risks, tragedy strikes the Matterhorn again and again. This film asks why so many climbers misjudge the risks. Death on the Matterhorn follows mountain guide and head of rescue operations, Anjan Truffer, up to Solvay Bivouac — one of the mountain's high-altitude huts. It shows how Edith Lehner, warden of the nearby Hörnli Hut, lives with the losses. The crew also accompanies climber Meli Rüfenacht on her first ascent of the Matterhorn — one year after she herself witnessed a fatal fall.\n\nThis documentary takes a look beyond the physical risks that come with mountain climbing to explore the psychological toll. How do families cope with the sudden losses? How do rescue crews live with the constant exposure to death and trauma? And — with more climbers than ever attempting the ascent without proper preparation — what role is social media playing? Death on the Matterhorn examines both the pull and the perils of mountaineering — and comes with a clear warning: In the high alps, even the smallest mistake can end in death.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #matterhorn #climbing #mountains \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

What starts as a discussion about the EU AI Act quickly reveals a deeper truth: the real challenge isn't regulatory compliance - it's fundamental engineering practices.\n\nLarysa argues that quality AI systems require robust MLOps, comprehensive documentation, and proper data governance, whether regulation mandates it or not. Drawing from frameworks like CRISP-ML and the Machine Learning Canvas, the book provides practical checklists and methodologies for taking AI projects from prototype to production. Written partially in Ukraine during wartime, this \"battle-tested\" guide addresses the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders, offering a common language for building sustainable AI systems.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nLarysa Visengeriyeva • The AI Engineer's Guide to Surviving the EU AI Act • https://amzn.to/42SKOuU\nLakshmanan, Robinson &amp; Munn • Machine Learning Design Patterns • https://amzn.to/4ox4Eos\nPhil Winder • Reinforcement Learning • https://amzn.to/3t1S1VZ\nDiana Montalion • Learning Systems Thinking • https://amzn.to/3ZpycdJ\nBernd Rücker • Practical Process Automation • https://amzn.to/3cs3BSH\nLauren Maffeo • Designing Data Governance from the Ground Up • https://amzn.to/3QhIlnV\nKatharine Jarmul • Practical Data Privacy • https://amzn.to/46XPrns\nZhamak Dehghani • Data Mesh • https://amzn.to/3tTCwAC\nKate Stanley &amp; Mickael Maison • Kafka Connect • https://amzn.to/40Jq5Jz\n\n\nBluesky (https://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com) \nTwitter (https://twitter.com/GOTOcon) \nInstagram (https://www.instagram.com/goto_con) \nLinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-) \nFacebook (https://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences) \n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
