      "content": "<article>For a cow to produce milk, she must give birth to a calf. Female calves later become dairy cows themselves, while male calves are surplus to the dairy industry’s requirements. They’re packed into trucks and suffer in transit on their way to fattening facilities.\n\nCows must calve once a year to produce milk. However, male calves are unwanted, considered waste products of the dairy industry. They’re often sent to fattening farms, mostly outside the EU. A farmer, a scientist and a butcher want to change this. Instead of sending the animals to factory farms where they’re fattened with soy or corn, the bull calves are sent to the pastures and alpine meadows of the Alps.\n \nAlong with a small group of farmers, restaurateurs and retailers, dairy farmer Marcel Renz is trying to change the dairy system in southern Germany. He wants to improve animal welfare, shorten transport distances and produce good quality meat that customers are willing to pay a little more for.\n\nFor people who buy their meat from butcher Hannes Hönegger, this is a positive. The butcher works with small, traditional organic farms that rely on what’s known as dual-purpose breeds, animals not bred solely for performance. Here, cows and calves are suitable for both milk and meat production, just as they were in the past. They feed almost exclusively on what grows in the pastures. In this way, they also contribute to the protection of nature in the Alps - from the Allgäu to South Tyrol.\n \nThomas Zanon's bull calves are among the lucky ones. No long journeys, no fattening with soya or maize. Instead, they graze on his mountain pasture - a small herd that he’s rescued from the dairy industry. Thomas Zanon's main job is as an assistant professor of livestock farming at the University of Bolzano in Italy. Taking all factors into account, he says, milk is by no means inferior to milk substitutes made from oats or soya. The rescued bull calves on his alpine pasture are not only happy animals: They also embody a new approach to sustainable milk production.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

      "content": "<article>In the collective memory, the Cold War is the conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union. However, one thing is often forgotten: the two superpowers also set their sights on the African continent.\n\nTo this day, the Cold War is remembered as an East-West conflict that was fought in the form of proxy and guerrilla wars in Asia and Latin America. However, one aspect of this confrontation is often forgotten: the United States and the Soviet Union also set their sights on Africa, which became a new arena for their power struggle, against the backdrop of decolonization. \nLeft-wing political forces gained strength in African countries in the 1960s. Moscow seized the opportunity and invested heavily in East African Somalia, for example. The situation was similar in Angola. And Moscow triumphed.\nWith Ronald Reagan as the new president, the United States began preparing its return to the African continent in 1981. The timing was favorable, as communism had been devastating in Africa: the collectivization of agriculture in Ethiopia, for example, led to a famine that cost 500,000 people their lives. \nAs more and more African countries turned away from the Soviet model, Moscow could only stand by and watch. Ultimately, Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms could not prevent the collapse of the USSR in 1991.\nThe end of the East-West conflict offered many countries in Africa the opportunity to take control of their own destiny once again. However, to avoid being exploited and manipulated by world powers once more, the continent had to learn the lessons of the Cold War era.\n\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

But maybe the biggest divide in our politics is the insider vs. outsider divide.\n\nThat’s only gotten more noticeable in recent months, as issues like the Epstein files and artificial intelligence have pitted the elites against everyone else. Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) is at the center of both of those issues. He wrote the Epstein Files Transparency Act. He brought one of Jeffrey Epstein’s abuse survivors to this week's State of the Union address. And he’s coined the term “the Epstein class” — the group of wealthy and connected individuals that he wants to bring to accountability. Even if they’re fellow Democrats.\n\nKhanna represents Silicon Valley in his district, so he has worked with companies like Google and Meta for years. That puts him at the forefront of one of the important political and economic questions of the coming year: Is AI about to put us all out of work? And is the government prepared to do anything about it?\n\n00:00 Intro\n1:52 Advocating for Epstein survivors\n4:31 Forcing the release of the Epstein Files\n5:23 Pushing for a vote on Iran strikes\n6:32 Should Dems work with Trump?\n9:41 Holding the “Epstein class” accountable\n15:03 Should Dems have done more to stop Epstein?\n18:10 Tech leaders and income inequality\n19:03 Is there an AI tsunami?\n19:42 Are Dems anti-AI?\n22:00 CA tax on billionaires\n23:56 Is Khanna making a presidential bid?\n\nToday, Explained publishes video episodes every Saturday tackling key issues in politics and culture.

Martin Luther King, Jr. in the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and was appointed to lead Operation Breadbasket, a program aimed at addressing economic concerns of Black Americans. In the years after King’s assassination, Jackson formed the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, a civil rights organization pushing for equity in the economic and political spheres for Black Americans. He died in February 2026 at the age of 84.\n\nThe interview has been edited for length and clarity.

      "content": "<article>In India, more than 80 women are raped every day. This number is probably just the tip of the iceberg. In most cases, the crimes are not reported - whether out of shame, fear of the perpetrator, or mistrust of the police and the justice system.\n\nIn the west of the country, in the wealthy and conservative state of Gujarat, the story of 17-year-old Kinjal portrays an India in which rape is apparently considered a \"trivial offense.” \nThree years ago, the young girl, who belongs to the Dalit community - a group considered \"untouchables,” who occupy the lowest social status, at the bottom of the caste system -- was raped by the son of a landowner from a higher caste. \nTo cover up the incident, the rapist's family offered Kinjal's parents land and 100,000 euros - a fortune. But Kinjal's father rejected the compromise, preferring to take the case to court. \nThis rare act of courage was considered an affront by the higher castes. As a sign of his struggle, he decided not to cut his hair again until the perpetrator was convicted. \nKinjal and her family were supported by Manjula Pradeep. The activist, who is also a Dalit, has dedicated her life to defending women who have been raped. Her goal, as yet unattained, is that each victim she helps will be the last. \nFor six months, a camera crew accompanied Kinjal and her family in their search for justice. A glimpse behind the scenes in India, where the violence of the caste system and the weight of tradition determine the lives of hundreds of millions of women.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #india \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

A lot of Gen Z women…do not. \n\nAnd that divide — and the national handwringing about it — says a lot about the changing status of men and women in this country, and the uncomfortable realization that for American policymakers, not all children are created equal. \n\nToday’s guest on The Gray Area is Vox reporter and bestselling novelist Anna North, who covers kids, parenting, and American family life. She writes the Vox newsletter Kids Today, and her latest chart-topping novel is Bog Queen. She recently reported on the gap between young men and young women on parenthood and what that might tell us about gender roles, relationships, and the future of family formation in a politically polarized country.\n\nHost: Sean Illing (@SeanIlling)\nGuest: Anna North, Staff Writer, Vox\n\n3:30 The poll that revealed a massive parenting gender gap in Gen Z.\n11:20 Why \"Tradwife\" content and traditional values are finding a new audience.\n15:43 The Gen Z family split\n23:11 The \"Care Crisis\" and the trauma of modern immigration enforcement on children.\n26:15 The future of the American family in 2026 and beyond.\n\nWe would love to hear from you.

      "content": "<article>China is pushing into European markets - and striving for ever greater military power. This has already had an impact on the internal and external security of Western countries. How dependent is Germany on China?\n\nFancy some iced tea? It'll be delivered by drone. A tree falls onto the road? The driverless taxi swerves out of the way. The rapid development of artificial intelligence and automation in the megacity of Shenzhen shows how high-tech China is integrating innovation into everyday life. Digitalization is everywhere, in a country where administrative procedures are carried out via mobile phone. \nBut the example of Shenzhen also shows that western countries are in danger of being left behind by China in key technologies such as AI, robotics and electric cars. \nBehind all this advancement lies a great deal of state planning - as well as possible attempts to exert influence. \nThis film shows how China is creating economic and technological dependencies, for example when it comes to so-called \"rare earths\" and \"technology metals.” These are not only indispensable for photovoltaics, wind power and robotics: Many armaments also depend on these raw materials, which are supplied almost exclusively by China.\nChinese manufacturers of batteries and electric cars are also focusing on Hungary as a location to conquer the European market. Factories are being built there, partly to circumvent EU customs duties. The country is actively courting Chinese investment. Within the EU, Hungary repeatedly blocks tougher measures against China. This is putting pressure on Germany's automotive industry.\nThe film explores the question of how dependent Germany is on China and what risks this poses for security and cyber security. What are the strengths and weaknesses of this global power? China competes with the US for leadership in the world, and has long been a security policy challenge for the West. The documentary looks at the two countries’ economic ties, political goals and interrelations -- down to the hyper-local level. Experts from Europe, the US and China provide insights and answers.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #china #europe \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Known as \"Eddy\" to his family, Queen Victoria's grandson and the eldest son of King Edward VII lived a life defined by privilege, mystery, and explosive royal scandals.\n\nIn this full documentary, we investigate the events that shadowed his legacy—from the notorious Cleveland Street Scandal and rumours of a secret life in London’s underworld to the sensational (though debunked) theories linking him to the Jack the Ripper murders. Was there a royal cover-up to protect the heir apparent, or was he a \"black sheep\" prince unfairly targeted by the press?\n\nWe also explore his tragic death at just 28 during the 1892 influenza pandemic, an event that changed British royal history forever by paving the way for his brother, King George V. Featuring insights into his education at Trinity College, his military service, and his failed romances, this biography reveals the human story behind the \"Lost King.\"\n\nPlease subscribe here. https://www.youtube.com/@PeopleProfiles?sub_confirmation=1\nOur second channel. https://www.youtube.com/@PeopleProfilesExtra\nFollow us on Spotify. https://open.spotify.com/show/7fKALbrzEO9Q4VVvAwWHqL\nSupport us on Patreon https://patreon.com/thepeopleprofiles\nFollow us on Twitter. https://twitter.com/tpprofiles\n\nThanks for watching!

      "content": "<article>Sixty years ago, Europe's first seawater desalination plant was built in the Canary Islands. This technology for producing fresh water was a blessing for the islands. Now, it could prove to be a curse for the ecosystem.\n\nThis water treatment system is essential for life in the area - but is it compatible with the principles of sustainable development?\n\nDue to limited freshwater resources and rising demand, the first seawater desalination plant in Europe was built in the Canary Islands. It is often touted as a perfect solution. Today, the Canary Islands have the highest number of desalinations plants in the world, relative to the islands’ size and population. \n\nThe fresh water obtained in this way is indispensable for human life on the volcanic islands, but - since it appears to be available in abundance - it also encourages unbridled economic development, such as mass tourism and the intensive monoculture of bananas for export. \n\nMoreover, seawater desalination is anything but climate-neutral. The plants consume vast amounts of electricity from fossil fuels. The brine returned to the sea destroys marine life and contributes to ocean acidification. \n\nThe film sheds light for the first time on this region's dependence on desalinated seawater. The documentary also explains how water desalination works, and the various impacts that need to be considered.\n \nAware of the urgent need to protect nature, their own health and the future of their children, the Canarian people are working together with scientists to find alternative solutions for sustainable water management. \n\nThanks to decades of experience, the Canary Islands are now leaders in the field of seawater desalination, and their technical expertise is in demand worldwide. In view of increasingly frequent droughts due to climate change, the extraction of drinking water using this technology is becoming a matter of survival for an increasing number of people.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #canaryislands #water \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

      "content": "<article>The survivors of the bar fire in the Swiss mountain resort and their families are desperately trying to come to terms with the tragedy. Could the New Year's blaze in Crans-Montana that claimed 41 lives and left 116 people injured have been prevented?\n\nNew Year's celebrations ended in tragedy at the Le Constellation bar in the upscale ski resort of Crans-Montana. Swiss investigators believe that sparklers attached to champagne bottles set light to sound insulation foam on the basement ceiling. The flames spread within seconds, turning the basement of the bar - a popular party location - into a death trap. \n41 people died as a result of the blaze and 116 people were left injured. Many of the mostly teenaged victims sustained severe burns. That night was the start of a living nightmare for the families affected. \nThis documentary accompanies some of the parents whose children were left critically injured and now face long hospital stays far from home, uncertain outcomes and the daily struggle to keep hope alive. \nOne young survivor also describes what she went through that night and how it has affected her. The psychological wounds run deep: anxiety, trauma and feelings of guilt. She is plagued by the question of why she survived when others died. \nThe film shows how initial reactions of shock and dismay quickly turned to outrage after revelations that human blunders and safety shortcomings may have led to the blaze. The investigation and legal proceedings are only just getting underway, but the mental and emotional impact is already overwhelming.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #swiss #switzerland \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

The discussion reveals that effects are composable operations that encapsulate side effects and defer execution, giving developers the right handles to manage unpredictability through compiler-checked types.\nThe authors explain how ZIO tracks three critical types: outputs, failures, and environmental requirements, enabling better testing with mock clocks and random number generators.\n\nThey share their intentional avoidance of intimidating functional programming terminology like \"monads\" proving you don't need mathematical foundations to understand effects. The conversation covers effect systems' expansion beyond Scala into TypeScript, Kotlin, and new languages like Unison and Roc, and how their collaborative writing process with strict constraints like 47-character line limits - created a coherent 100-page book readable in portrait mode on your phone.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nBill Frasure, Bruce Eckel, James Ward • Effect Oriented Programming • https://amzn.to/4sO6wLV\nBruce Eckel &amp; Svetlana Isakova • Atomic Kotlin • https://amzn.to/4qT1gEQ\nBruce Eckel • Thinking in C++ • https://amzn.to/4qnrIGW\nAndrew Harmel-Law • Facilitating Software Architecture • https://amzn.eu/d/5kZKVfU\nSam Keen • Clean Architecture with Python • https://amzn.to/4pBT5g0\nEric Evans • Domain-Driven Design • https://amzn.to/3tnGhwm\n\n\nBluesky (https://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com) \nTwitter (https://twitter.com/GOTOcon) \nInstagram (https://www.instagram.com/goto_con) \nLinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-) \nFacebook (https://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences) \n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

Overthrow the results of an election they claimed was rigged, despite no credible evidence of fraud. \n\nIf that sounds familiar, that’s because it is. Brazil’s January 8 looked a lot like the January 6 attack on the US capital, just two years earlier: mob violence, an insurrection, and a defeated leader who refused to concede.\n\nBut the aftermath could not be more different. Jair Bolsonaro is now serving a 27-year prison sentence, while Donald Trump is president, again. \n\nSo how did two democracies, facing similar threats, end up with such different outcomes?
