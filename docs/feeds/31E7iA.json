      "content": "<article>US President Donald Trump has announced he's sending his envoy Steve Witkoff to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin next week in Moscow. They will discuss Trump's peace plan for Ukraine - which is widely seen as echoing Russian demands. When asked about criticism of his 28-point peace plan for being too favorable to Russia, Trump described it as a \"map, not a plan,\" saying that it has been revised down to 22 points. Trump also stressed that Moscow too was \"making concessions,\" adding that they come in the form that \"they stop fighting, and they don't take any more land.\" Trump moreover said there was no deadline for the talks. \"You know what the deadline for me is? When it's over,\" he said.\n\nIn a virtual meeting between Ukraine and its allies, President Volodymyr signalled support for the proposal - but said sensitive issues need to be addressed with President Trump. Despite talks progressing, Russia launched a mass drone assault in Ukraine's southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia, injuring dozens. Authorities say more than 30 apartment blocks were damaged.\n\n#Ukrainepeace #Witkoff #ukrainewar\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\n\nFollow DW on social media:\n►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\n►TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dwnews\n►Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n►Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n\nFür Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1</article>",

This follows negotiations in Geneva over the weekend that narrowed the peace blueprint to a new list of proposals, though some of the most difficult issues still need to be negotiated, including territorial and security guarantees. As talks continue, Russia and Ukraine exchanged fire overnight, with airstrikes on Kyiv and southern Russian areas, resulting in casualties and damage to infrastructure. Bloomberg's Jennifer Welch joined Carol Massar and Tim Stenovec on 'Bloomberg Businessweek Daily' to break it down.\n--------\nWatch Bloomberg Radio LIVE on YouTube\nWeekdays 7am-6pm ET\nWATCH HERE: http://bit.ly/3vTiACF\n \nFollow us on X: https://twitter.com/BloombergRadio\n\nSubscribe to our Podcasts:\n\n    Bloomberg Daybreak: http://bit.ly/3DWYoAN\n    Bloomberg Surveillance: http://bit.ly/3OPtReI\n    Bloomberg Intelligence: http://bit.ly/3YrBfOi\n    Balance of Power: http://bit.ly/3OO8eLC\n    Bloomberg Businessweek: http://bit.ly/3IPl60i\n\nListen on Apple CarPlay and Android Auto with the Bloomberg Business app:\nApple CarPlay: https://apple.co/486mghI\nAndroid Auto: https://bit.ly/49benZy\n \nVisit our YouTube channels:\nBloomberg Podcasts: https://www.youtube.com/bloombergpodcasts\nBloomberg Television: https://www.youtube.com/@markets\nBloomberg Originals: https://www.youtube.com/bloomberg\nQuicktake: https://www.youtube.com/@BloombergQuicktake</article>",

They have the luxury of wondering about the meaning of life.</p><h2>‘The garbage time of history’</h2><p>In a cafe in Tiangzhu, a green suburb of the mega-city of Hangzhou, I met Mengling Xu, a graduate of Fudan, one of China’s top universities.</p><p>“After graduating I just work, work, work, work,” she complained. “Relaxation time is very limited.”</p><p>She had given up her job in a Shanghai investment company, and spent some time in the west of China trying to find herself and recover from depression.</p><blockquote><p>“After graduating I just work, work, work, work.”</p></blockquote><p>“This is ‘lishi de laji shijian’, the garbage time of history,” she said.</p><p>To explain: ‘garbage time’ is an American sports term, meaning the last minutes of a game where one team is so far ahead the result is a foregone conclusion.</p><p>Gen Z has adopted the concept to express their feeling that there’s nothing they can do to affect the course of events.</p><p>They are the opposite of the Tiananmen generation, who tried to change history and were punished for their bravery. Another new concept is ‘tangping’, meaning ‘lie flat’ – in other words, drop out.</p><p>The Party is increasingly worried about this disillusioned generation.</p><p>Enter Felix Tao, an AI innovator who has returned to China from Silicon Valley. He’s developing ‘Second Me’, an AI app “which essentially aims to help people to create their digital identity using AI.</p><p>“I’m particularly passionate about AI technology, especially its applications in social interactions, personal growth and productivity enhancement.” That was his AI avatar speaking, by the way, as it (he?) addressed me from his smartphone.</p><p>The idea is that the hassle of making friends can be eased by getting your avatar to do all the initial bit of working out whether you like each other.</p><p>I know, I know. People like me (AKA old people) think that’s the fun part of meeting someone new. I’m delighted that I met Felix in person, surrounded by his techy friends, in his living room.</p><p>But this new online generation experience things differently. Everyone in Tiangzhu – often called China’s Silicon Valley – is developing an AI app.</p><p>Mengling Xu hopes hers could help other depressed young people to recover their energy – a high tech answer to existential angst.</p><p>In the US, Wall Street investors are worrying about an AI bubble – maybe they have pumped too much money into the big Silicon Valley companies. Across the western world, people are fretting about AI’s potential to act autonomously and take control of our lives.</p><p>I heard no such doubts in China. The Party’s buttoned up men in suits see AI as the new high speed rail, a high-tech way of boosting the economy and winning the battle with the US for the future.</p><p>They’re also hoping that the brave new world of AI will inspire this baffling new generation, whose form of rebellion is not to stand defiantly in front of a tank, but to do nothing at all.</p><p>Thanks for reading the latest edition of our free FourGround newsletter.</p><p>Subscribe <a href=\"https://channel4news.substack.com/\">here</a> to keep up to date with Channel 4 News on Substack.</p>",

It is a blueprint for a Trump defeat and Putin win, and that’s why it has to be changed fundamentally.”</p></blockquote><p>Mr Rasmussen, who served as Denmark’s PM from 2001 to 2009, said: “Europe must step forward robustly and play hard power politics, which means give robust security guarantees to Ukraine, backed up by troop presence in Ukraine, and secondly unlock frozen Russian assets for Ukraine.”</p><p>While he said that he appreciated American efforts to initiate the peace process, Mr Rasmussen added: “I find it quite embarrassing that the Europeans are begging and asking for a seat at the table. We should have a seat at the table because we’re indispensable and the way to make yourself indispensable would be to bring something to the table, and that should be concrete security guarantees for Ukraine.”</p><blockquote><p>“Europe must step forward robustly and play hard power politics, which means give robust security guarantees to Ukraine, backed up by troop presence in Ukraine.”</p></blockquote><p>He told Channel 4 News those guarantees, and any US security guarantee, must involve troops in Ukraine.</p><p>“The fact is that Putin doesn’t care about paper guarantees,” he said.</p><p>“It’s only guarantees backed up by a concrete military presence that he will respect.”</p><p>Mr Rasmussen said he estimated that Europe would need to send 20,000 troops – but he stressed that they should not be on the frontline.</p><p>He told Channel 4 News that Europe should also send 150 combat aircraft, and “establish an air shield to protect these cities in Ukraine.”</p><blockquote><p>“The fact is that Putin doesn’t care about paper guarantees.”</p></blockquote><p>Asked if Europe has the assets to do this, he said yes, “but obviously the deterrent effect would be much stronger if the US would back up such a European reassurance force by <a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/news/ukraine-latest-trump-cuts-intelligence-sharing-with-kyiv\">intelligence sharing, space surveillance</a>, aircraft, transport, etc.”</p>",

      "content": "<article>Ukraine diplomacy went into overdrive after the Trump administration floated a 28-point 'peace plan', widely condemned as favoring Russia. Kyiv and its allies quickly hammered out a counter-proposal, which Kyiv says is 'workable'. But will the White House or the Kremlin agree to the changes? What are Ukraine's red lines? Is Russia ready to soften its hardline demands? Or will the US pressure Ukraine to accept a raw deal for peace?\n\n#UkraineWar #ukrainepeacetalks #NewsDesk\n\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\n\nFollow DW on social media:\n►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\n►TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dwnews\n►Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n►Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n\nFür Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1</article>",

      "content": "<article>Share of Nvidia fell and Alphabet gained on a report that Meta Platforms is in talks to spend billions on Google’s AI chips. Meta is in discussions to use the Google chips — known as tensor processing units, or TPUs — in data centers in 2027, The Information reported, citing an unidentified person familiar with the talks. Meta also may rent chips from Google’s cloud division next year, the news outlet said. An agreement would help establish TPUs as an alternative to Nvidia’s chips, the gold standard for big tech firms and startups from Meta to OpenAI that need computing power to develop and run artificial intelligence platforms.\n\nUS stock futures eased after a tech-fueled rally in the S&amp;P 500, as traders look ahead to a slate of economic data to gauge whether optimism over a potential Federal Reserve interest-rate cut can hold up. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 was little changed. Asia’s regional benchmark climbed 0.6%, buoyed by gains in Chinese shares after Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping held their first talks since agreeing to a tariff truce last month. Traders are watching US data ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday, including September retail sales and producer prices due later Tuesday. \n\nToday's guests: Omotunde Lawal, Barings; Jack Meaning, Barclays\n---\n\"The Pulse With Francine Lacqua\" is all about conversations with high profile guests in the beating heart of global business, economics, finance and politics.
