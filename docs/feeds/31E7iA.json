Bloomberg's Christina Ruffini and David Gura speak with Massachusetts Congressman Jake Auchincloss. “The hour for your freedom is at hand,” Trump said, addressing Iranians in a video posted on Truth Social on Saturday. “When we’re finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take. This will be probably your only chance for generations.” The military campaign could be a defining moment for Trump, risking a drawn-out regional war that leads to a surge in energy prices and American casualties ahead of mid-term elections this year. Iran quickly responded by firing missiles on Israel and US bases around the region, and countries in the Persian Gulf closed their airspace.\n--------\nMore on Bloomberg Television and Markets\n \nLike this video?

Among the total of 506,000 foreign visitors, 48,000 stayed for at least one night.</p><p>The figures, which are compiled for Lublin city hall and tourist office based on analysis of geolocation data, also showed 570,000 Ukrainians recorded in Lublin last year, including 47,000 who stayed for at least one night.</p><p>However, the city notes that it has in recent years chosen not to include Ukrainians in the visitor figures, given that generally their “movement was migratory in nature”. Ukrainians are by far Poland’s largest immigrant group and, like other Polish cities, Lublin has hosted many Ukrainian refugees since 2022.</p><p>However, “four years after the outbreak of the full-scale war, the number of [Ukrainian] arrivals has stabilised, suggesting that these are people [now] visiting Lublin for tourism, research, business, health, or shopping, or travelling in transit”, added the city.</p><p>Of the 1.69 million domestic visitors to Lublin last year, the largest number came from the Masovia province, which is where Warsaw, Poland’s capital, is located and which is relatively close to Lublin. For the first time, more Masovians visited the city than people from the surrounding Lublin province.</p><p>The city’s airport last year served 471,000 passengers, the highest number since it opened in 2012.&nbsp; On Thursday, low-cost carrier Ryanair, which is Poland’s biggest airline by passenger numbers, announced that it will run a record six connections from Lublin this summer, to destinations in Poland, Italy, Spain, Ireland and the UK.</p><p>Kraków remains Poland’s <a href=\"https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/09/19/krakow-again-named-europes-best-city-break-destination/\">most popular tourist destination</a>. In 2024, it was visited by almost eight million tourists who stayed for at least one night, including 1.5 million from abroad.</p><p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://notesfrompoland.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/support.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"275\" height=\"97\">\nNotes from Poland is run by a <a href=\"https://notesfrompoland.com/about-us/#editor-team\">small editorial team</a> and published by an independent, non-profit foundation that is funded through donations from our readers.

We cannot do what we do without your support.</p></div></div><p>Poland’s justice minister has asked the European Parliament to again strip Polish far-right leader Grzegorz Braun of legal immunity so that he can face charges in his homeland for denying German-Nazi crimes, an offence that carries a potential three-year jail term.</p><p>He is accused of refuting the fact that gas chambers were used to kill victims at the Auschwitz and Majdanek camps.</p><p>Braun is <a href=\"https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/12/08/trial-of-polish-far-right-leader-for-attacking-jewish-celebration-in-parliament-begins/\">already on trial</a> in Poland for a number of other alleged crimes, including attacking a Jewish religious ceremony in parliament. Now prosecutors also wish to charge him under a law that makes it a criminal offence to “publicly and contrary to the facts deny” Nazi or communist crimes.</p><p>“There is and will be no consent to distorting history and breaking the law,” wrote justice minister Waldemar Żurek, announcing on Friday that he had asked the European Parliament to lift Braun’s immunity.</p><p>“This is a question of historical truth, respect for the victims, and accountability for one’s words,” added Żurek, who also serves as prosecutor general. “The Polish state has a duty to respond to the denial of Nazi-German crimes.”</p><p>Żurek revealed that the accusation against Braun relates to “denial of genocide crimes committed by functionaries of the Third Reich in the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp and the Lublin concentration camp (Majdanek)”.</p><p>In a further statement, Poland’s Institute of National Remembrance (IPN), a state historical body that has prosecutorial power, said that the accusation related to the use of gas chambers at those two camps.</p><p>Neither the IPN nor Żurek confirmed what specific words Braun had said that prompted the planned charges against him. However, the IPN noted that they had come at a live event broadcast online on 27 September 2025.</p><p>On that date, Braun took part in a discussion with Jan Żaryn, a right-wing historian and former senator for the national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party, titled “The Polish Underground State and the Jewish Issue”. A&nbsp;recording of the event is still available online.</p><p>During his remarks, Braun referred to the “fake gas chambers of Majdanek and Auschwitz”, calling them “a dark, monstrous fantasy that has no satisfactory historical or academic support”.</p><p>He suggested that the idea of the gas chambers had been invented as part of “propaganda and black PR operations conducted by the Soviet and Anglo-Saxon security services during World War Two”, and that the false claim continues to be exploited by Jews today.</p><p>In actual fact, historians estimate that around 900,000 people were killed in the gas chambers at Auschwitz. The vast majority were Jews, but victims also included Roma, Soviet prisoners of war, and ethnic Poles.</p><p>Meanwhile, gas chambers at Majdanek were used to kill tens of thousands, again mainly Jews. Today, the ashes of the camp’s cremated victims are preserved in a memorial at the site of the former camp.</p><p>Braun, who has a long history of promoting antisemitic conspiracy theories, has repeatedly sought to cast doubt on the veracity of Nazi crimes against Jews.</p><p>In a separate interview in July last year, he also <a href=\"https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/07/10/polish-far-right-leader-declares-auschwitz-gas-chambers-to-be-fake/\">called</a> the gas chambers at Auschwitz “fake”. In response, Żurek <a href=\"https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/09/05/poland-asks-eu-parliament-to-strip-far-right-leader-of-immunity-over-holocaust-denial-charges/\">filed a similar request</a> to lift Braun’s immunity so that he could face charges for denying Nazi crimes.</p><p>The European Parliament – which can strip an MEP’s immunity by a majority vote among their fellow MEPs – is still processing that request.</p><p>In December, Braun <a href=\"https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/12/08/trial-of-polish-far-right-leader-for-attacking-jewish-celebration-in-parliament-begins/\">went on trial</a> over a separate set of charges relating to four other incidents, including his <a href=\"https://notesfrompoland.com/2023/12/12/far-right-mp-expelled-from-polish-parliament-after-spraying-hanukkah-candles-with-fire-extinguisher/\">attack</a> on a celebration of the Jewish festival of Hanukkah in parliament in December 2023 and his <a href=\"https://notesfrompoland.com/2023/05/31/far-right-mp-forces-abandonment-of-holocaust-scholars-lecture-at-german-institute-in-warsaw/\">disruption of a lecture</a> by a Holocaust scholar.</p><p>“I am standing before this court because I dared to defend myself against oppression and the ritual manifestation of Jewish supremacy,” declared Braun at the start of the trial.</p><p>In November, the European Parliament <a href=\"https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/11/13/polish-far-right-leader-braun-again-stripped-of-legal-immunity-by-european-parliament/\">also stripped Braun of immunity</a>&nbsp;to face charges for six alleged crimes, including inciting religious hatred against Jews, assaulting a doctor involved in carrying out a late-term abortion, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/03/20/police-investigating-far-right-presidential-candidates-vandalism-of-lgbt-exhibition-in-poland/\">vandalising</a>&nbsp;an LGBT+ exhibition.</p><p>Amid his legal troubles, Braun has seen his popularity rise. When he stood as a candidate in last year’s presidential election, he began as a rank outsider but ended up <a href=\"https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/05/19/narrow-win-in-polish-presidential-election-first-round-for-trzaskowski-who-will-face-nawrocki-in-run-off/\">finishing fourth</a>, with 6.3% of the vote, following a campaign characterised by antisemitic, anti-Ukrainian and anti-LGBT+ rhetoric.</p><p>Meanwhile, the radical-right party that he leads, Confederation of the Polish Crown (KKP), has <a href=\"https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/12/17/poll-shows-party-of-polish-far-right-leader-grzegorz-braun-rising-to-third-place/\">surged in the polls</a>, where it now averages support of around 8%.</p><p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://notesfrompoland.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/support.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"275\" height=\"97\">\nNotes from Poland is run by a <a href=\"https://notesfrompoland.com/about-us/#editor-team\">small editorial team</a> and published by an independent, non-profit foundation that is funded through donations from our readers.
