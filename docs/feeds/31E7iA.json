And, with new congressional momentum and a victory in midterm elections, Argentina’s President Javier Milei gets the electorate’s buy-in to continue economic reforms that have had mixed results. Plus, Geoffrey Hinton, the “Godfather of AI,” warns that the race to build smarter machines is outpacing efforts to control them, and that humanity must act before it’s too late. Later, will President Trump’s $100,000 H-1B visa fee actually solve the issues of misuse and poor pay, or will it starve the US of global talent?\n\nChapters:\n00:00:00 - Larry Summers on the Fed\n00:11:54 - Milei Wins in Argentina\n00:23:56 - Geoffrey Hinton on AI\n00:35:51 - Trump's $100k Visa Fee\n00:47:33 - Hinton on Responsible AI\n--------\nMore on Bloomberg Television and Markets\n \nLike this video?

He expresses concern about the lack of a clear strategy and warns that this could open a Pandora's box, especially in relation to China. Hodges also questions Trump’s strong focus on Venezuela, viewing the military actions as potentially aimed at regime change rather than addressing drug cartels. He raises alarms about Trump's intention to deploy military troops into U.S. cities, suggesting it could challenge military leadership. Additionally, Hodges shares a grim outlook on the situation in Ukraine, believing that Russia feels increasingly confident that Europe and the U.S. may give up on supporting Ukraine.\n\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\n\nFollow DW on social media:\n►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\n►TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dwnews\n►Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n►Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n\nFür Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1\n#trump #us #nuclear</article>",
