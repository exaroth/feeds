Use any language or AI framework, and deliver agents faster to production.</p></p><p>Star ⭐️ the repo if you found Plano useful — new releases and updates land here first.</p></div><p>Building agentic demos is easy. Shipping agentic applications safely, reliably, and repeatably to production is hard. After the thrill of a quick hack, you end up building the “hidden middleware” to reach production: routing logic to reach the right agent, guardrail hooks for safety and moderation, evaluation and observability glue for continuous learning, and model/provider quirks scattered across frameworks and application code.</p><p>Plano solves this by moving core delivery concerns into a unified, out-of-process dataplane.</p><p>Plano pulls rote plumbing out of your framework so you can stay focused on what matters most: the core product logic of your agentic applications. Plano is backed by <a href=\"https://planoai.dev/research\">industry-leading LLM research</a> and built on <a href=\"https://envoyproxy.io\">Envoy</a> by its core contributors, who built critical infrastructure at scale for modern worklaods.</p><p> to learn how you can use Plano to improve the speed, safety and obervability of your agentic applications.</p><blockquote><p>[!IMPORTANT] Plano and the Arch family of LLMs (like Plano-Orchestrator-4B, Arch-Router, etc) are hosted free of charge in the US-central region to give you a great first-run developer experience of Plano. To scale and run in production, you can either run these LLMs locally or contact us on <a href=\"https://discord.gg/pGZf2gcwEc\">Discord</a> for API keys.</p></blockquote><h2>Build Agentic Apps with Plano</h2><p>Plano handles <strong>orchestration, model management, and observability</strong> as modular building blocks - letting you configure only what you need (edge proxying for agentic orchestration and guardrails, or LLM routing from your services, or both together) to fit cleanly into existing architectures. Below is a simple multi-agent travel agent built with Plano that showcases all three core capabilities</p><h3>1. Define Your Agents in YAML</h3><pre><code># config.yaml\nversion: v0.3.0\n\n# What you declare: Agent URLs and natural language descriptions\n# What you don't write: Intent classifiers, routing logic, model fallbacks, provider adapters, or tracing instrumentation\n\nagents:\n  - id: weather_agent\n    url: http://localhost:10510\n  - id: flight_agent\n    url: http://localhost:10520\n\nmodel_providers:\n  - model: openai/gpt-4o\n    access_key: $OPENAI_API_KEY\n    default: true\n  - model: anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet\n    access_key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\n\nlisteners:\n  - type: agent\n    name: travel_assistant\n    port: 8001\n    router: plano_orchestrator_v1  # Powered by our 4B-parameter routing model. You can change this to different models\n    agents:\n      - id: weather_agent\n        description: |\n          Gets real-time weather and forecasts for any city worldwide.\n          Handles: \"What's the weather in Paris?\", \"Will it rain in Tokyo?\"\n\n      - id: flight_agent\n        description: |\n          Searches flights between airports with live status and schedules.\n          Handles: \"Flights from NYC to LA\", \"Show me flights to Seattle\"\n\ntracing:\n  random_sampling: 100  # Auto-capture traces for evaluation\n</code></pre><h3>2. Write Simple Agent Code</h3><p>Your agents are just HTTP servers that implement the OpenAI-compatible chat completions endpoint. Use any language or framework:</p><pre><code># weather_agent.py\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI, Request\nfrom fastapi.responses import StreamingResponse\nfrom openai import AsyncOpenAI\n\napp = FastAPI()\n\n# Point to Plano's LLM gateway - it handles model routing for you\nllm = AsyncOpenAI(base_url=\"http://localhost:12001/v1\", api_key=\"EMPTY\")\n\n@app.post(\"/v1/chat/completions\")\nasync def chat(request: Request):\n    body = await request.json()\n    messages = body.get(\"messages\", [])\n    days = 7\n\n    # Your agent logic: fetch data, call APIs, run tools\n    # See demos/agent_orchestration/travel_agents/ for the full implementation\n    weather_data = await get_weather_data(request, messages, days)\n\n    # Stream the response back through Plano\n    async def generate():\n        stream = await llm.chat.completions.create(\n            model=\"openai/gpt-4o\",\n            messages=[{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": f\"Weather: {weather_data}\"}, *messages],\n            stream=True\n        )\n        async for chunk in stream:\n            yield f\"data: {chunk.model_dump_json()}\\n\\n\"\n\n    return StreamingResponse(generate(), media_type=\"text/event-stream\")\n</code></pre><h3>3. Start Plano &amp; Query Your Agents</h3><pre><code># Start Plano\nplanoai up config.yaml\n...\n\n# Query - Plano intelligently routes to both agents in a single conversation\ncurl http://localhost:8001/v1/chat/completions \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"model\": \"gpt-4o\",\n    \"messages\": [\n      {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"I want to travel from NYC to Paris next week. What is the weather like there, and can you find me some flights?\"}\n    ]\n  }'\n# → Plano routes to weather_agent for Paris weather ✓\n# → Then routes to flight_agent for NYC → Paris flights ✓\n# → Returns a complete travel plan with both weather info and flight options\n</code></pre><h3>4. Get Observability and Model Agility for Free</h3><p>Every request is traced end-to-end with OpenTelemetry - no instrumentation code needed.</p><h3>What You Didn't Have to Build</h3><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Write intent classifier + routing logic</td><td>Declare agent descriptions in YAML</td></tr><tr><td>Handle each provider's API quirks</td><td>Unified LLM APIs with state management</td></tr><tr><td>Instrument every service with OTEL</td><td>Automatic end-to-end traces and logs</td></tr><tr><td>Build pipeline to capture/export spans</td><td>Zero-code agentic signals</td></tr><tr><td>Update routing code, test, redeploy</td></tr></tbody></table><p> Plano uses purpose-built, lightweight LLMs (like our 4B-parameter orchestrator) instead of heavyweight frameworks or GPT-4 for routing - giving you production-grade routing at a fraction of the cost and latency.</p><p>To get in touch with us, please join our <a href=\"https://discord.gg/pGZf2gcwEc\">discord server</a>.

Since launch, developers have pushed it far beyond research: building data pipelines, generating slide decks, spinning up dashboards, automating content workflows. Things we never anticipated.</p><p>That told us something important: DeerFlow wasn't just a research tool. It was a  — a runtime that gives agents the infrastructure to actually get work done.</p><p>So we rebuilt it from scratch.</p><p>DeerFlow 2.0 is no longer a framework you wire together. It's a super agent harness — batteries included, fully extensible. Built on LangGraph and LangChain, it ships with everything an agent needs out of the box: a filesystem, memory, skills, sandboxed execution, and the ability to plan and spawn sub-agents for complex, multi-step tasks.</p><p>Use it as-is. Or tear it apart and make it yours.</p><p>Skills are what make DeerFlow do .</p><p>A standard Agent Skill is a structured capability module — a Markdown file that defines a workflow, best practices, and references to supporting resources. DeerFlow ships with built-in skills for research, report generation, slide creation, web pages, image and video generation, and more. But the real power is extensibility: add your own skills, replace the built-in ones, or combine them into compound workflows.</p><p>Skills are loaded progressively — only when the task needs them, not all at once. This keeps the context window lean and makes DeerFlow work well even with token-sensitive models.</p><p>Tools follow the same philosophy. DeerFlow comes with a core toolset — web search, web fetch, file operations, bash execution — and supports custom tools via MCP servers and Python functions. Swap anything. Add anything.</p><pre><code># Paths inside the sandbox container\n/mnt/skills/public\n├── research/SKILL.md\n├── report-generation/SKILL.md\n├── slide-creation/SKILL.md\n├── web-page/SKILL.md\n└── image-generation/SKILL.md\n\n/mnt/skills/custom\n└── your-custom-skill/SKILL.md      ← yours\n</code></pre><p>Complex tasks rarely fit in a single pass. DeerFlow decomposes them.</p><p>The lead agent can spawn sub-agents on the fly — each with its own scoped context, tools, and termination conditions. Sub-agents run in parallel when possible, report back structured results, and the lead agent synthesizes everything into a coherent output.</p><p>This is how DeerFlow handles tasks that take minutes to hours: a research task might fan out into a dozen sub-agents, each exploring a different angle, then converge into a single report — or a website — or a slide deck with generated visuals. One harness, many hands.</p><p>DeerFlow doesn't just  about doing things. It has its own computer.</p><p>Each task runs inside an isolated Docker container with a full filesystem — skills, workspace, uploads, outputs. The agent reads, writes, and edits files. It executes bash commands and codes. It views images. All sandboxed, all auditable, zero contamination between sessions.</p><p>This is the difference between a chatbot with tool access and an agent with an actual execution environment.</p><pre><code># Paths inside the sandbox container\n/mnt/user-data/\n├── uploads/          ← your files\n├── workspace/        ← agents' working directory\n└── outputs/          ← final deliverables\n</code></pre><p><strong>Isolated Sub-Agent Context</strong>: Each sub-agent runs in its own isolated context. This means that the sub-agent will not be able to see the context of the main agent or other sub-agents. This is important to ensure that the sub-agent is able to focus on the task at hand and not be distracted by the context of the main agent or other sub-agents.</p><p>: Within a session, DeerFlow manages context aggressively — summarizing completed sub-tasks, offloading intermediate results to the filesystem, compressing what's no longer immediately relevant. This lets it stay sharp across long, multi-step tasks without blowing the context window.</p><p>Most agents forget everything the moment a conversation ends. DeerFlow remembers.</p><p>Across sessions, DeerFlow builds a persistent memory of your profile, preferences, and accumulated knowledge. The more you use it, the better it knows you — your writing style, your technical stack, your recurring workflows. Memory is stored locally and stays under your control.</p><p>DeerFlow is model-agnostic — it works with any LLM that implements the OpenAI-compatible API. That said, it performs best with models that support:</p><ul><li> (100k+ tokens) for deep research and multi-step tasks</li><li> for adaptive planning and complex decomposition</li><li> for image understanding and video comprehension</li><li> for reliable function calling and structured outputs</li></ul><p>We welcome contributions!

As soon as it sees that you're building something, it  just jump into trying to write code. Instead, it steps back and asks you what you're really trying to do.</p><p>Once it's teased a spec out of the conversation, it shows it to you in chunks short enough to actually read and digest.</p><p>After you've signed off on the design, your agent puts together an implementation plan that's clear enough for an enthusiastic junior engineer with poor taste, no judgement, no project context, and an aversion to testing to follow. It emphasizes true red/green TDD, YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It), and DRY.</p><p>Next up, once you say \"go\", it launches a <em>subagent-driven-development</em> process, having agents work through each engineering task, inspecting and reviewing their work, and continuing forward. It's not uncommon for Claude to be able to work autonomously for a couple hours at a time without deviating from the plan you put together.</p><p>There's a bunch more to it, but that's the core of the system. And because the skills trigger automatically, you don't need to do anything special.

We provide a <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion/main/#reference-sampling-script\">reference script for sampling</a>, but there also exists a <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion/main/#diffusers-integration\">diffusers integration</a>, which we expect to see more active community development.</p><h4>Reference Sampling Script</h4><p>We provide a reference sampling script, which incorporates</p><pre><code>mkdir -p models/ldm/stable-diffusion-v1/\nln -s &lt;path/to/model.ckpt&gt; models/ldm/stable-diffusion-v1/model.ckpt \n</code></pre><pre><code>python scripts/txt2img.py --prompt \"a photograph of an astronaut riding a horse\" --plms \n</code></pre><p>By default, this uses a guidance scale of , <a href=\"https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion/pull/51\">Katherine Crowson's implementation</a> of the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09778\">PLMS</a> sampler, and renders images of size 512x512 (which it was trained on) in 50 steps. All supported arguments are listed below (type <code>python scripts/txt2img.py --help</code>).</p><pre></pre><p>Note: The inference config for all v1 versions is designed to be used with EMA-only checkpoints. For this reason  is set in the configuration, otherwise the code will try to switch from non-EMA to EMA weights. If you want to examine the effect of EMA vs no EMA, we provide \"full\" checkpoints which contain both types of weights. For these,  will load and use the non-EMA weights.</p><p>A simple way to download and sample Stable Diffusion is by using the <a href=\"https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main#new--stable-diffusion-is-now-fully-compatible-with-diffusers\">diffusers library</a>:</p><pre><code># make sure you're logged in with `huggingface-cli login`\nfrom torch import autocast\nfrom diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline\n\npipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(\n\t\"CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4\", \n\tuse_auth_token=True\n).to(\"cuda\")\n\nprompt = \"a photo of an astronaut riding a horse on mars\"\nwith autocast(\"cuda\"):\n    image = pipe(prompt)[\"sample\"][0]  \n    \nimage.save(\"astronaut_rides_horse.png\")\n</code></pre><h3>Image Modification with Stable Diffusion</h3><p>By using a diffusion-denoising mechanism as first proposed by <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01073\">SDEdit</a>, the model can be used for different tasks such as text-guided image-to-image translation and upscaling. Similar to the txt2img sampling script, we provide a script to perform image modification with Stable Diffusion.</p><p>The following describes an example where a rough sketch made in <a href=\"https://www.pinta-project.com/\">Pinta</a> is converted into a detailed artwork.</p><pre><code>python scripts/img2img.py --prompt \"A fantasy landscape, trending on artstation\" --init-img &lt;path-to-img.jpg&gt; --strength 0.8\n</code></pre><p>Here, strength is a value between 0.0 and 1.0, that controls the amount of noise that is added to the input image. Values that approach 1.0 allow for lots of variations but will also produce images that are not semantically consistent with the input. See the following example.</p><p>This procedure can, for example, also be used to upscale samples from the base model.</p><pre><code>@misc{rombach2021highresolution,\n      title={High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models}, \n      author={Robin Rombach and Andreas Blattmann and Dominik Lorenz and Patrick Esser and Björn Ommer},\n      year={2021},\n      eprint={2112.10752},\n      archivePrefix={arXiv},\n      primaryClass={cs.CV}\n}\n</code></pre>",

      "content": "<p>A comprehensive collection of Agent Skills for context engineering, multi-agent architectures, and production agent systems. Use when building, optimizing, or debugging agent systems that require effective context management.</p><p>A comprehensive, open collection of Agent Skills focused on context engineering principles for building production-grade AI agent systems. These skills teach the art and science of curating context to maximize agent effectiveness across any agent platform.</p><h2>What is Context Engineering?</h2><p>Context engineering is the discipline of managing the language model's context window. Unlike prompt engineering, which focuses on crafting effective instructions, context engineering addresses the holistic curation of all information that enters the model's limited attention budget: system prompts, tool definitions, retrieved documents, message history, and tool outputs.</p><p>The fundamental challenge is that context windows are constrained not by raw token capacity but by attention mechanics. As context length increases, models exhibit predictable degradation patterns: the \"lost-in-the-middle\" phenomenon, U-shaped attention curves, and attention scarcity. Effective context engineering means finding the smallest possible set of high-signal tokens that maximize the likelihood of desired outcomes.</p><p>This repository is cited in academic research as foundational work on static skill architecture:</p><blockquote><p>\"While static skills are well-recognized [Anthropic, 2025b; Muratcan Koylan, 2025], MCE is among the first to dynamically evolve them, bridging manual skill engineering and autonomous self-improvement.\"</p></blockquote><p>These skills establish the foundational understanding required for all subsequent context engineering work.</p><table><tbody><tr><td>Understand what context is, why it matters, and the anatomy of context in agent systems</td></tr><tr><td>Recognize patterns of context failure: lost-in-middle, poisoning, distraction, and clash</td></tr></tbody></table><p>These skills cover the patterns and structures for building effective agent systems.</p><table><tbody><tr><td>Design short-term, long-term, and graph-based memory architectures</td></tr><tr><td>Use filesystems for dynamic context discovery, tool output offloading, and plan persistence</td></tr><tr><td> Build background coding agents with sandboxed VMs, pre-built images, multiplayer support, and multi-client interfaces</td></tr></tbody></table><p>These skills address the ongoing operation and optimization of agent systems.</p><table><tbody><tr><td>Build evaluation frameworks for agent systems</td></tr><tr><td>Master LLM-as-a-Judge techniques: direct scoring, pairwise comparison, rubric generation, and bias mitigation</td></tr></tbody></table><p>These skills cover the meta-level practices for building LLM-powered projects.</p><table><tbody><tr><td>Design and build LLM projects from ideation through deployment, including task-model fit analysis, pipeline architecture, and structured output design</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Cognitive Architecture Skills</h3><p>These skills cover formal cognitive modeling for rational agent systems.</p><table><tbody><tr><td> Transform external RDF context into agent mental states (beliefs, desires, intentions) using formal BDI ontology patterns for deliberative reasoning and explainability</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Each skill is structured for efficient context use. At startup, agents load only skill names and descriptions. Full content loads only when a skill is activated for relevant tasks.</p><p>These skills focus on transferable principles rather than vendor-specific implementations.

      "content": "<p>Find and fix problems in your JavaScript code.</p><p>ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code. In many ways, it is similar to JSLint and JSHint with a few exceptions:</p><ul><li>ESLint uses <a href=\"https://github.com/eslint/js/tree/main/packages/espree\">Espree</a> for JavaScript parsing.</li><li>ESLint uses an AST to evaluate patterns in code.</li><li>ESLint is completely pluggable, every single rule is a plugin and you can add more at runtime.</li></ul><p>Prerequisites: <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/\">Node.js</a> (, , or ) built with SSL support. (If you are using an official Node.js distribution, SSL is always built in.)</p><p>You can install and configure ESLint using this command:</p><pre><code>npm init @eslint/config@latest\n</code></pre><p>After that, you can run ESLint on any file or directory like this:</p><p>To use ESLint with pnpm, we recommend setting up a  file with at least the following settings:</p><pre><code>auto-install-peers=true\nnode-linker=hoisted\n</code></pre><p>This ensures that pnpm installs dependencies in a way that is more compatible with npm and is less likely to produce errors.</p><p>You can configure rules in your  files as in this example:</p><pre><code>import { defineConfig } from \"eslint/config\";\n\nexport default defineConfig([\n\t{\n\t\tfiles: [\"**/*.js\", \"**/*.cjs\", \"**/*.mjs\"],\n\t\trules: {\n\t\t\t\"prefer-const\": \"warn\",\n\t\t\t\"no-constant-binary-expression\": \"error\",\n\t\t},\n\t},\n]);\n</code></pre><p>The names  and <code>\"no-constant-binary-expression\"</code> are the names of <a href=\"https://eslint.org/docs/rules\">rules</a> in ESLint. The first value is the error level of the rule and can be one of these values:</p><ul><li> or  - turn the rule off</li><li> or  - turn the rule on as a warning (doesn't affect exit code)</li><li> or  - turn the rule on as an error (exit code will be 1)</li></ul><p>The three error levels allow you fine-grained control over how ESLint applies rules (for more configuration options and details, see the <a href=\"https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure\">configuration docs</a>).</p><p>The ESLint team provides ongoing support for the current version and six months of limited support for the previous version. Limited support includes critical bug fixes, security issues, and compatibility issues only.</p><p>ESLint offers commercial support for both current and previous versions through our partners, <a href=\"https://tidelift.com/funding/github/npm/eslint\">Tidelift</a> and <a href=\"https://www.herodevs.com/support/eslint-nes?utm_source=ESLintWebsite&amp;utm_medium=ESLintWebsite&amp;utm_campaign=ESLintNES&amp;utm_id=ESLintNES\">HeroDevs</a>.</p><p>Before filing an issue, please be sure to read the guidelines for what you're reporting:</p><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><p>Yes, ESLint natively supports parsing JSX syntax (this must be enabled in <a href=\"https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure\">configuration</a>). Please note that supporting JSX syntax  the same as supporting React. React applies specific semantics to JSX syntax that ESLint doesn't recognize. We recommend using <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react\">eslint-plugin-react</a> if you are using React and want React semantics.</p><h3>Does Prettier replace ESLint?</h3><p>No, ESLint and Prettier have different jobs: ESLint is a linter (looking for problematic patterns) and Prettier is a code formatter. Using both tools is common, refer to <a href=\"https://prettier.io/docs/en/install#eslint-and-other-linters\">Prettier's documentation</a> to learn how to configure them to work well with each other.</p><h3>What ECMAScript versions does ESLint support?</h3><p>ESLint has full support for ECMAScript 3, 5, and every year from 2015 up until the most recent stage 4 specification (the default). You can set your desired ECMAScript syntax and other settings (like global variables) through <a href=\"https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure\">configuration</a>.</p><h3>What about experimental features?</h3><p>ESLint's parser only officially supports the latest final ECMAScript standard. We will make changes to core rules in order to avoid crashes on stage 3 ECMAScript syntax proposals (as long as they are implemented using the correct experimental ESTree syntax). We may make changes to core rules to better work with language extensions (such as JSX, Flow, and TypeScript) on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>In other cases (including if rules need to warn on more or fewer cases due to new syntax, rather than just not crashing), we recommend you use other parsers and/or rule plugins. If you are using Babel, you can use <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@babel/eslint-parser\">@babel/eslint-parser</a> and <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@babel/eslint-plugin\">@babel/eslint-plugin</a> to use any option available in Babel.</p><p>Once a language feature has been adopted into the ECMAScript standard (stage 4 according to the <a href=\"https://tc39.github.io/process-document/\">TC39 process</a>), we will accept issues and pull requests related to the new feature, subject to our <a href=\"https://eslint.org/docs/latest/contribute\">contributing guidelines</a>. Until then, please use the appropriate parser and plugin(s) for your experimental feature.</p><h3>Which Node.js versions does ESLint support?</h3><p>ESLint updates the supported Node.js versions with each major release of ESLint. At that time, ESLint's supported Node.js versions are updated to be:</p><ol><li>The most recent maintenance release of Node.js</li><li>The lowest minor version of the Node.js LTS release that includes the features the ESLint team wants to use.</li><li>The Node.js Current release</li></ol><p>ESLint is also expected to work with Node.js versions released after the Node.js Current release.</p><p>Refer to the <a href=\"https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/getting-started#prerequisites\">Quick Start Guide</a> for the officially supported Node.js versions for a given ESLint release.</p><h3>Why doesn't ESLint lock dependency versions?</h3><p>Lock files like  are helpful for deployed applications. They ensure that dependencies are consistent between environments and across deployments.</p><p>Packages like  that get published to the npm registry do not include lock files.  as a user will respect version constraints in ESLint's . ESLint and its dependencies will be included in the user's lock file if one exists, but ESLint's own lock file would not be used.</p><p>We intentionally don't lock dependency versions so that we have the latest compatible dependency versions in development and CI that our users get when installing ESLint in a project.</p><p>We have scheduled releases every two weeks on Friday or Saturday. You can follow a <a href=\"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Arelease\">release issue</a> for updates about the scheduling of any particular release.</p><p>ESLint takes security seriously. We work hard to ensure that ESLint is safe for everyone and that security issues are addressed quickly and responsibly. Read the full <a href=\"https://github.com/eslint/.github/raw/master/SECURITY.md\">security policy</a>.</p><h2>Semantic Versioning Policy</h2><p>ESLint follows <a href=\"https://semver.org\">semantic versioning</a>. However, due to the nature of ESLint as a code quality tool, it's not always clear when a minor or major version bump occurs. To help clarify this for everyone, we've defined the following semantic versioning policy for ESLint:</p><ul><li>Patch release (intended to not break your lint build) \n  <ul><li>A bug fix in a rule that results in ESLint reporting fewer linting errors.</li><li>A bug fix to the CLI or core (including formatters).</li><li>Improvements to documentation.</li><li>Non-user-facing changes such as refactoring code, adding, deleting, or modifying tests, and increasing test coverage.</li><li>Re-releasing after a failed release (i.e., publishing a release that doesn't work for anyone).</li></ul></li><li>Minor release (might break your lint build) \n  <ul><li>A bug fix in a rule that results in ESLint reporting more linting errors.</li><li>A new option to an existing rule that does not result in ESLint reporting more linting errors by default.</li><li>A new addition to an existing rule to support a newly-added language feature (within the last 12 months) that will result in ESLint reporting more linting errors by default.</li><li>An existing rule is deprecated.</li><li>A new CLI capability is created.</li><li>New capabilities to the public API are added (new classes, new methods, new arguments to existing methods, etc.).</li><li>A new formatter is created.</li><li> is updated and will result in strictly fewer linting errors (e.g., rule removals).</li></ul></li><li>Major release (likely to break your lint build) \n  <ul><li> is updated and may result in new linting errors (e.g., rule additions, most rule option updates).</li><li>A new option to an existing rule that results in ESLint reporting more linting errors by default.</li><li>An existing formatter is removed.</li><li>Part of the public API is removed or changed in an incompatible way. The public API includes: \n    <ul><li>Rule, formatter, parser, plugin APIs</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>According to our policy, any minor update may report more linting errors than the previous release (ex: from a bug fix). As such, we recommend using the tilde () in  e.g.  to guarantee the results of your builds.</p><p>Since ESLint is a CommonJS package, there are restrictions on which ESM-only packages can be used as dependencies.</p><p>Packages that are controlled by the ESLint team and have no external dependencies can be safely loaded synchronously using <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#loading-ecmascript-modules-using-require\"></a> and therefore used in any contexts.</p><p>For external packages, we don't use  because a package could add a top-level  and thus break ESLint. We can use an external ESM-only package only in case it is needed only in asynchronous code, in which case it can be loaded using dynamic .</p><p>Copyright OpenJS Foundation and other contributors, &lt;www.openjsf.org&gt;</p><p>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:</p><p>The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.</p><p>THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

The installer guides you through system checks, LLM provider setup, search engine configuration, and security hardening.</p><p><strong>Quick Installation (Linux amd64):</strong></p><pre><code># Create installation directory\nmkdir -p pentagi &amp;&amp; cd pentagi\n\n# Download installer\nwget -O installer.zip https://pentagi.com/downloads/linux/amd64/installer-latest.zip\n\n# Extract\nunzip installer.zip\n\n# Run interactive installer\n./installer\n</code></pre><p><strong>Prerequisites &amp; Permissions:</strong></p><p>The installer requires appropriate privileges to interact with the Docker API for proper operation. By default, it uses the Docker socket () which requires either:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Option 1 (Recommended for production):</strong> Run the installer as root:</p></li><li><p><strong>Option 2 (Development environments):</strong> Grant your user access to the Docker socket by adding them to the  group:</p><pre><code># Add your user to the docker group\nsudo usermod -aG docker $USER\n\n# Log out and log back in, or activate the group immediately\nnewgrp docker\n\n# Verify Docker access (should run without sudo)\ndocker ps\n</code></pre><p>⚠️  Adding a user to the  group grants root-equivalent privileges. Only do this for trusted users in controlled environments. For production deployments, consider using rootless Docker mode or running the installer with sudo.</p></li></ul><ol><li>: Verify Docker, network connectivity, and system requirements</li><li>: Create and configure  file with optimal defaults</li><li>: Set up LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Bedrock, Ollama, Custom)</li><li>: Configure DuckDuckGo, Google, Tavily, Traversaal, Perplexity, Searxng</li><li>: Generate secure credentials and configure SSL certificates</li><li>: Start PentAGI with docker-compose</li></ol><p><strong>For Production &amp; Enhanced Security:</strong></p><p>For production deployments or security-sensitive environments, we  using a distributed two-node architecture where worker operations are isolated on a separate server.

It answers you on the channels you already use (WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, Google Chat, Signal, iMessage, Microsoft Teams, WebChat), plus extension channels like BlueBubbles, Matrix, Zalo, and Zalo Personal. It can speak and listen on macOS/iOS/Android, and can render a live Canvas you control. The Gateway is just the control plane — the product is the assistant.</p><p>If you want a personal, single-user assistant that feels local, fast, and always-on, this is it.</p><p>Preferred setup: run the onboarding wizard () in your terminal. The wizard guides you step by step through setting up the gateway, workspace, channels, and skills. The CLI wizard is the recommended path and works on <strong>macOS, Linux, and Windows (via WSL2; strongly recommended)</strong>. Works with npm, pnpm, or bun. New install?

Read the docs to dive deeper: <a href=\"https://docs.openmercato.com/user-guide/encryption\">docs.openmercato.com/user-guide/encryption</a>.</p><p>We have migrated Open Mercato to a monorepo structure. If you're upgrading from a previous version, please note the following changes:</p><p>The codebase is now organized into:</p><ul><li> - Shared libraries and modules (, , , , , , , , , )</li><li> - Applications (main app in , docs in )</li></ul><p><strong>Important note on storage:</strong> The storage folder has been moved to the  folder as well. If you instance has got any attachments uploaded, please make sure you run:</p><pre><code>mv storage apps/mercato/storage\n</code></pre><p>... from the root Open Mercato folder.</p><p>Import aliases have changed from path-based to package-based imports:</p><ul><li>, , </li><li><code>@open-mercato/shared/lib/...</code>, <code>@open-mercato/ui/components/...</code>, <code>@open-mercato/core/modules/...</code>, etc.</li></ul><p>The  file now must live in  instead of the project root. The fastest way to start is to copy the example file:</p><pre><code>cp apps/mercato/.env.example apps/mercato/.env\n</code></pre><p>At minimum, set , , and  (or ) before bootstrapping.</p><p>Yarn 4 is now required. Ensure you have Yarn 4+ installed before proceeding.</p><p>This is a quickest way to get Open Mercato up and running on your localhost / server - ready for testing / demoing or for !</p><pre><code># macOS (Homebrew)\nbrew install node@24\n\n# Windows (Chocolatey)\nchoco install nodejs --version=24.x\n\n# Or use nvm (any platform)\nnvm install 24\nnvm use 24\n</code></pre><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/open-mercato/open-mercato.git\ncd open-mercato\ngit checkout develop\nyarn install\n\ncp apps/mercato/.env.example apps/mercato/.env # EDIT this file to set up your specific files\n#At minimum, set `DATABASE_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`, and `REDIS_URL` (or `EVENTS_REDIS_URL`) before bootstrapping.\n\nyarn generate\nyarn initialize # or yarn reinstall\nyarn dev\n</code></pre><p>For a fresh greenfield boot (build packages, generate registries, reinstall modules, then start dev), run:</p><p>Navigate to <code>http://localhost:3000/backend</code> and sign in with the default credentials printed by .</p><p>Open Mercato offers two Docker Compose configurations — one for  (with hot reload) and one for . Both run the full stack (app + PostgreSQL + Redis + Meilisearch) in containers. The dev mode is the <strong>recommended setup for Windows</strong> users.</p><p>Run the entire stack with source code mounted from the host. File changes trigger automatic rebuilds — no local Node.js or Yarn required.</p><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/open-mercato/open-mercato.git\ncd open-mercato\ngit checkout develop\ndocker compose -f docker-compose.fullapp.dev.yml up --build\n</code></pre><p> Ensure WSL 2 backend is enabled in Docker Desktop and clone with <code>git config --global core.autocrlf input</code> to avoid line-ending issues.</p><pre><code>docker compose -f docker-compose.fullapp.yml up --build\n</code></pre><ul><li>Start: <code>docker compose -f docker-compose.fullapp.yml up -d</code></li><li>Logs: <code>docker compose -f docker-compose.fullapp.yml logs -f app</code></li><li>Stop: <code>docker compose -f docker-compose.fullapp.yml down</code></li><li>Rebuild: <code>docker compose -f docker-compose.fullapp.yml up --build</code></li></ul><p>Navigate to <code>http://localhost:3000/backend</code> and sign in with the default credentials (<a href=\"mailto:admin@example.com\">admin@example.com</a>).</p><h3>Docker Environment Variables</h3><p>Before starting, you may want to configure the following environment variables. Create a  file in the project root or export them in your shell:</p><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Secret key for JWT token signing. <strong>Use a strong, unique value in production.</strong></td></tr><tr><td>PostgreSQL database password. <strong>Use a strong password in production.</strong></td></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr><td>Meilisearch API key. <strong>Use a strong key in production.</strong></td></tr><tr></tr><tr><td>OpenAI API key (enables AI features)</td></tr><tr><td>Anthropic API key (for opencode service)</td></tr><tr><td>Opencode service exposed port</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Example  file for production:</p><pre><code>JWT_SECRET=your-strong-secret-key-here\nPOSTGRES_PASSWORD=your-strong-db-password\nMEILISEARCH_MASTER_KEY=your-strong-meilisearch-key\nOPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...  # Optional, for AI features\n</code></pre><p>For production deployments, ensure strong , secure database credentials, and consider managed database services. See the <a href=\"https://docs.openmercato.com/installation/setup#docker-deployment-full-stack\">full Docker deployment guide</a> for detailed configuration and production tips.</p><h2>Standalone App &amp; Customization</h2><p>The <strong>recommended way to build on Open Mercato</strong> without modifying the core is to create a standalone app. This gives you a self-contained project that pulls Open Mercato packages from npm — your own modules, overrides, and customizations live in your repo while core stays untouched and upgradeable.</p><pre><code>npx create-mercato-app my-store\ncd my-store\ncp .env.example .env   # configure DATABASE_URL, JWT_SECRET, REDIS_URL\ndocker compose up -d   # start PostgreSQL, Redis, Meilisearch\nyarn install\nyarn initialize\nyarn dev\n</code></pre><p>Navigate to <code>http://localhost:3000/backend</code> and sign in with the credentials printed by .</p><p>Drop your own modules into  and register them in  with :</p><pre><code>export const enabledModules: ModuleEntry[] = [\n  // ... core modules\n  { id: 'inventory', from: '@app' },\n]\n</code></pre><p>Run  and  — your module's pages, APIs, and entities are auto-discovered.</p><h3>Eject core modules for deep customization</h3><p>When you need to change the internals of a core module (entities, business logic, UI),  it.

They only allow conversion between two formats in the same medium (images to images, videos to videos, etc.), and they require that you <em>upload your files to some server</em>.</p><p>This is not just terrible for privacy, it's also incredibly lame. What if you  need to convert an AVI video to a PDF document? Try to find an online tool for that, I dare you.</p><p><a href=\"https://convert.to.it/\">Convert.to.it</a> aims to be a tool that \"just works\". You're almost  to get an output - perhaps not always the one you expected, but it'll try its best to not leave you hanging.</p><ol><li>Click the big blue box to add your file (or just drag it on to the window).</li><li>An input format should have been automatically selected. If it wasn't, yikes! Try searching for it, or if it's really not there, see the \"Issues\" section below.</li><li>Select an output format from the second list. If you're on desktop, that's the one on the right side. If you're on mobile, it'll be somewhere lower down.</li><li>Hopefully, after a bit (or a lot) of thinking, the program will spit out the file you wanted. If not, see the \"Issues\" section below.</li></ol><p>Ever since the YouTube video released, we've been getting spammed with issues suggesting the addition of all kinds of niche file formats. To keep things organized, I've decided to specify what counts as a valid issue and what doesn't.</p><blockquote><p>[!IMPORTANT] <strong>SIMPLY ASKING FOR A FILE FORMAT TO BE ADDED IS NOT A MEANINGFUL ISSUE!</strong></p></blockquote><p>There are thousands of file formats out there. It can take hours to add support for just one. The math is simple - we can't possibly support every single file. As such, simply listing your favorite file formats is not helpful. We already know that there are formats we don't support, we don't need tickets to tell us that.</p><p>When suggesting a file format, you must :</p><ul><li>Make sure that there isn't already an issue about the same thing, and that we don't already support the format.</li><li>Explain what you expect the conversion to be like (what medium is it converting to/from). It's important to note here that simply parsing the underlying data is . Imagine if we only treated SVG images as raw XML data and didn't support converting them to raster images - that would defeat the point.</li><li>Provide links to existing browser-based solutions if possible, or at the very least a reference for implementing the format, and make sure the license is compatible with GPL-2.0.</li></ul><p>If this seems like a lot, please remember - a developer will have to do 100x more work to actually implement the format. Doing a bit of research not only saves them precious time, it also weeds out \"unserious\" proposals that would only bloat our to-do list.</p><p><strong>If you're submitting a bug report,</strong> you only need to do step 1 - check if the problem isn't already reported by someone else. Bug reports are generally quite important otherwise.</p><p>Though please note, \"converting X to Y doesn't work\" is  a bug report. However, \"converting X to Y works but not how I expected\" likely  a bug report.</p><h3>Local development (Bun + Vite)</h3><ol><li>Clone this repository . You can use <code>git clone --recursive https://github.com/p2r3/convert</code> for that. Omitting submodules will leave you missing a few dependencies.</li><li>Run  to install dependencies.</li><li>Run  to start the development server.</li></ol><p><em>The following steps are optional, but recommended for performance:</em></p><p>When you first open the page, it'll take a while to generate the list of supported formats for each tool. If you open the console, you'll see it complaining a bunch about missing caches.</p><p>After this is done (indicated by a <code>Built initial format list</code> message in the console), use <code>printSupportedFormatCache()</code> to get a JSON string with the cache data. You can then save this string to  to skip that loading screen on startup.</p><p>Docker compose files live in the  directory, so run compose with  from the repository root:</p><pre><code>docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d\n</code></pre><p>Alternatively download the  separately and start it by executing  in the same directory.</p><p>This runs the container on <code>http://localhost:8080/convert/</code>.</p><h3>Docker (local build for development)</h3><p>Use the override file to build the image locally:</p><pre><code>docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml -f docker/docker-compose.override.yml up --build -d\n</code></pre><p>The first Docker build is expected to be slow because Chromium and related system packages are installed in the build stage (needed for puppeteer in ). Later builds are usually much faster due to Docker layer caching.</p><p>The best way to contribute is by adding support for new file formats (duh). Here's how that works:</p><p>Each \"tool\" used for conversion has to be normalized to a standard form - effectively a \"wrapper\" that abstracts away the internal processes. These wrappers are available in <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/p2r3/convert/master/src/handlers/\">src/handlers</a>.</p><p>Below is a super barebones handler that does absolutely nothing. You can use this as a starting point for adding a new format:</p><pre><code>// file: dummy.ts\n\nimport type { FileData, FileFormat, FormatHandler } from \"../FormatHandler.ts\";\nimport CommonFormats from \"src/CommonFormats.ts\";\n\nclass dummyHandler implements FormatHandler {\n\n  public name: string = \"dummy\";\n  public supportedFormats?: FileFormat[];\n  public ready: boolean = false;\n\n  async init () {\n    this.supportedFormats = [\n      // Example PNG format, with both input and output disabled\n      CommonFormats.PNG.builder(\"png\")\n        .markLossless()\n        // .allowFrom()\n        // .allowTo()\n    ];\n    this.ready = true;\n  }\n\n  async doConvert (\n    inputFiles: FileData[],\n    inputFormat: FileFormat,\n    outputFormat: FileFormat\n  ): Promise&lt;FileData[]&gt; {\n    const outputFiles: FileData[] = [];\n    return outputFiles;\n  }\n\n}\n\nexport default dummyHandler;\n</code></pre><p>For more details on how all of these components work, refer to the doc comments in <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/p2r3/convert/master/src/FormatHandler.ts\">src/FormatHandler.ts</a>. You can also take a look at existing handlers to get a more practical example.</p><p>There are a few additional things that I want to point out in particular:</p><ul><li>Pay attention to the naming system. If your tool is called , then the class should be called , and the file should be called .</li><li>The handler is responsible for setting the output file's name. This is done to allow for flexibility in rare cases where the  file name matters. Of course, in most cases, you'll only have to swap the file extension.</li><li>The handler is also responsible for ensuring that any byte buffers that enter or exit the handler . If necessary, clone the buffer by wrapping it in .</li><li>When handling MIME types, run them through <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/p2r3/convert/master/src/normalizeMimeType.ts\">normalizeMimeType</a> first. One file can have multiple valid MIME types, which isn't great when you're trying to match them algorithmically.</li><li>When implementing a new file format, please treat the file as the media that it represents, not the data that it contains. For example, if you were making an SVG handler, you should treat the file as an , not as XML.</li></ul><p>If your tool requires an external dependency (which it likely does), there are currently two well-established ways of going about this:</p><ul><li>If it's an  package, just install it to the project like you normally would.</li><li>If it's a Git repository, add it as a submodule to <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/p2r3/convert/master/src/handlers\">src/handlers</a>.</li></ul><p><strong>Please try to avoid CDNs (Content Delivery Networks).</strong> They're really cool on paper, but they don't work well with TypeScript, and each one introduces a tiny bit of instability. For a project that leans heavily on external dependencies, those bits of instability can add up fast.</p><ul><li>If you need to load a WebAssembly binary (or similar), add its path to <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/p2r3/convert/master/vite.config.js\">vite.config.js</a> and target it under . <strong>Do not link to node_modules</strong>.</li></ul>",

Sign in via Qwen OAuth to use it directly, or get an API key from <a href=\"https://modelstudio.console.alibabacloud.com?tab=doc#/doc/?type=model&amp;url=2840914_2&amp;modelId=group-qwen3.5-plus\">Alibaba Cloud ModelStudio</a> to access it through the OpenAI-compatible API.</p></blockquote><p>Qwen Code is an open-source AI agent for the terminal, optimized for <a href=\"https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3-Coder\">Qwen3-Coder</a>. It helps you understand large codebases, automate tedious work, and ship faster.</p><ul><li><strong>Multi-protocol, OAuth free tier</strong>: use OpenAI / Anthropic / Gemini-compatible APIs, or sign in with Qwen OAuth for 1,000 free requests/day.</li><li>: both the framework and the Qwen3-Coder model are open-source—and they ship and evolve together.</li><li><strong>Agentic workflow, feature-rich</strong>: rich built-in tools (Skills, SubAgents) for a full agentic workflow and a Claude Code-like experience.</li><li><strong>Terminal-first, IDE-friendly</strong>: built for developers who live in the command line, with optional integration for VS Code, Zed, and JetBrains IDEs.</li></ul><h3>Quick Install (Recommended)</h3><pre><code>curl -fsSL https://qwen-code-assets.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/installation/install-qwen.sh | bash\n</code></pre><h4>Windows (Run as Administrator CMD)</h4><pre><code>curl -fsSL -o %TEMP%\\install-qwen.bat https://qwen-code-assets.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/installation/install-qwen.bat &amp;&amp; %TEMP%\\install-qwen.bat\n</code></pre><blockquote><p>: It's recommended to restart your terminal after installation to ensure environment variables take effect.</p></blockquote><p>Make sure you have Node.js 20 or later installed. Download it from <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/download\">nodejs.org</a>.</p><pre><code>npm install -g @qwen-code/qwen-code@latest\n</code></pre><pre><code># Start Qwen Code (interactive)\nqwen\n\n# Then, in the session:\n/help\n/auth\n</code></pre><p>On first use, you'll be prompted to sign in. You can run  anytime to switch authentication methods.</p><pre><code>What does this project do?\nExplain the codebase structure.\nHelp me refactor this function.\nGenerate unit tests for this module.\n</code></pre><p>Qwen Code supports two authentication methods:</p><ul><li><strong>Qwen OAuth (recommended &amp; free)</strong>: sign in with your  account in a browser.</li><li>: use an API key to connect to any supported provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google GenAI, Alibaba Cloud Bailian, and other compatible endpoints).</li></ul><p>Choose  and complete the browser flow. Your credentials are cached locally so you usually won't need to log in again.</p><blockquote><p> In non-interactive or headless environments (e.g., CI, SSH, containers), you typically  complete the OAuth browser login flow. In these cases, please use the API-KEY authentication method.</p></blockquote><p>Use this if you want more flexibility over which provider and model to use. Supports multiple protocols:</p><ul><li>: Alibaba Cloud Bailian, ModelScope, OpenAI, OpenRouter, and other OpenAI-compatible providers</li><li>: Gemini models</li></ul><p>The  way to configure models and providers is by editing  (create it if it doesn't exist). This file lets you define all available models, API keys, and default settings in one place.</p><p> Create or edit </p><p>Here is a complete example:</p><pre><code>{\n  \"modelProviders\": {\n    \"openai\": [\n      {\n        \"id\": \"qwen3-coder-plus\",\n        \"name\": \"qwen3-coder-plus\",\n        \"baseUrl\": \"https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1\",\n        \"description\": \"Qwen3-Coder via Dashscope\",\n        \"envKey\": \"DASHSCOPE_API_KEY\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  \"env\": {\n    \"DASHSCOPE_API_KEY\": \"sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxx\"\n  },\n  \"security\": {\n    \"auth\": {\n      \"selectedType\": \"openai\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"model\": {\n    \"name\": \"qwen3-coder-plus\"\n  }\n}\n</code></pre><p> Understand each field</p><table><tbody><tr><td>Declares which models are available and how to connect to them.

The  file is in your home directory and should stay private.</p></blockquote><p>As an open-source terminal agent, you can use Qwen Code in four primary ways:</p><ol><li>Interactive mode (terminal UI)</li><li>Headless mode (scripts, CI)</li><li>IDE integration (VS Code, Zed)</li></ol><p>Run  in your project folder to launch the interactive terminal UI. Use  to reference local files (for example ).</p><pre><code>cd your-project/\nqwen -p \"your question\"\n</code></pre><p>Use  to run Qwen Code without the interactive UI—ideal for scripts, automation, and CI/CD. Learn more: <a href=\"https://qwenlm.github.io/qwen-code-docs/en/users/features/headless\">Headless mode</a>.</p><p>Use Qwen Code inside your editor (VS Code, Zed, and JetBrains IDEs):</p><p>Build on top of Qwen Code with the TypeScript SDK:</p><ul><li> - Display available commands</li><li> - Clear conversation history</li><li> - Compress history to save tokens</li><li> - Show current session information</li><li> - Submit a bug report</li><li> or  - Exit Qwen Code</li></ul><ul><li> - Cancel current operation</li><li> - Exit (on empty line)</li><li> - Navigate command history</li></ul><blockquote><p>: In YOLO mode (), vision switching happens automatically without prompts when images are detected.
