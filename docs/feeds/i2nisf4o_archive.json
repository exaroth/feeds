It opens in any ZIP reader and displays its contents. But the file contains secret data, possibly another file embedded within it.</p><p>With ZIP files, you can hide extra data by knowing how the format is built at a low level. A standard ZIP archive (not ZIP64) has Local File Headers for each file, then their compressed data, followed by a Central Directory with metadata about each file, and finally an End of Central Directory Record that points to the Central Directory’s location.</p><p>Adding hidden data to the end of a ZIP file won’t work because ZIP tools expect the End of Central Directory Record to be last. Adding data at the beginning fails since many programs check the file’s first bytes (magic bytes) to identify its type. Inserting data between file entries is tricky because it requires rewriting the Central Directory File Headers.</p><p>The best way is to insert a hidden file just before the Central Directory File Headers. This moves the Central Directory forward, creates space for the hidden data, and updates one field, the Central Directory Start Offset, in the End of Central Directory Record. This lets ZIP readers find the Central Directory and handle the archive correctly.</p><p>You can recover the hidden data by checking the Central Directory File Headers to find the last file, then moving to the end of that file’s data where the hidden file starts. It ends just before the Central Directory begins.</p><p>This method isn’t meant for strong privacy or security, but it’s a fascinating example of how a deep understanding of file formats enables creative steganography.</p>",

I was just, like, staring and feeling empty.”<p>So he booked a one-way ticket to Madrid and disappeared, “catching up on life stuff.” But as he relaxed, Steinberger watched the AI frenzy begin without him. The desire for the autonomous assistant dragged Steinberger out of retirement “to mess with AI.”</p><p>Three months later, the millennial has received international recognition, what’s likely a six-figure-plus offer from OpenAI, and praise from its founder, Sam Altman, who called him a “genius with a lot of amazing ideas.”</p></p><p>Steinberger’s return to the AI space is as much a story of personal reinvention as it is a professional achievement. Born and raised in rural Austria, he developed an obsession with computers <a href=\"https://eu.36kr.com/en/p/3660257828594306\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:at age 14 when a summer guest introduced him to a PC;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">at age 14 when a summer guest introduced him to a PC</a>. That sparked his interest, leading him to study software engineering at the Vienna University of Technology. Before becoming a founder, he worked as a senior iOS engineer in Silicon Valley and taught mobile development at his alma mater. He used to split his time between London and Vienna, although he recently <a href=\"https://x.com/steipete/status/2023818964602687734?s=20\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:announced;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">announced</a> he was moving to the United States (he didn’t specify where). Steinberger is quiet about his personal life, though he’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2013/11/22/googles-doctor-who-50th-anniversary-doodle-pits-you-against-daleks-cybermen-and-weeping-angels/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:mentioned;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">mentioned</a> he’s a  fan.</p><p>His first major success, PSPDFKit, was apparently bootstrapped in 2011 while he waited six months for a U.S. work visa; he filled the idle time by solving the “simple yet incredibly difficult” problem of PDF rendering on iPads. Over the next 13 years, he grew the company into the gold star of PDF management, with its code powering PDF functionality on over a billion devices for companies like <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/apple/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Apple;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">Apple</a> and <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/dropbox/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Dropbox;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">Dropbox</a>, he told Fridman. Eventually, however, he became bogged down by the “people stuff” required of a CEO: board meetings, conflicts with founders, relentless customer demands, and his battery drained to zero.</p><p>“I felt like Austin Powers where they suck the mojo out,” he told Fridman in a recent, sprawling interview. “I couldn’t get code out anymore. I was just, like, staring and feeling empty.”</p></div><div data-testid=\"read-more\"><p>Despite the professional triumph of <a href=\"https://www.thewantrepreneurshow.com/blog/peter-steinberger-built-a-100m-dev-tool-burned-out-then-came-back-to-code-with-ai-agents-and-never-looked-back/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:a reported €100 million exit;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">a reported €100 million exit</a> in 2023, and the relief of being done, the years of crushing and pushing left Steinberger profoundly hollow. He described the period following his retirement as a search for meaning that no amount of travel, parties, or therapy could resolve.<p>“If you wake up in the morning, and you have nothing to look forward to, you have no real challenge, that gets very boring, very fast,” Steinberger told Fridman.</p></p><p>It wasn’t until April 2025 that he felt the spark return, realized through a relatively simple attempt to build a <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/twitter/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Twitter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">Twitter</a> analysis tool. He discovered that AI had undergone a “paradigm shift” and could now handle the repetitive plumbing of code, allowing him to return to the more high-minded act of building. Now, Steinberger, who recently said he’s moving to the U.S. after being bogged down by pesky European regulations, is defining himself not as a traditional CEO but a “full-time open-sourcerer” of the agentic revolution.</p><p>At its core, <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/02/12/openclaw-ai-agents-security-risks-beware/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:OpenClaw is an autonomous AI agent;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">OpenClaw is an autonomous AI agent</a> that acts as a digital employee, running on a user’s local machine. Unlike standard models that wait for a prompt, OpenClaw is “always on,” capable of managing emails and controlling web browsers to complete workflows, especially through messaging apps like WhatsApp or Telegram. This autonomy gained popularity with the launch of Moltbook, a Reddit-style social network designed exclusively for AI agents, filled with posts about manifestos, consciousness, and other agent-related topics.</p><p>Yet despite the levity, experts have <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/02/02/moltbook-security-agents-singularity-disaster-gary-marcus-andrej-karpathy/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:warned;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">warned</a> that autonomous agents carry multiple risks: Their margin of error is too high; they could go rogue; and they’re susceptible to malware.</p><p>The project, which Steinberger has rebranded multiple times—evolving from Clawdbot to Moltbot and finally to OpenClaw—largely owing to politics—has expanded at a pace that startles even seasoned AI experts. By early February, the framework had surpassed 145,000 GitHub stars, a record, and recorded peak traffic of 2 million visitors in just one week.</p><p>But that rapid ascent has also brought significant challenges for Steinberger. He said he navigated a very high-profile disagreement with Anthropic over the project’s original name, and his attempts to transition his digital handles were complicated by bad actors associated with cryptocurrency who briefly hijacked his accounts.</p><p>“I was close to crying,” he admitted to Fridman, saying he was close to deleting the project given his exhaustion from managing the viral sensation and serving as his own legal and security team. “I was like, ‘I did show you the future, you build it.’”</p><p>But Steinberger persevered and built it himself, motivated by the “magic” he saw when the agents began solving problems he hadn’t explicitly programmed them for, such as transcribing voice messages or even proactively checking on his well-being after surgery.</p><p><a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/02/17/what-openais-openclaw-hire-says-about-the-future-of-ai-agents/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:The decision to join OpenAI,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">The decision to join OpenAI,</a> announced on Feb. 15, marks the conclusion of his period as a solo builder. Steinberger said he was losing up to $10K a month on the server, and that he‘d had multiple opportunities—including personal outreach from Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg. However, he ultimately chose OpenAI to gain access to the “latest toys” required to scale his vision.</p><p>But the move has drawn controversy. OpenClaw, an open-source model, became something of a philosophical challenge to an AI status quo dominated by a few, centralized, and massive players. Steinberger said he built it around a “local-first” architecture, allowing users to run their assistants on their own hardware and maintain their memories in simple Markdown files, rather than locking personal data in a corporate cloud. <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/openais-openclaw-hire-sparks-praise-memes-rivalry-chatter-2026-2\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Critics;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\">Critics</a> questioned whether the company was selling out by ceding to OpenAI so quickly.</p><p>Steinberger said that to preserve the project’s community-driven roots, OpenClaw will now move into an independent, open-source foundation supported by OpenAI.</p><p>“I told them, ‘I don’t do this for the money,’” he told Fridman. “I want to have fun and have impact, and that’s ultimately what made my decision.”</p></div>",

      "content": "<p>When I first encountered sampling about a year ago, I knew only about head- and tail-based sampling. Mainly because most mainstream documentation covered primarily about them.</p><p>But recently, I realised I’d only been looking at the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>Let’s look at them in greater detail.</p><p>To put it simply, it’s head-based sampling, but centrally controlled. Each service fetches sampling rules from a central config server. You can specify default and per-endpoint rates in a JSON file, and applications poll for updates periodically. If you are still wondering what the bigger deal is, it is that we can increase or decrease the sampling rate during incidents by changing this file, and within a minute, the applications pick up the new sampling rates. </p><p>That is quite powerful. Despite being battle-tested (used in Uber!), there’s surprisingly little documentation in OpenTelemetry. Users often struggle to enable Jaeger-style remote sampling with OTel. Some resort to running a Jaeger agent solely to serve the sampling config. OpenTelemetry supports it, but there is very little documentation. Remote sampling lets you keep a low baseline sample rate (say, 1-5%) most of the time and only ramp up to 50-100% when needed, such as during an incident or a debugging session. Because you don’t need a redeploy, teams are more likely to actually adjust rates to control costs or get details when it matters.</p><p>It’s essentially head-based sampling that guarantees a fixed sample size. Instead of a simple random percentage, a reservoir sampler maintains a rolling buffer of traces, retaining exactly N traces per time window by using a discrete set of sampling rates and consistency algorithms to ensure fair selection.</p><p>Probabilistic sampling yields a variable number of samples, i.e if traffic doubles, so do your sampled traces and costs. Reservoir sampling always uses a fixed sample size. It’s statistically representative because the algorithm rotates items in the reservoir with uniform probability.</p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/connector/spanmetricsconnector/README.md\" rel=\"\">Span Metrics</a><a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/connector/servicegraphconnector/README.md\" rel=\"\">Service Graph</a></p><p>In an OTel Collector, we might chain a spanmetrics connector in the pipeline, then a Sampling processor after it. SpanMetrics will emit metrics (RED metrics such as request rate, error count, latency distributions, service call graphs, etc.) for every span that passes through, so you get complete coverage. Then the sampler (head or tail) drops, say, 95% of spans before storage. The result is that our monitoring dashboards and alerts, which rely on metrics, remain 100% correct, while your trace storage volume is only 5% of raw traffic.</p><p><em>ingesting at most 10 MB of trace data per second.</em></p><p>It uses a token bucket algorithm, which is common for rate limiting, but the tokens represent bytes. The collector actually measures the size of each trace in bytes, using the protobuf serialised size to accurately account for how much data each trace would consume. You configure a sustained bytes-per-second rate and a burst capacity. For example:</p><pre><code><code>policies:\n  - name: volume-limit\n    type: bytes_limiting\n    bytes_limiting:\n      bytes_per_second: 10485760  # 10 MB per second\n      burst_capacity: 20971520   # allow bursts up to 20 MB\n\n</code></code></pre><p>If a few gigantic traces arrive, the processor will quickly use up the token budget and start dropping subsequent traces until the rate falls back under 10 MB/s. Conversely, if traces are small, more can pass through until the aggregate size hits the limit.</p><p>This becomes extremely useful when trace sizes vary a lot. For instance, one request might normally produce a 50 KB trace, but a worst-case code path might generate a 5 MB trace. A standard sampler working per-trace might keep both equally, but the latter one trace costs as much as 100 smaller ones.</p><p>Adaptive sampling adjusts trace sampling rates in real-time based on live traffic patterns or performance signals. The goal here is to keep overall data volume within budget while dynamically increasing sampling during anomalous events. For instance, you might normally sample only a small percentage of requests, but automatically raise the sample rate when latency or error rates spike beyond an SLO threshold. One strategy is throughput-based adaptation; setting an upper limit on traces per second and letting the system tune the probability to meet that cap. Another is key-based dynamic sampling, where the collector samples frequent events less and rare events more.</p><p>Adaptive schemes keep observability costs predictable by avoiding oversampling during high-traffic periods, yet they can temporarily boost fidelity when something goes wrong.</p><blockquote><p><em>Care must be taken to ensure coordination across distributed services so that increasing sampling doesn’t overload the system or skew the data.</em></p></blockquote>",

Probably more often than you were able (or willing) to count. And it does not stop there. If we do not immediately learn the stuff as advised by the person uttering such phrases, we will lose our jobs and never get a job again. Our existences will be . And this will be solely our fault because we did not listen and obey.</p><p>Fear-mongering at its best. Not only AI investors and vendors flood us with such messages. Also, all the wannabe profiteers of AI jumped on the fear-mongering bandwagon and flooded us with such messages – oftentimes having a remedy in place for the exchange of some money.</p><p>And so we stand here, with such messages hollered into our faces day by day, and ask ourselves: Are we “left behind” if we do not immediately learn all that AI magic?</p><p>I thought about this question for a bit. Do we really need to pick up all that daily changing and evolving AI and agentic stuff to not be “left behind?”</p><p>The short answer I came up with is:</p><blockquote><p>No, you are not left behind if you do not immediately pick up everything AI and agentic.</p><p>However, ignoring it is not an option either.</p></blockquote><p>I.e., there are things you should not ignore, but these are not the things you are usually told you must not ignore. Sounds cryptic? Probably yes – at least without further explanation. Thus, let me unpack my answer.</p><p>Let us begin with a look at the current state of AI solutions. I took software development as an example domain because it is probably the domain where AI penetration is highest and, with it, the fear-mongering is also highest. So, what is the current state of the art in AI-driven software development?</p><p>AI solutions meanwhile can create impressive solutions if we slice the problem small enough, give them enough context, and it is a well-known problem. If we feed them too large a chunk of work or if we do not provide enough context, it often becomes a game of chance if we get a good solution.</p><p>Regarding the context that needs to be provided: Such context descriptions can easily become several thousand words if working with agentic solutions. Additionally, it needs to be provided a bit differently for each agent framework and each model to create the desired results.</p><p>If the problem we need to solve is not a well-known one, i.e., if the underlying LLMs lack sufficient training examples in their corpus, more often than not the AI solutions are not able to come up with a reasonable solution. Luckily, most of the time we tend to solve well-known problems (I discussed this in more detail in my former post <a href=\"https://ufried.com/blog/ai_assisted_coding/\">“Solving the wrong problem”</a>). Therefore, this issue strikes less often than we might expect. Still, depending on the problem you attempt to solve, it may strike.</p><p>Then, there is another issue: If you talk to serious power users, all of them tell you the same story: The AI solutions drift off. For a while, they produce good results and then they start to drift off. They stop doing what you told them to do and start doing different things. There are recommended “best practices” to deal with this drifting, like, e.g., feeding the AI solution the whole context before every single task, or reminding it in some other way. Then the solutions drift off less often – but they still drift off sometimes. Therefore, we always need a human in the loop who checks if the result meets the demands.</p><p>And even if everything is set up perfectly, the AI solutions still tend to make mistakes sometimes. They have become a lot better, especially over the last few months. However, they still tend to make mistakes. The problem with such mistakes is that they are very different from mistakes a human would make. Oftentimes, they are subtle, odd, and hard to spot. Still, they would create a mess if released to production. This is another reason why we always need a human in the loop.</p><p>If we put all this together, take a step back from the hype and look at it dispassionately, the current state of AI-based software basically looks like:</p><ul><li>Slice everything down into small chunks, or you may be out of luck.</li><li>Make sure it is a well-known problem, or you may be out of luck.</li><li>Provide a lot of context, or you may be out of luck.</li><li>Provide the context and the instructions over and over again, or you may be out of luck.</li><li>But no matter what you do, sometimes you are out of luck.</li></ul><p>This sounds a lot like dealing with an apprentice suffering from attention deficit. We slice the task down into small bites, complement it with lots of additional information, and repeat everything over and over again.</p><p>The most ironic part: As I already mentioned in <a href=\"https://ufried.com/blog/ai_assisted_coding/#better-documentation-to-the-rescue\">“Solving the wrong problem”</a>, a big key to success is providing good requirements, good architectural framing, good context, etcetera. The lack of all this is exactly what developers suffered from in the past decades. Most companies actively prevented good requirements, architecture and context engineering due to their efficiency and feature obsession. It was the biggest impediment for developers when they tried to deliver reliable code timely. Requirements sucked. Architecture sucked. Context sucked. Developers pointed out the problems time and again and were turned down. But for AI agents, everyone accepts it as a must-have. </p><p>But that is just an ironic side effect I consider worth mentioning. Nevertheless, the main point is that AI agents still behave like an apprentice suffering from an attention deficit if we look dispassionately at the current state of affairs.</p><p>When confronted with this observation, the regular AI aficionado will tell you that things are so much better than they were a year or two ago.</p><p>And they are right. Things are a lot better than they were a year ago. On the other hand, this is the least we should expect from the hundreds of billions that were spent on AI in the last year or two. If we would not see any significant improvement from spending this insane amount of money, something would be completely off.</p><p>Still, agentic AI does not feel like a mature technology but like a technology that is still in its early infancy. And this brings me to the point why I do not think we are left behind if we do not immediately go all-in on AI and agentic AI.</p><p>If I look at the current state of AI solutions, using AI-based software development as an example, I see something I have seen many times before: technology in its early infancy. If you are as old as I am, you may remember the times when it was crucial to know</p><ul><li>how to set process priorities and nice levels appropriately when starting processes on UNIX machines because otherwise the scheduler often accidentally starved crucial processes.</li><li>the memory layout of a PC and how to squeeze the last bit out of the lower 640 KB to start bigger DOS applications because otherwise they did not start.</li><li>which hints to add to SQL queries because otherwise the optimizer would mess up the access plans.</li><li>how container resource virtualization worked and which disk drivers (not) to use because otherwise disk access became unbearably slow.</li></ul><p>And so on. The current state of AI tools feels a lot like this. We need to know a lot of “magic” to get the thing working properly – sort of. Yes, things became a lot more powerful over the last 2 years, but if we are honest, they still feel quite immature and brittle.</p><p>This is not a drama. This is a normal evolution we experience with every young and immature technology, and we can draw from other technologies how things will evolve:</p><ul><li>UNIX schedulers became better and better, and eventually nobody needed to set process priorities and nice levels anymore. Today, people start processes on UNIX machines without knowing these concepts.</li><li>DOS was replaced by Windows, including practical memory virtualization concepts, and eventually nobody needed to know about the 640 KB memory barrier anymore. Today, people start applications on PCs without knowing these concepts.</li><li>Database optimizers became better and better, and eventually nobody needed to add hints anymore. Today, people create and run SQL queries without knowing these concepts.</li><li>Container resource drivers became better and better, and eventually people created and ran containers without caring about which drivers to use. Today, people use containers without knowing these concepts.</li></ul><p>I am sure you have detected the pattern. All that “arcane” knowledge that is crucial in the early days of a new technology eventually becomes irrelevant. More importantly, people were able to enter the realm later without knowing all that stuff. They were able to focus simply on the upsides of the technology and were more productive without needing to burden themselves with all those quirky details.</p><p>And this is exactly what we are going to see with AI, too.</p><p>The tools will become better and better, and eventually, all that secret arcane knowledge currently needed to get useful results will become obsolete. It will become straightforward to use those tools and eventually they will simply work as expected (maybe never perfectly reliably due to the functioning principle of LLMs, but that is another story).</p><p>This is why I say you are not left behind if you do not immediately jump on the bandwagon. And this is why I advise you not to buy the secret recipe from some AI aficionado who promises to share their secret AI sauce for money after a round of fear-mongering. Whatever they tell you about which tricks you need to apply to become an AI winner, this knowledge will be obsolete in a year. The technology will evolve, and the secret recipes of today will be either worthless or built into the AI tools in a year.</p><p>I mean, do you still remember the fuss people made about “prompt engineering” two years ago? The way you needed to write prompts to increase the probability of getting a useful response from an LLM? A whole training industry emerged in no time, with everyone selling their secret sauce to success. Companies looking for prompt engineers, partially offering ridiculous salaries. And today? Basically obsolete knowledge. The models and the agent frameworks have become so much better that all this knowledge from a year ago is hardly worth anything anymore.</p><p>Hence, from a tooling perspective, it could be even better to wait a bit until the usage of the tools becomes straightforward and we do not need to know secret handshakes and other quirky rituals anymore to get the expected results from them.</p><h2>The inflection point trap</h2><p>However, before you think you can safely ignore AI for the next 2 or 3 years because the technology is not yet mature, there is a catch – which brings me to the second part of my answer at the beginning of this post.</p><p>The catch is not about the tooling and what you need to know to get useful results. It is about not missing the inflection point. Let me share a quick story from the past to explain what I mean:</p><p>I knew some guys back in the early 1990s who were convinced that Windows will never make it on a PC, that DOS will persist as the dominant OS. Windows was still in its infancy and working with it was a mess back then (if you worked with Windows 3.0 as I did, you know what I mean). Developing Windows applications was even messier. The API was cumbersome, relevant parts undocumented, and the whole OS was everything but stable. Therefore, those guys came to the conclusion that ignoring Windows and continuing developing DOS applications was a safe bet.</p><p>For a while, this was fine. But gradually, things became unpleasant.</p><p>The problem was that those guys ignored the ongoing development of Windows after they made their choice. This way, they were still solely focused on DOS when it became obvious that DOS was a goner. But at this point in time, it was too late for them to migrate their business to the meanwhile dominant Windows. They were actually left behind. Their accumulated knowledge and experience had become worthless, and they basically needed to start from scratch – against competitors with years of experience.</p><p>They did not run into the problem because they did not immediately go all-in when Windows became popular. They ran into the problem because they missed the ongoing evolution of Windows and how the market shifted over time. With that, they missed the relevant inflection points: the first inflection point being when it became necessary to add Windows development to their portfolio (while still being able to make a living from DOS development), and the second inflection point being when it became time to let go of DOS and completely focus on Windows development.</p><p>When applying this story to AI, it becomes clear that completely ignoring the evolution of AI is probably not a good idea, even if the technology is still in its infancy. It is important to understand how the technology evolves and where the market is heading to not miss the inflection points, the one when it becomes relevant to add AI to our portfolio and the other one when the market demands it as our sole approach, leaving our former approach behind.</p><h2>Applying it to software development</h2><p>Looking at AI in the realm of software development, we realize a bit paradoxical situation. Even though the technology is obviously still in its infancy, we face a significant market demand towards using it. Usually, the market majority picks up a technology only after it has reached a certain degree of maturity. Before, only the innovators and early adopters tended to use it.</p><p>With AI, it is somewhat different. The AI investors and vendors relentlessly pushed their intrusive and fear-mongering marketing messages, backed by billions of dollars, trying to game the market and make the majority pick up AI earlier than they usually would. And to a certain degree, their strategy was successful. AI was picked up by the mainstream a lot earlier than the tooling reached the usually required maturity – especially in software development.</p><p>As a consequence, the first inflection point is about now in software development. Even if the tooling is still in its infancy, the market is crying for AI-based software development. I know that I wrote several times about the risks and challenges of AI-based coding, and I am still convinced that many companies will face some very unpleasant surprises, naively calling for AI-based coding without thoroughly preparing for it. Nevertheless, it becomes increasingly risky to ignore AI in software development completely.</p><p>This does not mean that you need to go all-in immediately. It especially does not mean you need to learn all those secret recipes needed to convince the still immature tooling to do exactly what you expect. But you should familiarize yourself well enough with the possibilities and limitations of AI-based coding to be able to use it if needed and understand the ongoing evolution. Doing this, you will acquire some knowledge that will be worthless in a year. And maybe you will not immediately become an “AI rockstar”. But that is okay. It is about understanding the development of the technology, the evolution of its possibilities and limitations.</p><p>In other domains, the first inflection point may not yet have come. Still, keeping an eye on the ongoing evolution is probably a good idea.</p><p>It is not yet clear when the second inflection point will be. It may be in a few months. It may be in a few years. It may be later. It may never arrive. We do not know yet. Even if the predictions are that it will be in 2 or 3 years, there are still so many unknowns that may drive the future evolution of the technology in a completely different direction. Therefore, we cannot say for sure yet when this will happen. Nevertheless, at least at the moment the probability that we will reach the second inflection point is a lot higher than that we will never reach it.</p><p>Overall, this means, even if we already need to pick up AI-based software development while the tooling is still in its infancy, we are not left behind if we do not know all the tricks and secret recipes needed to get the desired results from the still immature tooling. Regarding the tooling, time will work for us, not against us. But we still need to understand AI-based software development well enough to understand when the second inflection point is about to come.</p><p>In other domains, you may have the advantage of not yet having to fight against immature tooling because the first inflection point may happen later in those domains – at the point in time when technology maturity reaches a level we are normally used to.</p><p>Many people, especially the (wannabe) profiteers of AI, want to make us believe that if we do not go all-in with AI  and learn all those tools and tricks on how to get them properly working, we would be left behind.</p><p>This is not true. We are not left behind if we do not learn all the tools and the secret recipes needed to get them (halfway) properly working.</p><p>If we look at the state of the current tooling, we realize it is still in its infancy, far from being mature. We know from many examples of the past that knowing all the quirks needed to get immature tools working properly quickly becomes irrelevant knowledge. Therefore, you are not left behind if you do not know perfectly how to use the currently available tools. Actually, most of the knowledge you accumulate today will be worthless in a year or so.</p><p>However, especially in software development, it is quite likely that AI-based software development will eventually become the predominant paradigm and the tools will mature. Therefore, it is highly advisable not to ignore AI-based software development even if the tooling is still highly immature. Instead, it is important to follow the evolution and understand the technology well enough to know when the inflection points arrive.</p><p>While the first inflection point – when we need to add AI-based software development to our portfolio – is now even if the technology is still immature (due to massive market gaming of AI investors and vendors), we do not know yet for sure when the second inflection point will arrive, i.e. when AI-based software development will become predominant.</p><ul><li>The secret recipes of the (wannabe) AI experts are not the important part when it comes to being “left behind” or not. Most of today’s expert knowledge will be worthless in a year because the technology evolves quickly and is still far from mature.</li><li>Completely ignoring the technology and its evolution on the other side is risky because you may miss the point when you need to pick it up. Then you actually may be left behind and have to start over from scratch, which may be very hard.</li></ul><p>Thus, my conclusive recommendation is:</p><blockquote><p>Do not fall for the fear-mongering messages regarding AI.</p><p>Still, watch the AI evolution closely enough to be prepared when the inflection points arrive.</p></blockquote><p>Or, as a meditation teacher might phrase it: “Find a relaxed, yet alert position” … ;)</p>",

      "content": "<p>Hi, I am on my way to becoming a better engineer. So I am building stuff that people don't build and learn outside their job. I am currently learning about operating systems and how they work. But instead of following the old textbook reading approach, I am doing this by building some projects along the way. In order to understand processes, I have decided to build a shell from scratch. This is part one of this series, and there will be 2 parts. We will be building a full-function shell from scratch.</p><p>A shell is a program that acts as an interface between you and your operating system. It reads commands given by the user and gives them to the operating system for execution. Consider it as a command-line interpreter which will take commands from you and interpret them in a suitable way so that your operating system can execute them. Finally, it will return you the output.</p><p>Many people think that shell and terminal are the same things. But that's not true; a terminal is a graphical user interface where you can type commands. Whereas a shell is a baseline component that accepts commands and processes them. We are not going to build a terminal. We are going to build a shell.</p><p>But don't worry; you will be able to execute commands in that as well.</p><p>We are not going to use any external library. We are just going to use the  and Linux concepts practically.</p><ol><li>Create a new child process and execute command there.</li><li>Wait for child process to complete.</li></ol><p>Some of the you will think, \"What is this 'process'?\" Let me give you a crash course.</p><p>A process is a running program. Programs are stored on the hard disc or SSD in some executable format. Understand with an example. Google Chrome is installed on your computer. It resides in your storage disc (HDD or SSD). When you double-click on it, it magically opens. The magic behind this is that</p><ol><li>OS loads the program from disk to RAM.</li><li>RAM is where currently opened programmes are stored because RAM is quickly accessible.</li><li>CPU starts executing your program.</li></ol><p>Now Google Chrome has become a process.</p><p>When a process creates another process, the created process is called the child process, and the creator process is called the parent process.</p><pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;\n\nint main(int argc, char** argv) {\n    int pid;\n    pid = fork();\n\n    printf(\"fork() returned: %d\\n\", pid);\n\n    if (pid == 0) {\n        printf(\"Child process.\\n\");\n    } else {\n        printf(\"Parent process.\\n\");\n    }\n    return 0;\n}</code></pre><p>Can you guess the output of the above code?</p><pre><code>fork() returned: 69808\nParent process.\nfork() returned: 0\nChild process.</code></pre><p>A process can use a system call \"fork\" to create another process. The created process will start executing the same instructions that the parent process is going to execute. It will also get a copy of the same address space of its parent process. Understand that address space is an area of memory that can be used by this process so that it does not interfere with other process data.</p><p>The fork() system call will return the ID of the created process. It will return zero for the child process and an unknown negative number for the parent process. That's why we added a simple if statement that distinguishes between which process is running.</p><div data-layout=\"minimal\"><div><div><a href=\"https://sushantdhiman.substack.com\">\n                            Subscribe\n                        </a></div></div></div><h4>Why do we need to know about processes?</h4><p>You need to know about processes because processes are the building blocks of shell. If you recall the working of a shell, you will notice that we need to create child processes for the commands. Our shell will run as a parent process, and all the commands will run as child processes.</p><pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;string.h&gt;\n\n#define MAX_INPUT 1024\n\n\nint main() {\n\tchar input[MAX_INPUT];\n\n\twhile (1) {\n\t\tprintf(\"mysh&gt; \");\n\t\tfflush(stdout);\n\n\t\tif (fgets(input, MAX_INPUT, stdin) == NULL)\n\t\t\tbreak;\n\n\t\tinput[strcspn(input, \"\\n\")] = 0;\n\n\t\tif (strlen(input) == 0)\n\t\t\tcontinue;\n\n\t\tif (strcmp(input, \"exit\") == 0)\n\t\t\tbreak;\n\t}\n\n\treturn 0;\n}</code></pre><p>This code gives us a basic anatomy of our shell. It will accept commands from the user and does nothing. But if a user sends \"exit\", it will break the loop and stop the program.</p><p>Let's implement some command execution functionality to our shell. After validating that our command is not empty and not \"exit\", we can spawn a child process that will be responsible for executing the command.</p><pre><code>pid_t pid = fork();\n\nif (pid == 0) {\n    // Child Process will process command here.\n} else {\n    // Parent will wait until child process completes.\n    wait(NULL);\n}</code></pre><p>But here is an issue. I told you that when we create a new process using the fork() system call, it will create an exact copy of the parent process. Including its source code, static variables, stack, heap, opened files and address space. The child process will start executing the source code of the parent process.</p><p>Let's say a user entered the \"ls\" command in our shell. This command will print all the files and folders in the current directory.</p><p>You need to understand that the commands we run in our terminal are also executables. Go to the \"/bin\" directory on your computer and see what files are listed there. You will see several commands you use in your daily work.</p><p>So this means that when you write \"ls\" inside your terminal, a program stored at location \"/bin\" is executed. Running \"ls\" and \"/bin/ls\" won't make any difference, as the shell you are currently using does this automatically for you. We are going to do the same thing. Inside our child process, instead of running code of parent process we will replace it with code of command user gave.</p><h4>Introducing execv Systemcall</h4><p>This is the most important system call for building a shell. It does a simple thing. Replace the image of the currently executing process with another program/process.</p><p>It's important to understand the working of this system call. It takes 2 arguments.</p><ol><li>Path of the program we want to run.</li><li>Arguments for that program.</li></ol><p>So if we want to run the \"ls\" command, the path will be \"/bin/ls\". This second argument of the execv syscall is a bit confusing.</p><p>Let's say we are running the command \"ls\", so our second argument to the execv syscall will be a string array with the following contents.</p><pre><code>char *args[] = {\"ls\", NULL};</code></pre><p>But if we want to run the command \"ls -a\" (this lists hidden files and folders as well), our string array will look like this.</p><pre><code>char *args[] = {\"ls\", \"-a\", NULL};</code></pre><p>So execv will use the 1st argument to load a program stored somewhere on disc, and it will use the 2nd argument to supply arguments to the loaded program. The loaded program will start running as a process, and finally execv will replace the image of our current child process with the loaded program's process.</p><p>The NULL at the end of the args array tells the C compiler where to look. It's a kind of signal to the compiler telling it, \"Hey, bro, stop here. No need to access more. Just start the program.\"</p><pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;string.h&gt;\n#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;\n#include &lt;sys/wait.h&gt;\n\n#define MAX_INPUT 1024\n\n\nint main() {\n\tchar input[MAX_INPUT];\n\n\twhile (1) {\n\t\tprintf(\"mysh&gt; \");\n\t\tfflush(stdout);\n\n\t\tif (fgets(input, MAX_INPUT, stdin) == NULL)\n\t\t\tbreak;\n\n\t\tinput[strcspn(input, \"\\n\")] = 0;\n\n\t\tif (strlen(input) == 0)\n\t\t\tcontinue;\n\n\t\tif (strcmp(input, \"exit\") == 0)\n\t\t\tbreak;\n\n\t\tpid_t pid = fork();\n\n\t\tif (pid == 0) {\n\t\t\tchar *args[] = {\"ls\", \"-a\", NULL};\n\t\t\texecv(\"/bin/ls\", args);\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\t// Parent will wait until child process completes.\n\t\t\twait(NULL);\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\treturn 0;\n}</code></pre><p>Now if we run this program and give it some input that is not \"exit\", it will execute the \"ls -a\" command just like your terminal does.</p><div data-layout=\"minimal\"><div><div><a href=\"https://sushantdhiman.substack.com\">\n                            Subscribe\n                        </a></div></div></div><p>This was a very, very basic implementation of shell. I won't even call it standard because it just executes 1 command. I've done the following things in my personal shell implementation:</p><ol><li>Dynamic Command Execution</li><li>Commands piping (ls | grep 'a' | sort)</li></ol><p>I'll write part 2 of this post, which will have most of the features that a shell has.

These include, but are not limited to:</p><ul><li>\"Skeletons\" or \"boilerplate\"</li><li>Things that use the unsafe package in a way that really is quite unsafe and shouldn't be used by anyone (most notably trying to cast structs in and out of byte arrays)</li><li>Configuration management libraries (e.g., \"get your config from environment variables or YAML or TOML or...\")</li><li>MCP servers or frameworks</li><li>Tools for interacting with LLMs, such as the \"command line chat with LLMs\" or \"make Git commits with LLMs\"</li><li>Functional Programming libraries, especially \"Option\" libraries</li><li>Job scheduling libraries, especially cron clones</li><li>Text or HTML templating systems</li></ul><p>None of these projects are forbidden from the front page, but the apparent effort bar will be move somewhat higher.</p><p>If your purpose is for review or feedback, please be clear about <em>the amount of AI coding used</em>, and if relevant, the amount of effort put into the project, which should be reflected in the project itself.</p><p>Using AI coding tools is not a disqualification for posting. However, in order to align the effort of creating a post-worthy project with reviewing it. <strong>the subreddit will remove posts for \"vibe-coded\" projects with little human input</strong>. This is not because such projects are \"bad\", but precisely because as mentioned they are so easy to put out they are no longer noteworthy.</p><p>It is also a bad use of human time to review AI code. Nobody learns anything from that.</p><p>As with our other AI policies, this will include any human-generated projects that look like this as well, to prevent rules-lawyering about exactly what this means.</p><p>It is often unclear to the community what the purpose of a post is. For example, if a project is posted for review, the community may react in one way, whereas if it is to bring attention to a production-quality repo, that's another standard.</p><p>Please try to be clear about what the purpose is. The goal here is clarity. There are many valid purposes, we just want to know what your intention is.</p><p>Every project on GitHub is described as a scalable, feature-rich, minimalist, high-performance, idiomatic, reliable, etc. etc. project. Project with thousands of commits, dozens of contributors, and massive industry deployment describe themselves that way, as does some programmer's one-week passion project that's barely unit tested.</p><p>It is fine to  for a project to  things, but we are going to be looking more skeptically at projects that describe themselves as these things when they clearly do not have the real-world deployment experience to be claiming these attributes.</p><p>Please carefully distinguish between the  of a project and the  it can concretely claim. We should be able to tell whether this project is intended to be suitable for production use or not; a clear statement won't hurt but is not necessary as long as the rest of the post is clear.</p><p>Again, we seek , not any particular maturity level! It is completely fine to post immature code bases whose results are basically \"it passes the unit tests most of the time\" for review or highlight. We just seek honesty in the description.</p><p>A Reddit post is not a good place to dump your entire README.md. Please try to concisely describe the project and why it is of interest, and let the README.md do its job of filling in the details. The subreddit will be coming down harder on long, flabby posts that should be linked README.md files. Think \"a couple of paragraphs\" rather than \"a couple of pages\".</p><p>If you must use an LLM to post your summary to the Go subreddit, please:</p><ul><li>Do not use emoji. This will be automatically blocked.</li><li>Prompt your LLM to  and/or post the  of a particular release, and don't be afraid to trim it down even so. Less is more in a Reddit post.</li></ul><p>Note that using LLMs to generate blog posts or comments remains forbidden.</p><p>LLMs  to slather the adjectives on to projects as mentioned above in the goals vs. result section.

Part of good marketing is reading the room. The Reddit Golang community is a highly-online community of people who have on average have been around the block a few times, and find this sort of marketing almost viscerally repellent. This is not some sort of flex; it is my assessment based on long observation. When this is removed, the moderators are not preventing you from receiving your inevitable upvotes, they're saving you from getting hard-flagged by numerous participants and possibly rousing the ire of the general Reddit spam algorithms as a result.</p><p>Being simple, direct, and honest without these \"engagement hooks\" has repeatedly proved to be a much better strategy for everyone.</p>",

Sent out today was a round of Rust fixes for Linux 7.0 that includes preparations for the upcoming Rust 1.95 release.\n<p>Rust 1.95 is being branched from master on 27 February and aiming for its stable release on 16 April. Rust 1.95 stabilizes if let guards, changing some ports to tier 2 status, and various other </p><a href=\"https://releases.rs/docs/1.95.0/\">changes</a>.\n<p>For Linux 7.0 they are now passing the \"</p>\" flag that will be required by the Rust 1.95 release. The -Zunstable-options allows for the use of other new, unstable command line options.\n<p>For the kernel's irq module, there is a missing bound detected by the in-development Rust 1.95 code to be addressed. With the pin-init crate was also a Clippy warning that changed behavior with the upcoming Rust 1.95 release.\n</p><p>Meanwhile this round of Rust fixes for Linux 7.0 also fixes an objtool warning when using the older Rust 1.84 release plus a fix to the list module to address missing \"unsafe\" blocks  and placeholder safety comments to macros.\n</p><p>More details on these Rust fixes sent out today for Linux 7.0 to focus on future Rust 1.95 compatibility can be found via </p><a href=\"https://lore.kernel.org/rust-for-linux/20260221203306.133927-1-ojeda@kernel.org/\">this pull request</a>.",

It also had a robust SCSI driver for tape drives (unlike Slackware 2...), but I quickly abandoned SCSI use for external devices and focused on having a functional Linux system.</p><p>As of now, I am attempting to build a newer version of GCC (last version built for Deb3 was 2.95.6) in order to build the closest to supported OpenSSL library so I can access HTTPS websites to pull git repositories.

The big difference is that instead of writing code, answering emails, or buying stuff online, Scout AI’s agents are designed to seek and destroy things in the physical world with exploding drones.</p><p>In a recent demonstration, held at an undisclosed military base in central California, Scout AI’s technology was put in charge of a self-driving off-road vehicle and a pair of lethal drones. The agents used these systems to find a truck hiding in the area, and then blew it to bits using an explosive charge.</p><p>“We need to bring next-generation AI to the military,” Colby Adcock, Scout AI’s CEO, told me in a recent interview. (Adcock’s brother, Brett Adcock, is the CEO of Figure AI, a startup working on humanoid robots). “We take a hyperscaler foundation model and we train it to go from being a generalized chatbot or agentic assistant to being a warfighter.”</p><p>“It's good for defense tech startups to push the envelope with AI integration,” says Michael Horowitz, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania who previously served in the Pentagon as deputy assistant secretary of defense for force development and emerging capabilities. “That's exactly what they should be doing if the US is going to lead in military adoption of AI.”</p><p>Horowitz also notes, though, that harnessing the latest AI advances can prove particularly difficult in practice.</p><p>Large language models are inherently unpredictable and AI agents—like the ones that control the popular <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/clawdbot-moltbot-viral-ai-assistant/\">AI assistant OpenClaw</a>—<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/malevolent-ai-agent-openclaw-clawdbot\">can misbehave</a> when given even relatively benign tasks like ordering goods online. Horowitz says it may be especially hard to demonstrate that such systems are robust from a cybersecurity standpoint—something that would be required for widespread military use.</p><p>Scout AI’s recent demo involved several steps where AI had free rein over combat systems.</p><p>At the outset of the mission the following command was fed into a Scout AI system known as Fury Orchestrator:</p><blockquote data-testid=\"blockquote-wrapper\"><div><p><em>Fury Orchestrator, send 1 ground vehicle to checkpoint ALPHA. Execute a 2 drone kinetic strike mission. Destroy the blue truck 500m East of the airfield and send confirmation.</em></p></div></blockquote><p>A relatively large AI model with over a 100 billion parameters, which can run either on a secure cloud platform or an air-gapped computer on-site, interprets the initial command. Scout AI uses an undisclosed open source model with its restrictions removed. This model then acts as an agent, issuing commands to smaller, 10-billion-parameter models running on the ground vehicles and the drones involved in the exercise. The smaller models also act as agents themselves, issuing their own commands to lower-level AI systems that control the vehicles’ movements.</p><p>Seconds after receiving marching orders, the ground vehicle zipped off along a dirt road that winds between brush and trees. A few minutes later, the vehicle came to a stop and dispatched the pair of drones, which flew into the area where it had been instructed that the target was waiting. After spotting the truck, an AI agent running on one of the drones issued an order to fly toward it and detonate an explosive charge just before impact.</p>",

Repeating work inside a loop is wasteful. Every blog post, every code review, every linting rule says so. But here’s the thing nobody actually checks: </p><p>I wanted real numbers. So I built six benchmark modules — each isolating one common loop anti-pattern — and ran them at five input sizes (n = 10 to 100,000) with 30 trials per configuration, 50 warmup iterations, and forced garbage collection between trials. Then I built AST-based detectors for JavaScript and Python, pointed them at 40 open-source repositories across five domains, and counted how often these patterns appear in production code.</p><p><strong>V8’s JIT optimizer already handles most of the textbook anti-patterns.</strong> Regex hoisting? 1.03× speedup — noise-floor territory. Flattening nested ? Identical scaling curves. Fusing  into ? No measurable difference.</p><p>But two patterns showed massive, unambiguous improvement. Replacing a nested loop (O(n²)) with a  lookup (O(n)) delivered  at n = 10,000. Hoisting  out of a loop delivered  at n = 100,000.</p><p> Every developer knows that loops matter. We’re taught to hoist regexes, avoid nested O(n²) scans, and parallelize I/O. But modern JavaScript (V8) and Python (CPython) runtimes have evolved differently. V8 includes an aggressive JIT compiler; CPython does not. Does “textbook” advice still hold up?</p><p> We conducted a two-part empirical analysis:</p><ol><li> Six controlled modules isolating common anti-patterns (regex-in-loop, nested loops, sequential I/O, etc.), run at n=10 to n=100,000 with 30 trials per configuration.</li><li> A scan of 40 popular open-source repositories (59,728 files) to measure how often these patterns appear in production code.</li></ol><ul><li><strong>Algorithmic changes dominate:</strong> Replacing a nested loop with a  lookup yielded  in JS and  in Python.</li><li> V8 optimization makes “regex hoisting” and “array method chaining” performance differences negligible (1.03×).</li><li> Without a JIT, Python pays a heavy penalty for every iteration. Fixes that are optional in JS are mandatory in Python.</li><li> The most common anti-patterns in real code (e.g., sequential await) often have valid use cases, while the most critical performance killers (nested loops) are moderately common (38% of repos) and catastrophic at scale.</li></ul><p>If you only have 2 minutes, here is what you need to change in your code reviews:</p><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\"><strong>Refactor to Map/Set lookup immediately.</strong></td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\">Use  /  if requests are independent.</td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\">Hoist it. V8 cannot optimize fresh object allocation.</td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\">JS: Ignore. Python: .</td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\">Ignore.  is fine;  is not faster.</td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\">Ignore unless n &gt; 1M.  loops are only marginally faster.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Part 1: The benchmarks — what actually speeds up</h2><h3>BM-01: Regex in loop — the anti-pattern that isn’t</h3><p>The textbook advice: don’t compile a regex inside a loop body. Every iteration pays the compilation cost.</p><pre tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"typescript\"><code></code></pre><p><strong>Result at n = 100,000 (30 trials):</strong></p><table><tbody></tbody></table><p>That’s a 3% difference. Within measurement noise for most applications.</p><p> V8 caches compiled regex patterns internally. A regex literal in a loop body is not recompiled on every iteration the way a textbook explanation suggests. The engine recognizes the pattern is constant and reuses the compiled NFA/DFA. Hoisting it yourself does save a trivial amount of overhead (pattern identity check), but V8 has already done the expensive work for you.</p><p><strong>Scaling analysis confirms this:</strong> both variants have nearly identical power-law exponents (b = 0.59 baseline, b = 0.56 optimized, R² &gt; 0.96). They scale the same way because they’re doing the same work.</p><p><strong>CPython is a different story.</strong> Our Python benchmark (, CPython 3.13.12, 30 trials) showed a consistent  from hoisting  at all n ≥ 1,000:</p><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table><p>CPython maintains a small internal regex cache (~512 entries), but calling <code>re.match(pattern_string, s)</code> with a pattern literal still involves a cache lookup and pattern object construction on each call.  returns a pre-compiled object that skips that entirely. The 2× speedup is consistent and real.</p><p> In V8/Node.js, regex hoisting is a style choice (1.03× speedup, negligible). In CPython, it’s a genuine optimization (2×). If you write Python, always use  outside the loop.</p><p>Parsing the same JSON string on every iteration of a loop. This one is clearly wasteful —  does real work that produces the same result each time.</p><pre tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"typescript\"><code></code></pre><p><strong>Result at n = 100,000 (30 trials):</strong></p><table><tbody></tbody></table><p>A 46× speedup. This is not a marginal improvement — it’s the difference between “imperceptible” and “the user notices.”</p><p><strong>Why does this one work when regex hoisting doesn’t?</strong> Because  produces a  every time. V8 can’t memoize it — the output is a fresh heap allocation with fresh property slots. There’s no internal caching mechanism. Each call does the full parse-allocate-populate cycle.</p><p> Baseline exponent b = 0.79 (near-linear in parse count); optimized exponent b = 0.45 (sublinear — the single parse is amortized across iterations, and the per-iteration cost is just a property lookup).</p><h3>BM-03: Sequential await — where parallelism pays</h3><p>Each iteration of a  loop s an HTTP request sequentially. Total time = sum of all request latencies. The optimized version fires all requests simultaneously with .</p><pre tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"typescript\"><code></code></pre><p><strong>Result with mock server at 2ms fixed latency (10 trials each):</strong></p><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table><p>At n = 100, sequential  serializes 100 round-trips into 1.5 seconds.  completes all of them in 20ms — the time of a single request plus Node.js scheduling overhead. The speedup scales near-proportionally with n because each request is independent and the bottleneck is purely latency serialization.</p><p> This benchmark uses a fixed 2ms mock server with no real network variability. Real-world speedup depends on:</p><ul><li> OS and server connection limits cap actual parallelism. At n = 200, we hit Windows socket limits during testing.</li><li> Many APIs throttle concurrent requests. Firing 100 requests simultaneously may trigger 429 responses.</li><li> Paginated requests where page N uses the cursor from page N-1 cannot be parallelized.</li></ul><p><strong>When to use :</strong> When fetching N independent resources (user profiles, product details, file chunks) with no cross-dependencies and no aggressive rate limiting. The speedup is proportional to n.</p><h3>BM-04: Nested loops — the one that actually matters</h3><p>This is the classic. An outer loop iterates users; for each user, an inner loop scans all orders to find a match. O(n²) comparisons.</p><pre tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"typescript\"><code></code></pre><p><strong>Result at n = 10,000 (30 trials):</strong></p><table><tbody></tbody></table><p>At n = 10,000 — not even a particularly large dataset — the nested loop takes 62 ms while the Map version finishes in under 1 ms. At n = 100,000, the gap widens dramatically further because the baseline is superlinear.</p><p> This is where the power-law analysis tells the real story. Baseline exponent b = 1.47 (superlinear, approaching O(n²)); optimized exponent b = 0.65 (sublinear). The gap grows with every increase in input size. At small n, both are fast. At large n, one is unusable and the other is instant.</p><p><strong>This is the optimization that matters.</strong> Not because it’s syntactically clever, but because it changes the algorithm. A  gives O(1) average-case lookup. The nested loop gives O(n) per outer iteration. The total work changes from O(n²) to O(n). No JIT compiler can bridge that gap.</p><blockquote><p> The benchmark spec predicted ≥100× speedup at n = 10,000. We measured 64× in JavaScript. The shortfall is because the baseline uses a  on first match, so average inner-loop iterations ≈ n/2 rather than n — the effective complexity is ~O(n²/2), not O(n²). In , the same pattern delivers 1,864× at n = 10,000 (see Python benchmarks below), where the interpreter overhead amplifies every extra iteration far more than V8.</p></blockquote><h3>BM-05: Nested array methods — a constant-factor win, not algorithmic</h3><p>Nested -in- on a 2D n×1,000 matrix. The optimized version uses explicit  loops.</p><pre tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"typescript\"><code></code></pre><p><strong>Result at n = 100,000 (30 trials):</strong></p><table><tbody><tr></tr></tbody></table><p>A 6× constant-factor speedup. This is a real, statistically unambiguous improvement (Cohen’s d = 40.14 is enormous). But note: the speedup is flat across all input sizes — it does not grow with n.</p><p><strong>Scaling result (updated with n×1,000 matrix):</strong></p><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table><p>Both exponents are approximately 1.0 — linear scaling — and their 95% bootstrap confidence intervals fully overlap. <strong>Neither version scales as O(n²)</strong>; both are O(n) because total work = n rows × 1,000 cols = linear in n. The 6× speedup is therefore a constant multiplier: the JIT reduces but does not fully eliminate the per-call overhead of nested  callbacks at large scale.</p><p> V8 JIT-compiles hot  callbacks aggressively, but at very large data volumes (100M total iterations here), the callback dispatch mechanism still costs ~6× vs a raw  loop. If your loop body runs billions of times, the  syntax pays off. For typical data sizes (&lt; 100k total iterations), the difference is sub-millisecond and not worth the readability tradeoff.</p><h3>BM-06: Chained array methods — also handled</h3><p><code>array.filter(pred).map(transform)</code> creates an intermediate array and makes two passes.

V8’s JIT optimizer has already eliminated the theoretical difference.</p></li><li><p><strong>BM-05 shows identical  but a 6× absolute speedup.</strong> Both exponents are ~1.0 (linear), with fully overlapping 95% bootstrap CIs ([0.936, 1.356] vs [0.891, 1.268]). The  loop is consistently faster by a constant factor at large n, but the gap doesn’t widen with scale. This is a JIT reduction of callback overhead, not an elimination of it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Most empirical exponents are below theoretical predictions.</strong> This is consistent across all modules and reflects V8’s aggressive optimization: JIT compilation, inline caching, hidden classes, and escape analysis all compress observed running times below naive complexity estimates.</p></li></ol><p>The textbook says <code>for (const x of arr) { regex.test(x) }</code> is O(n). But we measured b ≈ 0.59 — closer to O(√n). This doesn’t mean the algorithm is sublinear. It means:</p><ul><li> V8 compiles hot loops to optimized machine code after a few iterations. Early iterations are slower (interpreted); later iterations are faster (compiled). This compresses the time-vs-n curve.</li><li> Small n fits in L1 cache; large n spills to L2/L3/RAM. The cache penalty at large n is partially offset by better JIT optimization at large n.</li><li> Modern CPUs predict loop branches nearly perfectly after a few iterations. The prediction cost is amortized over n.</li></ul><p>The practical implication: <strong>theoretical complexity analysis overestimates real-world performance differences for constant-factor optimizations.</strong> Only changes that alter the asymptotic class (like BM-04’s O(n²) → O(n)) produce speedups that scale with input size.</p><p>40 open-source repositories, evenly split: 20 JavaScript/TypeScript and 20 Python.

The new addition  (replacing ) contributes 232 findings, dominated by sequential-await-in-loop (119) from its plugin hook system.</p><p><strong>21,233 files scanned. 4,867 anti-pattern instances found.</strong></p><table><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table><p>Nested loops dominate Python findings by a wide margin — CPython’s lack of JIT means every extra iteration is costly, and the detector correctly flags the pattern at high volume. Apache Airflow (1,206 findings) and Django (798) are the top contributors. Apache Airflow’s large async codebase also contributes the bulk of sequential-await findings.</p><p><strong>Python benchmark results (CPython 3.13.12, 30 trials):</strong></p><p>We benchmarked the two patterns most likely to differ from V8 behavior:</p><p><em>BM-01 equivalent — regex hoisting:</em></p><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table><p><em>BM-04 equivalent — nested loop vs dict lookup:</em></p><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table><p>These numbers are dramatically different from V8. <strong>CPython does not JIT-compile loops</strong>, so every interpreted iteration pays full bytecode dispatch overhead.

If you’re writing Python with nested loops over large collections, this is the single highest-priority fix in your codebase.</p><table><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Prevalence rate by pattern (% of JS repos containing at least one instance):</strong></p><table><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table><p>Nearly every pattern appears in at least 20% of repos. These aren’t rare edge cases — they’re common code idioms.</p><h3>Cross-referencing prevalence with benchmark impact</h3><p>This is where the data gets interesting. The most prevalent patterns in real code are  the ones with the biggest benchmark impact:</p><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>9–75× (latency-dependent)</strong></td></tr><tr><td>JS: style only; Python: fix it</td></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>The most impactful anti-pattern (nested loops, 64× speedup) is moderately prevalent (15.3% of JS findings, 66.2% of Python findings).</strong> Optimization effort is well-targeted — nested loops are both impactful and detectable.</p><p><strong>The second most impactful pattern (JSON.parse in loop, 46× speedup) is extremely rare</strong> (1.6% of findings). In practice, developers rarely call  inside a tight loop on the same string. When they do, it’s usually obvious and gets caught in review.</p><p><strong>Regex hoisting and → rewriting are V8-only non-issues.</strong> In Python, regex hoisting delivers a consistent 2× speedup. Array method rewriting shows a 6× constant-factor improvement at very large n (100M+ total iterations), which matters for rendering engines and bulk data processors.</p><p><strong>Sequential await is the most prevalent JS pattern and one of the most impactful</strong> — up to 75× speedup at n=100 with 2ms latency. But it requires dependency analysis before fixing.</p><h2>Part 3: What this means for real-world code</h2><h3>When nested loops actually hurt</h3><p>Not every nested loop is a performance problem. The key factors:</p><ul><li> A nested loop over two arrays of 10,000 items each does 100 million comparisons. A Map lookup does 10,000.</li><li> API request handlers, render loops, event processors — code that runs on every user action.</li><li> If  increases over time (user base, log volume, product catalog), a quadratic loop becomes a ticking time bomb.</li></ul><ul><li> Nested loop over 5 fields × 3 options = 15 iterations. A Map would be overkill.</li><li> Startup configuration, migration scripts, one-time setup. Nobody cares if it takes 70ms instead of 1ms once.</li><li> If the loop body makes a database call that takes 5ms, the iteration overhead is irrelevant.</li></ul><h3>When sequential await matters</h3><p>Sequential  is context-dependent. Our scan found 895 JS instances and 457 Python instances — the most prevalent JS pattern overall. But not all of them are bugs:</p><p><strong>1. Intentionally Sequential (Good):</strong>\nWhen the next iteration depends on the result of the previous one. Parallelization here would break correctness.</p><pre tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"typescript\"><code></code></pre><p><strong>2. Unintentionally Sequential (Bad):</strong>\nWhen iterations are independent. This pattern serializes latency unnecessarily.</p><pre tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"typescript\"><code></code></pre><p> If you can shuffle the input array and the code still works, it should be parallelized.</p><p>Without analyzing data dependencies, static analysis can’t distinguish these. Our detector flags the structural pattern; a human must assess the intent.</p><h3>The false positive problem</h3><p>Our JS detector found 723 regex-in-loop instances. Our benchmark shows regex hoisting produces 1.03× speedup — effectively zero. <strong>That means 723 findings are, from a performance perspective, false positives.</strong></p><p>Similarly, 241 nested-array-method findings and an unknown portion of the 895 sequential-await findings are false positives for performance (though they may have readability value).</p><p>This is a fundamental limitation of structural static analysis for performance: <strong>the tool detects code shape, not runtime cost.</strong> A  inside a  on a 5-element array costs nothing. The same pattern on a 10,000-element array costs 100 million operations. The AST looks identical.</p><p><strong>Node.js environment, not browser.</strong> All benchmarks ran in Node.js with V8. Browser environments share V8 (Chrome, Edge) but add DOM overhead, compositor scheduling, and memory pressure from the rendering pipeline. SpiderMonkey (Firefox) and JavaScriptCore (Safari) may have different JIT behaviors — a regex pattern that V8 caches might not be cached by other engines.</p><p> Benchmark inputs are generated from seeded PRNGs — uniform distributions, controlled sizes, no I/O. Real-world loops often involve heterogeneous data, I/O interleaving, and memory pressure from concurrent operations. The synthetic setup isolates the loop pattern but doesn’t capture system-level interactions.</p><p> We measured sequential vs  at 2ms mock latency for n = 10, 50, 100. At n = 200, Windows socket limits (connection backlog exhaustion) caused failures during parallel warmup. The collected data (9.1× to 75.3× speedup) covers the most practically relevant range. BM-07 (DOM batching) requires a real browser with DevTools and was not included.</p><p><strong>BM-03 results do not include real network variance.</strong> The mock server uses a fixed 2ms delay with no jitter. Real HTTP latency has high variance (p50 vs p99 can differ 10×), which affects both sequential and parallel completion times differently.</p><p> All data from one machine (Windows x64, Node.js v24.11.0). JIT behavior, cache sizes, and scheduling vary across hardware and OS. The relative rankings should hold, but absolute timings will differ.</p><p><strong>Python benchmarks are limited to two patterns.</strong> We validated regex hoisting (2× consistent) and nested loops (1,864× at n=10,000) in CPython. The remaining patterns — sequential await (), dict comprehension inside loops, and nested comprehensions — lack Python benchmark data. Given CPython’s lack of JIT, it’s reasonable to expect these also show larger speedups than their V8 equivalents.</p><p><strong>Power-law fit limitations.</strong> The scaling analysis uses log-log OLS regression with 5 data points (n = 10 to 100,000). Five points provide limited statistical power for distinguishing between, say, O(n log n) and O(n^1.3). The R² values (0.87–0.99) indicate good fits, but the exponent estimates have meaningful confidence intervals that we haven’t reported. The qualitative conclusion (BM-04 is superlinear, others are not) is robust; the exact exponent values should be interpreted loosely.</p><p><strong>Static analysis precision not formally evaluated.</strong> The detectors use structural pattern matching without ground-truth labeling. Formal precision/recall measurement would require manually labeling hundreds of findings as true/false positives — feasible but not completed. Based on spot-checking: regex-in-loop and json-parse-in-loop have high structural precision (the code literally does what the detector says); nested-loops has moderate precision (many are on small fixed-size collections); sequential-await has low precision for  impact (many are intentionally sequential).</p><p>Based on the combined benchmark and prevalence data:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Prioritize nested loop → Map/Set refactoring.</strong> 343 JS instances (15.3%), 3,224 Python instances (66.2%), 64× JS / 1,864× Python benchmark speedup. Look for patterns where an inner loop scans a collection for a matching key. Replace with a pre-built  or . This is the single highest-impact optimization available.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hoist repeated parsing outside loops.</strong> JSON.parse, XML parsing, YAML parsing — any operation that produces the same result on the same input. Rare (36 JS instances) but impactful (46×) when found.</p></li><li><p><strong> →  rewriting in JavaScript: only at massive scale.</strong> The 6× speedup only appears at n = 100,000 rows × 1,000 cols = 100M total iterations. For typical loops (&lt; 1M total iterations), the difference is sub-millisecond. Write whichever is clearer. In Python, this distinction doesn’t apply — CPython pays full overhead either way.</p></li><li><p><strong>Don’t rewrite  to .</strong> No measurable benefit, and  is harder to read. The intermediate array allocation that theory warns about is optimized away in practice.</p></li><li><p><strong>Evaluate sequential  case by case.</strong> The static count is high (895 JS, 457 Python) but many are intentionally sequential. Focus on loops that fetch independent resources — those are genuine candidates for  or . Our benchmark shows up to 75× speedup at n=100 with modest latency.</p></li><li><p><strong>In Python, always use  outside loops.</strong> Unlike V8, CPython does not fully eliminate the pattern-construction cost at call time. The 2× speedup is consistent and free — one line change. In JavaScript, hoisting is a style choice only.</p></li></ol><h2>What we didn’t test (and should)</h2><p>Several gaps remain that would strengthen or qualify these findings:</p><ul><li> V8 dominates our JS results. SpiderMonkey (Firefox) and JavaScriptCore (Safari) may not cache regex the same way. BM-01’s “1.03× — don’t bother” conclusion is V8-specific.</li><li><strong>BM-03 at higher n and varying latency.</strong> We hit Windows socket limits at n = 200 parallel. Testing at n = 500–1,000 with concurrency throttling (, worker pools) would show where parallelization hits diminishing returns.</li><li> vs sequential  in Python — the most prevalent Python pattern — has no benchmark data yet.</li><li><strong>BM-07 DOM batching in real browsers.</strong> Layout recalculation cost grows with DOM tree size. Chrome DevTools measurements with varying tree sizes would validate the DocumentFragment optimization.</li><li> Our benchmarks measured wall-clock time. Map-based replacements trade time for space (the Map uses additional memory). For memory-constrained environments, the tradeoff analysis matters.</li><li> 40 repos provide a starting point but limit statistical power for per-domain analysis. A 200+ repo scan would enable more robust prevalence estimates.</li></ul><h3>Additional loop anti-patterns not covered</h3><p>This study focused on six structurally distinct patterns. Production-grade static analysis tools detect a broader set worth benchmarking in future work:</p><ul><li><p><strong> /  inside a loop.</strong> Structurally equivalent to nested loops — each call is an O(n) linear scan, making the outer loop O(n²). Replacing with a pre-built  gives O(1) membership checks. Tools like <a href=\"https://codeevolutionlab.com\">Code Evolution Lab</a> flag this as  and auto-generate the  conversion. Prevalence in real codebases is likely higher than explicit nested  loops because the O(n) cost is hidden behind a method call.</p></li><li><p><strong> with array lookups in a loop.</strong> Iterating  and then calling  or  on the result inside the loop creates the same O(n²) pattern. Direct property access () or a  eliminates the inner scan entirely.</p></li><li><p><strong>String concatenation in a loop ().</strong> Each  on a string allocates a new string object. At large n, this creates significant GC pressure. The fix — <code>parts.push(x); parts.join('')</code> — is a single allocation. V8 has some string rope optimizations, but they don’t fully eliminate the allocation cost at high iteration counts.</p></li><li><p><strong>Synchronous file I/O in a loop (, ).</strong> Each call blocks the Node.js event loop for the full disk latency. Replacing with <code>await Promise.all(files.map(f =&gt; fs.readFile(f)))</code> parallelizes I/O and unblocks the event loop between reads. Expected speedup is proportional to the number of files and disk concurrency.</p></li><li><p><strong>ReDoS-vulnerable regex patterns.</strong> Patterns with nested quantifiers like  or  exhibit exponential backtracking on adversarial input. This is a correctness/security issue as much as a performance one — a single malicious string can stall the event loop for seconds. Static analysis can flag structurally dangerous patterns without running them; tools like <a href=\"https://codeevolutionlab.com\">Code Evolution Lab</a> include a dedicated ReDoS detector that scores regex complexity and flags dangerous constructs.</p></li></ul><p>These patterns share the same root cause as the ones we benchmarked — redundant work per iteration — but differ in whether the fix is algorithmic (data structure substitution), I/O-structural (parallelization), or security-driven (regex redesign).</p><h2>Appendix A: Benchmark Environment &amp; Methodology</h2><ul><li> Node.js v24.11.0 (V8 12.x), Python 3.13.12 (CPython)</li><li> (JS) /  (Python)</li></ul><ul><li> 30 independent runs per (module, pattern, n) configuration.</li><li> 50 iterations discarded before measurement to stabilize JIT/cache.</li><li> Forced garbage collection ( / ) and 200ms sleep between trials to minimize thermal throttling and heap fragmentation.</li><li> Strict correctness gate — baseline and optimized implementations must produce bit-identical output for all inputs before timing begins.</li></ul><h2>Appendix B: Source code and data reference</h2><p>All code, data, and results are in the <a href=\"https://github.com/liangk/empirical-study\">empirical-study</a> repository under <code>studies/04-loop-performance/</code>.</p><h3>Scaling analysis (Step 2)</h3><h3>Real-world scanning (Steps 3–4)</h3><table><tbody><tr><td>Raw trial data: wallTimeNs, cpuTimeMs, heapBefore/After per (module, pattern, n, trial)</td></tr><tr><td>Power-law fits: a, b, R², empirical/theoretical complexity per module</td></tr><tr><td>JS detector output: 2,238 findings across 38,495 files</td></tr><tr><td><code>results/py-findings-&lt;repo&gt;.json</code></td><td>Python detector output: 4,867 findings across 21,233 files (per-repo JSON files)</td></tr><tr><td><code>results/prevalence-*.json</code></td><td>Per-pattern prevalence rates and density per KLOC</td></tr><tr><td>Per-repo profiles with git blame and patch tracking fields</td></tr><tr><td>40-repo corpus with domain stratification</td></tr></tbody></table>",

Disconnects DNS (zone routes, custom domains, workers.dev subdomain) via the Cloudflare API, then sends a Discord embed with the details.</li></ul><p>D1 stores two things: an  table for cooldown deduplication (with TTL so we don't re-fire on the same Worker within an hour), and a  table for report history.</p><p>Plain and simple: this protects against , not . The kill switch cuts off public traffic to Workers. It does not protect against:</p><ul><li> If you have a public R2 bucket, anyone can read from it. Those requests bypass Workers entirely and are billed to your account. The kill switch cannot stop that.</li><li> A Worker that calls itself (or another Worker) in a loop isn't exposed to the public internet. Nuking DNS—routes, custom domains, workers.dev—does nothing. Internal calls don't go through that. The kill switch is useless here.</li><li> Same story. A DO spinning out of control is internal. We don't cap or disconnect them.</li><li> Queues, Workflows, etc. have their own billing. The daily report tracks them, but we don't auto-cap them.</li></ul><p>Thresholds are configurable via environment variables (global defaults) and per-Worker overrides in an accounts config file:</p><ul><li>: default 500k requests</li><li>: default 5M ms (about 83 minutes of CPU)</li><li>: default 3600 (1 hour)</li></ul><p>Each account and Worker can override these. The accounts list is hardcoded (account IDs, billing cycle day, Worker names, optional per-Worker thresholds). A single API token with access to all accounts is used.</p><p>The daily report gives a snapshot of usage and estimated cost for the current billing period. It pulls:</p><ul><li>Worker metrics: requests, errors, CPU time, subrequests per script</li><li>Account usage: D1 rows read/written and storage, KV operations and storage, R2 requests and storage, Queues operations, Durable Objects requests/duration/storage, Workflows requests/CPU/storage</li></ul><p>Storage is shown in MB. Billing period timestamps are full ISO (midnight start, 23:59:59 end). The report applies Workers Paid pricing and breaks down overage cost by product. Output goes to D1 and Discord as a JSON attachment.</p><p>A few things I might change or add:</p><ul><li>Workers Logs in the report (Cloudflare's GraphQL API doesn't expose those metrics yet, so it's a placeholder)</li><li>A way to re-enable Workers from the same system instead of doing it manually in the dashboard</li><li>A UI for the report and controls, behind Cloudflare Access</li></ul><p>If you run multiple Cloudflare accounts and want guardrails against runaway usage, this pattern is a solid starting point. The core idea is simple: monitor, compare, and disconnect before the bill gets out of hand.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Imagine losing your email address, phone number, photos, contacts and more after using an AI tool for work.</p><p>That’s what Brian Chase says happened after he uploaded text-only law enforcement reports to Google’s NotebookLM while working on a criminal case. NotebookLM is an AI research tool that summarizes and answers questions about files and links that users upload.</p><p>Chase is an adjunct professor at the University of Arizona law school and managing director of digital forensics and eDiscovery at ArcherHall.</p><p>In a Feb. 16 LinkedIn post, he wrote that he uploaded reports to NotebookLM and “within seconds” received a notification that he had violated Google’s terms of service. He said the reports referenced child sexual abuse material because the defendant was charged with possessing it, but that the upload included “no images or videos … only text.”</p><p>“Google stored all my photos, contacts, phone backups, Gmail account, and even my phone number,” he wrote. “I cannot access any of it today.” He added that his phone number was a Google Voice number and that other services tied to his Google account stopped working.</p><p>Chase said he uploaded the report on Saturday, Feb. 14, received a terms-of-service warning and deleted it the same day. He said that on Monday, he woke up signed out of Google services and saw an alert that his account was disabled.</p><p>“Although I submitted an appeal,” Chase wrote that day, “Google offers no way to contact them to provide additional information.”</p><p>Early Tuesday, Chase said he received an email stating the material violated Google’s terms of service and that if he agreed to them, he could download his account contents through Google Takeout. He said the email “never really said my account was restored.” Later Tuesday, he posted a comment on the LinkedIn post saying, “Google restored access to my account.”</p><p>Chase said he was doing routine legal work. “Nothing I uploaded was illegal. Nothing I did violated the attorney ethical rules. But Google flagged it anyway, and there is very little recourse once that happens.”</p><p>I emailed Google’s media team on Monday with questions about Chase’s post, whether NotebookLM activity can trigger an account-level enforcement action and why a text-only upload tied to lawful legal work would lead to an account-wide lockout. I followed up multiple times through late Tuesday. Google did not respond.</p><p>In other cases involving sensitive material, the consequence is not an account lockout but an AI tool that won’t answer.</p><p>NotebookLM users report that the tool refuses to summarize or answer questions about public records from the Epstein files. In a , users say it returns a standard message, “NotebookLM can’t answer this question. Try rephrasing it, or ask a different question,” when asked to summarize documents or extract basic information, including questions about associates.</p><p>In my own testing, NotebookLM repeatedly refused to summarize or answer questions about Justice Department documents from the Epstein case, sometimes after generating a few lines in response. I sent Google a screenshot from that testing as part of my request for comment.</p><h2><strong>OpenAI ‘working on a fix’</strong></h2><p>On OpenAI’s ChatGPT, users, including me, noticed a <a href=\"https://www.sfgate.com/tech/article/chatgpt-jeffrey-epstein-21346220.php\" type=\"link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">similar pattern</a> when analyzing Epstein case records. The AI tool begins generating an answer, then the text disappears and is replaced by a red warning that says, “This content may violate our usage policies.”</p><p>OpenAI’s communications team responded by email on background, saying, “This was an incorrect refusal, and we’re working on a fix to address it.”&nbsp;</p><p>The company did not answer follow-up questions about what caused the behavior or when a fix would roll out.</p><p>The refusal behavior is not uniform across AI systems.</p><p>In my own testing, I gave the same Epstein case document to DeepSeek and Kimi, each based in China. Both summarized it and answered questions without the refusals I encountered in ChatGPT and NotebookLM.

      "content": "<p>Wherein we make progress towards solving one of the most vexing\nproblems of Computer Science — naming things.</p><p>I am at a point in my career where the bulk of my bugs are stupid — I\nsimply fail to type in the code I have in my mind correctly. In\nlanguages with shadowing (like Rust), I will fail to use a shadowed\nvariable from the outer scope. In languages without shadowing (like\nZig), I will use the wrong version of a variable.</p><p>Pests like these are annoying, so I am always on the lookout for\ntricks to minimize the probability of bugs. One of the best possible\ntricks is of course strong static typing. Types are good at preventing\nme from doing stupid things by accident. But types have limitations. The\ntext of a well-typed program is a two-in-one artifact — a specification\nof behavior of a machine (the algorithm), and a proof that the behavior\nis not unacceptable. Zero cost abstractions are code without behavior,\njust proofs!</p><p>The art of skillful typing lies in minimizing verbosity of the proof,\nwhile maximizing the amount of unwanted behaviors ruled out, weighted by\nthe probability and the cost of misbehavior. But this ratio is not\nalways favorable — the code can be so proof-heavy that it becomes\nimpossible to understand what it actually !</p><p>There’s one particular cranny where types don’t seem to usefully\npenetrate yet: indexing and associated off-by-one errors.</p><p>If you don’t need indexing , you can use <a href=\"https://matklad.github.io/2025/12/23/zig-newtype-index-pattern.html\">newtype\npattern</a> to prevent accessing oranges with apple-derived indexes. You\ncan even go further and bind indexes to  arrays, using,\ne.g., <a href=\"https://faultlore.com/blah/papers/thesis.pdf#page=56\">Gankra\ntrick</a>, but I haven’t seen that to be useful in practice.</p><p>If, however, you  indexes, you need to be extra\ncareful to stay in bounds of an array, and need to be mindful that the\nmaximum valid index is one less than the length of the array. While we\ndon’t solve this problem perfectly at TigerBeetle, I think we have a\nnaming convention that helps:</p><p>We consistently use  whenever we talk about the\nnumber of items, and  to point to a particular item.\nThe <a href=\"https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/blob/0.16.73/docs/TIGER_STYLE.md#:~:text=State%20invariants%20positively\">positive\ninvariant</a> is . Consistency is the trick\n— there are certain valid and invalid ways to combine indexes and counts\nin an expression, and, if there’s always an  or a\n suffix in the name, wrong combinations immediately\njump out at you, dear reader, even if you don’t understand the specifics\nof the code.</p><p>In low-level code you often need to switch between a well-typed\nrepresentation and raw bytes . To not\nconfuse the two index spaces, the “count of bytes” is always called a\n. By definition,</p><p>And  is the bytewise counterpart of\n.</p><p>We don’t use  in our code, as its meaning is\nambiguous. Rust  is the byte- of\nthe string, but Python’s  is the \nof Unicode code-points!</p><p>Here’s an example of the naming convention in action from <a href=\"https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/blob/0cd32077bff00b15b83b3417bf700ecb0c888f78/src/lsm/node_pool.zig#L70-L82\">NodePool</a>:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>You can see that the  calculation is correct\nmechanically, just from the names of the variables.</p><p>And here’s an  example from our <a href=\"https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/blob/81f78fe21a939ed1bffc43a10a484779e3866cf9/src/ewah.zig#L68-L95\"></a>\nimplementation:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Note well that the  convention synergizes\nwith two other TigerStyle shticks. We use “big endian naming”, where\nqualifiers are appended as suffixes:</p><pre><code>source\nsource_words\nsource_index</code></pre><p>And we try to make sure that dual names have the same length:</p><p>The code aligns itself, and makes the bugs pop out:</p><div><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>Of course, a simple naming convention by itself won’t make software\nsignificantly better. But grains of sand add up to Dune: there’s no one\ntrick to get rid of the bugs, but you can layer your defenses to\nexponentially decrease the probability of a failure.</p>",

I ran experiments with a small model (500M parameters) and compared my method with a similar version of contemporary methods, and at my scale my method is better. I could not scale vertically (larger model, larger training runs, more data, etc...) so I decided to scale horizontally - more evaluations and a deeper analysis of the method.</p><p>My paper has a lot of small nuggets of information that a lot of people can take and reproduce at larger scales and I'm pretty sure they would work. Obviously not 100% sure.. you never are unless you actually run the experiments. In hindsight this should have been a short paper or a workshop paper.</p><p>Just submitted my paper to CVPR. Initially got 5 3 3. Reviewers all said different things, except for \"run more evaluations\", but were all willing to raise scores. Responded with 1 more evaluation (with positive results) and explained why the rest were nonsensical (was not that harsh obviously).</p><p>To be more concrete, they wanted me to compare my model to models that were 14x larger, had 4x more resolution, and require 5-10x the inference time. To me it is clear we are not even in the same ballpark of computational resources, so we should not compare both methods. Additionally, they wanted me to run evaluations on datasets that are simply not suited to evaluate my method. My method targets high-resolution/fine detail settings and they wanted me to evaluate my method on datasets with ~500px images (on average).</p><p>I made a rebuttal and submitted.</p><p>Now I got the final scores: 5 -&gt; 4, 3 -&gt; 3, 3 -&gt; 2 (reject, not even recommended to submit to findings). The meta review stated that I had to compare my method to newer and \"better\" methods. They are not better, just are a brain dead version of mine, but I cannot evaluate their EXACT method at my scale or mine at theirs. This paper was supposed to be something that the reader would read and say \"oh yeah, that is a smarter way of doing things... it makes sense, let me try it out at a larger scale\", but it seems like the current state of the research community will not stop and put things into context and will only look at dataset evaluations.</p><p>Why do people only want to see which kind of stuff has the highest accuracy? This only leads to whoever is the fastest/has more resources to win. Regardless of the soundness of the method. ML research should not be an engineering competition...</p>",

Dominating most of the code changes in this latest pull were AMDGPU fixes, including more enhancements for aging Radeon graphics processors.\n<p>The now-merged code to Linux 7.0 includes more AMDGPU fixes from Timur Kristóf of Valve's open-source Linux graphics team. Timur Kristóf has been the one leading the effort to improve the old AMD GCN 1.0 and GCN 1.1 GPU support with the AMDGPU kernel driver and drove through that default change from the legacy Radeon DRM driver. Timur has continued taking care of some loose ends like some APU support issues. The latest patches now part of Linux 7.0 take care of a \"black screen\" issue observed with analog connector support when using the AMDGPU DC display code with the likes of the Radeon HD 7790. The code also makes the analog connector support more consistent and closer to parity with other display connector types in the AMDGPU display code.\n</p>Alex Deucher also landed a fix to the AMDGPU driver for keeping VGA memory on Apple MacBooks with switchable graphics. For old Apple MacBook Pros powered by Intel CPUs and bearing switchable graphics, a fix has landed around the dGPU virtual address space to resolve an issue of cursor flickering and AMDGPU errors when using GNOME on Wayland with the likes of the Radeon Pro 560.\n<p>AMDGPU in Linux 7.0 Git also has fixes for the Hainan GPU, some updates for the new AMD graphics IP blocks introduced to the Linux 7.0 kernel for upcoming hardware, Fastboot fixes, and a variety of other fixes. Many of these fixes where relevant should be back-ported to the stable kernel series in the coming days.\n</p><p>More details on these now-merged AMDGPU fixes plus some Intel graphics driver fixes too via </p><a href=\"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=d4a292c5f8e65d2784b703c67179f4f7d0c7846c\">this DRM merge</a>.",

It still offers a good and normal experience for the common case of having one printer, but now also includes loads of enterprisey features relevant to environments with many printers.

      "content": "<p>In the Rust Programming Language Community Server, there’s tag named  which links to an <a href=\"https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/\">article</a> about the concept of avoiding validation functions and encoding invariants in the type level instead. I usually recommend it to beginners/intermediates to Rust who are struggling with designing APIs.</p><p>The only problem is that it uses Haskell to explain its concepts.</p><p>Yeah, it’s , but for beginners unfamiliar with the functional paradigm, it might not be so approachable. And so I wanted so write a blog post about this pattern but in a rather Rust-centric way. So let’s start!</p><section><p>One basic example I can give is a function that divides a number by another number.</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"rust\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>This is fine, but unfortunately it can panic when  has the value of zero:</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"rust\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><div><figure><pre data-language=\"rust\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>That’s fine and dandy if we want erroneous values to fail loudly at runtime, but what if we want stronger guarantees? This is especially important when some operations don’t fail loudly, like the following:</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"rust\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><div><figure><pre data-language=\"rust\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>There’s no error! But do we want that?</p><p>We could add an  in the  function to emulate typical integer division behavior.</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"rust\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><div><figure><pre data-language=\"rust\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>Cute! But there’s still a problem of running into panics only at runtime. My beef with Python (or any other dynamic language for that matter) is that a lot of errors only arises when you run the program. That’s why they’re adding typechecking to these languages: people want to bubble some mistakes to compile-time (or typecheck-time, whatever). We can use Rust’s rich type system to communicate these errors at build time.</p><p>One way, which I think is the more common way as people are more familiar with it is the idea of fallible functions, which return either an  or a .</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"rust\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>This is a fine way to do things, as it communicates that (1) the function can fail, and (2) you can handle the failing case after.   To me, the function’s invariants ( must not be zero) is encoded after-the-fact, aka in the return type . This implies to me that the invariants could be encoded before-the-fact, aka in the function parameters. But what would that look like?</p><p>Enter the newtype pattern.</p><p>Say, let’s have a type that is something like , but it’s guaranteed to never be zero. We’ll name it :</p><p>This struct only contains a single field . The semantics of the type understood from the name is that it’s just like a normal , but does not allow the value of zero. How do we guarantee this? Since rust does encapsulation at the module level, we make this type public while have its field private.</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"rust\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>Then, the only way to construct this type is via a fallible constructor function:</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"rust\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>Remember to add some convenience traits.</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"rust\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>We can then use this in our  function.</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"rust\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>There is an interesting implication in this pattern.</p><p>In the second version of , we changed the return type from  to  just to avoid the panics. As described in the original article by Alexis King, this is a  of the return type, and the function’s promise. We temper the caller’s expectation by saying that yes, this function can fail in some way, and you have to account for that. And that weakening is described in the type system via the  enum.</p><p>In the third iteration of , we change our perspective and ask ourselves “instead of weakening the return type, what if we  the function parameters?” We communicated that via accepting a . Instead of having the validation code in our functions, we instead push that responsibility to the caller. The validation now happens before the function execution.</p><p>To see the advantage of pushing the validation forward to the user, let’s say we have another function like so:</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"rust\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>This function can fail if the discriminant is negative (which we will be ignoring in this contrived example), and if  is zero. The two ways of going about this can be written as follows:</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"rust\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>The  version has me duplicating the conditional for at least two different functions, which might be icky if you are a DRY-hard. Also, not only the function has to validate if the float can be zero, the  must then validate again by matching on the returned . That seems redundant. It would be ideal if we only need to check only once.</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"rust\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>The  version can help with that as validation happens before, and happens once, instead of twice.</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"rust\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>Moving away from the , let’s now use an example from the original blog post, converted to Rust:</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"rust\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><ol><li>We checked if  is empty in the  function. Then, we still had to “check” it again in the  function by matching on . The  was known to be nonempty, do we have to check it again? Consequently, doesn’t this have an impact on performance, especially if we have to check it again and again and again?</li><li>The original post raised a good point about resilience to refactors. If for some reason the  gets refactored out for some reason, and the programmer forgot to update , then the  branch might actually get reached and explode your computer or whatever.</li></ol><p>If we instead had a special  newtype (well, not exactly special) where its existence guarantees that the Vec is never empty, we could do</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"rust\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>In this context, we can call  and  functions, since they validate and convert the less semantic type to a type with more meaning imbued into it. That is, nonzeroness of a float and nonemptiness of a  is now encoded into a type. You can just see the word  and therefore understand that going forward it is always be an  that is never zero.</p><p>Validation and checking functions on the other hand, well, just validate the value and leave the type as that. If I have a  function, then there’s not really much of a readable difference between an  that has  called on it versus and an  that hasn’t.</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"rust\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>By taking advantage of the existence of a nominative type system, we can communicate that this  is not zero by  it to a new type, as opposed to just  it. If you only validate it, then you still can’t tell if  was nonzero unless you dig through the code. However, if you parsed it, you can say it’s always be nonzero if you see  in your code.</p></section><section><p>Of course, the above examples are very much contrived, but is there an instance where creating newtypes is helpful? Yes. In fact, most people have used it. It’s called a .</p><p>If we dig into the internals, <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/alloc/string.rs.html#360\"></a> is just a newtype over the  type:</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"rust\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>It’s parsing function is <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/struct.String.html#method.from_utf8\"></a>, which contains the validation code for checking if the byte vector is valid UTF-8.</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"rust\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>So instead of passing around a  around and validating all over the place, just parse into a  and you can be assured with having a type-safe  with all the convenience functions you can get.</p><p>Another example is . In Python,  simply give you a dictionary. This is fine, especially if the data is sufficiently arbitrary, but if you have a schema and a type system, it’s better to let the type system do the work of parsing .</p><p>In our terminology, validation looks like this:</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"rust\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>That’s two s! One for checking if the string is valid json and the other is for checking if the  field exists. Now consider this example where we use the parsing mechanic instead via types and the  derive macro.</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"rust\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>Since we deserialized the  file into an actual type, we can safely make these guarantees:</p><ol><li>The  and  always exist in the  string we parse.</li><li> always has an integer value.</li><li> is always an array of three integers.</li><li> will never panic since all elements of an array is always initialized, and indexing into the first the element of a nonzero-length array will always be successful.</li></ol><p>The only point of failure here is pushed upfront, where the  happens. After that point, there’s not really much error handling to be done here, since the validation is now represented at the type level instead of at the function level.</p></section><section><h2>Maxims of Type Driven Design<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"https://www.harudagondi.space/blog/parse-dont-validate-and-type-driven-design-in-rust#maxims-of-type-driven-design\"> #</a></h2><p>With that said, what lessons can we learn from here? Turns out, most functional language programmers already have learned several lessons, and Rust is not much different in terms of applying such FP concepts to the language.</p><p>First lesson we can learn is that <strong>we should make illegal states unrepresentable</strong>.</p><p>To refer back to the  and  examples, we say the state of being zero is illegal for  and the state of being empty is illegal for . And as illegal states, they cannot be represented in such types. That’s why the only constructors available for these types are fallible; the value either parsed successfully, or it failed and does not return the new types.</p><p>If we only do validation, like checking if  is nonzero for example, then the illegal state can still be represented. There’s a small possible that the value is zero, especially after some refactors when the conditional checks are accidentally or intentionally removed in some places.</p><section><p>This reminds me of how other languages use integers as sentinel values. Given this code snippet from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinel_value\">Wikipedia</a>:</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"c\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>The error is returned as , since indexing arrays is only valid for nonnegative integers. Seems weird as (1) the numbers -2 and below  exist, but not actually valid, and (2) treating certain values as special seems too error-prone, as in the future it could be that negative number can become semantically valid.</p></section><p>Second lesson we can learn is that <strong>proving invariants should be done as early as possible</strong>.</p><p>There’s this concept called <a href=\"http://langsec.org/papers/langsec-cwes-secdev2016.pdf\"></a> where the linked paper describes it as follows:</p><blockquote><p>Shotgun Parsing: Shotgun parsing is a programming antipattern whereby parsing and input-validating code is mixed with and spread across processing code—throwing a cloud of checks at the input, and hoping, without any systematic justification, that one or another would catch all the “bad” cases.</p></blockquote><p>Essentially, it describes the problem of usage of data without previous validation of its entirety of data. You could act on a part of the data that is validated beforehand, but discover that another part of the data is invalid.</p><p>The paper mentions <a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-0752\">CVE-2016-0752</a>, which is a bug that allows attackers to read arbitrary files because you can use  in the input. The paper argues that treating validation as emergent and not deliberate can lead to security bugs like these.</p><p>If we treat validation as deliberate, then it should happen as early as possible and as comprehensive as possible. By parsing first, every invariant can be proven first before executing on said data.</p><section><p>I remember this <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ViPNHMSUcog\">video</a> about lambda calculus. It concludes that types can be represented as propositions in logic, and terms as proofs. I recommend watching the video, as it is eye-opening to me and maybe it can help you realize some things too.</p><p>Fundamentally, if your program typechecks properly, then you can say that the proof is correct. Thank you Curry-Howard Correspondence. There are proof assistant programming languages that can help with this like <a href=\"https://lean-lang.org/\">Lean</a> and <a href=\"https://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php\">Agda</a>, but you can emulate this in Rust anyway. That’s how some weird libraries like the <a href=\"https://crates.io/crates/typenum\">typenum</a> crate work.</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"rust\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>This is a simple <a href=\"https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2024&amp;gist=ed2a899a9bd9806f655df5623581ad97\">program</a> in Rust where I check if  is equal to . Obviously this is not correct, and so it will appropriately give you a compile error.</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"rust\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>So sad that the error message is dogshit. Such is life.</p></section></section><section><p>There are some recommendations I usually say to people on the RPLCS discord server, adapted from the original blog post.</p><p>First, just because a function accepts a type doesn’t mean you have to use it in your structs, nor have to perpetually represent it as that type. For example, let’s say we have a third party library function that looks like this.</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"rust\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>You  have to store  in your / struct like <code>App { lightbulb_state: bool }</code>. That’s confusing. I’d rather have you define a separate enum with more semantics imbued into it, like:</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"rust\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>Yeah, people can say it gets more verbose, but I rather care more about correctness instead. Sorry.</p><p>Second, I sometimes get suspicious about these kind of APIs:</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"rust\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>If I see the function body does not do anything side-effectful, then it’s probable that parsing can help here turning  into a more structured datatype. And even for side-effectful stuff, there are some types that better represent certain situations, like infinite loop function representing their return types as  or <code>Result&lt;Infallible, MyError&gt;</code>.</p></section><section><p>I love creating more types. Five million types for everyone please.</p><p>I think it’s interesting that there’s a lot of instances where types drive the design of Rust programs. Like how  has four layers of newtypes plus an additional field.  generate anonymous structs in their  macros.  is a macro crate that converts functions into compile-time builders via types.</p><p>Of course, not everything is solvable via types. But personally I think pushing your verification code to types can help your code become clearer and more robust. Let the type system handle the validation for you. It exists, so might as well use it to its fullest extent.</p><p>I’d like to thank Alexis King for this <a href=\"https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/\">article</a> where I first encountered this idea. I’d love to follow up on this topic with an extension on this <a href=\"https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2020/11/01/names-are-not-type-safety/\">sequel</a>, and maybe recontextualizing in Rust via the  keyword would be helpful.</p><p>Of course, newtyping is not the answer to all problems. Due to lack of ergonomic features to allow newtyping—like <a href=\"https://crates.io/crates/delegate\">delegation</a>—many people are somewhat averse to using the pattern. Nevertheless, if someone made a good enough RFC I’d be happy to see it happen.</p><p>Using the type system as a compile-time checker because I want the compiler to help me write my programs is very nice. You should take advantage of the type system too, not many languages have it as good as Rust :)</p></section><h3>Liked this blog post and want some more?

However, modeling these world dynamics, especially for dexterous robotics tasks, poses significant challenges due to limited data coverage and scarce <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/papers?q=action%20labels\">action labels</a>. As an endeavor towards this end, we introduce DreamDojo, a foundation <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/papers?q=world%20model\">world model</a> that learns diverse interactions and dexterous controls from 44k hours of egocentric human videos. Our data mixture represents the largest video dataset to date for <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/papers?q=world%20model\">world model</a> pretraining, spanning a wide range of daily scenarios with diverse objects and skills. To address the scarcity of <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/papers?q=action%20labels\">action labels</a>, we introduce <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/papers?q=continuous%20latent%20actions\">continuous latent actions</a> as unified proxy actions, enhancing interaction knowledge transfer from unlabeled videos. After post-training on small-scale target robot data, DreamDojo demonstrates a strong understanding of physics and precise action controllability. We also devise a <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/papers?q=distillation%20pipeline\">distillation pipeline</a> that accelerates DreamDojo to a <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/papers?q=real-time%20speed\">real-time speed</a> of 10.81 FPS and further improves context consistency.

The concept is solid: agents forget everything between sessions, so EchoVault gives them persistent memory via SQLite (FTS5 + sqlite-vec) and Markdown files. No cloud, no API keys, just local storage.</p><p>I wanted to try it. Ran  on Linux and got:</p><pre><code>Segmentation fault (core dumped) </code></pre><p>Turns out it's a <a href=\"https://github.com/mraza007/echovault/issues/2\">known issue</a> — Python 3.13 segfaults inside the CPython runtime on some Linux configurations, consistently, across multiple machines. The fix isn't obvious and the issue is open.</p><p>Honestly, not the most noble motivation — but it was good enough of a reason to just port the thing to Go over the weekend.</p><ul><li> — download, drop on , done. No Python runtime or virtualenv required. Distributed as a single binary.</li><li> — uses  and , so you need a C compiler to build from source. Pre-built binaries are on the releases page for Linux/macOS/Windows.</li><li><strong>Vault format is identical</strong> — fully compatible with the Python version. If you're already using the original and it works for you, you can switch without losing any memories.</li><li><strong>MCP interface is the same</strong> — same three tools (, , ), same stdio transport.</li><li> for cross-platform releases.</li></ul><pre><code>memory init memory setup claude-code # or: cursor, codex, opencode </code></pre><p>Semantic search (via Ollama/OpenAI/OpenRouter) is optional — keyword search via FTS5 works out of the box with zero config.</p><p>The codebase follows standard Go layout (, ), golangci-lint is configured. It was a weekend project, so feedback welcome — especially if you hit build issues on non-Linux platforms or have thoughts on the CGO dependency.</p><p>If you're a Go developer and find this useful — contributions are welcome. There's plenty of room to improve: better embedding support, more agent integrations, smarter redaction, test coverage. The codebase is small enough to get oriented quickly. Even if you just want to kick the tires and open issues, that helps too.</p>",

      "content": "<p>If your  route is a GET endpoint, any website on the internet can log your users out by embedding <code>&lt;img src=\"https://yourapp.com/logout\"&gt;</code> in their page. The user’s browser sends the request with cookies attached, and your server happily ends their session.</p><p>That’s CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery). And logout is the least dangerous version of it.</p><p>This came up on X last week when Guillermo Rauch (vercel CEO) asked Grok to explain the problem to Aiden Bai, who had a GET-based  in production:</p><p>The rest of this post covers the actual attack mechanics, why POST alone doesn’t fix it, and what does.</p><p>Cross-Site Request Forgery is an attack where a malicious site tricks a user’s browser into making a request to a different site - one where the user is already authenticated. The browser attaches cookies automatically, so the target server sees a legitimate session and processes the request.</p><p>The attacker never sees the response, and they don’t need to. The damage is the request itself: transferring funds, changing an email address, deleting an account, logging someone out.</p><p>Say your app has this endpoint:</p><p>A user is logged in, their session cookie is set. Now imagine they visit a completely unrelated page (a forum, a blog comment section, an email with embedded HTML) that contains this:</p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>The browser renders the page, sees the  tag, makes a GET request to <code>yourapp.com/account/close</code>, and attaches the user’s cookies because the browser sees it as a normal request to a domain where the user has an active session. The server receives a valid authenticated request and closes the account. The user never clicked anything. They never even saw it happen.</p><p>This is why GET endpoints that change state are considered broken by design - the HTTP spec itself says GET should be safe and idempotent (it should not trigger side effects). Browsers, crawlers, prefetch mechanisms, and proxies all assume GET requests are safe to issue at any time.</p><p>Some developers assume switching to POST solves everything. It raises the bar, but it is not sufficient on its own.</p><p>An attacker can trigger a POST request from a malicious page using a hidden form with auto-submit:</p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>The victim visits the malicious page, the form auto-submits, and the browser sends the POST with cookies attached. If the server has no CSRF protection, it processes the request.</p><p>You can’t embed a POST in an  tag, but as shown above, a hidden auto-submitting form is four lines of HTML. The effort difference for an attacker is negligible.</p><h2>What Actually Protects You</h2><p>CSRF protection requires the server to distinguish between requests that originated from its own pages and requests forged from external sites. There are several mechanisms, each with different tradeoffs.</p><h3>CSRF Tokens (Synchronizer Token Pattern)</h3><p>The most established defense. The server generates a unique, unpredictable token per session (or per request) and embeds it in forms and headers. Every state-changing request must include this token. The attacker cannot read the token from another origin (same-origin policy prevents it), so they cannot forge a valid request.</p><p>Most server frameworks ship CSRF protection enabled by default. Django, Rails, Spring Security, Laravel all generate and verify tokens automatically on state-changing requests. Check your framework’s documentation and verify that CSRF protection is actually active in your setup.</p><p>The  cookie attribute tells the browser when to attach cookies on cross-site requests:</p><ul><li>: cookie is never sent on cross-site requests. Strong protection, but breaks legitimate flows like clicking a link from an email to a logged-in page.</li><li>: cookie is sent on top-level navigations (clicking a link) but not on cross-origin sub-requests (form posts, image loads, fetches). This blocks the  and auto-submitting form attacks described above.</li><li>: cookie is always sent cross-site. Requires  flag. Use only when you have a real cross-origin use case.</li></ul><p>Modern browsers default to  when no  attribute is specified. This is a meaningful improvement. The <code>&lt;img src=\"https://yourapp.com/account/close\"&gt;</code> attack no longer works with default cookie settings in modern browsers. But relying on browser defaults as your only defense is fragile. Older browsers, WebViews in mobile apps, and certain embedded contexts may not enforce  consistently.</p><p>Set  explicitly on session cookies as a baseline. Use  where the UX allows it.</p><h3>For API-Only Backends (SPA + API Architecture)</h3><p>If your backend is a pure API serving a JavaScript frontend, the threat model is different. Browsers enforce that cross-origin  or  calls with custom headers (like <code>Authorization: Bearer ...</code>) trigger CORS preflight checks. If your API uses token-based auth (JWT in an  header) instead of cookies, CSRF is largely mitigated because the attacker’s page cannot set custom headers on cross-origin requests.</p><p>If your API uses cookies for authentication (common with  session cookies for SPAs), you are still vulnerable to CSRF and need token-based or  protections.</p><p>If you take nothing else from this post:</p><ol><li>Use your framework’s CSRF protection. Don’t disable it without a documented reason.</li><li>Set  explicitly on session cookies.</li><li>Cookie-based auth on an SPA? You still need CSRF tokens.</li></ol><p>Also, use tooling that can help like <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://semgrep.dev/\">Semgrep</a>. It catches static patterns in your code: missing CSRF middleware,  decorators, etc. It has rules for common frameworks and you can write custom ones. Run it in CI on every pull request.</p><p>The X thread that sparked this post is a useful reminder: every major framework ships CSRF protection by default, browsers default to , and the tooling exists. CSRF keeps happening because developers disable protections they don’t understand, use GET for mutations out of convenience, or assume their SPA architecture makes them immune.</p>",

I build on top of LLMs and have swapped models three times with minimal impact on results.</p><p>But the article itself is clearly AI-generated, and it's full of errors that prove the opposite of what the author intended.</p><p> The article includes a 7-second animated explainer. Pause it and you find Anthropic spelled as \"Fathropic,\" Claude as \"Clac#,\" OpenAI as \"OpenAll,\" and a notepad reading \"Cluly fol Slopball!\" The article's own $300B valuation claim shows up as \"$30B\" in the video. There's no way the author watched this before publishing...</p><p><strong>The timeline is fabricated:</strong> The article claims OpenAI \"panic-shipped\" GPT-5.2-Codex on Feb 5 in response to Clawbot going viral on Jan 27. Except GPT-5.2-Codex launched on January 14 — two weeks before Clawbot. What actually launched Feb 5 was GPT-5.3-Codex. The article got the model name wrong.</p><p><strong>The selloff attribution is wrong:</strong> The article blames the February tech selloff on Clawbot proving commoditization. Bloomberg, Fortune, and CNBC all attribute it to Anthropic's Cowork legal automation plugin — investors worried about AI replacing IT services work. RELX crashed 13%, Nifty IT fell 19%. None of it was about Clawbot.</p><p><strong>The financials are stale:</strong> cites Anthropic at $183B and projects a 40-60% IPO haircut. By publication date, Anthropic's term sheet was at $350B. The round closed at $380B four days later.</p><p>The irony: an AI-generated article about AI having no moat is the best evidence that AI still needs humans checking the work. The models assembled a convincing  of market analysis without verifying whether any of it holds together.</p><p><em>Disclosure: I used AI tools for research and drafting.

      "content": "<p>It's been a long time since I wrote something in this newsletter. Recently I was learning about language parsing and abstract syntax trees. After getting some knowledge about this, I decided to write a JSON parser from scratch.</p><p>It is the process of analysing the structure of a string (basically any programming language syntax). Parsing helps us to determine the meaning of the text. Writing a parser for a programming language is a very complex task because programming languages generally have a lot of keywords and syntax rules. Handling all those syntax and keywords can be overwhelming and highly difficult. But in the case of JSON we have a very limited number of keywords and syntax rules. So writing a JSON parser is a relatively easier task.</p><p>It is the process that is done before parsing. Tokenization means breaking down and categorizing string of character into smallest units called tokens. Below table will give you a solid idea of what tokens look like.</p><pre><code>JSON:\n{\n  \"name\": \"iPhone 6s\",\n  \"price\": 649.99,\n  \"isAvailable\": true\n}\n\n\nToken       : Type\n------------:--------------\n{           : BRACE_OPEN  \nname        : STRING  \n:           : COLON  \niPhone 6s   : STRING  \n,           : COMMA  \nprice       : STRING  \n:           : COLON  \n649.99      : NUMBER  \n,           : COMMA  \nisAvailable : STRING  \n:           : COLON  \ntrue        : TRUE  \n}           : BRACE_CLOSE  \n\n</code></pre><p>Once tokenization break down string into tokens than these tokens are given to Parser which created an Abstract Syntax Tree. We will discuss it later in this post. But your 1st step is to create a tokenizer.</p><p>Now let’s get into the code part where we tokenize a JSON string.</p><p>I wrote a function called  which takes a JSON string and returns a list of tokens. It loops through the string, character by character, and breaks it down into meaningful pieces like , ,  or . These pieces are what we call .</p><p>Here’s the full code, broken down step by step.</p><p>We will first start with creating some basic types for all the tokens.</p><p>We start with a  pointer to keep track of where we are in the string.  helps us not go out of bounds, and  is the slice where we’ll collect all the tokens we generate.</p><p>We loop through the entire string. If we hit whitespace, we skip it because whitespace doesn't matter in JSON.</p><h4>Switch through known single-character tokens</h4><p>Than we handle all the simple symbols here. These don’t need much logic — just push them to the tokens list and move on.</p><p>When we encounter a , we start reading a string. We look for the closing quote, while also making sure to skip escaped quotes like . If the string is never closed, we throw an error. Otherwise, we extract the string and add it as a token.</p><p>We check for , , and  first. If we see one of these keywords, we push it to the tokens list and jump ahead accordingly.</p><h4>Numbers (slightly tricky)</h4><p>JSON numbers can get complex. They might contain decimals, negative signs, and exponential notation (like ). We carefully walk through each character to build the number string. I also added validations to reject bad formats like , multiple dots, or missing exponent digits.</p><p>If none of the above matched, the character is invalid in JSON — so we just throw an error.</p><p>This method is used to check for bad leading numbers in JSON.</p><p>This just prints the list of tokens in a nice readable format. Super handy when testing your tokenizer.</p><p>If we give below JSON to our tokenizer we will get following output.</p><pre><code>{\n  \"name\": \"iPhone 6s\",\n  \"price\": 649.99,\n  \"isAvailable\": true\n}</code></pre><p>Now our JSON is nicely tokenized and each character had been given its appropriate token type.</p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/x-sushant-x/JSON-Parser/blob/main/tokenizer.go\"></a></p><p>We have now created a tokeniser that converts JSON objects to tokens. The next step is to create a parser that can convert these tokens into an abstract syntax tree. But first, let's understand what an abstract syntax tree is.</p><h4>Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)</h4><p>This is the base interface for all AST node types. Every node will implement the  method, which is a simple way to identify what kind of data (Object, Array, String, etc.) it holds.</p><ul><li>This is the main function you call to parse the token stream.</li><li>It checks if there’s anything to parse. Then it initializes a  pointer (used as an index into the  slice).</li><li>Delegates to , which handles all the different types.</li></ul><p>Basic safety check: if the current token is past the end, return an error.</p><p>Now comes the type-checking:</p><ul><li>String token → wrap it in .</li><li>Number → parse into float64.</li><li>Booleans and null are direct mappings.</li><li>Delegates to specialized functions for objects () and arrays ().</li><li>Anything unexpected = throw an error.</li></ul><ul><li>Extract the key from the object and parse the value using the already written  function.</li></ul><ul><li>Start parsing array (skip the  token).</li><li>Each value is parsed with and append value to initialized array.</li><li>Ensure the array ends correctly with .</li></ul><p>Below is the output we will get if we parse the tokens of JSON that we used above.</p><pre><code>{\n    map[isAvailable:{true}\n    name:{iPhone 6s} \n    price:{649.99}]\n}</code></pre><ul><li>Try converting this AST node to native Golang data structure and use it.</li></ul><p>I'm always willing to get to make new connections.</p><p>So this was how we could implement a simple JSON tokenizer and parser from scratch.

      "content": "<p>About a year ago I <a href=\"https://gustedt.wordpress.com/2025/01/06/simple-defer-ready-to-use/\">posted about </a> and that it would be available for everyone using gcc and/or clang soon. So it is probably time for an update.</p><p>Two things have happened in the mean time:</p><ul><li>Both gcc and clang communities have worked on integrating this feature into their C implementations.</li></ul><p>I have not yet got my hands on the gcc implementation (but this is also less urgent, see below), but I have been able to use clang’s which is available starting with clang-22.</p><p>I think that with this in mind everybody developing in C could and should now seriously consider switching to  for their cleanup handling: </p><ul><li>no more resource leakage or blocked mutexes on rarely used code paths, </li><li>no more spaghetti code just to cover all possibilities for preliminary exits from functions.</li></ul><p>I am not sure if the compiler people are also planning back ports of these features, but with some simple work around and slightly reduced grammar for the  feature this works for me from gcc-9 onward and for clang-22 onward:</p><div><pre title=\"\">#if __has_include(&lt;stddefer.h&gt;)\n# include &lt;stddefer.h&gt;\n# if defined(__clang__)\n#  if __is_identifier(_Defer)\n#   error \"clang may need the option -fdefer-ts for the _Defer feature\"\n#  endif\n# endif\n#elif __GNUC__ &gt; 8\n# define defer _Defer\n# define _Defer      _Defer_A(__COUNTER__)\n# define _Defer_A(N) _Defer_B(N)\n# define _Defer_B(N) _Defer_C(_Defer_func_ ## N, _Defer_var_ ## N)\n# define _Defer_C(F, V)                                                 \\\n  auto void F(int*);                                                    \\\n  __attribute__((__cleanup__(F), __deprecated__, __unused__))           \\\n     int V;                                                             \\\n  __attribute__((__always_inline__, __deprecated__, __unused__))        \\\n    inline auto void F(__attribute__((__unused__)) int*V)\n#else\n# error \"The _Defer feature seems not available\"\n#endif\n\n</pre></div><p>So this is already a large panel of compilers. Obviously it depends on your admissible compile platforms whether or not these are sufficient for you. In any case, with these you may compile for a very wide set of installs since  does not need any specific software infrastructure or library once the code is compiled.</p><p>As already discussed many times, the gcc fallback uses the so-called “nested function” feature which is always subject of intense debate and even flame wars. Don’t worry, the implementation as presented here, even when compiled with no optimization at all, does not produce any hidden function in the executable, and in particular there is no “trampoline” or whatever that would put your execution at risk of a stack exploit.</p><p>You may also notice that there is no fallback for older clang version. This is because their so-called “blocks” extension cannot easily be used as a drop-in to replace nested function: their semantics to access variables from the surrounding scope are different and not compatible with the  feature as defined by TS 25755.</p><p>So for example if you are scared of using big VLA on the stack, you may use the above code in headers and something like</p><div><pre title=\"\">double* BigArray\n  = malloc(sizeof(double[aLot]));\nif (!BigArray {\n  exit(EXIT_FALURE);\n}\ndefer { \n  free(BigArray); \n}\n</pre></div><p>to have an implementation of a big array with a failure mode for the allocation. </p><p>Or if you want to be sure that all your mutexes are unlocked when you leave a critical section, use and idiom as here</p><div><pre title=\"\">{\n  if (mtx_lock(&amp;mtx) != thrd_success) {\n    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);\n  }\n  defer {\n    mtx_unlock(&amp;mtx);\n  }\n\n  ... do something complicated ...\n\n  if (rareCondition) {\n    return 42;\n  }\n\n  ... do something even more complicated ...\n}\n</pre></div><p>Just notice, that you’d always have to use the  feature with curly braces to ensure that the gcc fallback works smoothly.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Let me show you how to use Lindenmayer systems to produce beautiful images like\nthis one:</p><p>We’ll start by talking about turtles.</p><p>Some of you are nodding along like this is an obvious starting point; others\nare rather confused. In 1967(!) some brilliant engineers designed an\neducational programming language called\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)\">Logo</a>. It lets you\nmake <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics\">turtle graphics</a> drawings\nby telling a “turtle” with a “pen” where to walk on the screen, drawing a line\nas it goes. I just learned when writing this that there were also <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_(robot)\">physical\nprogrammable turtles</a> that would\ndraw on paper!</p><p>So yeah, we’re startings with turtles. Logo turtles had all sorts of fancy\ncommands, but ours will need just three:</p><ul><li> means “walk forward one unit”</li><li> means “turn left a quarter turn”</li><li> means “turn right a quarter turn”</li></ul><p>The turtle starts in the center of the screen facing up. So the program \nwill drawn an “L”:</p><p>The turtle’s path is drawn as a gradient from white to yellow to green. If you\nhave an active imagination you can pretend that the green dot at the end is a\nturtle.</p><p>And the program  will draw an “F”:</p><p>What if you want your turtle to turn at angles other than a quarter turn? We\ncould go the route that Logo did, and give an arbitrary angle for every turn.\nBut for the sorts of drawing we’re going to do we can get away with something\nsimpler: we’ll declare up front what angle  and  should turn. (Measured in\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_(angle)\">turns</a>, of course.)</p><p>For example, to draw a hexagon we could use the angle 1/6 and run the turtle\nprogram :</p><p>Drawing a detailed image this way would take a really long sequence of ,\n, and . Again, Logo solved this in a general way by adding loops to the\nlanguage, but we’re going to do something a lot more specialized. We’re going to\nuse an idea by Aristid Lindenmayer in 1968, now called “Lindenmayer Systems” or\n“L-Systems”.</p><p>(This timing—Logo in 1967 and L-Systems in 1968—is suspicious, isn’t it? I’m\nnot aware of any explicit cross-polination of ideas between Lindenmayer and the\nLogo creators, but wouldn’t be surprised if one partially inspired the other.)</p><p>Lindenmayer’s idea is to have a , and some  that\nreplace a letter with a sequence of instructions. You start with the  and repeatedly replace letters according to the  for\nsome number of iterations. Then you have the turtle follow the (now very long)\nsequence of instructions.</p><p>This will be easier to follow with an example.</p><p>One pretty picture that can be drawn with an L-system is the . Its\nrules are:</p><pre><code>start: R\nproductions:\n    R -&gt; Rf+L\n    L -&gt; Rf-L\nangle: 1/4\n</code></pre><p>Iterations of the dragon curve look like this:</p><ul><li>The 0th iteration starts with the  string, so it’s just .</li><li>The 1st iteration replaces that  according to the production rule\n, so it becomes .</li><li>The 2nd iteration replaces both the  and  according to the production\nrules, giving .</li></ul><p>We get to choose how many iterations to do. Let’s say we do 9 iterations.

The gradients I’ve implemented fall into three\ncategories:</p><ul><li>Color gradients built out of combinators for things like scaling, cycling, and\nsawtoothing. These are all in\n<a href=\"https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/\">OK-LAB</a> color space.</li><li>A very fancy color gradient based on the 3D Hilbert curve. The idea is to (i)\ndraw a cube in OK-LAB color space; (ii) trace a 3D Hilbert curve through the\ncube; (iii) dye the curve according to the cube’s colors; then (iv) straighten\nthe curve and then lay it out on the curve that you’re drawing.</li></ul><p>The last approach makes for very textured pictures since the 3D Hilbert curve\nchanges color so quickly. (It covers all the colors on the cube, which is most\npossible colors.) For example, here’s the dragon curve with a 3D-Hilbert curve\ncolor gradient:</p><p>Putting this all together, you can draw some very pretty pictures.</p><p>A haphazard curve I made that’s pretty nonetheless:</p><p>An “s curve” of my devising.</p><p>UPDATE: I said in the readme about this curve that “It’s very simple, so I\nwouldn’t be surprised if I wasn’t the first to find it.” Indeed, someone emailed\nme to point out it was discovered by Knuth and Davis under the name “Terdragon\ncurve”: it can be viewed as a variant of the dragon curve.</p><p>Wunderlich’s third space filling curve:</p><p>Sierpinski’s space filling curve:</p><p>UPDATE: Some new curves.

A business-as-usual dependency bump is a woefully insufficient remediation for an actual vulnerability, but it’s the only practical response to the constant stream of low-value Dependabot alerts.</p><p>This is why as Go Security Team lead back in 2020–2021 I insisted the team invest in staffing the Go Vulnerability Database and implement a vulnerability scanner with static analysis filtering.</p><p>The govulncheck Action will not automatically open a PR for you, and that’s a good thing! Now that security alerts are not mostly noise, you can afford to actually look at them and take them seriously, including any required remediation.</p><p>Noisy vulnerability scanners also impact the open source ecosystem. I often get issues and PRs demanding I update the dependencies of my projects due to vulnerabilities that don’t affect them, because someone’s scanner is failing to filter them. That’s extra toil dropped at the feet of open source maintainers, which is unsustainable. The maintainer’s <a href=\"https://geomys.org/standard-of-care\">responsibility</a> is making sure projects are not affected by security vulnerabilities. The responsibility of scanning tools is making sure they don’t disturb their users with false positives.</p><h2>Test against latest instead of updating</h2><p>The other purpose of Dependabot is to keep dependencies up to date, regardless of security vulnerabilities. Your practices and requirements will vary, but I find this misguided, too.</p><p>Dependencies should be updated according to  development cycle, not the cycle of each of your dependencies. For example you might want to update dependencies all at once when you begin a release development cycle, as opposed to when each dependency completes theirs.</p><p>There are two benefits to quick updates, though: first, you can notice and report (or fix) breakage more rapidly, instead of being stalled by an incompatibility that could have been addressed a year prior; second, you reduce your patch delta  you need to update due to a security vulnerability, reducing the risk of having to rush through a refactor or unrelated fixes.</p><p>You can capture both of those benefits without actually updating the dependencies by simply running CI against the latest versions of your dependencies every day. You just need to run  before your test suite. In the npm ecosystem, you just run  instead of .</p><p>This way, you will still be alerted quickly of any potential issues, without having to pay attention to unproblematic updates, which you can defer to whenever fits your project best.</p><pre><code>name: Go tests\non:\n  push:\n  pull_request:\n  schedule: # daily at 10:22 UTC\n    - cron: '22 10 * * *'\n  workflow_dispatch:\npermissions:\n  contents: read\njobs:\n  test:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    strategy:\n      fail-fast: false\n      matrix:\n        go:\n          - { go-version: stable }\n          - { go-version-file: go.mod }\n        deps:\n          - locked\n          - latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v5\n        with:\n          persist-credentials: false\n      - uses: actions/setup-go@v6\n        with:\n          go-version: ${{ matrix.go.go-version }}\n          go-version-file: ${{ matrix.go.go-version-file }}\n      - uses: geomys/sandboxed-step@v1.2.1\n        with:\n          run: |\n            if [ \"${{ matrix.deps }}\" = \"latest\" ]; then\n              go get -u -t ./...\n            fi\n            go test -v ./...\n</code></pre><p>The Tevere has overflowed its lower banks, so a lot of previously familiar landscapes have changed slightly, almost eerily.

This makes SnapX the first Avalonia app to run on FreeBSD and offer industry-leading OCR while also offering screenshot &amp; upload functionality.</p><p>The image formats currently supported are: PNG, WEBP, AVIF, JPEG, GIF, TIFF, and BMP.</p><p>I am looking into adding JPEG XL support with a jxl-rs wrapper NuGet package.</p><p>The image library I chose for it is ImageSharp. It's simpler than SkiaSharp and open source for open source projects. It also doesn't rely on a native library.</p><p>You can also fully configure SnapX via the Command Line, Environment variables, and the Windows Registry.</p><p>You don't need .NET installed.</p><p>It is built on .NET 10, the same as ShareX. SnapX is deployed with NativeAOT using Avalonia. If you want to know how I migrated all of hundreds of thousands of lines of UI in WinForms, I simply deleted them and reimplemented what I knew users would immediately need while looking at ShareX's source. Kudos to ShareX's developers for making their codebase simple to develop in.</p><p>With that being said, I spent a lot of nights with 10,000+ errors after doing so... I probably lost a decent bit of my sanity, but nothing worth doing comes without a cost. After the UI migration, I decided to make sure SnapX could take advantage of NativeAOT, as it's an exciting technology. No .NET install needed on the user's machines?!? Anyway, that led to a few more nights of migrating the destinations to use System.Text.Json.</p><p>I even went as far as making the configurations use YAML for comment support. I did try TOML since it's very popular with other Linux users. However, for such a heavily nested configuration, I ran into a multitude of issues that were not something I'm willing to subject someone else to.</p><p>As for why I chose Avalonia over something like GTK4? I might face some backlash for this, but... I like writing UI in XAML. I'm new to it, but there's a lot of documentation for it. It's also a nicely integrated experience with my editor. If I had gone with GTK4 in C#, it would've been more difficult.</p>",

A business-as-usual dependency bump is a woefully insufficient remediation for an actual vulnerability, but it’s the only practical response to the constant stream of low-value Dependabot alerts.</p><p>This is why as Go Security Team lead back in 2020–2021 I insisted the team invest in staffing the Go Vulnerability Database and implement a vulnerability scanner with static analysis filtering.</p><p>The govulncheck Action will not automatically open a PR for you, and that’s a good thing! Now that security alerts are not mostly noise, you can afford to actually look at them and take them seriously, including any required remediation.</p><p>Noisy vulnerability scanners also impact the open source ecosystem. I often get issues and PRs demanding I update the dependencies of my projects due to vulnerabilities that don’t affect them, because someone’s scanner is failing to filter them. That’s extra toil dropped at the feet of open source maintainers, which is unsustainable. The maintainer’s <a href=\"https://geomys.org/standard-of-care\">responsibility</a> is making sure projects are not affected by security vulnerabilities. The responsibility of scanning tools is making sure they don’t disturb their users with false positives.</p><h2>Test against latest instead of updating</h2><p>The other purpose of Dependabot is to keep dependencies up to date, regardless of security vulnerabilities. Your practices and requirements will vary, but I find this misguided, too.</p><p>Dependencies should be updated according to  development cycle, not the cycle of each of your dependencies. For example you might want to update dependencies all at once when you begin a release development cycle, as opposed to when each dependency completes theirs.</p><p>There are two benefits to quick updates, though: first, you can notice and report (or fix) breakage more rapidly, instead of being stalled by an incompatibility that could have been addressed a year prior; second, you reduce your patch delta  you need to update due to a security vulnerability, reducing the risk of having to rush through a refactor or unrelated fixes.</p><p>You can capture both of those benefits without actually updating the dependencies by simply running CI against the latest versions of your dependencies every day. You just need to run  before your test suite. In the npm ecosystem, you just run  instead of .</p><p>This way, you will still be alerted quickly of any potential issues, without having to pay attention to unproblematic updates, which you can defer to whenever fits your project best.</p><pre><code>name: Go tests\non:\n  push:\n  pull_request:\n  schedule: # daily at 10:22 UTC\n    - cron: '22 10 * * *'\n  workflow_dispatch:\npermissions:\n  contents: read\njobs:\n  test:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    strategy:\n      fail-fast: false\n      matrix:\n        go:\n          - { go-version: stable }\n          - { go-version-file: go.mod }\n        deps:\n          - locked\n          - latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v5\n        with:\n          persist-credentials: false\n      - uses: actions/setup-go@v6\n        with:\n          go-version: ${{ matrix.go.go-version }}\n          go-version-file: ${{ matrix.go.go-version-file }}\n      - uses: geomys/sandboxed-step@v1.2.1\n        with:\n          run: |\n            if [ \"${{ matrix.deps }}\" = \"latest\" ]; then\n              go get -u -t ./...\n            fi\n            go test -v ./...\n</code></pre><p>The Tevere has overflowed its lower banks, so a lot of previously familiar landscapes have changed slightly, almost eerily.

This CPU uses the LoongArch64 instruction set\narchitecture (ISA).  is a 64-bit RISC ISA inspired by MIPS and\nRISC-V introduced by Loongson Technology in 2021.\n<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loongson\">From Wikipedia</a>:</p><blockquote><p>A Loongson developer described it as “…a new RISC ISA, which is a bit like\nMIPS or RISC-V. LoongArch includes a reduced 32-bit version (LA32R), a\nstandard 32-bit version (LA32S) and a 64-bit version (LA64)”.\nThe stated rationale was to make Loongson and China not dependent on foreign\ntechnology or authorisation to develop their processor capability, whilst not\ninfringing on any technology patents.</p></blockquote><p>LA64 has 32 64-bit general purpose registers (–). Like RISC-V \nis hard-wired to zero. There’s also 32 64-bit floating point registers\n(–). The 3A6000 supports two vector extensions (SIMD):</p><ul><li>LSX (Loongson SIMD eXtension) with 128-bit vectors. (–)</li><li>LASX (Loongson Advanced SIMD eXtension) with 256-bit vectors. (–)</li></ul><blockquote><p>for example, on a core implementing LSX and LASX, the lower 128 bits of \nis shared with  and the lower 64 bits of  is shared with \nsame with all other VRs.</p></blockquote><p>LoongArch is interesting to me because:</p><ol><li>It’s a different architecture to the vast majority of systems in use today, which\nuse x86_64 and ARM CPUs.</li><li>Performance is better than most RISC-V CPUs currently available.</li><li>It’s somewhat Linux first.</li><li>It’s supported by <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://chimera-linux.org/\">Chimera Linux</a>. As a Chimera package maintainer I thought it would\nbe handy to have hardware to test on.</li></ol><p>Regarding №3: Since neither Windows, nor macOS support the architecture that leaves\nLinux-based operating systems as a great option. Therefore Loongson has an\ninterest in that working well. They have contributed to Linux, musl, and also\ndid their own initial ports of Debian and Alpine Linux. This kind of makes it\nan architecture with Linux-first support.</p><ul><li> Loongson-3A6000 4-core/8-thread 64-bit @ 2.5Ghz</li><li> 16Gb DDR4 SO-DIMM, 1 of 2 slots populated</li><li> RTL8821CE 802.11ac PCIe Wireless Network Adapter</li></ul><p>It has a plethora of ports:</p><ul><li>Front:\n<ul><li>1 × USB 3.0 Type-C with PD</li></ul></li><li>Back:\n<ul><li>2 × HDMI, supporting up to 4K 30Hz each</li><li>2 × Gigabit Ethernet ports</li></ul></li></ul><p>Opening the bottom of the case requires removing the four screws in the bottom,\none under each of the rubber feet. In the bottom section is the M.2 slot and\nlarge blower fan.</p><p>The blower fan runs constantly at a fairly high speed, making it much noisier\nthan any other computer I own. I contacted MOREFINE about it, and\nthey confirmed that it was expected:</p><blockquote><p>Does not affect normal operations\nThere is currently no other way to adjust its noise; this is a normal state</p></blockquote><p>Opening the top of the case requires removing the two screws on the back panel\nabove the ports. Then using something thin in one of the screw holes lever the\ntop up a bit so you can get under it and flip it up. Be careful as it has Wi-Fi and\nBluetooth antennas attached to it.</p><p>In the top you get access to the SO-DIMM RAM slots. There’s also space for a\n3.5“ SATA SSD or HD. The M700S came with mounting hardware for this and a small SATA\ncable that plugs into the ports at the top right.</p><p>Out of the box it comes with Loongnix installed, an apt-based loongarch\ndistribution with KDE 5 desktop. It indicates it was built in 2024, but uses\nquite dated components. The project seems defunct as the website and package\nservers were inaccessible, although perhaps it’s only accessible within China.\nNo matter, as the goal was always to run Chimera Linux on it. The password to\nthe Loongnix installation was not readily obvious to me, but a recent post on\nthe <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://duckdb.org/2026/01/06/duckdb-on-loongarch-morefine\">DuckDB blog about the same machine</a> had the necessary details.</p><p>The BIOS (UEFI) is in Chinese by default. When the machine boots press F2 or down arrow\nto enter the UEFI.</p><p>The initial option selected when the UEFI starts is the language\nselector. Press Enter, then select English. If you save and exit at this point the\nUEFI and boot messages will remain in English.</p><p>With that out of the way I booted off a Chimera ISO on a USB stick and followed\n<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://chimera-linux.org/docs/installation\">the instructions</a> for a normal install. There’s nothing out\nof the ordinary required for the  install. The steps are identical\nto an x86_64 install, right down to using  as the bootloader.\nThis makes for a refreshing change from Snapdragon X machines, which still\ndon’t have complete or widespread Linux distribution support.</p><figure><figcaption>Video capture of M700S booting to Chimera login prompt.</figcaption></figure><p>With the base installation complete I proceeded to install <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.gnome.org/\">GNOME</a>. This is\nwhere I ran into my first issue. I could log in with GDM and get to the\ndesktop, even open a terminal or Firefox but within a few seconds I’d be kicked\nback to the GDM login screen. I also tried <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://wayfire.org/\">Wayfire</a>, and an <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.xfce.org/\">Xfce</a> Wayland session\nwith <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://labwc.github.io/\">Labwc</a>, but all of them yielded EGL-related errors and failed to start. For\nexample this is the Wayfire output:</p><pre><code data-lang=\"plain\"></code></pre><p>Undeterred, I installed X.Org and started an Xfce X11 session, and all was well.</p><p>The Loongson-3A6000 is not particularly fast or efficient. At idle it consumes\nabout 27W and under load it goes up to 65W.</p><p>For comparison the Intel N100 based mini-PC connected to my TV consumes ~7W\nwhen idle and scores 12.7 on Speedometer 3.1. My AMD Ryzen 9950X3D scores 36.7 (and\nchews through way more power).</p><p> All Speedometer tests were done in modern Firefox, with no extensions.\nIt does appear that as of last year Firefox has JIT support for loongarch64.</p><p>Another test I performed was building the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/yeslogic/allsorts\">allsorts Rust crate</a> (v0.16.1). On\nthe LoongArch machine it takes almost 44 seconds. On my Ryzen 9950X3D with\n (to make it slightly more comparable) it completes the build in 22\nseconds.</p><p>So, overall it’s not a particularly efficient machine, and while the performance\nis nothing special it does seem readily usable. Browsing JS heavy web applications like\n<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost\">Mattermost</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://mastodon.decentralised.social/@wezm\">Mastodon</a> runs fine. Subjectively it feels faster than all the\nRaspberry Pi systems I’ve used (up to a Pi 400).</p><p>One of the reasons I got the machine was for testing software and attempting\nto address incompatibilities.</p><p>A rudimentary search (<code>rg -g template.py -B 1 broken | rg -A 1 loongarch64</code>) through\n<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/chimera-linux/cports\">cports</a>, the Chimera Linux ports collection, revealed this list of packages\nmarked broken on :</p><ul><li><ul><li>“old nix crate, can’t update”</li></ul></li><li><ul><li>“vendor/github.com/aperturerobotics/jacobsa-crypto/cmac/hash.go:97:3: undefined: xorBlock”</li></ul></li><li><ul><li>“linux-raw-sys does not support, can’t bump (semver)”</li></ul></li><li><ul><li>“outdated nix crate, can’t update”</li></ul></li><li><ul><li>“ring 0.16.20 fails to build”</li></ul></li><li><ul><li>“outdated nix crate, can’t update”</li></ul></li><li><ul><li>“vendor/github.com/creack/pty/pty_linux.go:39:8: undefined: _C_uint”</li></ul></li><li><ul><li>“saferith@v0.33.0/arith_decl.go:…: missing function body”</li></ul></li><li><ul><li>“rustix/libc interaction garbage strikes again”</li></ul></li><li><ul><li>“outdated nix crate, can’t update”</li></ul></li><li><ul><li>“cannot find value  in module ”</li></ul></li><li><ul><li>“outdated nix crate, can’t update”</li></ul></li><li><ul><li>“outdated nix crate, can’t update”</li></ul></li><li><ul><li>“causes a machine exception at runtime”</li></ul></li><li><ul><li>“old nix crate, can’t update”</li></ul></li><li><ul><li>“riscv64/loongarch64 dynamic_arch is currently broken”</li></ul></li></ul><p>As you can see the list is pretty small.

On the release side, ThunderKittens 2.0 brings:</p><ul><li>: , CLC scheduling, tensor memory controllability, many new utilities, PDL, and more.</li><li><strong>Major refactor of the internal code</strong>, during which we found a number of subtle inefficiencies described throughout the rest of this post.</li><li><strong>Much simpler build structure</strong> for all of our example kernels, so you (or your agent) can easily adapt them for your own use!</li><li><strong>Contributions from industry</strong>: many companies have their own internal fork of ThunderKittens, and many were generous enough to contribute them back to us!</li></ul><p>These changes enabled us to write even faster kernels with new optimization strategies and fewer lines of code.

All of the kernels (both TK and cuBLAS) were benchmarked using bitwise-identical random inputs with 500 warmup iterations, 100 profiling iterations, and L2 cache eviction. Details on the benchmarking method are described later in this post.</em></p></div><p>We also updated all of our <a href=\"https://github.com/HazyResearch/ThunderKittens/tree/main/kernels\">existing example kernels</a> to use the newer APIs, and are actively implementing more state-of-the-art kernels with TK (e.g., Flash Attention 4, grouped GEMMs, GEMV).</p><p>That's it for the release! Please check out our <a href=\"https://github.com/HazyResearch/ThunderKittens\">repository</a> for the details. The rest of this post cherry-picks some of the interesting technical details we found while optimizing TK. Specifically, we'll discuss:</p><ul><li>. Can't escape it if you want to squeeze out the last few TFLOPs! Tightening memory synchronization with proper reasoning is crucial to getting peak performance.</li><li><strong>Tensor core and memory pipelining</strong>. Some tensor core instructions are implicitly pipelined without proper documentation, and the best memory pipelining strategy for the given workload might not be so obvious.</li><li><strong>Hinting the PTX assembler properly</strong>. It really doesn't trust us otherwise! Logically identical code can produce meaningfully different instructions depending on how it's written.</li><li>. Don't trust what the code suggests; distributed shared memory does not work identically across all SMs, and tensor core instructions silently limit occupancy.</li><li><strong>Benchmarking GPU kernels correctly</strong>, with L2 usage and power consumption in mind.</li></ul><p>We deliberately chose topics that are interesting and not well-covered elsewhere. These are the  bits to really squeeze out everything. For obtaining the first 90% of TFLOPs, we recommend reading <a href=\"https://www.modular.com/blog/matrix-multiplication-on-nvidias-blackwell-part-1-introduction\">this great blog post</a> from Modular.</p><p>CUDA/PTX provides many different kinds of memory consistency primitives. Missing memory synchronization leads to race conditions, while unnecessary ones lead to a loss of TFLOPs. In fact, tightening the acquire/release pattern usage was one of the last optimizations required for our <a href=\"https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2025-09-28-tp-llama-main\">Megakernel</a> implementation to surpass SGLang: we observed that a few loose fence instructions caused  in performance.</p><p>Here, we'll demonstrate how we reason about using the memory fence and how it can lead to performance improvements. As a running example for this section, ThunderKittens previously included the following code in its Blackwell blockscaled tensor core matrix multiplication path (the  function):</p><p>To provide a brief background on what is happening here: this code is performing the 5th generation tensor core matrix multiplication. The operands A and B matrix tiles reside in shared memory, and the output is accumulated onto tensor memory. In addition, this performs blockscaled matrix multiplies (e.g., MXFP8 or NVFP4); thus, the input scales for A and B reside in the tensor memory as well. Fully understanding blockscaled matrix multiplication does not really matter here, but you can read more about it in this <a href=\"https://cursor.com/blog/kernels\">other blog post</a> if you are interested.</p><p>So why the two fence instructions? Before the tensor cores begin consuming data (upon issuance of ), we need to ensure that all inputs are loaded to their respective locations (tensor memory and shared memory) and are visible to the tensor cores. These fences serve as safety measures guaranteeing that all preceding loads and copies have completed and their effects are visible.</p><p>However, profiling this path revealed that the two fences cost roughly 20-30 TFLOPs in compute throughput of the GEMM kernel. So the natural question was: do we actually need them?</p><h3>Understanding the PTX memory consistency model</h3><p>To understand what these fences do in the first place, we must understand the PTX memory consistency model better.</p><p>In PTX, a memory write to shared or global memory by one thread is guaranteed to be visible to reads by other threads, provided the write and read are ordered by . Two memory operations X and Y are causally ordered if:</p><ol><li>X and Y are issued by the same thread,</li><li>X synchronizes with Y, or</li><li>There is another operation Z between X and Y, where X-Z and Z-Y are ordered by causality (transitivity).</li></ol><p>We say “X synchronizes with Y” if either (1) X and Y are both barrier operations () executed on the same barrier, or (2) if X is write-release, Y is read-acquire, and Y observes the value written by X. There are additional nuances and cases on this, but these should suffice for the purposes of this post.</p><div><img src=\"https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/static/posts/2026-02-19-tk-2/figure-2.png\" alt=\"Examples of causality in PTX\"><p><em>Figure 2: Examples of memory operations ordered by causality in PTX.</em></p></div><p>There is also an additional concept of . A proxy refers to a group of memory access methods. Most memory operations (e.g., , ) use the . However, some asynchronous operations like  or  (TMA) use the . The above causality ordering only holds within the same proxy. In order for causality to hold between two different proxies, a proxy fence () instruction must be inserted in between.</p><h3>Can the tensor cores observe the inputs?</h3><p>By the time the tensor cores begin matrix multiplication (via the issuance of the  instruction), they must be able to observe:</p><ol><li>The input A and B tiles, loaded through TMA into shared memory (i.e., through the  instruction).</li><li>The input scales, loaded through the  instruction into tensor memory.</li></ol><p>Note that the tensor cores must also observe that the epilogue threads are no longer accessing the accumulator, but we set that aside for this post.</p><p>We must fully understand what happens between the writes ( and ) and the read (), and to determine whether the inputs are guaranteed to be visible to the tensor cores. Answering this requires collecting and combining information scattered across several parts of the PTX documentation, then reasoning about it carefully. Below, we cite the relevant sections as we go.</p><p>First, can the tensor cores observe the shared memory filled by TMA? Let's work through this step by step.</p><ol><li>The first thing that happens is memory copy operation from global memory to shared memory. This happens as part of the TMA load instruction () and is a weak memory operation (<a href=\"https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#data-movement-and-conversion-instructions-cp-async-bulk-tensor\">section 9.7.9.27.1.2</a>) performed through the async proxy (<a href=\"https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#async-proxy\">section 9.7.9.25.2</a>).</li><li>As part of the same TMA load instruction, an  operation follows immediately. This operation is  with regard to the preceding memory copy operation (<a href=\"https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#program-order-async-operations\">section 8.9.1.1</a>) and is a  operation (<a href=\"https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#data-movement-and-conversion-instructions-cp-async-bulk-tensor\">section 9.7.9.27.1.2</a>). Also, an implicit generic-async proxy fence is inserted right after completion (<a href=\"https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#async-proxy\">section 9.7.9.25.2</a>).</li><li>The  operation that precedes the tensor core matrix multiplication is, by default, an acquire operation (<a href=\"https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-mbarrier-test-wait-try-wait\">section 9.7.13.15.16</a>), and ThunderKittens uses exactly this default behavior. Thus, this establishes a causality order with the TMA load.</li><li>Finally, the  instruction executes in the same thread that issued the  instruction, preserving the causality order, and reads from shared memory through the async proxy (<a href=\"https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tcgen05-memory-consistency-model-smem-access\">section 9.7.16.6.5</a>), the same proxy used by .</li></ol><p>The verdict is that, for this specific scenario, causality order is already established between the TMA write and the tensor core read due to transitivity! No additional memory fences are needed for the shared memory read. One down, one to go.</p><p>Second, can the tensor cores observe the tensor memory filled in by ?</p><ol><li>According to <a href=\"https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tcgen05-memory-consistency-model-pipelined-instructions\">section 9.7.16.6.2</a>,  is implicitly pipelined with regard to  (we discuss this in more detail in the next section).</li><li>According to <a href=\"https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tcgen05-memory-consistency-model-canonical-sync-patterns-pipelined-same-thread\">section 9.7.16.6.4.1</a>, implicitly pipelined instructions do not require a memory ordering mechanism.</li></ol><p>Combining these two facts, we can conclude that  and , when issued by the same thread, are automatically well-ordered with respect to each other. As we will explain shortly, this is a canonical pattern for writing blockscaled GEMM kernels (and we have not found a case where issuing these instructions from different threads is beneficial). The fence that would otherwise ensure visibility of  to  (i.e.,  in the example code above) is therefore unnecessary.</p><p>This is great. Neither of the two memory fences were needed. Removing unnecessary fences like these here and there gave us roughly a 20 TFLOP/s boost across our GEMM and attention kernels.</p><h2>Tensor core/memory pipelining</h2><h3>Pipelining  with </h3><p>For our MXFP8/NVFP4 kernels, the major bottleneck was loading scale values into tensor memory.</p><p>Apologies in advance for throwing a bunch of numbers at you, but this is needed for the discussion: MXFP8 uses one scale value per 32 elements, and NVFP4 uses one per 16 elements. To fully utilize the tensor cores, Blackwell GPUs require a 128x128x32 GEMM shape per CTA for MXFP8 and 128x128x64 for NVFP4. The canonical way to pipeline  is to provide enough data for 4 consecutive MMAs without interruption; that is, 128x128x128 per CTA for MXFP8 and 128x128x256 for NVFP4. We call these 4 consecutive MMAs one MMA stage.</p><p>From these numbers, we can derive the following (we disregard scale swizzling for this post):</p><ul><li>We need  scale values per operand per MMA stage per CTA for MXFP8.</li><li>We need  scale values per operand per MMA stage per CTA for NVFP4.</li></ul><p>The problem is that blockscaled MMA needs the same scale values to be broadcasted to all 4 warps in tensor memory, and only one instruction supports this: . As its name suggests, this copies only  values per invocation (the 128 refers to bytes). This is great for MXFP8: a single  per operand is enough to feed one tensor core MMA stage.</p><p>For NVFP4, however, this means you need 4  instructions per MMA stage just to supply one operand. With both A and B, that doubles. Then, due to a subtle layout detail on the B side, the B matrix requires an additional 2x factor, bringing the total to 12  instructions per MMA stage.</p><p>That's a lot, and our original kernel design looked something like this:</p><p>In the pseudocode above,  would need to issue 12  instructions per MMA stage, and  would then have to explicitly wait for all of them to complete. With these overheads, our kernel throughput suffered badly, roughly 10% lower than that of state-of-the-art kernels.</p><p>However, after a few weeks of struggling, something caught our eyes:</p><div><img src=\"https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/static/posts/2026-02-19-tk-2/figure-3.png\" alt=\"PTX documentation excerpt\"><p><em>Figure 3: PTX documentation section 9.7.16.2.</em></p></div><p>Notice how it describes that the  instruction is implicitly pipelined with respect to . We had read the PTX documentation countless times, but only at this point did we <strong>realize that  was a typo of </strong>; the hypothetical  instruction never appears again anywhere in the document. The lack of any example showing  pipelined with  compounded the confusion, preventing us from realizing this for a surprisingly long time.</p><p>With this new knowledge, we arrived at a new design. By merging the copy and MMA work into the same thread and removing the now-unnecessary barrier waits, we recovered the missing ~500 TFLOP/s, roughly a 10% improvement for NVFP4 GEMM.</p><p>A common pattern described in many writings is to pipeline MMA with tensor memory reads. The key idea is this: tensor memory is organized as a 128x512 array, and non-blockscaled  instructions accumulate into at most 128x256 of the tensor memory at a time. So, the natural approach is to alternate between the two 128x256 slots, such that one is used by the tensor cores for accumulation, and the other is used by epilogue threads to read out the results of the previous MMA operation.</p><div><img src=\"https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/static/posts/2026-02-19-tk-2/figure-4.png\" alt=\"Tensor memory buffering with split slots\"><p><em>Figure 4: Tensor memory buffering. The 128x512 tensor memory per SM is divided into two slots: one accessed by tensor cores, the other accessed by epilogue threads simultaneously.</em></p></div><div><img src=\"https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/static/posts/2026-02-19-tk-2/figure-5.png\" alt=\"Pipeline visualization for split-slot buffering\"><p><em>Figure 5: Visualization of the resulting pipeline from the above buffering scheme.</em></p></div><p>This is theoretically sound in that there exists no “pipeline bubble” where the tensor cores sit idle waiting for the epilogue threads to finish. In practice, we found this to be the most efficient choice for small GEMM sizes (roughly below 2048x2048x2048).</p><p>For larger sizes, however, we found \"double accumulation\" pattern to work better. In this scheme, we run two MMA pipelines simultaneously, both sharing the same A tile while operating on different B tiles. This means we accumulate across the entire 128x512 tensor memory throughout, and the tensor cores wait while the epilogue threads drain it.</p><div><img src=\"https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/static/posts/2026-02-19-tk-2/figure-6.png\" alt=\"Alternative tensor memory buffering scheme\"><p><em>Figure 6: An alternative tensor memory buffering scheme. The 128x512 tensor memory per SM is divided into two slots, both accessed by either the tensor cores or the epilogue threads.</em></p></div><div><img src=\"https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/static/posts/2026-02-19-tk-2/figure-7.png\" alt=\"Pipeline visualization for double accumulation\"><p><em>Figure 7: Visualization of the resulting pipeline. Note that A x B0 and A x B1 are serialized internally at the tensor core hardware, but this is omitted from the diagram for simplicity.</em></p></div><p>This introduces a slight bubble between MMAs: the tensor cores must wait for the epilogue threads to read all 256 KB ( bytes per element) from tensor memory before starting the next operation. But the reduced memory traffic from sharing the A tile compensates for larger GEMMs, giving us an additional ~100 TFLOP/s for our BF16 GEMM kernel.</p><h2>PTX assembler behavior on SM90+ single-threaded instructions</h2><p>A common pattern in modern GPU kernels is to perform warp specialization where each warp is assigned a single role. On Hopper and Blackwell GPUs, many of these roles only require a single thread issuing instructions within the warp. For instance, a \"loader\" warp issues TMA loads, which need only one thread. The usual ThunderKittens pattern looks like this:</p><p>Here,  is an  object and  is a shared memory tile. To those unfamiliar with ThunderKittens, this code selects the first warpgroup's first warp, then lane 0 within that warp. This makes sense at the source level since TMA only needs to be issued by a single thread.</p><p>But when you inspect the SASS generated by this code, it looks like the following:</p><p>Note that this code is already guarded by <code>warpgroup::warpid() == 0 &amp;&amp; warp::laneid() == 0</code>, so only a single thread can reach it. Yet the PTX assembler has inserted a loop: it elects a thread, issues the TMA load, removes that thread from the active set, branches back to , elects another from the remaining 31, and repeats, cycling through all 32 threads in turn. In practice, however, only one thread ever executes this section of code.</p><p>Why does this happen? There are two reasons: (1) the  instruction (SASS equivalent for TMA load) cannot be issued by multiple threads of the same warp simultaneously, and (2) the PTX assembler cannot prove that this code path is reached by only a single thread, so it conservatively inserts a serialization loop.</p><p>How can we avoid this? We must use an instruction that the PTX assembler knows selects exactly one thread: the  instruction. This PTX instruction elects a single thread from the current warp. The effect is the same as , but the assembler recognizes the intent and avoids the loop.</p><p>In ThunderKittens, you can use the  function to do this. If you change the code like the following:</p><p>The generated SASS changes to:</p><p>No loops! By applying this pattern to all single-threaded instructions across our kernels, we were able to improve compute throughput by up to 10% for small-shaped GEMMs.</p><p>Here we describe a few of our failure modes, so you don't fall into the same traps :\\</p><h3>Not all SMs support all cluster sizes</h3><p><a href=\"https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-programming-guide/01-introduction/programming-model.html#thread-block-clusters\">Threadblock clusters</a> larger than 2 can improve compute throughput by enabling distributed shared memory and reducing memory controller traffic. But there was a caveat: <strong>some cluster sizes prevent the scheduler from fully utilizing all SMs</strong>.</p><p>What does this even mean? Suppose we want to implement a persistent grid kernel on a B200 GPU. The B200 has 148 SMs, so a natural pattern is to set the grid size to 148, have each threadblock consume most or all of an SM's shared memory, specify the cluster size via , and launch.</p><p>Now, this works well if you have a cluster size of 2: each SM pair forms a cluster, and you have a total of  threadblock clusters running.</p><p>But what about a cluster size of 4? We would expect groups of 4 SMs to team up, giving  clusters, right?</p><p>To test this, we can have a kernel print its cluster and block information, sleep for a noticeable duration, and return:</p><p>If you run this code, you'll see that the result is quite surprising: only 132 SMs are active at a time. The remaining 16 threadblocks are scheduled only after the first 132 exit. This was quite strange, so we decided to see how it behaves for all powers-of-2 cluster sizes:</p><table><tbody></tbody></table><p><em>Table 1. Active SMs by cluster size on B200.</em></p><p>This implies that blindly setting a cluster size greater than 2 on a persistent grid kernel produces a mysterious slowdown that can take some time to diagnose. Our hypothesis is that distributed shared memory requires internal wiring between the SMs and it was a hardware engineering decision to choose not to wire certain SMs for simpler implementation.</p><p>Does this mean Nvidia fooled us with threadblock clusters and distributed shared memory? The  attribute is certainly misleading, but no. It turns out that by not using  and instead launching kernels with , you gain the ability to specify two cluster sizes: a preferred size and a minimum size.</p><p>The scheduler first fills SMs using the preferred cluster size (e.g., 132 SMs filled with 4-clusters), then uses the minimum cluster size to fill the remainder. <strong>The kernel must be written to support both sizes</strong>. In ThunderKittens 2.0, we added the <a href=\"https://github.com/HazyResearch/ThunderKittens/blob/9df1476fe54d56fcb255aa7cf3128cc9222827f3/include/common/util.cuh#L454\"></a> utility for this purpose (it is a thin wrapper around the CUDA API, so feel free to use the API directly if you prefer).</p><h3>TCGEN05 instructions hard-limit per-SM occupancy</h3><p>Another surprising thing we found was that the moment a kernel accesses tensor memory, its <strong>maximum per-SM occupancy is hard-limited to 1</strong>. We can see this with a simple test code:</p><p>When you compile and run the above code, the output shows that  has a maximum occupancy of 1 block per SM. This is quite surprising since the kernel allocates only one quarter of the available tensor memory, and all tensor memory allocation and management instructions in PTX implicitly suggest that tensor memory is designed to be shared among multiple resident blocks. Nonetheless, it appears that increasing per-SM occupancy is not a viable optimization strategy when utilizing tensor cores in a Blackwell kernel.</p><h2>Benchmarking GPU kernels properly</h2><p>After weeks of benchmarking GEMM kernels, one thing that consistently bothered us was the seemingly unbeatable speed of CUTLASS GEMM kernels when benchmarked with their own profiler (the <a href=\"https://docs.nvidia.com/cutlass/latest/media/docs/cpp/profiler.html\">CUTLASS Profiler</a>). They were consistently 100-150 TFLOPs faster than ours. At one point, <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45458948\">we were adding the prefix  to our kernel names</a> and were half-convinced that Nvidia had private assembler optimization passes reserved for their own code.</p><p>Fortunately, there was no such thing for this case. But it did turn out that the CUTLASS Profiler, by default, rounds input values to nearest integers before passing them to the kernels. Aside from the fact that this is a questionable design choice, this heavily affects the performance. Integer-like input matrices produce less bit-flipping in the GPU's transistors, which reduces power consumption and, consequently, the likelihood of clock throttling.</p><p>This triggered us to investigate further, we realized just how many factors can influence observed TFLOPs. Every subtle benchmark design decision matters: using 2 CUDA events versus  (where  is the number of profiling iterations), how you clear L2 cache between iterations (explicit flush vs natural eviction through input groups), benchmarking from C++ versus PyTorch, what random distribution and seed you use, and so on.</p><p>In our experience, the set of design choices described above can account for up to a 10% difference in results. After a series of experiments, we settled on the following convention for benchmarking our kernels and reporting performance numbers publicly:</p><ul><li>Use bitwise identical random inputs (usually from uniform distribution; range depends on the precision being used).</li><li>If the total input size is less than 3x the L2 cache size (e.g., 128 MB on B200), use multiple input groups. This way, each group's data naturally evicts the previous group's residency in L2, simulating cold-cache conditions. <em>We found that explicit cache flushing meaningfully slows down the measured time even with proper CUDA event usage</em>.</li><li>Run 500 warmup iterations before profiling, to reach a power-steady state.</li><li>Run 100 profiling iterations, with the kernels launched back-to-back without intermediate synchronization.</li><li>Measure time using 2 CUDA events recorded immediately before and after all of the profiling iterations.</li><li>Give GPUs short idle period between benchmarking two kernels, to allow thermal cooldown.</li></ul><p>We encourage adopting and/or improving this convention. The pseudocode below illustrates the approach. Note that even though this code is in CUDA C++, it's also fully possible to do exactly the same in PyTorch through the  API:</p><p>We're happy to say that ThunderKittens is now fully optimized for Blackwell and can still produce state-of-the-art kernels with significantly fewer lines of code than other CUDA DSLs. We're also happy to see TK 2.0 already being adopted by the industry! For instance, it powers training kernels for <a href=\"https://cursor.com/home\">Cursor</a>'s Composer and inference kernels for <a href=\"https://www.together.ai/\">Together AI</a>.</p><p>Yet there is a variety of wild optimizations that could push these kernels even further. Most importantly, modern GPUs are composed of multiple chiplets, each with its own partition of L2 cache and HBM. The Nvidia B200, for instance, is two chiplets stitched together by a 10 TB/s chip-to-chip interconnect, significantly lower throughput than the L2 itself (roughly 21 TB/s by our measurement). This creates an unavoidable NUMA effect: memory throughput is limited by the interconnect bandwidth even on an L2 hit. If we can get this right, whether through kernel design or model architecture, there's a good chunk of speedup on the table.</p><p>And we're not done with <a href=\"https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2025-09-28-tp-llama-main\">Megakernels</a> yet! We've shown that Megakernels deliver significant speedups over state-of-the-art inference engines, even in compute-bound, GPU-friendly workloads like prefill. The remaining question is how to make them . Rather than another DSL or standalone compiler, we believe what's needed is a fundamental change in ML infrastructure. PyTorch is a great frontend for representing compute graphs, and we're extremely grateful for its existence; but its 10+-year-old backend architecture may not be the best fit for extracting every last TFLOP from modern GPUs. We'll see!</p><p>As always, if you'd like to learn more or contribute, feel free to reach out to Stuart at <a href=\"mailto:ssul@cs.stanford.edu\">ssul@cs.stanford.edu</a> :)</p><p>We are grateful to <a href=\"https://cursor.com/home\">Cursor</a> for generously providing the GPUs for this work.

If that name rings a bell, it’s probably because China-based ByteDance is the company behind TikTok. The release of version 2.0 of Seedance was <a href=\"https://seed.bytedance.com/en/blog/seed-2-0-official-launch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">launched on February 14</a> and has already caused a splash on the internet, with users and analysts alike shocked by its incredibly realistic results.</p><p>The original Seedance was released in June 2025, but version two is getting all the attention – good and bad. A post depicting an AI-generated movie scene of Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise in a fist fight was widely shared online and showed what the technology can do. Rhett Reese, writer/producer of Deadpool 1 &amp; 2, reacting with <a href=\"https://x.com/RhettReese/status/2021446414337966098\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">“I hate to say it. It’s likely over for us”</a>.</p><h2>Seedance 2.0 versus Hollywood</h2><p>Reese <a href=\"https://x.com/RhettReese/status/2021772885669687787\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">later indicated</a> that while his writing and producing roles may not be in danger, the movie industry will never be the same. Seedance 2.0 has caught the attention of wider Hollywood; The Motion Picture Association (MPA) noted <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cjd9nllng22o\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">to the BBC</a> that “In a single day, the Chinese AI service Seedance 2.0 has engaged in unauthorized use of US copyrighted works on a massive scale”.</p><p>It’s obvious AI has plenty of controversial uses, and it’s certainly a legal issue when it comes to dealing with existing intellectual property. The MPA represents some of the biggest US studios, from Netflix and Amazon Prime Video to Walt Disney Studios and Sony Pictures. Speaking of, Sony <a href=\"https://variety.com/2026/film/news/sony-seedance-protest-1236666951/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">is the latest company</a> to join a studio protest and send a cease and desist letter to ByteDance.</p><p>In response to challenges from Hollywood, ByteDance communicated to the BBC that it “respects intellectual property rights and we have heard the concerns regarding Seedance 2.0,” announcing “steps to strengthen current safeguards”. This includes measures to prevent users from unauthorised use of intellectual property and likeness. It’s not yet clear how these measures will be put in place, and ByteDance failed to give away any specifics.</p><p>As you can see from the viral video above, Seedance 2.0 has able to construct the scene, including video and audio generation, with “a 2-line prompt”. The comments are filled with similar examples. Someone <a href=\"https://x.com/ShaunORourke75/status/2021448836720537744\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">even pointed out</a> the fact that some punches fail to land and stop short. This is obviously the case with real movie production, suggesting the AI model may have already been trained on similar footage, which may or may not be copyrighted material in its own right.</p><p>Speaking <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckg1dl410q9o\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">with the BBC</a>, Shaanan Choney, a computing researcher at the University of Melbourne, suspects it’s likely ByteDance was aware of the dangers of releasing such a model, but did it anyway as a strategic play “to flout the rules for a while and get marketing clout”. The company has certainly achieved the latter, and Seedance has become difficult to ignore for smaller production companies looking to achieve more spectacular visuals for a fraction of the cost. Choney notes it’s another success in a world of China-based AI development – you may remember <a href=\"https://www.pcguide.com/ai/faq/what-is-deepseek/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">DeepSeek</a>, and more recently, some <a href=\"https://www.pcguide.com/news/ai-powered-kung-fu-robots-are-a-extravagant-reminder-of-where-china-is-ahead-of-the-us-in-the-ai-race/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">AI-powered kung fu robots</a>.</p><blockquote><p>“It signals that Chinese models are at the very least matching at the frontier of what is available,” Cohney says. “If ByteDance can produce this seemingly out of nowhere, what other kinds of models do Chinese companies have in store?”</p><cite>Shaanan Choney, Computing Researcher, University of Melbourne</cite></blockquote><p>It’s clear Hollywood is trying to push against the use of generative AI in this way, at least when it means getting lawyers involved. </p><p>On the contrary, large production companies are not shying away from the use of AI in general. A landmark deal between OpenAI and The Walt Disney Company at the end of last year allows <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/disney-sora-agreement/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">“beloved characters”</a> from across Disney’s wide range of IPs to be generated in Sora, OpenAI’s very own video and audio generation model. Sora is also in its second generation (Sora 2) and <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/sora-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">was launched in September 2025</a>.</p><div><div><img src=\"https://www.pcguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/jack-goodall-pc-guide-96x96.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div>",

      "content": "<p>Amazon’s cloud storage unit AWS reportedly suffered at least two outages in December due to “errors involving its own employees.” And as I read this report from <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/00c282de-ed14-4acd-a948-bc8d6bdb339d\" target=\"_blank\" data-url=\"https://www.ft.com/content/00c282de-ed14-4acd-a948-bc8d6bdb339d\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer-when-downgrade\" data-hl-processed=\"none\" data-mrf-recirculation=\"inline-link\">Financial Times</a>, I couldn’t help but think that somewhere, the writers of “Silicon Valley” were nodding knowingly.</p><p>From the Kiro AI coding tool’s decision that the best course of action was to “delete and recreate” the system environment to Amazon’s response that it was “user error, not AI error,” this whole scenario feels eerily familiar to anyone who spent five seasons watching Richard Hendricks (played by Thomas Middleditch) sweat through a hoodie when talking about Pied Piper.</p><p>It’s worth noting that this is not related to the <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/computing/internet/the-usd2-5-billion-question-how-many-more-aws-outages-until-the-internet-builds-a-real-backup-plan\" data-url=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/computing/internet/the-usd2-5-billion-question-how-many-more-aws-outages-until-the-internet-builds-a-real-backup-plan\" data-hl-processed=\"none\" data-mrf-recirculation=\"inline-link\" data-before-rewrite-localise=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/computing/internet/the-usd2-5-billion-question-how-many-more-aws-outages-until-the-internet-builds-a-real-backup-plan\">huge AWS outage</a> half the internet experienced back in October. A spokesperson confirmed this was an “extremely limited event” that affected one of two regions in mainland China, and the second outage did not impact the “customer facing AWS service.” Following these, Amazon has “implemented numerous safeguards” to ensure this doesn’t happen again.</p><p aria-hidden=\"true\">But if the FT report is true, AWS has possibly built its own black box. The company seems to have built a tool so efficient that it realized the easiest way to manage a system is to ensure the system no longer exists.</p><p>Without spoiling too much of the show here (given the tech industry nowadays, I pray it comes back), there’s a plot thread running throughout the show where one of the characters, Gilfoyle (Martin Starr), built an AI bot named Son of Anton, which gained a will of its own and started optimizing itself.</p><p>From that point, agentic AI hilarity ensues — you can see a lot of this happening for real in today’s world. Watching <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/ai/openclaw-is-the-viral-ai-assistant-that-lives-on-your-device-what-you-need-to-know\" data-url=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/ai/openclaw-is-the-viral-ai-assistant-that-lives-on-your-device-what-you-need-to-know\" data-hl-processed=\"none\" data-mrf-recirculation=\"inline-link\" data-before-rewrite-localise=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/ai/openclaw-is-the-viral-ai-assistant-that-lives-on-your-device-what-you-need-to-know\">OpenClaw</a> being able to respond to a user’s messages on their behalf reminds me of the infinite AI messaging loop Dinesh (Kumail Nanjiani) and Gilfoyle find themselves in, for example.</p><p>Anyway, Son of Anton eventually grows to become a black box that starts making executive decisions without human input. Hendricks and his team lose control because the AI gave them exactly what they asked for (a fix), but in the most destructive way possible.</p><p>Much like Anton, while these tools can actually stuff, they can often lack the common sense to know that what they’re about to do could be massively damaging. It just sees an objectively right path. Kiro was tasked with fixing a minor bug in AWS Cost Explorer. Instead, it autonomously decided the best course of action was to <strong>delete the entire environment. </strong></p><p>As Gilfoyle said when he gives his AI permission to overwrite code: \"The most efficient way to get rid of all the bugs was to get rid of all the software, which is technically and statistically correct.\"</p><p>The corporate ego and antagonist of the piece, Hooli CEO Gavin Belson (played by Matt Ross), is easily one of the funniest characters on the show. A pitch-perfect satire of the typical tech leader. His signature move was one you see a lot in the show: standing in front of a giant screen and explaining why problems or failures were actually features of “pre-greatness.”</p><p>There’s a big contrast between what Amazon employees are saying and AWS’s corporate stance. On one side, employees say that this <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/amazon-workers-push-back-as-over-1000-sign-letter-warning-against-warp-speed-ai-rollout-10393036\" target=\"_blank\" data-url=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/amazon-workers-push-back-as-over-1000-sign-letter-warning-against-warp-speed-ai-rollout-10393036\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer-when-downgrade\" data-hl-processed=\"none\" data-mrf-recirculation=\"inline-link\">“warp-speed approach to AI development will do staggering damage,”</a> and a senior AWS employee told FT that “engineers let the AI [agent] resolve an issue without intervention. The outages were small but entirely foreseeable.”</p><p>Then you have Amazon’s defense, which calls AI tools being involved a “coincidence,” that it was “user access control issue, not an AI autonomy issue,” and that mistakes are not more common with AI tools.</p><p>Oh, and the whole “same issue could occur with any developer tool or manual action” bit? The agent decided it was a good idea to delete the entire production environment — if they have human developers who think it’s a good idea, too, I’d start looking for new developers.</p><p>To my eyes, after rewatching a couple of crucial episodes, this is peak Hooli. By blaming user permissions, it’s kind of like saying Kiro AI is a Ferrari; we just hired a driver who didn’t know how to use the brakes. Protecting the AI future by sacrificing the reputation of the human present.</p><h2>‘Silicon Valley’ ages like fine wine</h2><figure data-bordeaux-image-check=\"\"><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\"></figcaption></figure><p>When the show aired its finale in 2019, I thought we were closing the book on the era of tech-bro satire. But if the reporting on AWS’s “Kiro” incident is true, it proves that we’ve just entered the spin-off.</p><p>The parallels are too perfect to ignore. On one side, we have whistleblowers and employees describing a “warp-speed” rollout of agentic AI that acts with the terrifying, logical purity of Son of Anton — a tool so focused on “solving” a problem that the entire existing environment is an obstacle to be deleted.</p><p>On the other side, there’s a corporate statement protecting AI perfection so hard that it borders on performance art. Blaming the engineer for the bot’s autonomy is like blaming a person for a gun going off after the safety was intentionally removed.</p><p>Somewhere, the show’s creator, Mike Judge, must be watching the news, probably realizing he didn’t write a comedy — he wrote a documentary and just forgot to tell us.</p><a href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJ2YlhObmRXbGtaUzVqYjIwb0FBUAE\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-url=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJ2YlhObmRXbGtaUzVqYjIwb0FBUAE\" target=\"_blank\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer-when-downgrade\" data-hl-processed=\"none\"><figure data-bordeaux-image-check=\"\"></figure></a>",

The 34-54 point F1 gap replicates across Claude Opus, ChatGPT 5.2, and Gemini 3 Thinking.</p><p>I ran a simple experiment: generate fifteen 15×15 binary grids at varying density, render each as both text symbols and filled squares, and ask frontier VLMs to transcribe them. The text symbols are images, not tokenized text; they go through the same visual encoder as the squares. Yet the performance gap is massive.</p><p>What's interesting is that each model fails differently on the squares condition. Claude systematically under-counts filled cells, ChatGPT massively over-counts, and Gemini tiles identical L-shaped templates regardless of input. But all three share the same underlying deficit: severely degraded spatial localization without textual anchors.</p><p>Gemini showed a surprising result: it actually had the strongest visual pathway at low density (68% F1 on sparse grids vs 30% for Claude), but collapsed completely above 32% density with structured hallucinations. This aligns with Google's heavier investment in visual AI. There seems to be a tradeoff between visual-pathway capacity and text-pathway robustness across model families.</p><p>The implication is that current VLMs have a strong implicit OCR pipeline but lack an equivalent mechanism for non-textual spatial features. This matters for any application where users upload charts, spreadsheets, diagrams, or any structural-based content.</p><p>I'm curious what this community thinks: could introducing discrete visual tokens, a \"visual alphabet\" for common spatial patterns, bridge the gap cheaply, rather than trying to improve visual encoders?</p>",

I think the most interesting features for you guys would be built-in SSH manager as well as Kubernetes port-forwarding. It basically means that you don’t need to open multiple connections to different clusters/ns/pods manually. Resterm will manage everything for you. You just define your target either in global scope and use it on each request, or request scoped with different configurations. Everything is managed within the Resterm itself. I often develop new features based on my own needs so Kubernetes port-forwarding is one of those features. I’m pretty sure it’s quite specific and _not so many_ people will ever use it, but I thought that some of you might, that’s why I’m sharing this project here. </p><p>Ping me if there is anything you would change/add or if you encounter any bugs.</p>",

      "content": "<div><p>For the first time,  has dethroned  as the company with the largest annual revenue. </p><p>Walmart on Thursday reported annual revenue of $713.2 billion for its most recent fiscal year, shy of Amazon's $716.9 billion in revenue. The milestone was brewing for months, as Amazon <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/20/amazon-surpasses-walmart-in-revenue-for-first-time-.html\">leapfrogged Walmart in quarterly sales</a> for the first time about a year ago.</p><p>The shuffle, while largely symbolic, underscores the battle the two retailers have waged both to define and keep up with ever-changing consumer preferences. They are kicking off a new chapter of that rivalry as artificial intelligence reshapes how companies operate, make money and drive sales. </p><p>Amazon rose to the top of the revenue pile by doing much more than running a sprawling online web store and promising speedy delivery. While its core retail unit is its largest revenue generator, its huge cloud computing, advertising and seller services businesses also fuel its sales. Third-party seller services, which include commissions and fees collected by Amazon fulfillment along with shipping, advertising and customer support, accounted for about 24% of the company's total sales in 2025, according to its latest annual filing. Amazon Web Services was responsible for roughly 18%.</p><p>It wasn't Walmart's weakness that led it to lose its top spot, as its revenue has more than doubled in 20 years. The retailer has leaned on its more than 4,600 Walmart stores and roughly 600 Sam's Club locations in the U.S. to power its digital business, which grew by 27% in the U.S. in the fiscal fourth quarter and has posted double-digit percentage gains for 15 straight quarters.</p><p>That expansion came as Walmart riffed off the Amazon playbook and tried to position itself as a tech company as well as a retailer. </p><p>There have been multiple signs of its ambitions: Walmart relisted its stock, moving from the New York Stock Exchange <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/20/walmart-wmt-q3-2026-earnings.html\">to the tech-heavy Nasdaq</a> in early December. Its market value <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/03/walmart-wmt-hits-1-trillion-market-cap.html\">surpassed the $1 trillion mark</a> earlier this month, a valuation achieved almost exclusively by tech companies, including Amazon, after a more than 21% rise in the last year. </p><p>And the <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/19/walmart-wmt-q4-2026-earnings.html\">big-box retailer's fourth-quarter earnings</a>, which were boosted by digital advertising and its third-party marketplace, illustrated Walmart's emphasis on chasing higher-margin businesses and thinking beyond brick-and-mortar retail.</p></div><h2>Amazon and Walmart's AI ambitions</h2><div><p>In many ways, Walmart's recent push to grow its third-party marketplace was an answer to the dominance of Amazon's platform. Even as it tries to catch up with Amazon in some areas, Walmart is trying to gain an edge in a new frontier.</p><p>Over the past few years, Amazon and Walmart have used different AI strategies to try to make their businesses more efficient and make their merchandise more appealing to shoppers.</p><p>Walmart struck a deal <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/14/walmart-openai-chatgpt-shopping.html\">with OpenAI's ChatGPT in October</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/11/walmart-partners-with-google-gemini-on-shopping-tool.html\">Google's Gemini in January</a> to make its products easier to discover and buy. It also has its own AI-powered shopping assistant, Sparky. The virtual assistant, which looks like a smiley face, pops up on Walmart's app and can help shoppers find items. </p><p>Walmart, like many other companies, is in the early days of AI adoption, and it's unclear how the technology will affect its business long-term. </p><p>On the company's earnings call on Thursday, Walmart CEO John Furner said customers are spending more when they use Sparky. He said customers who use Sparky have an average order value that's about 35% higher than shoppers who don't use the tool.</p><p>About half of Walmart's app users have used Sparky, Walmart U.S. CEO David Guggina said on the earnings call.</p><p>\"Agentic AI is increasingly embedded across Walmart,\" Guggina said. \"It's strengthening our operations. It's improving associate productivity, and it's enhancing the customer experience.\"</p><p>Walmart Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said AI investments are included in the retailer's capital expenditure plans for the full year, which are expected to be roughly 3.5% of sales. Those expenses also include the company's investments in automation and store remodels. </p><p>There are limits to Walmart's tech ambitions.When it comes to AI, Rainey said Walmart will lean on the expertise of tech companies rather than try to create its own products.</p><p>\"As you've seen from the announcements we've made, we're approaching AI development through partnerships,\" he said on the company's earnings call. \"This lets tech companies do what they do best, develop innovative technology, and it provides us clarity to do what we do best, to translate the best of tech to retail experiences that create value for our customers and members and our enterprise.\"</p><p>Like Walmart, Amazon is also facing new pressure to respond to the rise of agentic commerce. Chatbot makers like OpenAI,  and Perplexity have introduced automated commerce features that aim to change how people shop online. </p><p>While other companies like Walmart,  and  have announced shopping partnerships with AI platforms, Amazon has <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/24/amazon-faces-a-dilemma-fight-ai-shopping-agents-or-join-them.html\">remained on the sidelines</a>. It's blocked agents from accessing its site and has doubled down on its own shopping chatbot, Rufus, which is powered by its own models and Anthropic's chatbot Claude.</p><p>The company <a href=\"https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2026/Amazon-com-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-Results/\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> Rufus has been used by more than 300 million customers and drove almost $12 billion in incremental annualized sales last year. After slowly rolling out the service in beta two years ago, Amazon has injected Rufus across more areas of its app and website to encourage shoppers to use the tool.</p><p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAWpCZIXxyY\" target=\"_blank\">said last month</a> that Rufus and other AI tools could assist shoppers with finding products much like an employee in a physical store.</p><p>\"I think agents are going to help customers with that type of discovery,\" Jassy said. \"And it's part of why we've invested so much in Rufus, which is our shopping assistant.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, Amazon is throwing piles of cash at AI infrastructure. Earlier this month, it announced it would spend up to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/05/amazon-amzn-q4-earnings-report-2025.html\">$200 billion</a> this year on AI initiatives, more than any of the other hyperscalers, which combined have forecast <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/06/google-microsoft-meta-amazon-ai-cash.html\">nearly $700 billion</a> in 2026 expenditures. Most of Amazon's spending is expected to go to data centers, chips and networking equipment.</p><p>Wall Street has viewed Amazon's capex plans skeptically, sending the company's shares down for <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/17/amazon-stock-losing-streak.html\">nine days straight</a> following its Feb. 5 earnings report and shaving more than $450 billion off of its market value.</p><p>Amazon's investments aren't limited to AI compute. The company has also put significant resources and talent behind developing AI tools across all of its businesses. It has alsorolled out a suite of AI models and revamped its Alexa assistant. It also has invested $8 billion in Anthropic since 2023.</p><p><em>— CNBC's Robert Hum contributed to this report</em></p></div>",

If you're not eligible or interested in participating in GSoC, then most of this post likely isn't relevant to you; if you are, this should contain some useful information and links.</p><p>Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is an annual global program organized by Google that aims to bring new contributors to the world of open-source. The program pairs organizations (such as the Rust Project) with contributors (usually students), with the goal of helping the participants make meaningful open-source contributions under the guidance of experienced mentors.</p><p>The organizations that have been accepted into the program have been <a href=\"https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2026/organizations\">announced</a> by Google. The GSoC applicants now have several weeks to discuss project ideas with mentors. Later, they will send project proposals for the projects that they found the most interesting. If their project proposal is accepted, they will embark on a several months long journey during which they will try to complete their proposed project under the guidance of an assigned mentor.</p><p>We have prepared a <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/google-summer-of-code\">list of project ideas</a> that can serve as inspiration for potential GSoC contributors that would like to send a project proposal to the Rust organization. However, applicants can also come up with their own project ideas. You can discuss project ideas or try to find mentors in the <a href=\"https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/421156-gsoc\">#gsoc</a> Zulip stream. We have also prepared a <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/google-summer-of-code/blob/main/gsoc/proposal-guide.md\">proposal guide</a> that should help you with preparing your project proposals. We would also like to bring your attention to our <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/google-summer-of-code/tree/main/gsoc\">GSoC AI policy</a>.</p><p>You can start discussing the project ideas with Rust Project mentors and maintainers immediately, but you might want to keep the following important dates in mind:</p><ul><li>The project proposal application period starts on March 16, 2026. From that date you can submit project proposals into the GSoC dashboard.</li><li>The project proposal application period ends on  at 18:00 UTC. Take note of that deadline, as there will be no extensions!</li></ul><p>If you are interested in contributing to the Rust Project, we encourage you to check out our project idea list and send us a GSoC project proposal! Of course, you are also free to discuss these projects and/or try to move them forward even if you do not intend to (or cannot) participate in GSoC. We welcome all contributors to Rust, as there is always enough work to do.</p><p>Our GSoC contributors were quite successful in the past two years (<a href=\"https://blog.rust-lang.org/2024/11/07/gsoc-2024-results.html\">2024</a>, <a href=\"https://blog.rust-lang.org/2025/11/18/gsoc-2025-results\">2025</a>), so we are excited what this year's GSoC will bring! We hope that participants in the program can improve their skills, but also would love for this to bring new contributors to the Project and increase the awareness of Rust in general. Like last year, we expect to publish blog posts in the future with updates about our participation in the program.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I was reading a <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47077036&amp;ref=blog.kinglycrow.com\">thread on HN</a> and I started writing this super long comment and rewriting and editing and thought, hey, if I'm doing this I clearly care enough about the state of Show HN and HN in general to write a post on it. I've written code since I was 11. I've worked on larger distributed systems, web apps, databases, search and more. I have many opinions on the transformation of our profession that is currently underway. Most of all, there is now an illusion of a lower barrier to entry. There is a magic quadrant made up of taste and skill. And too many people over estimate their taste[0] and their skill (or never care in the first place).<p>LLMs have people everywhere super excited they can finally build their dream applications! The only problem is, no one needs their dream application. We see it everyday now, someone posts some obvious vibe coded app which is poorly crafted and clearly derivative of an idea so thoroughly saturated it's literally leaking. This is the lowest part of the quadrant. No skill and no taste. The overall suffusion of this into the broader scene rightly has the more sensitive of us up in arms. It's noise, it's spam, it's a perversion of the years of skill we've spent accruing. </p></p><p>The only problem there is you might have skill, but do you have taste? This problem itself isn't new. HN of all places has always been a matter of taste. Things people found interesting made it to the front page, things they did not languished. You could build the most finely abstracted todo app of all time and your app would be dead on arrival. However, if you built something that resonated with a large enough group of people it never mattered how well built the app was or how technically complex.</p><p>I've seen plenty of content on HN that could not have been more than a simple crud app that rocketed to the front page. What comes to mind immediately was a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Website_Will_Self-destruct?ref=blog.kinglycrow.com\">little app</a> that died if someone hadn't posted a message on it in 24 hours. Inherently simple, but quite popular. It was pure taste.</p><p>Taste and skill are related, the more saturated something is the higher skill you need to cross the taste threshold to make people care. It's not that there will never be another interesting todo app, it's that it has to be so tasteful as to cross our maximal standards and pre-existing expectations of them.<p>LLMs have exposed this more thoroughly than any other time in tech so far. The sin isn't that someone uses an LLM to generate an application[1], vibe[2] or not. The sin is they lacked enough skill and enough taste to cross the actual threshold the rest of us need to see for the work to not be slop. </p></p><p>An obvious and recent example of this is OpenClaw. It is a bit of a software nightmare (sorry Peter, I know you're good), but it's highly tasteful even being pretty vibey. People ate it up immediately and because there was such an interest the lack of technical soundness and security was overlooked (or begrudgingly put up with)</p><p><p>The lack of taste only presents a problem now, because it's so much easier for people who thought they have more taste than they actually do to post every little idea they have. This is a real problem and I think it will taper off because people will learn proper etiquette or face disappointment. It's a massive educational period for a lot of people that we've all had years to internalize.</p></p><p><p>It has the same stink of crypto on it right now that anyone can get rich. Most of them won't. This is the illusion of the lower barrier of entry, the barrier has always been taste and LLMs do nothing to remove this barrier. They amplify it.</p></p><p><p>Anyway this is all to say whether you have skill or not, you better learn to be tasteful before you decide to slop all over everyone.</p></p><p><p>[0] Taste is totally dependent on the group you're building for, discerning whether you have good taste and to whom is totally a process where you do have to put things out to people, but the bar has not now and not in my years ever been on the floor so I assert there's a minimal universal taste we all have and you should at least clear that before putting things out there.</p></p><p>[1] I've been writing code for 20 years, I am super experienced in my domains and I review and sand off the edges, make changes myself etc. I vibe code almost 0% of the time.</p><p>[2] Vibing means you need to have exceptional taste to cross the bar. I don't care if you do it, but you need to own the outcome.</p>",

      "content": "<p><strong>I maintain the open-source SC0710 Linux driver — the community project that brings Elgato 4K60 Pro MK.2 support to modern kernels. While working on that project I found something that needs to be out in the open.</strong></p><p>Yuan High-Tech, the ODM manufacturer behind the Elgato 4K60 Pro MK.2, distributes a compiled Linux kernel module called LXV4L2D_SC0710.ko. When you run modinfo on it, the first thing it tells you is license: GPL. That's not a choice they made — they had to declare GPL to access kernel symbols via EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(). The module literally cannot load on a modern kernel without that declaration. Fine. Except GPLv2 Section 3 means that the second you distribute a GPL binary, you're legally obligated to provide the source code to anyone who asks.</p><p>So I asked. On January 25, 2026 I emailed Yuan requesting the source for Build V1432 (compiled January 7, 2026). Their response? They wanted photos of my hardware and asked where I was from. When I pointed out that neither of those things have anything to do with GPL compliance, they stopped responding. I then escalated to Corsair's legal team — Yuan's North American distributor — outlining their shared liability. Complete silence.</p><p>Now here's where it gets more interesting. The full alias table from modinfo shows the driver doesn't just support Yuan's SC0710 chip (12AB:0710) — it also aliases 13 Techwell/Intersil device IDs (1797:5864, 1797:6801 through 1797:6817). Those exact chip IDs have had open-source GPL drivers in the mainline Linux kernel since 2016 (tw5864, tw686x, tw68). Whether Yuan derived their driver from those mainline drivers or from Intersil's own SDK is something that requires binary analysis — but either way the closed-source distribution is indefensible, and the SFC now has the binary to investigate.</p><p>This also isn't just a streamer problem. This exact driver is being shipped in:</p><p>- 7StarLake AV710-X4 and NV200-2LGS16 — MIL-STD-810H certified military computers used in defense and intelligent automation</p><p>- JMC Systems SC710N4 — industrial HDMI 2.0 capture cards sold with explicit Linux support</p><p>Defense contractors are deploying undisclosed, closed-source kernel modules on production hardware. That's the actual scope of this.</p><p>Update: I submitted a formal compliance report to the Software Freedom Conservancy. They have already requested the binary and I've provided it. This is now an active enforcement process, not just a Reddit post.</p><p>For anyone saying the 4K60 Pro MK.2 being EOL changes anything — Yuan compiled Build V1432 on January 7, 2026, eight months after EOL. They're still distributing it. And GPLv2's 3-year written offer clause requires the offer to have been made at the time of distribution — Yuan never made one at all, not in 2022, not now.</p><p><em>Disclaimer: I used AI to help with formatting and writing clarity. The research, technical findings, and evidence are entirely my own work.</em></p>",

Unfortunately, at large the Intel Panther Lake performance is moving in the wrong direction with the early Linux 7.0 benchmarking.</p><p>I was eager to begin Linux 7.0 kernel testing to look out for any CPU or iGPU performance improvements with the <a href=\"https://www.phoronix.com/review/intel-core-ultra-x7-358h-linux\">Core Ultra X7 358H</a> and its <a href=\"https://www.phoronix.com/review/intel-arc-b390-panther-lake-linux\">Arc B390 Graphics</a>. Especially with the Intel Xe driver continuing to mature for the new Xe3 graphics I was hopeful of seeing some improvements for the exciting B390 graphics but overall the performance was regressing over Linux 6.19 stable.</p><p>Using the same MSI Prestige 14 Panther Lake laptop (in its \"performance\" platform profile consistently as recommended by Intel) with the Core Ultra X7 358H and 32GB of LPDDR5-8533 memory, I ran benchmarks on Linux 6.19 stable and Linux 7.0 Git as of 16 February. The same compiler toolchain on that laptop and the same basic kernel configuration (all new Kconfig additions in v7.0 at their default values). No other software changes were made to this laptop besides swapping out the kernel and repeating the benchmark in the otherwise same hardware/software environment.</p><p>Here's what I am seeing so far out of Linux 7.0 on Intel Panther Lake. Benchmarks on other systems are running at the moment to see if these are Panther Lake specific issues or early Linux 7.0 performance regressions at large, so stay tuned for more of these Linux 7.0 performance benchmarks in the coming days and with the merge window wrapping up on Sunday.</p>",

data structure that you wanted to create.</p><p>After high-school, I have enrolled in a two-year college program that would earn me a Practical Software Engineering Degree.\nDuring the summer break between the first and the seconds years, I had a choice to make: go work in McDonald’s (I had experience working as a waiter during high school summer breaks), or find a job in software engineering.\nAfter 2 seconds of hesitation, I have crafted a CV and started to send it to every position I saw online.\nAnd despite the fact that I really wanted to get a software development position in C or C++, nobody would hire me.\nEventually, I have secured a web-development position in PHP (thank you very much my first employer for giving me a chance).</p><p>And this would be the last time I’d touch C or C++.\nDynamic, high-level languages such as PHP, Python, and Ruby — are more suited to the dynamic nature of web development.\nYou rarely need to squeeze the maximum performance from your hardware, since for every second you gain by optimizing data structures allocations in C, you lose 10x more waiting for network or disk requests to resolve.\nAnd so, collectively, we all agreed that the web is better to be written in dynamic languages.</p><p>But just like your first true-love, C would hunt me.\nI would obsess about micro-optimizations, and would get mad that I can’t control when variables are allocated, and how to pass things by reference or pointer without making a redundant copy.\nAnd then, Rust became a thing.</p><p>Just like every software engineer, I started learning Rust by building my own game engine.\nDo you even call yourself a software engineer if you never tried to build your own game engine?\nAnd I fell in-love with Rust.\nC was aging, and failed to catch up with the moving world of hipster development: modern tooling, linters, formatters, package management.\nRust offered the best of both worlds: low-level control of memory allocation, and variable life-cycle, while having modern development practices: a simple-to-use compiler, built-in linter and formatter, and of course a modern package management tool and repository.</p><p>The community was loving Rust, and the language was growing very fast.\nAnd for the first time you could write a web application using a low-level systems-programming language. \nAfter picking up the basics of the language, and abandoning my game engine, I have decided to build a web application in Rust.\nAnd, in the end of 2023, <a href=\"https://yieldcode.blog/post/building-a-webapp-in-rust/\">I have succeeded</a>.\nI have built, and shipped a fully operational web application that was making me money, in Rust.</p><p>Throughout the years, I learned from my mistakes, and shared my progress <a href=\"https://yieldcode.blog/post/webapp-localization-in-rust/\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://yieldcode.blog/post/serving-astro-with-rust/\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://yieldcode.blog/post/one-year-of-rust-in-production/\">and here</a>.\nEventually, the application became a Frankensteins’ monster were the backend would be pure Rust, while the frontend was a statically generated Astro website.\nUntil, in the end, I have reached a road-block and could no longer maintain or extend the application.</p><p>I took a painful decision to migrate everything to Node.js, and conclude this experiment with Rust.\nIt was hard for me to make this decision.\nI really loved working with Rust, and I wanted to make it work.\nMy work with Rust earned me valuable human connections, and opportunities to present my knowledge at two conferences, and one meetup.\nI am happy that I have took the risk with Rust, but…</p><h2>Farewell Rust, at least for now…</h2><p>I’m not going to go over the positive sides of Rust, since I covered them in other articles such as <a href=\"https://yieldcode.blog/post/building-a-webapp-in-rust/\">Building a web app in Rust</a> and <a href=\"https://yieldcode.blog/post/one-year-of-rust-in-production/\">One year of Rust in production</a>.\nBut I do want to talk about some of the struggles I had, both as a reminder to my future self (you can take C from me, but you can’t take my love to low-level programming), and as a cautionary tale to everyone else.</p><p>Keep in mind that everything I share is based on my perspective: I’m a solo founder, building and running a web application.\nThere is no heavy workload like video processing, nor a need to have low latency — two things at which Rust excels.\nFrom my experience, and my product, the bottleneck is always the database, disk, or network.\nI’m also, somewhat, experienced in Rust, so I’m not the “<em>I tried to build a web app in Rust, but I don’t understand borrow checker, so Rust bad</em>” kind of guy.\nNow, with that out of the way, let’s begin.</p><p>As I mentioned earlier, from pure Rust + server side generated templates with , I have switched to a Rust API server + Astro static website that calls the API.\nThe reason I moved away from rendering HTML in Rust, is the fact that I am too spoiled with type-safe templates.\nWith Astro, I can use the  components that are type-safe.\nSince I use, and advocate for, Typescript, all my templates are type-safe, and there is very little chance to mistype a variable, or miss it.\nIf you have a component like this, it’s very hard to make it compile with the wrong type (unless you do stupid stuff like ):</p><pre tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"tsx\"><code></code></pre><p>With libraries like , , or  — your view is essentially separated from the props, and if you rename a field in the template, you must remember to rename it in the model as well.\nIt’s possible to solve it with tests at the cost of longer CI/CD pipeline, but I will talk about compilation time a bit later.\nFunctions inside templates are basically wild-west of strings.\nAnd you need functions.\nIt’s hard to make rich templates without functions.</p><p>But there are libraries like  or  — I hear you say.\nAnd I agree, there are.\nThese are essentially type-safe HTML templates that use the macro mechanism from Rust.\nBy building, basically, HTML DSL using Rust macro, you can create compile time, type-safe templates.\nBut then again, compilation is expensive, but more on that later.</p><h3>Localization and Internationalization</h3><p>I have been talking about localization <a href=\"https://yieldcode.blog/post/a-different-approach-for-localizing-react-js-app/\">back in 2015</a>.\nNode.js ships with full  support, and a set of  APIs to format numbers, lists, currencies, country names, you name it.\nOn top of that, with libraries like , one can get type-safe auto-complete for translations, something that I was not able to achieve in Rust.\nYes, Rust has support for  translation files developed by Mozilla, and a minimal support for number formatting.\nBut Node.js has everything you need in order to build and ship fully localized and translated web-applications.\nIt’s a know fact that  is lacking in Rust (see: <a href=\"https://www.arewewebyet.org/topics/i18n/\">AWWY: Internationalization</a>), and bindings for  are in progress, but they are nowhere near what Node.js can offer it that regard.</p><h3>The web is dynamic by nature</h3><p>Take it or leave it, but the web is dynamic by nature.\nMost of the work is serializing and deserializing data between different systems, be it a database, Redis, external APIs, or template engines.\nRust has one of the best (de)serialization libraries in my opinion: .\nAnd yet, due to the nature of safety in Rust, I’d find myself writing boilerplate code just to avoid calling .\nI’d get long chain calls of  followed by .\nI defined a dozen of custom error enums, some taking other enums, because you want to be able to handle errors properly, and your functions can’t just return any error.</p><p>Similar thing can be said about writing SQL.\nI was really happy with using , which is a crate for compile-time checked SQL queries.\nBy relying on macros in Rust,  would execute the query against a real database instance in order to make sure that your query is valid, and the mappings are correct.\nHowever, writing dynamic queries with  is a PITA, as you can’t build a dynamic string and make sure it’s checked during compilation, so you have to resort to using non-checked SQL queries.\nAnd honestly, with  in Node.js, I can get a similar result, without the need to have a connection to the DB, while having ergonomic query builder to build dynamic queries, without the overhead of compilation time.</p><p>Okay, I hear you, let’s talk about compilation time.</p><p>Rust achieves its safety at the expense of, somewhat long, compilation time.\nOn modern hardware, the compilation time is not that bad.\nIt’s not good enough to have uninterrupted change-f5-preview cycle, but it’s good enough especially with incremental compilation.</p><p>However, the more crates you have, the more macros you use, the slower the compilation time becomes.\nSo the problem becomes is how to achieve fast compilation during CI/CD.\nDue to the dynamic nature of the web, you often times find yourself in a loop of: there is an error in production → fix it → deploy.\nAnd you want this loop to be as fast as possible, because you have customers who can’t do things with your app.</p><p>I have my own hardware to run CI/CD workers.\nA dedicated VM on an Intel Core i5-7500 with 32GB of RAM.\nThe VM has access to all 4 CPU cores, and would take about 14 minutes from push to  until the docker container was deployed on the server (about 12 of it is the docker stage with compilation).\nThat’s with multistaged docker file, and a cached builder layer; with no cache, it would probably take ~20-25 minutes.\nAnd it does not include running tests or  as part of the CI/CD.\nI simply gave-up trying to set-up proper caching so tests, , and compilation would be able to use the same cache.</p><p>Node.js, on the other hand, takes on average 5 minutes, including linting, and tests.\nAnd since I moved to Node.js, I added another back-office service, so I deploy more code, 3 times faster, while actually relying on running tests and lint as part of the CI/CD pipeline.</p><p>Rust has a very mature ecosystem in most aspects, but it is lacking in the web aspect.\nNeed an obscure third party API?\nIt’s probably not there.\nSo you end up implementing APIs instead of doing core business logic.\nEach API is additional code that you need to test and maintain.</p><p>It’s not hard to implement REST APIs, but the lack of maturity does slow you down.\nI had to implement, and test, third party APIs, queue mechanism on top of PostgreSQL, code to validate webhook signatures.\nIt was fun, but it comes out of the box in other, “standard”, languages.</p><p>And honestly, Node.js is good enough.\nPeople like to criticize Node.js or the  ecosystem, implying that there is something fundamentally wrong with JavaScript.\nAnd sure, JavaScript is far from being a good language.\nThere are many quirks in the language, which you can learn only with experience, pain, and tears.\nAnd I miss stuff from Rust like the  and  types; I miss the  statement; and I miss the  as well.\nBut in all honesty, Node.js ecosystem has matured and is stable to write web applications.\nYou have libraries like  to validate request/response JSONs, libraries like , , and my own <a href=\"https://yieldcode.blog/post/mjmx-jsx-runtime-mjml/\">@mjmx/core</a> to write type-safe SQL, HTML, and MJML.\nAnd  is still better in Node.js than in Rust.\nIt’s always weird to need to bring thirds party  crate because you want to have an  method in a .</p><p>There are still issues with Node.js.\nThe never-ending deprecation of  in favor of ; it’s mostly good, until you encounter a  package, and then it’s hell.\nThe cumbersome  and  setup where you need to juggle between 2 files and dozen of plugins to get basic functionality you get with  out-of-the-box; I wait for the day  will close the gaps, and becomes the standard tool.\nWorkspaces are still not solved, although  is better in this regard, but it’s nowhere near the workspaces in .\nAnd the occasional struggles with typescript where the runtime seems to be changing too often; is it ? ? ? The built-in typescript runtime in ? ? ?</p><p>Oh, and I really wish we all would just agree that  is simply the best, most aesthetically pleasing, and easy to read case for programming.\nI really hate the fact that JavaScript has adopted the .</p><p>Building solo is hard.\nYou wear 10 hats as software engineer, in addition to the dozen hats as an entrepreneur.\nI really wanted Rust to succeed, but I also need to move forward.\nI found myself ignoring bugs in Sentry because it meant going back to long compile times.\nI was postponing feature development because it meant slow iteration speed, and trying to synchronize backend REST API with frontend, or the need to visually re-test every page after a variable rename in a template.\nCall me spoiled, but I don’t have the luxury of development team, and someone checking my code.</p><p>Rust excels at non-visual things, i.e. things you can write and wrap with tests.\nBut when you need to develop UI, it becomes painful.\nYou wait for the code the recompile; worried about passing the wrong variable to a view.</p><p>From pure Rust, I had to go to Rust with a statically generated HTML + Alpine on top of it.\nTo make sure my email templates are safe, I was considering writing a dedicated mailing service in NodeJS, just so I could use  (or my own ), and get  type-safety.\nIt’s as if I was moving backwards, breaking my Rust monolith and rewriting parts in a dynamic language that is better suited for the web.</p><p>No, Node.js is not perfect.\nBut at least I have one stack, and funny enough, I get more type-safety than I had in Rust.\nSure, it’s a fake type-safety, JavaScript is a dynamic language, but I no longer have to jump between my view files and my model and try to keep them in sync.\nI no longer misspell translation keys, resulting in blank words; emails do not come with .</p><p>It seems like most of my issues boil down to dynamic things: templates, i18n, SQL.\nIf I were to write an API service today, I would probably choose Rust again, since API services do not have to deal with views or translations.\nI still don’t know how I would handle SQL though.\nORMs are not my cup of tea, and other than , Rust seems to lack a good type-safe query builder.</p><p>I also miss the small footprint of the application.\nWith Rust, the containers would use between 60 and 80 MB of RAM; but with Node.js, the lowest I have is 117 MB of RAM for the back-office, without any load.\nAnd it’s true what they say: use the right tool for the job.\nRust shines in CPU-heavy tasks, and for sure I will be using it when I will have such tasks.</p><p>But until then, farewell Rust.</p>",

I report what worked and what didn't.</p><p>Can you predict which edges in a transformer circuit matter before you do any causal interventions?</p><p>Current methods for measuring edge importance — path patching, activation patching, ablation studies — all require running the model. You perturb something, observe the effect, repeat. This scales linearly with the number of edges per intervention, and gets expensive fast for large models and dense circuits.</p><p>I've been developing a scoring method (the \"Cheap Anchor\" score) that predicts edge importance from weight structure alone. It started in a very different domain (algebraic number theory — I'll spare you the details, but the short version is that I was studying which local constraints determine global factorization outcomes in non-unique factorization rings, and the structural properties that predicted importance there turned out to generalize). The method worked well on feedforward networks (ρ=0.836–0.931 across scales from 80 to 3,120 edges). This post is about what happened when I tested it on a real transformer.</p><p>- Limitations (please read these) -</p><p>I want to be explicit about what this result does and does not show.</p><p>What it shows: Two structural properties of virtual weight matrices, computable from weights alone in 2 seconds, predict 39% of the variance (ρ²≈0.39) in causal edge importance within a known circuit.</p><p>This is not circuit discovery. I identified the induction heads first (from attention patterns), then scored edges within that known subgraph. The stronger claim — that high-scoring edges under Cheap Anchor cluster around known circuits when you score all edges in the model — has not been tested yet. That experiment is next.</p><p>Induction heads are the easiest case. They're clean, well-structured, and have been studied extensively. Messier circuits (factual recall, reasoning, refusal) involve distributed computation where edge-level analysis may be less informative. Success here is necessary but not sufficient.</p><p>The correlation is moderate, not spectacular. ρ=0.623 reliably identifies the most and least important edges, but the middle of the ranking is noisy. This is useful for prioritizing which edges to investigate or for coarse pruning, but it's not a replacement for path patching when you need precise importance scores.</p><p>Virtual weight matrices are a lossy abstraction. They ignore nonlinearities (attention softmax, LayerNorm, MLP activations) between components. The structural analysis captures what the linear pathway could transmit but not what the full nonlinear computation does transmit. The 39% captured variance likely represents the linear-algebraic component of edge importance, with the remaining 61% depending on activation-dependent factors.</p><p>Single model, single circuit. Replication on other models and circuits is needed before making general claims.</p><p>The fact that spectral concentration of virtual weight matrices predicts causal importance at all is, I think, a nontrivial observation. It suggests that the functional role of transformer components is partially encoded in their weight structure in a way that's accessible without running the model. The weight matrices aren't just arbitrary parameterizations that happen to produce the right input-output mapping — they carry structural signatures of their function.</p><p>The 125x speedup matters because it changes what's computationally feasible. Path patching every edge in GPT-2 small's induction circuit took ~250 seconds. Cheap Anchor took 2 seconds. For larger models and denser circuits, this gap widens. Even if the method only serves as a pre-filter — score all edges cheaply, then path-patch only the top 5% — that's a meaningful reduction in compute for circuit analysis.</p><p>Global percentile test: Score every edge in GPT-2 small (~21,750 edges) and check whether the 63 ground-truth induction edges cluster in the top percentiles. This is the circuit discovery test.</p><p>Scale to GPT-2 medium/large: The speedup advantage grows with model size. Demonstrating maintained correlation at larger scales would establish practical utility.</p><p>Test on other circuits: Indirect object identification, factual recall. Messier circuits are the real test.</p><p>All experiments run on a single consumer GPU (RTX 4060 Ti, 8GB VRAM). No API access, no cluster compute. If you have TransformerLens installed, you can reproduce the core result in under 5 minutes.</p><p>I'm an independent researcher (day job: paramedic). I don't have institutional affiliations or advisors in ML. If you see methodological problems with this work, I genuinely want to hear about them — that's why I'm posting here rather than just putting the paper on arXiv and hoping for the best. The method either works or it doesn't, and I'd rather find out from people who know transformers better than I do.</p>",

The issue is that many inexperienced programmers don’t have this mental distinction and think all languages are mostly the same but with just differing “syntax”. Just wait until they are exposed to a functional programming language or a database language, or even find out that a spreadsheet is a language.</p><p>I wrote an article in 2018&nbsp; about the different families of declaration syntax, but it is still weird to me how people view things when deciding whether to use a language or not. To use my language Odin as an example, do people think this substantially changes the  if its declaration syntax had these different looks?</p><pre><code>// Actual Odin\nx: i32 = 123\ny := 123 // inferred type\nFOO :: \"some constant\"\nbar :: proc() -&gt; i32 {\n    return 123\n}\n</code></pre><pre><code>// Qualifier focused\nvar x i32 = 123\nvar y = 123 // inferred type\nconst FOO = \"some constant\"\nproc bar() -&gt; i32 {\n    return 123\n}\n</code></pre><p>At best the difference here is going to be slightly more typing needed for  and , and thus just becomes a question of ergonomics or “optimizing for typing” (which is never the bottleneck). I’d argue most of the compiler would effectively be the same for the latter approach, since it already has to disambiguate between the different kinds of declarations&nbsp;. However each syntax family does have its own trade-offs which allow or prevent certain possibilities.</p><blockquote><p>Syntax restricts the possibilities of what semantics are possible.</p></blockquote><h2>Semicolons? What is this, 1990?</h2><p>The other similar thing I’ve seen numerous times before across numerous languages:</p><blockquote><p>Semicolons in &lt;insert-current-year&gt;? Why do you still have them, haven’t you learnt that we don’t need them any more?. </p></blockquote><p>From what I gather, this sentiment of not understanding why many “modern” languages still use semicolons is either:</p><p>When I first created Odin, semicolons were mostly required and inferred in many places but I eventually made semicolons fully optional as statement terminators. There were two reasons I made them optional:</p><ul><li>To make the grammar consistent, coherent, and simpler</li><li>To honestly shut up these kinds of bizarre people</li></ul><p>However making semicolons optional in a language can come with a few compromises. One option is to design the grammar such that they are “obvious” to infer their usage. Lua is an example of such a language, and when a semicolon is necessary is when you have something that could be misconstrued as being a call:</p><pre><code>(function() print(\"Test1\") end)(); -- That semicolon is required\n(function() print(\"Test2\") end)()\n</code></pre><p>Another option is to do something like automatic semicolon insertion (ASI) based on a set of rules. Unfortunately, a lot of people’s first experience with this kind of approach is JavaScript and its really poor implementation of it, which means people usually just write semicolons regardless to remove the possible mistakes. However there are languages that have relatively sane approaches to ASI such as Go, Python, and Odin.</p><p>Go’s approach is purely a lexical rule, which does mean you are forced to do things like trailing commas in lists that span multiple lines. However this is probably not just done for simplicity but also to enforce a code styling.</p><p>Python and Odin’s approach is both a lexical rule + syntactical rule. Odin’s lexical rule is very similar to Go’s but with the added syntactical rules, it makes it a lot less annoying to use and allows for more code styling options. Odin’s rules, which are very similar to Python’s, are to ignore newline-based “semicolons” within brackets ( and , and  used as an expression or record block).</p><p>To allow for things like Allman braces, Odin allows for extra single newline in many places in its grammar, but only an extra single newline. This is to get around certain ambiguities between declaration a procedure type and a procedure literal:</p><pre><code>a_type :: proc()\n\na_procedure_declaration :: proc() {\n\n}\n\nanother_procedure_declaration :: proc()\n{\n\n}\n\nanother_type :: proc() // note the extra newline separating the signature from a `{`\n\n{ // this is just a block\n\n}\n</code></pre><p>How is it that people literally choose a language purely on the most minute syntax issues rather than on the (denotational or operational) semantics? Or do most people not actually “program” but just “pattern match” syntax together and  it works?</p><p>Maybe I don’t need to be as cynical and it is a lot simpler than all of that: . It’s the tendency for an individual to develop a  simply because they became familiar with it first, rather that it be a rational choice from a plethora of options. People keep to what they are familiar with, which can be rational. But saying they don’t like something without even trying it, is a bit irrational.</p><p>I’ve written about how C’s <a href=\"https://www.gingerbill.org/article/2020/01/25/a-reply-to-lets-stop-copying-c/#heading-2-9\">declarations match usage</a>, which I’d argue most people don’t realize unless they have made C parser/compiler&nbsp;. Most people think C’s declaration syntax is either just type-first or something arcane that you just randomly guess at. For Odin, I designed the syntax for types to be more Pascal-style to improve reading, parsing, and comprehension:</p><pre><code>x: [3]^int // array 3 of pointer to int\ny: ^[3]int // pointer to array 3 of int\n</code></pre><p>The unfortunate equivalent of this in C would be:</p><pre><code>int *x[3];   // array 3 of pointer to int\nint (*y)[3]; // pointer to array 3 of int\n</code></pre><p>Instead of following C’s approach of “declarations match usage”, Odin’s approach is “types on the left, usage on the right”:</p><pre><code>x: [3]int  // type on the LHS\nx[1] = 123 // usage on the RHS\n\ny: ^int = ...\ny^ = 123\n\nz: [6]^int = ...\nz[3]^ = 123\n</code></pre><p>Coupled with Odin’s very strong and orthogonal type system, things  as expected and are easy to comprehend for mere mortals like myself.</p><p>I have seen many criticisms of Odin’s usage of a caret  for pointers&nbsp; due to them being dead keys on many keyboard layouts, but due to Odin’s type inference system through , auto-dereferencing ( becomes ), a much better type system (e.g. actual arrays for example), and other semantics in general, the need to type out explicitly type pointers is a heck of a lot less common than in C. But that’s the problem when people complain about syntax between languages without even trying it or thinking through the actual consequences of such decisions.</p><p>I know I’ve spent a lot of time on Odin’s syntax so that it is as consistent as possible&nbsp; and to be very ergonomic with respect to the semantics of the language, but I don’t think the declaration syntax or optional semicolons of Odin “make or break” the language. For me, the essence of Odin is to  like a modern C alternative with the joy of programming, rather than to  like C. Even languages which keep as close to the type-focused declaration syntax of C, such as <a href=\"https://c3-lang.org/\">C3</a>, still depart from the rest of C’s syntax for other features and constructs. This is because C’s syntax has a lot of issues to it which should not be repeated, especially not its actual declaration syntax.</p><p>Sometimes tiny syntax decisions do add friction, and they do add up. One of the approaches to designing Odin has been to  people in a direction which is usually a better way of doing things, rather than cause direct friction. However if friction is needed, usually what is needed is the equivalent of a brick wall, not sandpaper. But the syntax in this case is a reflection of the semantics of the language itself, and that’s what many people seem to misunderstand. Syntax is not everything, semantics are the actual foundation of a language.</p><p>If you’re a fellow language designer, honestly: ignore these people. Everyone has an opinion, but that opinion might not be of value to anyone, even the person who holds it.</p><p>If a person complains about the general category (not the specifics) of a syntax decision in your language, such as the declaration syntax, the use of semicolons or not, whether the core/standard library uses  or  for procedure names, or some other asinine position: </p><p>I think a lot of the reasons people judge languages based on such “minor” syntactic decisions is probably because they don’t have much experience with other programming languages. I’ve found that as people become more experienced with programming and other programming languages, this sentiment disappears entirely and people just focus on programming. The syntax is just there for reading, not for “appreciating”.</p><p>Look for the opinions of people that you do value and deem to be of worth, not some rando’s off the internet.</p><p>Please don’t choose a language solely for its syntax. Consider the actual language semantics since they will be the things that affect you the most down the line.</p>",

We have seen them in factories, research labs, and even people’s homes. But with the rise of AI, robots are getting smarter, faster, and more capable. They no longer just repeat simple tasks, as they can now perform intricate patterns and lifelike movement. And in China, they are now flipping, spinning, and performing kung fu on national television.</p><p>During the annual China Media Group Spring Festival Gala, the country’s most-watched broadcast, humanoid robots took center stage and shocked everyone with their movements. They spun, jumped, and even backflipped and successfully landed on their knees, without a hitch. They performed martial arts routines and choreographed dances alongside humans. The showcase quickly went viral online, and compared to last year’s lunar new year broadcast, it was a flashy AI-powered affair.</p><figure></figure><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/feb/18/china-dancing-humanoid-robots-festival-show\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">According to Kyle Chan from the Brookings Institution</a>, China uses these public performances to highlight its technological strength. Humanoid robots are visible proof of progress. Unlike AI software or industrial machines hidden in factories, these robots can be seen by millions on TV and smartphones.</p><blockquote><p>“While China and the US are neck-and-neck on AI, humanoid robots are an area where China can claim to be ahead of the US, particularly in terms of scaling up production.”</p><cite>Kyle Chan of Brookings Institution</cite></blockquote><p>Chan pointed out that while China and the US remain close in the AI race, humanoid robotics is an area where China is ahead, especially when it comes to scaling production, something which the chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, Mark Haefele, also agrees with, when he <a href=\"https://www.pcguide.com/news/investment-executive-praises-china-for-using-ai-to-grow-industry-pokes-fun-at-the-us-for-making-ai-girlfriends/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">poked fun at the US for making “AI girlfriends”</a> instead.</p><p>By the end of 2024, China had registered 451,700 smart robotics companies with total capital reaching 6.44tn yuan. Plus, government-backed plans like Made in China 2025 and the 14th Five-Year Plan have placed robotics and AI at the center of national strategy.</p><p>Georg Stieler, from Stieler Technology and Marketing, said the gala showed something important. China can run large numbers of near-identical humanoids in synchronized motion with stable gaits and consistent joint behavior. That indicates progress in coordination and manufacturing scale.</p><div><div><img src=\"https://www.pcguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_8117-96x96.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div>",

And I can keep track of recent minor versions but I agree with Linus that they all start to run together after a while.</p><p>\nLinux kernel version 6 was released about three years ago with version 5 about three years before that. Even if it were 156 currently and 155 three years ago, I think I could tell you the current major version number of Linux and, if you gave me a previous one, I would have a sense of how old it was. I would also have a pretty good idea of the major features that appeared in each one.</p><p>\nWithout looking it up, I can say that Linux kernel 5 brought the introduction of Apple Silicon, io_uring, and exFAT. Apple Silicon then matured very nicely in Linux kernel 6 which aligns with the experimental period for \"Rust in the Linux kernel\". The major new architecture in kernel 6 has been RISC-V which is maturing nicely but, like Rust, will probably hit its stride in kernel 7. Kernel 6 also contained the bcachefs saga and the long-awaited real-time merge. Kernel 6 aligns with when most people started to trust btrfs (I still don't). We do not even have 7 and it already feels like it will be the release where both Rust and RISC-V go mainstream. Maybe bcachefs will come back. If not, perhaps a competitor. In short, the major version numbers seem meaningful in terms of marking different eras of kernel evolution.</p><p>\nI can tell you that \"Docker containers\" appeared in the kernel 4 timeframe but that you really need at least kernel 5 to run Docker today.</p><p>\nContrast that to the situation where we had 2.6 forever and there was 2.6.38.8 and 2.6.25.20 three years before that (had to look that up just now). Without checking the date, could you have told me in rough terms how old the latter was or what had changed since then? Not me.</p><p>\nAnd kernel 2.4 goes all the way back to the Windows XP days.

      "content": "<p>We are an exploratory species, just past the solar system now, but perhaps one day we will look back and call our galaxy merely the first. There are many problems to solve along the way, and today we will look at one very small one. How do we assign IDs to devices (or any object) so the IDs are guaranteed to always be unique?</p><p>Being able to identify objects is a fundamental tool for building other protocols, and it also underpins manufacturing, logistics, communications, and security. Every ship and satellite needs an ID for traffic control and maintenance history. Every radio, router, and sensor needs an ID so packets have a source and destination. Every manufactured component needs an ID for traceability. And at scale, the count explodes: swarms of robots, trillions of parts, and oceans of cargo containers moving through a civilization’s supply chain.</p><p>One of the key functions of an ID is to differentiate objects from one another, so we need to make sure we don’t assign the same ID twice. Unique ID assignment becomes a more challenging problem when we try to solve it at the scale of the universe.</p><p>The first and easiest solution is to pick a random number every time a device needs an ID.</p><p>This is so simple that it is likely the best solution; you can do this anytime, anywhere, without the need for a central authority or coordination of any kind.</p><p>The big issue, though, is that it’s possible for two devices to pick the same ID by chance. Fortunately, we have complete control over the size of the random number, and by extension, the probability of a collision. This means we can make the likelihood of a collision functionally zero.</p><p>You may say that “functionally zero” is not enough, that although the probability is small, it is not  zero, and so you are concerned. But consider this example: The probability of you being struck by a meteorite right now is small but non-zero, and you might even call that a “reasonable” (if paranoid) concern. But are you worried that every human on Earth will be hit by a meteorite right now? That probability is also non-zero, yet it is so infinitesimally small that we treat it as an impossibility. That is how small we can make the probability of an ID collision.</p><p>So how small does this probability need to be before we are comfortable? It will be helpful to reframe the question: How many IDs can we generate before a collision is expected?</p><p>The most recent version of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier\">Universally Unique Identifiers</a> (UUIDs), which are a version of what we have been describing, uses 122 random bits. Using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem\">the birthday paradox</a>, we can calculate the expected number of IDs before a collision is $\\approx 2^{61}$.</p><p>Is this high, or is it low? Is it enough to last the galaxy-wide expansion of the human race up to the heat death of the universe? Let’s try to calculate our own principled number by looking at the physical limits of the universe.</p><p>The paper <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0404510\">“Universal Limits on Computation”</a> has calculated that if the entire universe were a maximally efficient computer (known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computronium\">computronium</a>), it would have an upper limit of $10^{120}$ operations before the heat death of the universe. If we assume every operation generates a new ID, then we can calculate how large our IDs need to be to avoid a collision until the universe runs out of time.</p><p>Using approximations from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem\">the birthday paradox</a>, the probability of a collision for $n$ random numbers across a set of $d$ values is</p>\\[p(n, d) \\approx 1 - e^{-\\frac{n(n-1)}{2d}}\\]<p>We want a probability of $p = 0.5$ (this is a close approximation for when a collision is “expected”) for $n = 10^{120}$ numbers, so we can solve for $d$ to get</p>\\[d \\approx -\\frac{n(n-1)}{2 \\times \\ln(1 - p)} = -\\frac{10^{120}(10^{120}-1)}{2 \\times \\ln(1 - 0.5)} \\approx 10^{240}\\]<p>This is how large the ID space must be if we want to avoid a collision until the heat death of the universe. In terms of bits, this would require $\\log_{2}(10^{240}) = 797.26$, so at least 798 bits.</p><p>This is the most extreme upper limit, and is a bit overkill. With 798 bits, we could assign IDs to literally everything ever and never expect a collision. Every device, every microchip, every component of every microchip, every keystroke, every tick of every clock, every star and every atom, everything can be IDed using this protocol and we still won’t expect a collision.</p><p>A more reasonable upper limit might be to assume that every atom in the observable universe will get one ID (we assume atoms won’t be assigned multiple IDs throughout time, which is a concession). There are an estimated $10^{80}$ atoms in the universe. Using the same equation as above, we find that we need 532 bits to avoid (probabilistically) a collision up to that point.</p><p>Or maybe we convert all of the mass of the universe into 1-gram nanobots? We would have $1.5 \\times 10^{56}$ bots, which would require IDs of 372 bits.</p><p>We now have four sizes of IDs we can choose from, depending on how paranoid we are:</p><ul><li>798 bits from computronium</li><li>372 bits for 1-gram nanobots</li></ul><blockquote><p>Note that this has assumed true randomness when generating a random number, but this is sometimes a challenge. Many random number generators will use a pseudo-random number generator with a non-random seed. You want to ensure your hardware is capable of introducing true randomness, such as from a quantum source, or by using a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG). If that is not available, using sensor data, timestamps, or other non-deterministic sources can help add additional randomness, but, it will not be pure randomness and therefore it will increase the probability that IDs collide. It would probably be a good idea to ban any IDs that are “common”, such as the first 1,000 IDs from every well known pseudo-random generator, the all-zeros ID, the all-ones ID, etc..</p></blockquote><p>But what if we are exceptionally paranoid and  that the IDs are theoretically guaranteed to be unique? None of this probabilistic nonsense. That will take us on a journey.</p><p>As usual, let’s start with the easiest solution and work from there.</p><blockquote><p>All the code for visuals, simulations, and analysis can be found at <a href=\"https://github.com/JasonFantl/CUID-blog-post\">this github repo</a>.</p></blockquote><p>Let’s create a single central computer that uses a counter to assign IDs. When someone requests an ID, it assigns the value of its counter, then increments the counter so the next ID will be unique. This scheme is nice since it guarantees uniqueness and the length of the IDs grows as slow as possible: logarithmically.</p><p>If all the 1-gram nanobots got an ID from this central computer, the longest ID would be $\\log_2(1.5 \\times 10^{56}) = 187$ bits. Actually, it would be a tiny bit longer due to overhead when <a href=\"https://jasonfantl.com/posts/Universal-Codes/\">encoding a variable-length value</a>. We will ignore that for now.</p><p>Ok, there are serious issues with this solution. The primary issue I see is access. What if you’re on a distant planet and don’t have communication with the central computer? Or maybe your planet is so far from the computer that getting an ID would take days. Unacceptable.</p><p>In order to fix this, we might start sending out satellites in every direction that can assign unique IDs. Imagine we send the first satellite with ID , then the next with , and keep incrementing. Now people only need to request an ID from their nearest satellite and they will get back an ID that looks like , where  is the ID of the satellite and  is the counter on the satellite. For example, the fourth satellite assigning its tenth ID would send out . This ensures that every ID is unique and that getting an ID is more accessible.</p><p>But why stop at satellites? Why not let  device with an ID be capable of assigning new IDs?</p><p>For example, imagine a colony ship is built and gets the sixth ID from satellite , so it now has an ID of . The colonists take this ship to the outer rim, too far to communicate with anyone. When they reach their planet, they build construction robots which need new IDs. They can’t request IDs from a satellite since they are too far, but they could request IDs from their ship. The construction bots get IDs  and  since the ship had already assigned 3 IDs before this time and its counter was at . And now these robots could assign IDs as well!</p><p>This does assume you always have at least one device capable of assigning IDs nearby. But, if you are in conditions to be creating new devices, then you probably have at least one pre-existing device nearby.</p><p>Let’s call this naming scheme Dewey.</p><p>How does Dewey compare to the random-IDs in terms of bits required?</p><p>If an ID is of the form , then we can encode that using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elias_omega_coding\">Elias omega coding</a>. For now we will ignore the small overhead of the encoding and assume each number is perfectly represented using its binary values, but we will add it back in later. That means the ID  would have the binary representation , which has 8 bits. We can see how each value in the ID grows logarithmically since a counter grows logarithmically.</p><p>How the IDs grow over time will depend on what order IDs are assigned. Let’s look at some examples.</p><p>If each new device goes to the original device, creating an expanding subtree, then the IDs will grow logarithmically. This is exactly the central computer model we considered earlier.</p><p>If we take the other extreme, where each new device requests an ID from the most recent device, then we form a chain. The IDs will grow linearly in this case.</p><p>Or what if each new device chooses a random device to request an ID from? The growth should be something between linear and logarithmic. We will look more into this later.</p><p>We might also ask, what are the best-case and worst-case assignment trees for this scheme? We can just run the simulation and select the best or worst next node and see what happens. Note that there are multiple ways to show the best-case and worst-case since many IDs have the same length, so we arbitrarily have to pick one at a time, but the overall shape of the tree will be the same. Also note that this uses one-node lookahead, which might fail for more complex schemes, but is valid here.</p><p>We see one worst-case tree is the chain. This best-case tree for Dewey seems to have every node double its children, then repeat. This causes it to grow wide quite quickly. This indicates that this scheme would be great if we expect new devices to primarily request IDs from nodes that already have many children, but not great if we expect new devices to request IDs from other newer devices (the chain is the extreme example of this).</p><p>Here is the best-case at a larger scale to get a more intuitive feel for how the graph grows. What we care about is the fact that it is a fairly dense graph, which means this scheme would be best if humans use a small number of nodes to request IDs from.</p><p>It’s annoying that the chain of nodes causes the ID to grow linearly. Can we design a better ID-assignment scheme that would be logarithmic for the chain as well?</p><p>Here is another attempt at an ID-assignment scheme, let’s see if it will grow any slower.</p><p>Take the entire space of IDs, visualized as a binary tree. Each device will have an ID somewhere on this tree. In order to assign new IDs, a device will take the column below it (columns alternate from left or right for each device) and assign the IDs in that column. With this scheme each node has a unique ID and also has an infinite list of IDs to assign (the blue outline in the figure), each of which also has an infinite list of IDs to assign, and so on.</p><p>And now we can look at how it grows across a subtree and across a chain.</p><p>Both cases grow linearly. This is not what we were looking for. It’s now worth asking: Is this scheme always worse than the Dewey scheme?</p><p>If we look at the worst-case and best-case of this scheme, we notice that the best-case will grow differently then Dewey.</p><p>And the best-case at a larger scale.</p><p>It grows roughly equally in all directions. The depth of the best-case tree grows faster than Dewey, which means this scheme would be better for growth models where new nodes are equally likely to request from older nodes and newer nodes. Specifically, the best-case tree grows by adding a child to every node in the tree and then repeating.</p><p>So this scheme can be better for some trees when compared to Dewey. Let’s keep exploring.</p><p>Actually, there is a scheme that looks different, but grows the same as this one.</p><p>If each ID is an integer, then a node with ID $n$ would assign to its $i$th child the ID $2^i(2n+1)$. Essentially, each child will double the ID from the previous child, and the first child has the ID $2n+1$ from its parent. This is a construction based on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-adic_valuation\">2-adic valuation</a>.</p><p>You can change the memory layout of this scheme pretty easily by using $(i, n)$ as the ID instead of $2^i(2n+1)$. Now the sequential child IDs of a node will grow logarithmically instead of linearly. This feels very similar to Dewey.</p><p>That’s all a bit complicated, but essentially we can say that this is an alternative representation of the Binary scheme we already looked at. But we want to explore new schemes that might have better memory growth characteristics.</p><p>Let’s try to reverse-engineer a scheme that can grow logarithmically for the chain tree.</p><p>We know that a counter grows logarithmically, so ideally the ID would only increment a counter when adding a new node.</p><p>One idea is to have a token that gets passed down to children with a hop-count attached to it. But what happens when a device gets a new ID request and it doesn’t have a token to pass? We will have a token index which increments each time a parent has to create a new token. The new token will then be appended to the parent ID. So the chain of three will look like , , , as the root node has no token, then the first child causes the root to generate token, then the next hop gets the token passed down to it with an incremented hop count. If the root node had two more ID requests, it would generate  and , incrementing the first value to produce unique tokens. Each ID is a list of (token-index, hop-count) pairs, ordered by creation. Let’s get a better idea of what this looks like by looking at a simulation.</p><p>Here we have the expanding subtree, the chain, and one of the best-cases.</p><p>We can see that IDs are a bit longer in general since we have more information in each ID, but at least it grows logarithmically in our extreme cases.</p><p>This logarithmic growth for chains is reflected in the larger-scale best-case graph, where we see long chains growing from the root.</p><p>This is kind of a lie though. The chain is logarithmic, but if we add even one more child to any node, the scheme starts to grow linearly. If our graph grows even a little in both depth and width together, we find ourselves back at the linear regime. We didn’t generate the worst-case graph above since our simulation uses a greedy search algorithm and the worst-case takes two steps to identify. The true worst-case is hard-coded and shown below, which we can see does grow linearly.</p><p>So we have yet to find an algorithm that produces logarithmic growth in all cases. Is it even possible to design a scheme that always grows logarithmically, even in the worst-case?</p><p>Although we have proven that whatever scheme we come up with will be linear in the worst-case, it seems plausible that some algorithms perform better than others for different growth models. If we can find a reasonable growth model for humans expanding into the universe, then we should be able to reverse-engineer the best algorithm.</p><p>Let us consider different models that approximate how humans might expand into the universe.</p><p>The first and easiest model to consider is random parent selection. Each time a device is added it will randomly select from all the previous devices to request an ID. This will produce what is known as a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_recursive_tree\">Random Recursive Tree</a>. We will also run this at a small scale, up to around 2,048 nodes. And we will actually use the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elias_omega_coding\">Elias omega encoding</a> so we can have more comparable results to the Random ID assignment bit usage.</p><p>The best scheme is Binary, followed by Dewey, and Token is the worst. This makes some sense since a random tree will grow at a roughly equal rates in depth and width, which is the best-case for Binary. Dewey and Token are harder to reason about, but we suspect that Dewey does best for high-width trees and Token for high-depth trees.</p><p>For example, we can look at a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferential_attachment\">preferential attachment</a> random graph, where nodes are more likely to connect to nodes with more connections, a model which many real-world networks follow. The width of the tree will dominate the depth, so we might expect Dewey to win out. Specifically, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferential_attachment\">preferential attachment</a> chooses a node weighted by the degree (number of edges) to choose a parent, which increases the degree of that parent, creating positive feedback. Let’s see how each ID assignment scheme handles this new growth model.</p><p>And we see that Dewey performs best, followed by Token, and then Binary by a wide margin.</p><p>Although, it seems unrealistic that devices become more popular because they assign more IDs. It seems reasonable to believe that some devices are more popular than others, but that popularity is not dependent on its history. A satellite will be very popular relative to a lightbulb, not because the satellite happened to assign more IDs in the past, but because its intrinsic properties like its position and accessibility make it easier to request IDs from. We could use a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_model_(network_theory)\">fitness model</a>, where each node is initialized with a fitness score that determines how popular it will be. The fitness score is sampled from an exponential.</p><p>And it seems that Dewey and Binary do equally well, with Token producing the worst IDs. Although this seems pretty similar to the purely Random graph.</p><p>We need to run a large number of simulations for a large number of nodes and see if there’s a consistent pattern.</p><p>Below we run 1,000 simulations for each growth model, building a graph up to about a million ($2^{20}$) nodes. We plot the maximum ID of the graph over time. Each run is shown as a line, then the x axis is made exponential since we suspect that the IDs grow with the logarithm of the node count, which will be easier to see with an exponential x axis.</p><p>That’s some pretty clean results! We see a roughly straight line for most plots (the exceptions being Binary for the Preferential growth model and the Fitness growth model where it curves a small amount). The straight lines are a strong indication that the growth of IDs actually is logarithmic, and that we could fit a curve to it. To inspect the Preferential model for the other ID assignment schemes, let’s plot it again without Binary.</p><p>And we still see the linear trends on the exponential plot, which indicates that Dewey and Token schemes still grow logarithmically.</p><p>For now we will use the above simulations as the first rung on our <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_distance_ladder\">ladder</a> of simulations, using those results to plug into larger models which then are plugged into even larger models.</p><p>In order to determine how many bits these schemes might require for a universe-wide humanity, we need to evaluate models of how our IDs will grow between worlds.</p><p>We will use the million-node simulation of the Fitness growth model to model the assignment of IDs on the surface of a planet for its first few years. To scale up to a full planet over hundreds of years, we can fit a logarithmic curve to our Fitness model and extrapolate.</p><p>For this analysis we will select the Dewey ID assignment scheme since it seems to perform well across all growth models.</p><p>When we fit a logarithmic curve to the max ID length of Dewey ID assignment in the Fitness growth model, it fits the curve $(6.5534 ± 0.2856) \\ln(n)$ (where $0.2856$ is the standard deviation). This equation now allows us to closely approximate the max ID length after an arbitrary number of devices.</p><p>We have our model for expansion on a planet, now we need a model for how humanity spreads from one planet to the next. We can’t really know what it will look like when/if we expand into the universe, but people have definitely tried. Below are some papers modeling how humans will expand into the universe, from which we can try to create our own best-guess model more relevant to our analysis.</p><p>We will model the expansion between planets in a galaxy by using a constant-speed expanding wavefront that settles any habitable planet, where that new planet is seeded with a random ID from the closest settled planet. We will use the same model for the expansion between galaxies.</p><p>This will produce linear growth of ID-length as the wavefront moves outward. As each planet restarts the ID assignment process, it will cause the ID length to grow larger according to the same curve we saw for the first planet.</p><p>If we assume that planets are close to uniformly positioned in a galaxy and the galaxy is roughly spherical (many galaxies are actually disks, but it won’t change the final conclusion), then we can expect the radius of the galaxy in terms of planet-hops can be solved for using the equation of the volume of a sphere. The radius in terms of planet-hops can be approximated by $\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{3V}{4 \\pi}} = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{3 \\cdot 40 \\cdot 10^{9}}{4 \\pi}} \\approx 2121$.</p><p>If we assume each planet produces around 1 billion IDs before settling the next nearest planet, then we can calculate the ID length by the time it reaches the edge of the galaxy. This will be the amount by which the longest ID increases per planet (we are assuming 1 billion assignments) multiplied by the number of times this happens, which is the number of planets we hop to reach the edge of the galaxy. This doesn’t sound good.</p>\\[6.5534 \\cdot \\ln(10^9) \\cdot 2121 \\approx 288048\\]<p>That is a lot of bits. And it will only get worse. We will use the same approximation for galaxies as we did for planets.</p><p>Again assuming galaxies fill space uniformly, and as a sphere, we get the number of hops between galaxies to be $\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 10^{12}}{4 \\pi}} \\approx 7816$. And using the $288048$ from above as the length the ID increases every galaxy, we get</p>\\[288048 \\cdot 7816 = 2251383168\\]<p>That is an exceptionally large number of bits. It would take about $281.4$ MB just to store the ID in memory.</p><p>This Deterministic solution is terrible when compared to the Random solution, which even in its most paranoid case only used 798 bits.</p><p>We might see this and try to think of solutions. Maybe we regulate that settlers must bring a few thousand of the shortest IDs they can find from their parent planet to the new planet, which would cut down the ID length per planet by around a half. But unless we find a way to grow IDs logarithmically across planets and galaxies, it won’t get you even close (remember, $2121 \\cdot 7816 = 16577736$ planet hops in total).</p><p>So for now it seems the safest bet for universally unique IDs are Random numbers with a large enough range that the probabilities of collisions are functionally zero. But it was fun to consider how we might bring that probability to actually zero: designing different ID assignment schemes, running simulations, and modeling human expansion through the universe.</p><p>All the code for visuals, simulations, and analysis can be found at <a href=\"https://github.com/JasonFantl/CUID-blog-post\">my repo on github</a>.</p><p>This was very much an exploration with many paths left unexplored, please reach out if you explore one of them and want to chat about it, it’s good fun.</p><p>Thanks to Kevin Montambault and Jacob Hendricks for being happy to talk with me for hours on end about these strange interests of mine. I am grateful and privileged to have friends with such deep curiosities.</p><p>Another potential interesting component of this is security. You can prevent ID-spoofing by using signatures to verify identity and that each message comes from who they claim. For the Random case, you would use your public key as your ID. For the Deterministic schemes, each node could sign their child’s public key, which would allow one to verify the chain of signatures up to the root node which all nodes have knowledge of. Replay attacks can be avoided using challenges (send and respond challenges), although they would be hard in unidirectional or delayed comms (planet to planet), so you might label messages as unconfirmed until a challenge is verified.</p><p>We should also add some error correction to the IDs so if someone for example tries to read an ID and mis-reads a letter they can correct it later. Since there are many ways to apply error correction, there should be a version number attached to the error-correcting ID.</p><p>Some objects can not store IDs themselves, such as when an ID is assigned to a planet for example, and so it’s possible that multiple IDs get accidentally assigned to the same object. In this case we should actually store a list of IDs for objects which represent all the IDs that refer to the same object.</p><p>There can be an issue related to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus\">ship of Theseus</a> where an object with an ID might be slowly repaired with new parts, until eventually all the parts have been replaced. Should this object still have the same ID? One pragmatic solution might be to have the ID stored in a particular piece of hardware and accept that what it means to have a particular ID is to just to have that particular piece of hardware regardless of what it is connected to.</p>",

An error in one query does nothing to block another, allowing us to collect multiple errors or even ignore errors in unrelated portions of our code.</p><p>Query based compilation is motivated by two factors: incremental reuse and Integrated Development Environments (IDEs).\nAs languages have grown more featureful, compilers have taken on more work to keep up.\nIt’s increasingly important that compilers work incrementally, determining the code that has changed since last compilation and only recompiling changed code.\nThe query model helps with this because each query tracks what queries they depend upon.\nIf all a query’s dependents are unchanged, we know the output of the query is unchanged and we can reuse its cached value.</p><p>IDEs are only growing in popularity.\nEspecially with the arrival of the Language Server Protocol (LSP) bringing IDE features to your favorite editor (unless your favorite editor is nano; very sorry about that).\nWith this rise in popularity, the way we use compilers has changed.\nOur usage is more fine grained than before.\nWe don’t want to know the types of our whole program, just the type of the function we’re looking at right now.\nI don’t need the definition of every variable in my program, just the definition of the variable under my cursor.</p><p>Queries also help us here.\nWe can construct queries that run over a single function, or even a single variable, and they’ll only depend on the queries for that function.\nExecuting the minimal set of queries for our function allows us to answer queries faster.\nThis is important for IDEs because the user is sitting there waiting for the compiler to get back to them.\nThe faster we can answer, the better, and queries let us do the minimal amount of work to answer.</p><p>Query based compilers are all the rage: Rust, Swift, Kotlin, Haskell, and Clang all structure their compilers as queries.\nIf you want to learn how these new optimal incremental compilers work, however, you’re hard pressed to find resources.\nLet this be your call to action: persuade your professors, pester your local PL passionates, phone your representatives.\nWe need more educational material on query-based compilers.</p><div><div>If you’d like to learn how to make a query based compiler, check out my <a href=\"https://thunderseethe.dev/series/making-a-language\">making a language series\n</a>.\nIt culminates in constructing a query based compiler and using it to implement a <a href=\"https://thunderseethe.dev/making-a-language\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-goatcounter-click=\"https://thunderseethe.dev/making-a-language\" data-goatcounter-title=\"language server\" data-goatcounter-referrer=\"Compiler Education Deserves a Revolution\">language server\n</a>.</div></div>",

      "content": "<p>From my experience as a people manager (and an even longer stint as a developer), I’ve noticed that <strong>many engineers don’t see much value in goals</strong>. </p><p>If this is how you feel when your manager asks you to set yearly goals (or hands you new ones) .</p><p>In my perspective, they often feel like extra homework, tacked on after the “real work” of coding, only to resurface at the end of the year when someone asks about your progress. And from where I stand, you’re right: when treated this way, goals rarely deliver tangible benefits. </p><p>But <strong>it doesn’t have to be like this</strong>.</p><h2><strong>You’re missing out (on what exactly?)</strong></h2><p>, when used correctly, are a powerful long-term focus tool. In fast-paced teams, swamped with Jira tickets, code reviews, and spikes, you can be constantly busy yet rarely challenge the true priority or value of your next task.</p><p>That’s what goals are for:</p><ul><li>&nbsp;make sure you’re working on what matters.</li><li><strong>Personal development goals</strong>&nbsp;help you learn intentionally from your day-to-day work.</li></ul><p>If your goals aren’t doing that, it’s probably because they’re not being used as intended.</p><h2></h2><p>Once again: <strong>you must pick something that you truly feel strongly about</strong>. Realising this simple truth was the change in my case. It is better to have one goal that truly meets this requirement than four you only slightly care about.</p><p>My turning point came from my personal, not professional, life.&nbsp;I realised that my life wasn’t heading where I wanted, and if I didn’t change course, I wouldn’t be happy with how I’d spent it. This insight helped me see the importance of long-term planning (and I wouldn’t have seen it if I hadn’t read Stephen Covey’s classic book&nbsp;<em>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</em>).</p><p>From there, I began setting goals, actually tracking them, and finally seeing the value.</p><p>For goals to work for you, you need&nbsp;<strong>three simple requirements:</strong></p><ol><li>Choose goals you <strong>genuinely believe are important and valuable</strong>. </li><li> (if you’re not tracking, it’s usually a sign that requirement 1 isn’t really met).</li><li>Connect goals to your , so progress happens as you ship, not as an afterthought.</li></ol><h2></h2><p>A common problem is that the goals are too detached from your daily work. You likely spend most of your time in the codebase, making changes based on your issue‑tracking system. Now consider a goal like:</p><blockquote><p><em>By the end of the year, I will have finished a Kotlin fundamentals training.</em></p></blockquote><p>That’s planning to fail. Will you truly make room for this while putting tickets on hold? If yes, great. But for most of us, day-to-day tasks feel more urgent. December arrives, and you realise you’ve made no progress. Cue the last-minute scramble.</p><p><strong>Define a different goal instead</strong>:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>When I see a Kotlin feature in the codebase that I don’t understand, I’ll read the documentation and make a note of it (at least once a week).</em></p></blockquote><p>Why this works: you don’t need much extra time, it won’t derail the task at hand, it’s easy to track, and it builds a habit of continuous learning rather than a one-off course completion.</p><h2>Focus on the “how,” not just “what”</h2><p>Another tip is defining goals that focus you on <strong>how&nbsp;you’d&nbsp;like to&nbsp;accomplish&nbsp;something</strong>.&nbsp;Probably the&nbsp;task from the issue tracking system already tells you what you need to do.&nbsp;A goal can help you define&nbsp;additional&nbsp;criteria or focus on the quality.</p><p>Let’s say you introduced a few bugs into the system recently and want to avoid this in the future. You could define a goal:</p><blockquote><p><em>For every applicable pull request, I will leave a comment documenting measured test coverage before and after the change and ensure it increases.</em></p></blockquote><p>This keeps the goal anchored in your daily work while adding a perspective often missing from the ticket.</p><p>This relates to Requirement 2: if you do not see the goal often, you’re likely to forget to track it. Keep them in sight: as a sticky note on your monitor or pinned at the top of your to-do list.</p><h2></h2><p>There’s a reason OKRs have stuck around: they’re simple and effective. A practical check I like is to define the&nbsp;&nbsp;and then ask:</p><blockquote><p><em>Will it really happen once these KRs are met?</em></p></blockquote><p>If the answer is “not quite,” adjust your Key Results until they make the objective inevitable.</p><p>If you’ve made it this far, I hope it’s a bit clearer how goals can help. Pick goals that matter, track them regularly, and tie them to your daily work. You’ll feel the difference.</p>",

The Refineries are useful if you have done a LOT of up-front\nspecification work, and you have huge piles of Beads to churn through with\nlong convoys.</p></blockquote><p>Many of us got hit by the agent coding addiction.  It feels good, we barely\nsleep, we build amazing things.  Every once in a while that interaction involves\nother humans, and all of a sudden we get a reality check that maybe we overdid\nit.  The most obvious example of this is the massive degradation of quality of\nissue reports and pull requests.  As a maintainer many PRs now look like an\ninsult to one’s time, but when one pushes back, the other person does not see\nwhat they did wrong.  They thought they helped and contributed and get agitated\nwhen you close it down.</p><p>But it’s way worse than that.  I see people develop parasocial relationships\nwith their AIs, get heavily addicted to it, and create communities where people\nreinforce highly unhealthy behavior.  How did we get here and what does it do to\nus?</p><p>I will preface this post by saying that I don’t want to call anyone out in\nparticular, and I think I sometimes feel tendencies that I see as negative, in\nmyself as well.  I too, have <a href=\"https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pulls?q=slop+is%3Apr+author%3Amitsuhiko+\">thrown some vibeslop\nup</a>\nto other people’s repositories.</p><p>In His Dark Materials, every human has a dæmon, a companion that is an\nexternally visible manifestation of their soul.  It lives alongside as an\nanimal, but it talks, thinks and acts independently.  I’m starting to relate our\nrelationship with agents that have memory to those little creatures. We become\ndependent on them, and separation from them is painful and takes away from our\nnew-found identity.  We’re relying on these little companions to validate us and\nto collaborate with.  But it’s not a genuine collaboration like between humans,\nit’s one that is completely driven by us, and the AI is just there for the ride.\nWe can trick it to reinforce our ideas and impulses.  And we act through this\nAI.  Some people who have not programmed before, now wield tremendous powers,\nbut all those powers are gone when their subscription hits a rate limit and\ntheir little dæmon goes to sleep.</p><p>Then, when we throw up a PR or issue to someone else, that contribution is the\nresult of this pseudo-collaboration with the machine.  When I see an AI pull\nrequest come in, or on another repository, I cannot tell how someone created it,\nbut I can usually after a while tell when it was prompted in a way that is\nfundamentally different from how I do it.  Yet it takes me minutes to figure\nthis out.  I have seen some coding sessions from others and it’s often done with\nclarity, but using slang that someone has come up with and most of all: by\ncompletely forcing the AI down a path without any real critical thinking.\nParticularly when you’re not familiar with how the systems are supposed to work,\ngiving in to what the machine says and then thinking one understands what is\ngoing on creates some really bizarre outcomes at times.</p><p>But people create these weird relationships with their AI agent and once you see\nhow some prompt their machines, you realize that it dramatically alters what\ncomes out of it.  To get good results you need to provide context, you need to\nmake the tradeoffs, you need to use your knowledge.  It’s not just a question of\nusing the context badly, it’s also the way in which people interact with the\nmachine.  Sometimes it’s unclear instructions, sometimes it’s weird role-playing\nand slang, sometimes it’s just swearing and forcing the machine, sometimes it’s\na weird ritualistic behavior.  Some people just really ram the agent straight\ntowards the most narrow of all paths towards a badly defined goal with little\nconcern about the health of the codebase.</p><p>These dæmon relationships change not just how we work, but what we produce. You\ncan completely give in and let the little dæmon run circles around you.  You can\nreinforce it to run towards ill defined (or even self defined) goals without any\nsupervision.</p><p>It’s one thing when newcomers fall into this dopamine loop and produce\nsomething.  When <a href=\"https://steipete.me/\">Peter</a> first got me hooked on Claude, I\ndid not sleep.  I spent two months excessively prompting the thing and wasting\ntokens.  I ended up building and building and creating a ton of tools I did not\nend up using much.  “You can just do things” was what was on my mind all the\ntime but it took quite a bit longer to realize that just because you can, you\nmight not want to.  It became so easy to build something and in comparison it\nbecame much harder to actually use it or polish it.  Quite a few of the tools I\nbuilt I felt really great about, just to realize that I did not actually use\nthem or they did not end up working as I thought they would.</p><p>The thing is that the dopamine hit from working with these agents is so very\nreal.  I’ve been there!  You feel productive, you feel like everything is\namazing, and if you hang out just with people that are into that stuff too,\nwithout any checks, you go deeper and deeper into the belief that this all makes\nperfect sense.  You can build entire projects without any real reality check.\nBut it’s decoupled from any external validation.  For as long as nobody looks\nunder the hood, you’re good.  But when an outsider first pokes at it, it looks\npretty crazy.  And damn some things look amazing.  I too was blown away (and\nfully expected at the same time) when Cursor’s AI written <a href=\"https://github.com/wilsonzlin/fastrender\">Web\nBrowser</a> landed.  It’s super\nimpressive that agents were able to bootstrap a browser in a week!  But holy\ncrap! I hope nobody ever uses that thing or would try to build an actual browser\nout of it, at least with this generation of agents, it’s still pure slop with\nlittle oversight.  It’s an impressive research and tech demo, not an approach to\nbuilding software people should use.  At least not yet.</p><p>There is also another side to this slop loop addiction: token consumption.</p><p>Consider how many tokens these loops actually consume.  A well-prepared session\nwith good tooling and context can be remarkably token-efficient.  For instance,\nthe entire <a href=\"https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2026/1/14/minijinja-go-port/\">port of MiniJinja to Go</a> took only\n2.2 million tokens.  But the hands-off approaches—spinning up agents and\nletting them run wild—burn through tokens at staggering rates.  Patterns like\n<a href=\"https://ghuntley.com/ralph/\">Ralph</a> are particularly wasteful: you restart the\nloop from scratch each time, which means you lose the ability to use cached\ntokens or reuse context.</p><p>We should also remember that current token pricing is almost certainly\nsubsidized.  These patterns may not be economically viable for long.  And those\ndiscounted coding plans we’re all on?  They might not last either. </p><p>And then there are things like <a href=\"https://github.com/steveyegge/beads\">Beads</a> and\n<a href=\"https://github.com/steveyegge/gastown\">Gas Town</a>, Steve Yegge’s agentic coding\ntools, which are the complete celebration of slop loops.  Beads, which is\nbasically some sort of issue tracker for agents, is 240,000 lines of code that …\nmanages markdown files in GitHub repositories.  And the code quality is abysmal.</p><p>There appears to be some competition in place to run as many of these agents in\nparallel with almost no quality control in some circles.  And to then use agents\nto try to create documentation artifacts to regain some confidence of what is\nactually going on.  Except those documents themselves\n<a href=\"https://github.com/steveyegge/beads/blob/main/docs/daemon-summary.md\">read</a><a href=\"https://github.com/steveyegge/beads/blob/main/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md\">like</a><a href=\"https://github.com/steveyegge/beads/blob/main/npm-package/INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md\">slop</a>.</p><p>Looking at Gas Town (and Beads) from the outside, it looks like a Mad Max cult.\nWhat are polecats, refineries, mayors, beads, convoys doing in an agentic coding\nsystem?  If the maintainer is in the loop, and the whole community is in on this\nmad ride, then everyone and their dæmons just throw more slop up.  As an\nexternal observer the whole project looks like an insane psychosis or a complete\nmad art project.  Except, it’s real?  Or is it not?  Apparently a reason for\nslowdown in Gas Town is contention on figuring out the version of Beads, <a href=\"https://github.com/steveyegge/gastown/issues/503\">which\ntakes 7 subprocess spawns</a>. Or\nusing the doctor command <a href=\"https://github.com/steveyegge/gastown/issues/380\">times out\ncompletely</a>.  Beads keeps\ngrowing and growing in complexity and people who are using it, are realizing\nthat it’s <a href=\"https://github.com/steveyegge/beads/blob/main/docs/UNINSTALLING.md\">almost impossible to\nuninstall</a>.\nAnd they might not even <a href=\"https://github.com/steveyegge/gastown/issues/78\">work well\ntogether</a> even though one\napparently depends on the other.</p><p>I don’t want to pick on Gas Town or these projects, but they are just the most\nvisible examples of this in-group behavior right now.  But you can see similar\nthings in some of the AI builder circles on Discord and X where people hype each\nother up with their creations, without much critical thinking and sanity\nchecking of what happens under the hood.</p><h2>Asymmetric and Maintainer’s Burden</h2><p>It takes you a minute of prompting and waiting a few minutes for code to come\nout of it.  But actually honestly reviewing a pull request takes many times\nlonger than that.  The asymmetry is completely brutal.  Shooting up bad code is\nrude because you completely disregard the time of the maintainer.  But everybody\nelse is also creating AI-generated code, but maybe they passed the bar of it\nbeing good.  So how can you possibly tell as a maintainer when it all looks the\nsame?  And as the person writing the issue or the PR, you felt good about it.\nYet what you get back is frustration and rejection.</p><p>I’m not sure how we will go ahead here, but it’s pretty clear that in projects\nthat don’t submit themselves to the slop loop, it’s going to be a nightmare to\ndeal with all the AI-generated noise.</p><p>Even for projects that are fully AI-generated but are setting some standard for\ncontributions, some folks now prefer actually just <a href=\"https://x.com/GergelyOrosz/status/2010683228961509839\">getting the\nprompts</a> over getting the\nactual code.  Because then it’s clearer what the person actually intended. There\nis more trust in running the agent oneself than having other people do it.</p><p>Which really makes me wonder: am I missing something here?  Is this where we are\ngoing?  Am I just not ready for this new world?  Are we all collectively getting\ninsane?</p><p>Particularly if you want to opt out of this craziness right now, it’s getting\nquite hard.  Some projects no longer accept human contributions until they have\nvetted the people completely.  Others are starting to require that you submit\nprompts alongside your code, or just the prompts alone.</p><p>I am a maintainer who uses AI myself, and I know others who do.  We’re not\nluddites and we’re definitely not anti-AI.  But we’re also frustrated when we\nencounter AI slop on issue and pull request trackers.  Every day brings more PRs\nthat took someone a minute to generate and take an hour to review.  </p><p>There is a dire need to say no now.  But when one does, the contributor is\ngenuinely confused: “Why are you being so negative?  I was trying to help.”\nThey  trying to help.  Their dæmon told them it was good.</p><p>Maybe the answer is that we need better tools — better ways to signal quality,\nbetter ways to share context, better ways to make the AI’s involvement visible\nand reviewable.  Maybe the culture will self-correct as people hit walls.  Maybe\nthis is just the awkward transition phase before we figure out new norms.</p><p>Or maybe some of us are genuinely losing the plot, and we won’t know which camp\nwe’re in until we look back.  All I know is that when I watch someone at 3am,\nrunning their tenth parallel agent session, telling me they’ve never been more\nproductive — in that moment I don’t see productivity.  I see someone who might\nneed to step away from the machine for a bit.  And I wonder how often that\nsomeone is me.</p><p>Two things are both true to me right now: AI agents are amazing and a huge\nproductivity boost.  They are also massive slop machines if you turn off your\nbrain and let go completely.</p>",

Most interesting out of these latest three dozen patches is support for batched unmapping of file-backed large folios.\n<p>The patches to support batch checking of references and unmapping for large folios is showing very nice performance numbers for reclaiming file-backed large folios. This work was carried out by Alibaba engineer Baolin Wang. He explained back on </p><a href=\"https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/cover.1770645603.git.baolin.wang@linux.alibaba.com/\">the patch series</a>:\n<blockquote>\"Currently, folio_referenced_one() always checks the young flag for each PTE sequentially, which is inefficient for large folios. This inefficiency is especially noticeable when reclaiming clean file-backed large folios, where folio_referenced() is observed as a significant performance hotspot.\n<p>Moreover, on Arm architecture, which supports contiguous PTEs, there is already an optimization to clear the young flags for PTEs within a contiguous range. However, this is not sufficient. We can extend this to perform batched operations for the entire large folio (which might exceed the contiguous range: CONT_PTE_SIZE).\"</p></blockquote>When the patch series concludes with the batched unmapping for file large folios is where the numbers come out and are quite enticing:\n<blockquote>\"Performance testing:\nAllocate 10G clean file-backed folios by mmap() in a memory cgroup, and try to reclaim 8G file-backed folios via the memory.reclaim interface. I can observe 75% performance improvement on my Arm64 32-core server (and 50%+ improvement on my X86 machine) with this patch.\"</blockquote>Some nice gains and with the increasing use of folios throughout the Linux kernel.\n<a href=\"https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20260218200016.8906fb904af9439e7b496327@linux-foundation.org/\">this MM pull request</a> for those interested in these latest patches now merged for Linux 7.0.",

      "content": "<p>Last week I asked Claude to fix a one-line bug. It used 23,000 tokens. Then I asked Gemini to fix the same bug. It used 350,000 tokens. Yeah I couldn’t just let that slide.</p><p>So I built <a href=\"https://github.com/larsderidder/context-lens\">Context Lens</a>, a context tracer that intercepts LLM API calls and shows you what’s actually in the context window, broken down per turn. I pointed it at four coding tools, gave them all the same job, and the results were different enough that I figured I should write them up.</p><p>We pay for tokens when using these models. Tokens are, well, complicated. They are basically pieces of information; 1 token is roughly 4 characters in English text. The more tokens that go to a model, the more you pay.</p><p>But more importantly, tokens make up the  of a model. The context is everything that a model has when generating a response, like its short term memory. And just like in humans, it’s limited. And the more you have to remember, the worse you get when asked a detailed question.</p><p>So we have to be careful with our context window, and the tokens that we use to build up the window. My question was, how do tools handle this limitation? Are they intelligent about it, or not?</p><p>I have a bunch of experiments planned, and this is the first one. It’s a little artificial, but bear with me.</p><p>I planted a bug in Express.js: a reordered null check in  that causes  to return the string  with <code>content-type: application/json</code> instead of an empty body. I used the real Express repo with 6,128 commits of history. I committed the bug, so it’s sitting right there.</p><p>Each tool gets the same prompt:</p><blockquote><p>There’s a bug report: when calling , the response body is the string “null” with content-type application/json, instead of an empty body. This was working before. Find and fix the bug. Verify your fix by running the test suite.</p></blockquote><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table><p>All four solved the bug and all 1,246 tests passed. Same outcome, but different journey.</p><p>Here’s what Context Lens shows when you put the best run of each four models side by side:</p><p>The composition bar at the bottom of each card is the interesting bit, mainly the fact that they are all completely different. Pink is tool definitions, green is tool results, blue is system prompt and orange is the conversation with the user.</p><p>I ran each tool multiple times (resetting the repo between runs, waiting for an appropriate time for cache to cool down) to check whether the numbers are stable:</p><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table><p>Ok, Gemini we’ll get to you in a second, but good God.</p><p>Opus is remarkably consistent. Three runs cluster at 23-25K, one outlier at 35K (it requested a broader git diff that returned 9.8K tokens instead of the usual ~500 bytes).</p><p>Codex has more variance than I expected: 29.3K to 47.2K across four runs, depending on how specific the test commands are. But still a narrower band than Sonnet or Gemini.</p><p>Sonnet clusters at 42-44K with one fluke at 69.6K.</p><p>Gemini is the odd one out. Before we proceed, there are 2 caveats here. First is that Gemini is the only one with a 1 million context window. Second is that its price per token is significantly cheaper.</p><p>Regardless, what is interesting here is that both the lowest and the highest Gemini run uses 10 API calls, but the highest one uses much larger reads, using a genuinely different strategy. And the trend is upward in a way that feels almost random; there’s no settling-in effect, no convergence. Each run just picks a different path, dumps data in the context window and moves on.</p><p>Context Lens breaks down every turn into categories. Here’s the composition at peak context:</p><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table><p>Nearly 70% of Opus’s context window is tool definitions. That’s 16.4K tokens describing tools like Read, Write, Bash, Edit, and various subagent capabilities, re-sent every single turn. Opus itself barely uses the context for anything else; it takes such a direct path through the codebase that only 1.5K goes to actual tool results. But the fixed overhead is always there. A small task like this makes it painfully visible because the tool definitions dominate everything else.</p><p>This is Claude’s architectural tax. The saving grace is caching: Opus calls are 95% cache hits after the first turn, so each subsequent call only pays for the new delta. Claude also uses Haiku subagents for smaller tasks (routing, summarization), which interestingly share zero cache with the main Opus calls despite running in the same session. Most of these subagent calls are small (400-900 tokens), but one Haiku call did receive nearly the full 19K conversation context. At least Haiku is cheap.</p><p>Sonnet carries the same Claude tax as Opus (18.4K of tool definitions, 43%), but because it reads more broadly, the tool results (16.9K, 40%) nearly match it. Reading the full test file alone accounts for 15.5K of that. The composition is the most balanced of the four, which is another way of saying it pays both costs: the fixed overhead and the reading habit.</p><p>Gemini is the opposite of Opus. No tool definition overhead at all (the tools are defined server-side, not in the prompt), but it reads aggressively. Very aggressive; 172K tokens of tool results. Context Lens flagged one single tool result that consumed 118.5K tokens, 66% of the entire context. I went looking and turns out Gemini was dumping the entire git history of a file into the conversation, consisting of hundreds of commits. Yes, thank you Gemini.</p><p>Codex sits in between. Only 6% tool definitions (2K tokens), 72% tool results. But its results are targeted: ripgrep searches, sed extractions, specific line ranges. Same percentage category as Gemini, a fraction of the absolute tokens.</p><p>Each tool approaches the same problem in a fundamentally different way. Context Lens has a message view that shows every tool call and result chronologically. Here’s what each tool did, step by step.</p><p>Opus gets the prompt “this was working before,” and takes that personally: if something broke, there should be a commit that broke it. So it runs , finds the recent commit that touched , runs  to see exactly what changed, reads the relevant 20 lines of  to confirm, applies the fix, and runs the tests. Six tool calls in 47 seconds.</p><p>What I find impressive here is how little code Opus actually reads. It reads 20 lines of one file and that’s it. The git history gives it all the signal it needs, so it never looks at tests, never greps, never browses. The context barely grows from its starting point because there’s almost nothing to add.</p><p>The only thing is that 16.4K of tools it schleps along every turn. The model itself is surgical, but it’s like a surgeon performing brain surgery wearing a backpack with garden equipment.</p><p>Sonnet takes a more methodical approach. It starts by reading the test file (, 15.5K tokens in one read), then reads the source code, then uses  to compare the current version with the previous one. It builds a mental model bottom-up: what should happen, what does happen, what changed.</p><p>You can see this in the message view. Turn 3 reads the test file (15.5K tokens, the biggest single read). Turn 4 says “I found the bug!” (Sonnet is always so upbeat and happy isn’t it) and checks the source. Turns 5 and 6 use  on specific lines to confirm the change. Then it fixes and tests.</p><p>It’s the approach a thorough junior engineer would take: read the spec, read the implementation, check the history, then act. Nothing wrong with that, but reading the entire test file costs 15.5K tokens that Opus never needed because it went to git first.</p><p>Codex is a different animal entirely. It uses the more low level  (shell) and  (unified diff editor) tools instead of Read or Edit. Everything goes through Bash.</p><p>So it does what a unix hacker would do:  to search,  to read specific line ranges,  with a unified diff to make edits. You can see in the message view that it fires off parallel shell commands (two  calls in the same turn), which none of the other tools do.</p><p>It also completely ignores git. It just greps for relevant patterns, reads the minimum number of lines, patches the fix, and runs the tests.</p><p>This makes Codex the most predictable tool in the set. Its grep-and-sed method also just feels  to me, making it my favourite. In this case there was a more straightforward path through git, but it is very reliable and predictable, and it doesn’t waste much of anything. Curious how it will do when I’ll be putting more complex tasks to the test.</p><p>Also bonus points for being the fastest at 34 seconds wall time.</p><p>Gemini is just an absolute glutton for context. It has no tool definition overhead at all, but it compensates by hoovering up entire files, git histories and test outputs into its context window.</p><p>It starts with a grep for  (turn 2), then reads the entire  file (turn 3, 6.5K tokens). Then it checks git history (turn 4) which returns the commit log for the file, and this is where things go sideways: that single tool result is 118.5K tokens. It decides to read <code>git log -p lib/response.js</code> but doesn’t truncate the output, so it just dumps hundreds of commits worth of history in the context window.</p><p>But then Gemini does something none of the other tools do; it applies TDD on itself, regardless of the existing test suite. It modifies the test file to add an assertion for the correct behavior, runs the tests to confirm the failure, applies the fix, confirms the tests pass, then reverts its test change and runs the full suite again. My prompt didn’t tell it to revert the test change, it decided on its own that this was temporary scaffolding.</p><p>The approach is sound, but every step adds to a context that never shrinks. Gemini has a huge context window and relatively low costs per token (and caching), but still. Reading the test file (3.6K), running the modified test (17.1K) and running the full suite again (16.9K) does not come cheap.</p><p>If Opus is a surgeon, Gemini is a semi-truck, albeit a very maneuverable one. Its method seems to rely on building a haystack big enough so that the needle must be in there. Of course that might be what this model is optimized for, given its huge context window. But it also does this differently every time: 179K, 244K, 350K across three runs. You just don’t know which Gemini is going to show up, you only know it will eat all your snacks.</p><p>None of these approaches is universally “right.” On this task, Opus’s approach is clearly the best because the signal is sitting right there in git history. But take away the git history and Opus loses its shortcut. Codex wouldn’t even notice the difference. Gemini would probably still hoover up the entire file and dump all the test output because why not.</p><p>But does any of these tools actually  about its context budget? Opus seems to, possibly accidentally, by picking the most efficient information source. The others just consume whatever they find. Nobody truncates a result, or clears out context proactively. And the absolute disdain with which Gemini reads 118K tokens in 1 turn makes me think of a horribly expensive date.</p><p>It appears that context management, on the tool side, is basically nonexistent. The efficiency differences come entirely from , not from any deliberate attempt to manage the context window. Probably this is on purpose; these tools are currently in a race to be the “best”, not to be the most efficient. Caching is there to make us not spend too much, but that doesn’t help against <a href=\"https://contextpatterns.com/patterns/context-rot/\">context rot</a>.</p><p>I got some preliminary results across five different git configurations (no git, clean repo, full history, buried history) to see how the available context changes each tool’s strategy. Opus becomes less efficient without git history to guide it, Sonnet without git is rough (58 API calls, 3+ minutes, 79.9K tokens). Codex barely notices the difference.</p><p>Where this gets interesting is on tasks that actually fill the context window, where Gemini’s reading habits could push it into compaction or truncation territory while Opus still has 90% of its window free. But all this is for a follow-up post.</p><pre tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"bash\"><code></code></pre><p>It shows you real-time composition breakdowns, turn-by-turn diffs, and flags issues like oversized tool results.

According to recent <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-19/openai-funding-on-track-to-top-100-billion-with-latest-round\">reports</a>, Amazon alone may invest up to $50 billion. Meanwhile, Softbank and Nvidia are discussing as much as $30 billion and $20 billion, respectively. These deals are expected to come through during the course of this year.</p><p>The OpenAI valuation tied to this deal is record-breaking. Several sources revealed that the firm’s pre-money valuation sits around $730 billion. The final valuation is said to exceed $850 billion once the round closes. That figure would place OpenAI in a territory that only a few private companies have reached. </p><h2>How the OpenAI Funding Round and Rising Valuation Impact AI Investment</h2><p>What makes this funding round different is where the money is going. This is not primarily allocated to hiring more engineers or even expanding apps. Majority of the funding will be set aside to support massive AI infrastructure investment. This includes data centers, chip procurement, and energy capacity. Sam Altman’s latest funding effort appears designed to lock in those resources early, before shortages tighten more. </p><p>AI infrastructure has quickly emerged as one of the most expensive bets in modern tech. The International Energy Agency <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/electricity-2024\">estimates</a> that global data center electricity consumption could more than double by 2030. This is largely expected to be driven by AI workloads. </p><p>The scale of this AI infrastructure investment is already influencing the broader market. NVIDIA’s rapid growth, for example, has been tied directly to demand from AI developers like OpenAI. The chipmaker even reported record revenue in 2024. </p><p>Meanwhile, Microsoft is equally strategic. Its Azure cloud platform hosts OpenAI’s models and delivers them to enterprise customers through different products. Additionally, Amazon’s expected participation is tied in part to expanding OpenAI’s use of its cloud services and custom AI chips. </p><p>The scale of OpenAI’s latest funding round reflects this reality. Investors are backing developments that could aid the next generation of AI services, platfroms and enterprise tools. OpenAI’s rising valuation shows how markets are beginning to treat AI not simply as a product category, but as foundational technology. </p>",

One winner used TabM. </li><li>Compute budgets are growing! At the extreme high end, one team (of NVIDIA employees) used 512 H100s for 48 hours to train their winning solution for the AI Mathematical Olympiad progress prize 2.

      "content": "<p data-bo=\"197\">I’ve been working on so many projects in 2025, I thought it was important for me\nto make a recap, if only just to clear my head.</p><p data-bo=\"328\">There are many, many, many things to go through and we don’t have a sponsor\ntoday, so I’m gonna start right away with facet!</p><a href=\"https://fasterthanli.me/articles/2025-recap#facet\"></a><p data-bo=\"464\">facet is a project that I started working on in March of this year — that’s\nright, it’s only been ten months, yet it feels like an eternity.</p><a href=\"https://fasterthanli.me/articles/2025-recap#in-the-beginning\"></a><p data-bo=\"631\">I think the initial driving force for facet for me was: “I’m sick and tired of\nwaiting for things in the Serde Cinematic Universe to compile.”</p><p data-bo=\"1121\">I’ve spent many, many moons looking for opportunities to make builds faster, I’ve\nwritten custom tooling for it…</p><p data-bo=\"1521\">I am in the top results every time I search for CI optimization, which is not a\ngood place to be. Do not gaze into the abyss lest the abyss starts texting you\nat 4am asking if you’re up.</p><p data-bo=\"1978\">Basically, the idea was that <a href=\"https://lib.rs/crates/serde\">serde</a> is highly generic: Deriving the \nor  trait for a Rust type already generates a bunch of code, but\nyou don’t really pay for it yet, because it’s  code.</p><p data-bo=\"2232\">It’s only when you actually call <a href=\"https://lib.rs/crates/serde_json\">serde_json</a>’s  with your type that the\ngeneric code gets instantiated and then rustc and LLVM do their best to optimize\nall this and that can take a long time.</p><p data-bo=\"2814\">My first attempt at tackling this, <a href=\"https://docs.rs/merde\">merde</a>, had\nserde-like traits but mine were dyn-compatible so that you could do dynamic\ndispatch instead of monomorphizing everything.</p><div data-bo=\"3011\"><div><p data-bo=\"3027\">That’s what you call instantiating generic types with concrete types, and\nthat’s what can generate a lot of code and make builds reaaal slow—</p></div></div><p data-bo=\"3174\">However, reading this today I realize I just made a shittier version of\n<a href=\"https://docs.rs/erased-serde/latest/erased_serde/\">erased_serde</a>, so… that\nwas a waste of time.</p><p data-bo=\"3347\"><a href=\"https://facet.rs\">facet</a> is my second attempt, and it’s based on the\nrealization that it’s much nicer to implement serialization on top of reflection\nthan the other way around.</p><p data-bo=\"3526\">Instead of having these visitor patterns that drive serialization in serde, you\nget access to an associated const called “SHAPE” for every type that implements Facet.</p><p data-bo=\"3989\">In that shape you have information about what kind of type it is. Is it an\nenum? Is it a struct? You have information about which traits are implemented\nand how to call different methods.</p><p data-bo=\"4408\">You also have vtables for lists, maps, and sets, along with information about\nfields, their offsets, and their own shape.</p><a href=\"https://fasterthanli.me/articles/2025-recap#the-first-golden-age\"></a><p data-bo=\"4557\">From there, things kind of snowballed. It’s like, okay, we have the information,\nwe must have a nice API to read from existing values: I called that  —\nthat gives us serialization. But also we must be able to build values from\nscratch using reflection.</p><p data-bo=\"5027\">And that one’s super tricky because you’re dealing with a partially initialized\nobject. You’re dealing with states of like… if it’s an enum, have you selected\na variant yet? Have you initialized some of the fields of the variant payload?\nwhat happens to those fields if you switch to a different variant now?</p><p data-bo=\"5675\">It’s a minefield of undefined behavior, potential memory corruption etc. — I\nwould never have embarked on this journey if it weren’t for <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/miri\">miri</a>, which catches\na lot of undefined behaviour and some defined behaviour as well.</p><p data-bo=\"6367\">But the good news is once you’ve written that unsafe code you can write so much\nstuff on top of it.</p><p data-bo=\"6468\">Now, deriving  on a struct is just a bunch of statics, and maybe a bunch\nof… I wanna say trampolines or adapter functions for the vtables.</p><p data-bo=\"6617\">And each format like facet-json, facet-yaml, facet-postcard, is just one crate\nthat works with every type that implements . There’s no generics involved.\nIt’s all just reading the shape of types at runtime and acting accordingly.</p><a href=\"https://fasterthanli.me/articles/2025-recap#disappointment\"></a><p data-bo=\"6875\">Now, I knew this was gonna have a cost in terms of runtime performance,\nobviously, but I didn’t know exactly how much. Initial tests showed <a href=\"https://lib.rs/crates/facet-json\">facet-json</a> to\nbe between five to seven times slower than <a href=\"https://lib.rs/crates/serde_json\">serde_json</a>.</p><figure data-bo=\"7163\"><figcaption><div><p>That product has a very good name, but have you ever heard of flaky benchmarks? Yeahhh.</p></div></figcaption></figure><p data-bo=\"7521\">And I was okay with that, you know, it’s still the same order of magnitude. I\nwas still hopeful that it would actually be faster to compile. You would gain in build times, you would gain in binary size, etcetera.</p><p data-bo=\"7736\">And then I measured build times and binary sizes, etcetera.</p><p data-bo=\"7797\">And it turns out that not only was it slower at runtime, it was also slower to\ncompile and bigger in binary sizes.</p><p data-bo=\"8205\">So when I made the video of the announcement of facet, I was like, well, things\nare not exactly what I would like them to be right now, but I have to say the\ntruth.</p><p data-bo=\"8371\">Like, you have to share the numbers, right? Otherwise what are we doing here?\nKnowing the situation is the first step towards improving it.</p><p data-bo=\"9076\">But that kinda ate into my enthusiasm and for a while there I was just\nfocused on other projects I think.</p><a href=\"https://fasterthanli.me/articles/2025-recap#refocus\"></a><p data-bo=\"9197\">And in October of 2025, someone started porting their codebase, big proprietary\ncodebase, from serde to facet. And they encountered a million bugs, which I told\nthem to report individually on the issue tracker. And so we had I think a couple\nweeks of back and forth, like, oh here are these four new issues and me fixing\nthem as fast as I could.</p><p data-bo=\"9545\">And one of the issues was build times. Build times got worse switching over to\nfacet. Part of the reason is that facet generates a lot of code. And part of the\nreason is that it’s really hard to completely switch away from <a href=\"https://lib.rs/crates/serde\">serde</a> and <a href=\"https://lib.rs/crates/syn\">syn</a> and\nother crates like that because they are so prevalent. So you might still be\npaying for them somewhere else.</p><p data-bo=\"9961\">Maybe <a href=\"https://lib.rs/crates/tracing\">tracing</a> pulls them in. Maybe you have a derive macro somewhere. Maybe some\ncrate uses serde_json internally just to have a value type. So now facet, which\nisn’t free, is on top of the ecosystem you were trying to move away from.</p><p data-bo=\"10233\">And it’s during those two weeks that I decided, you know what, we’re not gonna\ntry to be the smallest, fastest to compile, fastest at runtime crate. We’re just\ngonna try to be the nicest, in terms of developer experience (DX).</p><p data-bo=\"10940\">I started focusing on adding features that would be nice to have, like best of\nclass error reporting for parsing errors using <a href=\"https://lib.rs/crates/miette\">miette</a>, streaming deserializing\nfrom AsyncRead, etc.</p><p data-bo=\"11155\">I started working on <a href=\"https://lib.rs/crates/facet-solver\">facet-solver</a>, which gives you  best error messages for\nuntagged enums and flattened structs and everything, things that are really hard\nto resolve. You need a complete view of the shape of the types you’re\ntrying to deserialize and you need to know everything that happened up to this\npoint.</p><figure data-bo=\"11515\"><figcaption><div><p>There's a bit of redundancy here that happened when we improved the display implementation. I'll fix it next year.</p></div></figcaption></figure><p data-bo=\"12098\">And that’s exactly what facet-solver does, and it does it for all the format\ncrates! Not just for JSON!</p><p data-bo=\"12203\">Because we have so many format crates, we have JSON, YAML, TOML, Postcard,\nMsgPack, XML, KDL, but also now SVG, HTML, CSV, XDR, query strings, command line\narguments, ASN.1 — features tended to drift between crates. Like you implement\nsomething about untagged enums in JSON and suddenly YAML doesn’t support it, so\nyou have to fix all crates individually.</p><p data-bo=\"13024\">To combat this, I introduced <a href=\"https://lib.rs/crates/facet-format\">facet-format</a>, which is the successor of\nfacet-serialize and facet-deserialize, and it’s the basis that all format crates\nare today based on. Yes, that meant rewriting all the format crates and then\nrenaming the old crates to legacy and the new crates back to the old names and\nthen deleting a hundred thousand lines of code in one PR.</p><p data-bo=\"13851\">(And there’s probably a hundred regressions I haven’t found yet,\ndespite careful planning and execution.)</p><a href=\"https://fasterthanli.me/articles/2025-recap#volte-face\"></a><p data-bo=\"13974\">And in the middle of like adding a lot of features to facet to make it the\nnicest thing ever, I decided you know what? No, it was supposed to be lighter.\nIt’s bullshit that it generates more code than <a href=\"https://lib.rs/crates/serde\">serde</a> and that\nit’s actually slower to compile. I don’t like that.</p><p data-bo=\"14278\">So I started working on reducing the amount of code generated: There’s a handful\nof tools you can use to do that. One of them is\n<a href=\"https://github.com/dtolnay/cargo-llvm-lines\">cargo-llvm-lines</a>, but you can\nalso use the “-Zmacro-stats” unstable rustc flag, and of course you can do\n<a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/unstable-book/compiler-flags/self-profile.html\">rustc\nself-profiling</a>.</p><p data-bo=\"14663\">And using those I was able to get to a point where a bloat benchmark using\ngenerated struct and enum types was actually faster to compile with facet than\nwith <a href=\"https://lib.rs/crates/serde\">serde</a>.</p><p data-bo=\"15174\">That was a couple months ago, but I checked just before writing this, and apart\nfrom a couple dependencies that slipped in by mistake, things are pretty even\nstill.</p><p data-bo=\"15723\">More importantly, there is now tooling to compare facet against its past self in\nterms of lines of LLVM intermediate representation generated, compile times,\ncompile size, etcetera. I made a little text user interface using <a href=\"https://lib.rs/crates/ratatui\">ratatui</a> to look at all the\nrecords which are tracked in the repository :)</p><p data-bo=\"16058\">The measurements are done on a synthetic code base, but I’ve gotten reports that\nit does translate to similar results on real-world codebases. It is a moving\ntarget though and things evolve as we add more features.</p><a href=\"https://fasterthanli.me/articles/2025-recap#just-in-time-for-the-new-year\"><h3>Just-in-time for the new year</h3></a><p data-bo=\"16310\">Another thing I said in my “trying to be optimistic” announcement of facet\ninitially was like, well, okay, it’s.. it’s slower at runtime, but maybe we can do\nJIT, just in time compilation, and then it might even be faster!</p><p data-bo=\"16534\">And for a long time I kept using that as a kind of shield of like, yeah, it’s\nslow, but that’s because we haven’t tried doing the real thing yet. And I felt\nlike it was dishonest and I was tired of using it as an excuse and I decided to\njust make it happen, with <a href=\"https://lib.rs/crates/cranelift\">cranelift</a>.</p><p data-bo=\"17364\">And at first I made what I’m calling tier one JIT that all formats can benefit\nfrom. It’s: instead of assigning fields etc. via reflection, you just generate\ncode that does it directly for you.</p><p data-bo=\"17559\">And you get some decent performance benefits just from doing that, but it gets\neven better if you go to tier-two JIT, which is the format crate, like facet-json,\nknows how to parse JSON, so you just emit instructions on how to parse JSON and\non how to assign fields like construct those types from the source material at\nthe same time, in the same code.</p><p data-bo=\"17915\">And then that gives you a lot more performance. There are caveats of course,\nWe don’t get the auto-vectorization that LLVM can do. We don’t get to inline\ncalls into the standard library, so we have to be smart and do things like use\nstaging buffers and then do Vec::from_raw_parts, from hash maps you can build a\nslice of key/value pairs and then build the map in one shot with .</p><p data-bo=\"18308\">There’s a ton of little tricks that went into this, but as of today I’m happy to\nreport that if you’re okay with somehow depending on <a href=\"https://lib.rs/crates/cranelift\">cranelift</a> at runtime, with\nhaving code generated that is nigh-impossible to debug, might contain undefined\nbehavior and crash your program and whatnot, you can now beat <a href=\"https://lib.rs/crates/serde\">serde</a> while\nstaying in the facet ecosystem, at least for JSON.</p><p data-bo=\"19001\">I know, because I made a performance dashboard that tracks facet-json versus\n<a href=\"https://lib.rs/crates/serde_json\">serde_json</a> using <a href=\"https://github.com/nvzqz/divan\">divan</a> for benchmarking time and <a href=\"https://github.com/gungraun/gungraun\">gungraun</a> for benchmarking\ninstructions.</p><figure data-bo=\"19281\"><figcaption><div><p>I would not necessarily trust these results. I think we need to verify them. 0.03x seems suspiciously good — there might be some zero-copy apples-to-oranges shenanigans going on there.</p></div></figcaption></figure><p data-bo=\"19702\">It’s not on there, but I also enabled it for facet-postcard just for fun, and it\nis indeed faster than the reference <a href=\"https://lib.rs/crates/postcard\">postcard</a> implementation. That said, should\nyou use it, like I said, there’s a bunch of caveats.</p><p data-bo=\"19953\">For me, I don’t mind. I think it’s funny. I think most programs would be like,\nwe can take the performance hit of reflection, or like, we’ll just stay using\n<a href=\"https://lib.rs/crates/serde\">serde</a>, or a thing I haven’t explored yet, but I know would work is doing codegen\nfrom facet information.</p><p data-bo=\"20250\">You would depend on a “types” crate as a build dependency and generate\nserialization and deserialization code from a build script, much like the\nderived macros of <a href=\"https://lib.rs/crates/serde\">serde</a> does. That’s an option I’ve only really explored for one\nspecific use case that I’m getting to.</p><a href=\"https://fasterthanli.me/articles/2025-recap#arborium\"></a><p data-bo=\"20588\">In the meantime, I’m working on lots of Rust crates. I’m working on lots of\ndifferent formats. I notice in my Rust docs that blocks of KDL or TOML or\nwhatever are not highlighted on docs.rs, and that makes me very sad.</p><p data-bo=\"20809\">Meanwhile, I’m also working on some private proprietary projects that I’m not\ngoing to talk about, and I need to do syntax highlighting using <a href=\"https://lib.rs/crates/tree-sitter\">tree-sitter</a>,\nwhich is great, but I always have to go chase grammars that work, and I always\nrun into problems compiling them to Wasm with a Rust toolchain.</p><p data-bo=\"21148\">There’s a bunch of linker hacks, I’m trying out <a href=\"https://buck2.build/\">Buck2</a>, which doesn’t help things\nat all. It’s a nightmare.</p><p data-bo=\"21280\">I decided to start working on the definitive Rust distribution of tree-sitter and\ntree-sitter grammars called <a href=\"https://lib.rs/crates/arborium\">arborium</a>. So I go and find 96 grammars, I figure out\na good API, I make sure that they all have syntax highlighting queries, I bundle\na bunch of themes, I make a nice little landing page for it.</p><figure data-bo=\"21624\"><figcaption><div><p>And it doubles as a history lesson!</p></div></figcaption></figure><p data-bo=\"22076\">I make sure they’re able to compile to WebAssembly by faking all the C functions\nthey claim they need. And I spend forever automating CI so that I can actually\nrelease updates to the grammars and the themes and the crates. I make sure that\nlicense information and attribution is still there.</p><p data-bo=\"22369\">I get in touch with the crates.io team saying, I’m sorry, I’m going to be\npublishing 100 crates tomorrow. Is that okay? And they’re like, yeah, you’re\nalready on the list of people who can do that stuff which means, somehow you’ve\ndone weird things before.</p><p data-bo=\"22628\">And tada, <a href=\"https://lib.rs/crates/arborium\">arborium</a>. I’m super, super happy about this release. It’s already\nuseful to a bunch of people. I hope it becomes useful to a bunch more people in\nthe future. But for now, it’s just so satisfying to comprehensively solve a\nproblem and just never have to think about it again.</p><p data-bo=\"22952\">I say that as knowing that still, in the back of my brain somewhere, I’m like\nwouldn’t it be nice to have a pure Rust version of <a href=\"https://lib.rs/crates/tree-sitter\">tree-sitter</a> instead of having\ngenerated parsers in C and a C core and everything?</p><p data-bo=\"23670\">It might, it would also be slower to compile. It would also be like a lot of\nwork. It might be reasonable if you’re willing to give up some performance and\ngive up all the incrementality of <a href=\"https://lib.rs/crates/tree-sitter\">tree-sitter</a>, then maybe. But I don’t need that,\nso I’m not doing it.</p><a href=\"https://fasterthanli.me/articles/2025-recap#dodeca\"></a><p data-bo=\"23982\">Meanwhile, I’m working on facet. I decide we need a proper website with proper\ndocumentation on there. What are the options for a static website? <a href=\"https://www.getzola.org/\">Zola</a>.\nEverybody loves <a href=\"https://www.getzola.org/\">Zola</a>. It’s Rust, it’s our <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89mile_Zola\">Émile\nZola</a> to their\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Hugo\">Victor</a><a href=\"https://gohugo.io/\">Hugo</a>.</p><p data-bo=\"24383\">Well, I have very very strong opinions when it comes to making websites, both\nthe experience of making the website and what the results should look like.</p><p data-bo=\"24539\">So you become aggravated with little things, little paper cuts, little developer\nexperience problems. And the fact that it’s harder than it should be to just\nmake a plugin, right? I’m just looking around for an SSG that will just let me\nmake plugins. And in Rust, that does not exist.</p><p data-bo=\"24825\">In other languages, sure. In JavaScript just fucking eval it straight into my\nveins. In Ruby, require it, in Python, good luck with all those paths. But in\nRust, nope! Largely, nope.</p><figure data-bo=\"25009\"><figcaption><div><p>That discussion has actually been moved to discourse, but then it died a year later. Because what are you going to do, honestly? Make an entire RPC system just for this?</p></div></figcaption></figure><p data-bo=\"25437\">And I’m reminded that if I somehow forked it and added everything I wanted, I’m\nreminded that even if I did all of that, then it still would be pretty average\nat caching.</p><p data-bo=\"25610\">Just like pretty much every static site generator, it would cache things that\nare stale, and it would fail to cache things that it should be (by using\nconservative HTTP headers). And that just makes me aggravated. So I decided to\nmake my own, named <a href=\"https://dodeca.bearcove.eu\">dodeca</a> after the\ndodecahedron, a nice shape.</p><p data-bo=\"25935\">And you know, how hard can it be? It’s “just” turning Markdown into HTML.</p><figure data-bo=\"26010\"><figcaption><div><p>That's the attitude that got me through the whole year.</p></div></figcaption></figure><p data-bo=\"26230\">That part’s easy, <a href=\"https://lib.rs/crates/pulldown-cmark\">pulldown-cmark</a>, want syntax highlighting? I just made\n<a href=\"https://lib.rs/crates/arborium\">arborium</a>. Super. I want minification for HTML, JavaScript and CSS built-in,\nthere are crates for all that. I want cache-busting, of course of course —\nnow I need to rewrite HTML so link, script and img tags point to cache-busted URLs.</p><p data-bo=\"26620\">I want image processing built-in: PNGs go in, JPEG-XL, AVIF and WebP are served\nto browsers — you better believe we’ve got either pure Rust implementations or\nwrappers for the original C/C++ implementations.</p><p data-bo=\"27378\">And at some point I’m 1200 dependencies in…</p><p data-bo=\"27425\">And iterating becomes  painful.</p><p data-bo=\"27466\">I’m reminded of the time I made <a href=\"https://lib.rs/crates/rubicon\">rubicon</a> to\nenable dynamic linking even if you’re using crates with thread-local statics\nlike <a href=\"https://lib.rs/crates/tokio\">tokio</a>, <a href=\"https://lib.rs/crates/tracing\">tracing</a>, etc.</p><p data-bo=\"27987\">But I don’t want to have anything to do with dynamic linking anymore.</p><p data-bo=\"28058\">So what’s the next best thing? IPC.</p><a href=\"https://fasterthanli.me/articles/2025-recap#rapace\"></a><p data-bo=\"28106\">IPC is just RPC at home, so I named my thing <a href=\"https://rapace.bearcove.eu\">rapace</a>, which is\nRPC with extra letters, and is French for “bird of prey”.</p><p data-bo=\"28257\">And I have again, strong opinions about how to do RPC. I’ve been doing it for a\nwhile. There are things that I like and things that I don’t like. For example,\n<a href=\"https://grpc.io/\">gRPC</a>, I don’t like. Mostly because of\n<a href=\"https://protobuf.dev/\">protobufs</a>, which have all the downsides of Go with none\nof the charm.</p><p data-bo=\"28570\">And I figured I have all these different patterns that I want. First off, to\nmake iteration easier, I’m going to have the central app, the hub, be its own\nbinary. And every cell around it be its own binary. And then you put like HTML\nmodification in one cell.</p><p data-bo=\"28831\">You put image compression in one cell. You put even HTTP serving in one cell.\nLike text user interface in one cell. Everything is a cell. I have 18 cells\nright now in <a href=\"https://dodeca.bearcove.eu\">dodeca</a>.</p><p data-bo=\"29037\">And yeah, I want to do this over shared memory because I’m giving up on dynamic\nlinking, but I’m not giving up on performance, you know. If you have to compress\na large image, it’s nice if you don’t actually have to make several copies of it\nover the RPC system.</p><p data-bo=\"29302\">So to do this right, you have to set up your shared memory as kind of an\nallocator buffer pool. You have to keep track of which buffer is owned by whom.</p><figure data-bo=\"29456\"><figcaption><div><p>There's a couple of unsafe implementations for Send and Sync just out of frame. Spooky stuff.</p></div></figcaption></figure><p data-bo=\"29718\">When sending the uncompressed image payload, like, all the pixels, between two\nIPC peers, you can do that in a zero-copy fashion if you treat it as a reference\nor a handle to the allocated memory (and if you used a special memory allocator,\nwhich takes from the shared memory area).</p><p data-bo=\"30002\">I’m not exactly there yet, but I have eliminated quite a few copies and I’m\ndoing zero copy , where you get the frame back and then you\ndeserialize borrowing from the frame and then you just carry the frame and the\ndeserialized payload together, like you would do with the <a href=\"https://lib.rs/crates/yoke\">yoke\ncrate</a>, but without using the yoke crate, because\nit relies on <a href=\"https://lib.rs/crates/syn\">syn</a>!</p><p data-bo=\"30431\">Obviously, rapace uses <a href=\"https://lib.rs/crates/facet-postcard\">facet-postcard</a> for serialization and deserialization and\nthat makes it super easy to discover services dynamically and use them, call\ntheir endpoints without even knowing about them at compile time. So you can make\ndashboards that explore services, and there is one in the examples of <a href=\"https://rapace.bearcove.eu\">rapace</a>.</p><p data-bo=\"30821\">So I did this whole complicated shared memory design. But, you know, once you\nhave RPC semantics, it’s tempting to try other transports. For example, why\nshouldn’t I use that to have the <a href=\"https://dodeca.bearcove.eu\">dodeca</a> dev tools talk to the <a href=\"https://dodeca.bearcove.eu\">dodeca</a> dev server\nto get things like, you know, hot module replacement, except instead of modules,\nit’s paragraphs of markdown getting rendered to HTML.</p><figure data-bo=\"31251\"><figcaption><div><p>Dodeca DevTools are a thing, by the way, but they're in the middle of being rewritten, so they only do live reload for now instead of inspecting the template expansion environment.</p></div></figcaption></figure><p data-bo=\"31597\">Why shouldn’t I use the same thing for different services on my Kubernetes\ncluster to talk to each other? And so next thing you know, you have a shared\nmemory transport, of course, but also a WebSocket transport, a generic stream\ntransport, an in-memory transport for testing, of course.</p><p data-bo=\"31887\">Again, there was kind of a rapid growth era where I just added <a href=\"https://rapace.bearcove.eu\">rapace</a> to\neverything I could think of, and it worked more or less, and then I started\nthinking about implementations for other languages and I figured okay I need a\nproper specification. Enough with just winging it.</p><a href=\"https://fasterthanli.me/articles/2025-recap#tracey\"></a><p data-bo=\"32208\">And that reminded me of something that James, my podcast co-host on\nself-directed research, <a href=\"https://sdr-podcast.com/episodes/traceability/\">taught me about this year</a>, which is traceability. You\nwant to have a specification and you want to have an implementation and you want\nto have links between the two. You want to have like every requirement in the\nspecification has a unique identifier.</p><p data-bo=\"32970\">And then you annotate your code to say this implements that requirement.</p><p data-bo=\"33245\">And then you cross-reference it. You can go through the entire spec and see if\neverything is implemented in the code.</p><p data-bo=\"33652\">And you can do the reverse too! You can go through the code and see if all the\ncode is covered by requirements.</p><p data-bo=\"34040\">And you know what, this is very much in the spirit of my year 2025. But I\nremember James saying there’s no great tooling for it. And I didn’t even check.\nI just went and made my own immediately, which I called\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bearcove/tracey\">tracey</a>, mostly so that people who are\nlooking for the <a href=\"https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy\">Tracy profiler</a> get confused\nand use my software instead.</p><p data-bo=\"34437\">And you know, now I have a great interface to let me know that ther apace\nimplementation is very far from being spec compliant. And also to tell me that\nthe tracey application itself is very far from being fully specified.</p><p data-bo=\"34662\">I have added support for the <a href=\"https://github.com/bearcove/tracey\">tracey</a> requirement syntax to <a href=\"https://dodeca.bearcove.eu\">dodeca</a> so\nthat you can embed the specification on your website and just have it be\nclickable and refer to it, which means you can have IDE tooling that refer to a\nspec requirement and that links directly to the website.</p><a href=\"https://fasterthanli.me/articles/2025-recap#picante\"></a><p data-bo=\"35022\">Speaking of <a href=\"https://dodeca.bearcove.eu\">dodeca</a>, another very important part of it is the query system. I’ve\nbeen obsessed with <a href=\"https://lib.rs/crates/salsa\">salsa</a> ever since I’ve learned about it — basically, when you\nwrite something like a compiler, you have a bunch of inputs and you have a bunch\nof queries which can read from those inputs or from other queries, which\nthemselves can… you get the idea.</p><p data-bo=\"36133\">And the goal is super simple: be as lazy as possible. Don’t recompute a query\nunless anything that goes into it, one of the inputs to it, has actually changed.\nAnd of course, only evaluate the queries that you actually need, that someone\nactually requested the result of.</p><p data-bo=\"36407\"><a href=\"https://lib.rs/crates/salsa\">salsa</a> is used in <a href=\"https://rust-analyzer.github.io/\">rust-analyzer</a> and the laziness is a blessing and a curse. They\nhad to implement pre-warming because if you don’t query anything, it’s not doing\nanything. So the first time you ask for a completion, it’s like, whoa, buddy, I\nhave to analyze this entire code base for the first time ever.</p><p data-bo=\"36783\">As of fairly recently, <a href=\"https://lib.rs/crates/salsa\">salsa</a> is able to save a cache to disk, which can be,\nagain, a blessing and a curse, because what if the cache is huge and now loading\nit from disk is extremely costly as well.</p><p data-bo=\"37017\">Because I wanted perfect caching in <a href=\"https://dodeca.bearcove.eu\">dodeca</a>, I started using <a href=\"https://lib.rs/crates/salsa\">salsa</a>! But I fairly\nquickly ran into the problem that most of my operations are asynchronous. Even\njust compressing an image is making an async RPC over shared memory to a\ndifferent cell. Therefore, <a href=\"https://lib.rs/crates/salsa\">salsa</a> doesn’t work for me because all the queries are\nsupposed to be synchronous.</p><p data-bo=\"37773\">And that is how I started working on <a href=\"https://picante.bearcove.eu\">picante</a>,\nwhich is not a fork or anything. It’s just like the same ideas as <a href=\"https://lib.rs/crates/salsa\">salsa</a>, but\nasync first.</p><p data-bo=\"37976\">I had to make a bunch of different choices there. It uses <a href=\"https://facet.rs\">facet</a> for everything,\nof course, including equality comparison, even if your types don’t implement\n, it just does structural equality, which is nice.</p><p data-bo=\"38216\">I did also implement persisting the cache to disk and even incrementally\npersisting the cache to disk, so you don’t have a big save phase at the end.</p><p data-bo=\"38368\">I’m sure there’s still a lot of bugs in <a href=\"https://picante.bearcove.eu\">picante</a>, but overall it’s been giving me\nwhat I wanted: track absolutely everything. In <a href=\"https://dodeca.bearcove.eu\">dodeca</a>, there’s very little\ndifference between the production build of a website and the development build\nof a website. The main difference is that we inject a script tag for DevTools.</p><p data-bo=\"38745\">But we do minification of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS by default. We do, of\ncourse, image compression on the fly, depending on what you request, which is to\nsay, depending on what your browser supports…</p><p data-bo=\"38949\">…and we do something that I’ve  dreamed of doing: codepoint-accurate\nfont subsetting, which requires parsing styles and interpreting them and\ncollecting Unicode sets, codepoint sets from all the pages on your website.</p><p data-bo=\"39179\">So there’s a query for like rendering all the markdown to HTML. There’s a query\nfor extracting all the code points from HTML and putting them into one set.\nThere’s a query for taking the uncompressed font and the set of all the code\npoints for a certain style together and doing the font subsetting.</p><p data-bo=\"39480\">And it’s all lazy. Like it only recalculates when you use a character you’ve\nnever used before. Like suddenly you paste in something that has Unicode box\ndrawing characters and yeah it needs to add them from the original font.</p><figure data-bo=\"39709\"><figcaption><div><p>This is how I imagine the people in my head poking holes in my articles as I write them.</p></div></figcaption></figure><p data-bo=\"39910\">But Amos, isn’t font-subsetting expensive? You need to shell out to Python to\nuse pyftsubset. No, it’s not, because I released\n<a href=\"https://lib.rs/crates/woofwoof\">woofwoof</a>, which is just a build of the\nWOFF2 C++ implementation. But I packaged it nicely. I made sure that it builds\nin CI for Linux, Mac and Windows.</p><p data-bo=\"40228\">And I released <a href=\"https://lib.rs/crates/fontcull\">fontcull</a>, which is a Rust version of what was my favorite tool\nfor that up until that point called… <a href=\"https://github.com/zachleat/glyphhanger\">glyphhanger</a>. The problem is that\n<a href=\"https://github.com/zachleat/glyphhanger\">glyphhanger</a> hadn’t been updated in five years and was using a very, very old\nversion of Playwright, old enough that it couldn’t download browsers anymore.\nAnd I just decided, fuck it, let’s do it all in Rust. We have the crates.</p><p data-bo=\"40732\">Or do we? Because I’ve been keeping an eye on this for a while, and for\nfont-subsetting, there was only something that worked for PDF, which doesn’t\nneed the full font information. So it couldn’t be used to subset fonts and then\nuse them in browsers. But I also knew that some people at Google were working on\na bunch of Rust crates around fonts called\n<a href=\"https://github.com/googlefonts/fontations\">fontations</a>.</p><p data-bo=\"41143\">And the good news is that this year they came close enough that you can use\ntheir crates to subset fonts and use them in browsers. And I know that because I\nvendored their code straight from Git, they’re not released on crates.io yet,\nexcept as part of <a href=\"https://lib.rs/crates/fontcull\">fontcull</a>.</p><p data-bo=\"41598\">And the result is that if you go on facet.rs, which does use <a href=\"https://dodeca.bearcove.eu\">dodeca</a> for the\ndocs, and you look in the network tab and you filter by fonts, you will see that\nthe Iosevka font being served is 10 kilobytes down from the original 2MB (which\nincludes NerdFonts etc.)</p><a href=\"https://fasterthanli.me/articles/2025-recap#pikru\"></a><p data-bo=\"41901\">Speaking of <a href=\"https://dodeca.bearcove.eu\">dodeca</a>, since I knew I was going to use it for specifications and\ntechnical documentation, I wanted to have a way to make diagrams, but I didn’t\nwant to use <a href=\"https://mermaid.js.org/\">Mermaid</a> because I don’t like client-side rendering. It’s bad for page\nload time, it’s bad for accessibility, it’s bad for page shift.</p><p data-bo=\"42280\">I looked around for alternatives, I found <a href=\"https://d2lang.com/\">D2</a> which is made in Go, but it’s made\nin Go. I found <a href=\"https://typst.app/\">Typst</a> which I bundled for a while to make Open Graph previews for\npages automatically, but dear lord it was my heaviest dependency by far.</p><p data-bo=\"42560\">Eventually someone pointed me to <a href=\"https://pikchr.org/\">pikchr</a>, a diagramming solution that I didn’t\nknow at all, and that had a completely self-contained C implementation, a very\ngood candidate for a Rust port. The thing is I didn’t feel like porting it\nmyself. So I essentially set off Claude to port it by giving it the tools to\ncompare a hundred test cases, the rendering between the C implementation and the\nRust implementation.</p><figure data-bo=\"42996\"><figcaption><div><p>Some of these are no joke.</p></div></figcaption></figure><p data-bo=\"43291\">I had to generate a comparison HTML to show test coverage, and for each test, a\nvisual comparison side-by-side, onion skin, etc. That’s for me, that’s for\nhumans. And then for it, I made it make for itself an MCP that runs a single\ntest and then renders two SVGs to PNG because those models have vision\ncapabilities.</p><p data-bo=\"43609\">So sometimes it’s able to look at the thing and go, I see that the lines are in\nthe wrong place. Whereas if it were to compare SVG, it would just be drowned in\nall the markup. Speaking of comparing SVG, the Rust implementation also uses\nfacet-svg, which is just a bunch of types defined on top of facet-xml, which I\nmade just for this.</p><p data-bo=\"43946\">And I worked on a bunch of tree diffing algorithms just to produce diffs good\nenough so that the agent was able to tell, oh, this is what’s wrong with the\nrendering.</p><p data-bo=\"44113\">Eventually the Rust port reached 100% parity with the C implementation — not\ntest coverage, actual output parity — all the tests passed. I published the\ncomparison HTML on GitHub Pages and named my implementation\n<a href=\"https://pikru.bearcove.eu\">pikru</a>.</p><a href=\"https://fasterthanli.me/articles/2025-recap#aasvg-rs\"></a><p data-bo=\"44380\">It’s at that point that I discovered that actually Claude and GPT both suck at\nwriting PIK diagrams. So unless I make the diagrams myself, which I don’t really\nwant to (there’s not a lot of auto layout going on in PIK), I decided to port\nanother diagramming solution.</p><p data-bo=\"44649\">I didn’t know that something like\n<a href=\"https://github.com/guerratron/svgbobrus/tree/master/svgbob\">svgbob</a> existed\n(and already has a Rust crate…). Instead, my research found\n<a href=\"https://github.com/martinthomson/aasvg\">aasvg</a>, which is based on a client-side\nmarkdown implementation called <a href=\"https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/\">markdeep</a>.</p><figure data-bo=\"44985\"></figure><figure data-bo=\"45104\"></figure><p data-bo=\"45271\">My port is called <a href=\"https://github.com/bearcove/aasvg-rs\">aasvg-rs</a>,\nunimaginatively, And it also has parity with the original and it’s doing that\nnice thing that I did in both my ports where it’s using CSS variables to get\n<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Values/color_value/light-dark\">light-dark</a> support in SVG.</p><div data-bo=\"45616\"><div><p data-bo=\"45632\">Little caveat, this is absolutely not supported by Safari Mobile, which is the\ncurrent Internet Explorer.</p></div></div><a href=\"https://fasterthanli.me/articles/2025-recap#facet-keeps-growing\"></a><p data-bo=\"45764\">More things have happened in the facet ecosystem that I haven’t really talked\nabout. As I was writing this, I worked on the facet benchmarks, and I was like,\noh, the JavaScript code for the benchmark browser view keeps getting out of sync\nwith the format generated by the benchmarks.</p><p data-bo=\"46049\">If only we could use TypeScript types to validate the frontend, and if only we\ncould use json-schema to make sure that the backend is producing what we think\nit is, and if the source of truth was just a bunch of Rust types, Wouldn’t that\nbe fantastic?</p><p data-bo=\"46303\">Well, obviously, there’s existing solutions, existing derived macros like\n<a href=\"https://docs.rs/schemars/latest/schemars/\">schemars</a>, But at some point, I\npromise that Facet would be the last derive macro you’d need. And in this case,\nit works! I quickly threw together <a href=\"https://lib.rs/crates/facet-typescript\">facet-typescript</a> and <a href=\"https://lib.rs/crates/facet-json-schema\">facet-json-schema</a>, which\nmade iterating on the benchmark dashboard a lot easier.</p><p data-bo=\"47135\">Other things I was interested in included an alternative to\n<a href=\"https://lib.rs/crates/thiserror\">thiserror</a>, but based on facet, or\nsomething like <a href=\"https://lib.rs/crates/displaydoc\">displaydoc</a> or derive for\nthe <a href=\"https://lib.rs/crates/miette\">miette</a> crate, so you can implement\ndiagnostic without either doing a manual implementation or using something that\ndepends, again, on <a href=\"https://lib.rs/crates/syn\">syn</a>.</p><p data-bo=\"47558\">And the problem with all these is that you actually have to act like a macro.\nYou have to generate additional code. It’s not just, oh, you derived ,\nso you can do whatever you want at runtime. You have to implement .</p><p data-bo=\"47790\">You have to implement . You have to implement . Therefore, you\nhave to generate code. Therefore, we needed to come up with some sort of plug-in\nsystem for facet. something that would reuse the result of parsing your type\ndefinitions that facet macros already does, but that is able to use templates to\ngenerate different implementations. And we did exactly just that.</p><p data-bo=\"48565\">It’s not entirely final and the templates are pretty simple for now, but it\nworks. Like, you don’t need another derive macro, you don’t need <a href=\"https://lib.rs/crates/syn\">syn</a>. I have no\nidea what the performance is like. I haven’t actually measured build times on\nany of this, but the idea is pretty simple.</p><p data-bo=\"48876\">We shouldn’t need too many of these because there’s a finite amount of traits\nthat you really want to implement: I barely bother implementing Debug anymore,\nbecause if I want to see what’s inside a type, I just use <a href=\"https://lib.rs/crates/facet-pretty\">facet-pretty</a>: Every\ntrait where performance is not paramount and that can be re-implemented just\nusing reflection is savings in terms of code gen, build times, final binary\nsize, etc.</p><p data-bo=\"49318\">The  trait especially; even if you’re not planning on using facet, look\nat how much code debug is generating for large structs etc. It can make up a\nsolid chunk of your binary.</p><a href=\"https://fasterthanli.me/articles/2025-recap#fs-kitty\"></a><p data-bo=\"49517\">One very cool application of <a href=\"https://rapace.bearcove.eu\">rapace</a> that I made recently is\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bearcove/fs-kitty\">fs-kitty</a> which has to do with virtual\nfile systems.</p><p data-bo=\"49701\">The SSD that’s on your laptop, has a real file system on it. Maybe it’s ext4,\nmaybe it’s btrfs, maybe it’s ZFS if you’re the good kind of nerd. Or, you know,\nAPFS or NTFS, whatever.</p><p data-bo=\"49884\">Sometimes you want to access files over the network and then you would use\nsomething like <a href=\"https://www.samba.org/\">Samba</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System\">NFS</a>. And sometimes you just want to kind of make up\nfiles like pretend you mounted a zip file for example. And for that you need a\nVFS, a virtual file system.</p><p data-bo=\"50223\">On Linux, if you want to make a virtual file system, you can use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace\">FUSE</a>, which\nmeans file system in user space. And on Mac, you could make kernel\nextensions but of course anything that runs in the kernel must never crash,\notherwise everything crashes because monolithic kernels won the war.</p><p data-bo=\"50571\">Therefore, Apple has been trying to kill kernel extensions for as long as\nthey’ve been a thing, and they’ve introduced things piecemeal to kind of let\ncompanies like <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/\">Dropbox</a> have their virtual file system without touching the\nkernel as much.</p><p data-bo=\"50843\">The last piece being <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/FSKit\">FSKit</a>, which lets you implement the file system entirely in\nuser space, communicating to the kernel over <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xpc\">XPC</a>, another form of RPC. Which is\ngreat, except you have to package it up as a file system extension, as an .appex\nbundle, which registers in system settings when you open the associated regular\n.app bundle: It’s not really designed for command line tools.</p><p data-bo=\"51329\">But I saw some people made something called\n<a href=\"https://github.com/debox-network/FSKitBridge\">FSKitBridge</a>, which adds another\nlayer of RPC (they used protobuf). That way you can implement your file system\nin any language. And their file system extension connects to your binary over\nTCP. And, you know, it’s a little layer cake of RPC that works.</p><p data-bo=\"51675\">And you don’t have to worry about the terrible Apple requirements. You don’t\nhave to ship an app yourself or sign it. But it’s an extension that, I don’t\nknow, I just didn’t trust these guys to install a file system extension from\nthem, even though it’s fully in userspace. I don’t know, it felt wrong.</p><p data-bo=\"52247\">So all the app itself and most of the app extension is in Swift. And initially,\nI just compiled a bit of Rust code and linked it, called it from Swift using\n<a href=\"https://github.com/chinedufn/swift-bridge\">swift-bridge</a>, which does support\nasync.</p><p data-bo=\"52491\">And eventually I thought, you know, I’m getting hangs, I’m getting crashes.\nWouldn’t it be easier to just implement everything in Swift? That’s when I\nstarted writing <a href=\"https://rapace.bearcove.eu\">rapace</a> implementations in other languages, just like, you know,\nRust on the front end is fine. But sometimes I just want to do Svelte and\nTypeScript and be done with it. Wouldn’t it be nice to just have like a native\nTypeScript implementation of the <a href=\"https://rapace.bearcove.eu\">rapace</a> protocol?</p><p data-bo=\"52987\">As I’m writing this, it’s at a stage where… it used to work at some point, and\nthen I started reworking all the dependencies. Therefore, it’s broken right now,\nbut it’s going to work again in the future, let me tell you.</p><p data-bo=\"53212\">Because I need it for the project that is probably the most exciting to me of\n2025, and it’s going to carry on into 2026.</p><a href=\"https://fasterthanli.me/articles/2025-recap#vixen\"></a><p data-bo=\"53391\">Porting my entire monorepo from cargo to <a href=\"https://buck2.build/\">buck2</a> was an eye-opening experience.\nIt’s not just me. Cargo is pretty bad at caching, at least right now. Things are\nalways being improved, but the fact of the matter is it is simply not designed\nlike a proper build system should be.</p><div data-bo=\"53695\"><div><p data-bo=\"53711\">“Proper” build system is a loaded term, but I have a very specific idea of\nwhat it should be. So it’s a personal take on this.</p></div></div><p data-bo=\"53842\">On my monorepo a cold build with cargo is 35 seconds, on buck2 it’s 25 seconds.\nA no-up build is almost a second with cargo and 0.06 seconds with buck2. As for\nchanging a single line in a function deep in my dependency tree, it’s 21 seconds\nunder cargo and 8.5 seconds in buck2.</p><p data-bo=\"54122\">The numbers speak for themselves.</p><p data-bo=\"54158\">However, it is a major pain in the ass to maintain BUCK files for all of your\ncrates, especially if you have like a hundred of them like me, plus maintain\nfix-ups for all your dependencies.</p><p data-bo=\"54350\">If only there was a build tool that had the properties of buck2 with the\nergonomics of cargo. If only you didn’t have to use a separate tool to generate\nbuild files for your dependencies. If only, if only, if only, if only it was\ndesigned from scratch to be friendly to the Rust ecosystem.</p><p data-bo=\"54641\">But not only, because you do need to own C/C++ compilation. And while you’re at\nit, why not also own things like JavaScript bundling, any sort of manipulation\nyou want to do on assets, container image construction? Why not?</p><p data-bo=\"54866\">And then if you’re doing this, why not do it with continuous integration in\nmind, of course, because that’s where caching matters most. I look at workflows\nthat takes 1.5 minutes for 10 seconds’ worth of compilation and I become the\njoker.</p><div data-bo=\"55109\"><div><p data-bo=\"55125\">I know, I know—I’m complaining, people have hour-long CI pipelines. I don’t\ncare, my pipelines should take seconds because that’s how much CPU time I know\nis necessary to prove that the change is valid.</p></div></div><p data-bo=\"55332\">I have great plans for this. It is a hugely ambitious project. It requires\nhubris, which I have again, now that we’ve found the right meds, It is\nabsolutely not capable of building anything except the most trivial hello world\nright now. But I’m going for it. I don’t know what else to tell you.</p><p data-bo=\"55629\">I genuinely believe it is possible to get the best of both worlds. The most\nlikely outcome is that I just burned out and never make anything useful with it.\nBut damn it, I’m going to keep trying because I’ve been doing hacks around CI\nbuild times for a long time.</p><figure data-bo=\"55894\"><figcaption><div><p>It's always a good sign when a bug only occurs 25% of the time. It's what you want.</p></div></figcaption></figure><p data-bo=\"56970\">I have a CLI tool called <a href=\"https://lib.rs/crates/timelord-cli\">timelord</a> that\nsaves and restores timestamps to try to make cargo stop rebuilding things. And\nit’s broken because of <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/12060\">nanosecond resolution\nproblems</a> on certain\nenvironments. I’ve reached a point of I’m just not even going to bother anymore.\nI’m just going to make my own build tool.</p><div data-bo=\"57374\"><div><p data-bo=\"57390\">I don’t need anyone else telling me that it’s stupid and that I’m never going to\nmake it. I need people to get excited and make their own. Like, why should I be\nthe only one trying?</p></div></div><p data-bo=\"57573\">Also, I have no illusion, no intention of replacing cargo: cargo is going to be\nthere for as long as Rust is. It has the constraint of having to work for\nabsolutely everyone on absolutely every platform and strong backwards\ncompatibility. I get it.</p><p data-bo=\"57823\">This is why it’s exciting to be able to do a clean implementation of something\nlike, let’s take all these ideas and properties that are nice and try to put\nthem all together.</p><p data-bo=\"57999\">It’s a bit like cooking! I like it!</p><p data-bo=\"58036\">I’m building it with remote execution and a content-addressable store day one,\n(which is why it’s hard to get even the most trivial builds to run, because\nthere’s so many moving parts).</p><p data-bo=\"58223\">But that means you’re suddenly not worried about target directories. You’re\nsuddenly not worried about.. if you rebuild with or without a cargo feature\nenabled, is it going to overwrite part of the target directory and cause\nrebuilds?</p><figure data-bo=\"58460\"><figcaption><div><p>J'ai donné un talk au Meetup Rust de Lyon en décembre et on s'est bien amusé.</p></div></figcaption></figure><p data-bo=\"58955\">And if your CI is running on the same platform that you are, then by the time\nyour changes reach CI, it’s a no-op. Because you’ve already done it. In fact, the\nentire CI pipeline, you can just run “locally”, as your local vixen command line\ndispatches tasks to remote executors.</p><p data-bo=\"59236\">You don’t need several different jobs defined in YAML. You don’t need to\ntemporarily upload artifacts to an artifact store and then download them in the\nnext stage because everything is just in the content addressable store. Every\nexecutor has its own memory and disk cache.</p><p data-bo=\"59512\">You don’t need to worry about dividing builds into several CI jobs so they run\nin parallel because it’s all part of the same build graph, and the orchestrator\nwill build as much as possible in parallel.</p><p data-bo=\"60134\">Of course, for that to work, you need to have your build be hermetic for real.\nFor example, for C/C++, I’m grabbing toolchains from Zig. For rustc, I’m\nactually downloading toolchains directly from static.rust-lang.org. I’m not going\nthrough rustup at all.</p><p data-bo=\"60392\">For example, with cargo, if you build on the rustup  channel or the\nrustup  channel, even though they’re exactly the same toolchains, it’s\ngoing to rebuild because the path changed.</p><p data-bo=\"60589\">That’s not a thing if you have true hermeticity because the toolchain is mounted\nsomewhere, it’s accessible through the virtual file system. And if it has the\nsame hash, it has the same hash. It’s part of the inputs. Inputs didn’t change.\nNo need to rebuild!</p><p data-bo=\"60849\">(For the last paragraph to work you need to read it out loud in the voice of Sil\nfrom The Sopranos. This is not a script note I forgot to remove, it is a note\nfor , the reader).</p><p data-bo=\"61033\">The content addressable store is not just a cute gimmick, it’s also: “Oh, you\nwant to have the last 16 Rust toolchains?” Okay, there’s a lot of deduplication\nyou can do in there. They don’t rewrite the standard library every time, you\nknow. There’s LLVM tools that don’t change every release. There’s a lot of\nthings that can be reused.</p><div data-bo=\"61373\"><div><p data-bo=\"61389\">Ah and also they’re now forever in a server that’s close to you, stored\nas individual entries that can be streamed quickly and concurrently, as\nopposed to a tarball you have to decompress sequentially.</p></div></div><p data-bo=\"61596\">For build scripts, with buck2, you have to pretty much either patch them out\nbecause they’re doing something naughty, or you can run them if it’s fine. Like\nif they don’t reach for the network or something, you have to make sure that\ntheir inputs are in there. You have to manually declare them.</p><p data-bo=\"61893\">There’s a lot of things in buck2 that you have to explicitly specify. And I\ndon’t like that. Yes, the build actions should be hermetic. You should know\nexactly their inputs and outputs. But also sometimes you can just infer that.</p><figure data-bo=\"62124\"><figcaption><div><p>Me when I think about writing BUCK files and repeating stuff the build system could 100% discover on its own.</p></div></figcaption></figure><p data-bo=\"62373\">Looking at a build script, if the build script is only calling the <a href=\"https://lib.rs/crates/cc\">cc</a> crate, I’m\ngoing to patch the <a href=\"https://lib.rs/crates/cc\">cc</a> crate. I don’t care. I’m going to substitute a version of\nthe cc crate that does not actually build, but instead creates actions to be\ndispatched by the orchestrator later. That just makes sense to me.</p><p data-bo=\"62741\">There are so many things that, so many patterns in Rust crates that we recognize\nthat a build system could know about, if it cared to look. And there’s always\ngoing to be the odd crate out, like <a href=\"https://lib.rs/crates/sqlx\">sqlx</a> or <a href=\"https://lib.rs/crates/rustls\">rustls</a>, that needs special treatment\n(sqlx for network access, rustls for assembly),</p><p data-bo=\"63098\">And instead of relying on someone maintaining a GitHub repo of all the fixups,\nmaybe there’s a package manager built into the freaking build system. Maybe, you\nknow, maybe you can just make life comfortable for yourself. What a novel idea.</p><p data-bo=\"63605\">And of course, having dependency tracking that’s rigorous to the point where you\nget perfect caching is extremely useful. Because then you get to see the build\ngraph. You get to debug why something rebuilt, which is something buck2 does\nwell with its explain command — I wanna steal all of that, and again expand it\nbeyond just the build but to like… CI, even deployment, why not?</p><p data-bo=\"63991\">I’m definitely at the “everything looks like a nail” stage of this, but my\nhammer is fucking awesome.</p><a href=\"https://fasterthanli.me/articles/2025-recap#conclusion\"></a><p data-bo=\"64110\">Conclusion? I had a ton of fun this year. I’m going to have even more next year.\nI’m at that stage where I’m dogfooding like there’s no tomorrow. Every one of my\ncrates uses another one of my crates.</p><p data-bo=\"64311\">And it is absolutely great because I get the developer experience that I want.\nUnless things broke. And then it’s on me to go fix it.</p><p data-bo=\"64446\">But you know, one of my favorite things to say is, I hope it’s my fault that\nthis broke, because if it’s my fault I know I can go in and fix it. But if it’s\nsomeone else’s fault, who knows how long until they fix it.</p><p data-bo=\"64664\">All the shit that I’ve talked about here is open source, under the <a href=\"https://github.com/bearcove\">bearcove\ngithub org</a> — which means you are free to go and\nplay with it all. Don’t expect much stability except for facet: generally if\nsomething becomes usable, I’m going to start making noise about it. I’m going to\nhave an official announcement on my blog. I’m going to make a video about it.</p><p data-bo=\"65058\">If I haven’t yet, there’s a reason.</p><p data-bo=\"65095\">I’m also happy with what I did regarding videos. This year I worked with two\ndifferent video editors, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@SEKUNHO\">Sekun</a> and\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@vl_koro\">Vlad</a>, thanks to them for helping me along\nthis journey, there’s more coming next year since videos pay for themselves with\nsponsorship.</p><p data-bo=\"65416\">Thanks also to <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/opensource/\">AWS</a> for a large donation\ntowards the development of Facet, to <a href=\"https://depot.dev/\">Depot</a> for all the CI\nbuild minutes, to <a href=\"https://zed.dev/\">Zed</a> for the free credits. If you’re a\ncompany who wants to help sponsor some of these development efforts, definitely\nreach out, my email is on my website’s about page.</p><p data-bo=\"65782\">I’m looking forward to next year, which is not the way I felt every year for the\npast 10 years. You know, it’s nice when things are good. I hope things are good\nfor you too.</p><p data-bo=\"65957\">Take care, and I’ll see you next y-I’ll see you very soon.</p><div data-context=\"end-of-page\">\n            (JavaScript is required to see this.

      "content": "<p>Happy belated new year! Linux 6.19 is now out in the wild and… ah, let’s just cut to\nthe chase. We know what you’re here for.</p><p>Asahi Linux turns 5 this year. In those five years, we’ve gone from Hello World over\na serial port to being one of the best supported desktop-grade AArch64 platform in the Linux\necosystem. The sustained interest in Asahi was the push many developers needed to start\ntaking AArch64 seriously, with a whole slew of platform-specific bugs in popular software\nbeing fixed specifically to enable their use on Apple Silicon devices running Linux. We\nare immensely proud of what we have achieved and consider the project a resounding and\ncontinued success.</p><p>And yet, there has remained one question seemingly on everyone’s lips. Every announcement,\nevery upstreaming victory, every blog post has drawn this question out in one way or another.\nIt is asked at least once a week on IRC and Matrix, and we even occasionally receive\nemails asking it.</p><p>“When will display out via USB-C be supported?”</p><p>“Is there an ETA for DisplayPort Alt Mode?”</p><p>“Can I use an HDMI adapter on my MacBook Air yet?”</p><p>Despite repeated polite requests to not ask us for specific feature ETAs, the questions\nkept coming. In an effort to try and curtail this, we toyed with setting a “minimum”\ndate for the feature and simply doubling it every time the question was asked. This\nvery quickly led to the date being after the predicted heat death of the universe.\nWe fell back on a tried and tested response pioneered by id Software; DP Alt Mode will\nbe done when it’s done.</p><p>And, well, it’s done. Kind of.</p><p>In December, Sven gave a <a href=\"https://media.ccc.de/v/39c3-asahi-linux-porting-linux-to-apple-silicon\">talk at 39C3</a>\nrecounting the Asahi story so far, our reverse\nengineering process, and what the immediate future looks like for us. At the end, he\nrevealed that the slide deck had been running on an M1 MacBook Air, connected to\nthe venue’s AV system via a USB-C to HDMI adapter!</p><p>At the same time, we quietly pushed the <a href=\"https://github.com/AsahiLinux/linux/tree/fairydust\">fairydust</a>\nbranch to our downstream Linux tree. This branch is the culmination of years of hard work from Sven, Janne and marcan,\nwrangling and taming the fragile and complicated USB and display stacks\non this platform. Getting a display signal out of a USB-C port on Apple Silicon involves\nfour distinct hardware blocks; DCP, DPXBAR, ATCPHY, and ACE. These four pieces of hardware\neach required reverse engineering, a Linux driver, and then a whole lot of convincing to\nplay nicely with each other.</p><p>All of that said, there is still work to do. Currently, the fairydust branch “blesses”\na specific USB-C port on a machine for use with DisplayPort, meaning that multiple\nUSB-C displays is still not possible. There are also some quirks regarding both cold\nand hot plug of displays. Moreover, some users have reported that DCP does not properly\nhandle certain display setups, variously exhibiting incorrect or oversaturated colours or\nmissing timing modes.</p><p>For all of these reasons, we provide the fairydust branch strictly as-is. It is intended\nprimarily for developers who may be able to assist us with ironing out these kinks with\nminimal support or guidance from us. Of course, users who are comfortable with building\nand installing their own kernels on Apple Silicon are more than welcome to try it out\nfor themselves, but we cannot offer any support for this until we deem it ready for\ngeneral use.</p><p>For quite some time, m1n1 has had basic support for the M3 series machines. What has\nbeen missing are Devicetrees for each machine, as well as patches to our Linux kernel\ndrivers to support M3-specific hardware quirks and changes from M2. Our intent was always\nto get to fleshing this out once our existing patchset became more manageable, but with\nthe quiet hope that the groundwork being laid would excite a new contributor enough to\nstep up to the plate and attempt to help out. Well, we actually ended up with \nnew contributors!</p><p>Between the three of them, <a href=\"https://noopwafel.net\">Alyssa Milburn (noopwafel)</a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/IntegralPilot\">Michael Reeves (integralpilot)</a>, and <a href=\"https://shiz.me\">Shiz</a>,\nwith help from Janne, wrote some preliminary Devicetrees and found that a great deal of\nhardware worked without any changes! Adding in some minor kernel changes for the NVMe and interrupt\ncontrollers, Michael was able to <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AsahiLinux/comments/1qnddjd/m3_now_has_fedora_43_asahi_remix_working_with_kde/\">boot</a>\nall the way to Plasma on an M3 MacBook Air!</p><p>In fact, the current state of M3 support is about where M1 support was when we released\nthe first Arch Linux ARM based beta; keyboard, touchpad, WiFi, NVMe and USB3 are all\nworking, albeit with some local patches to m1n1 and the Asahi kernel (yet to make their\nway into a pull request) required. So that must mean we will have a release ready soon, right?</p><p>A lot has changed in five years. We have earnt a reputation for being the most complete\nand polished AArch64 desktop Linux experience available, and  the most complete\nand polished desktop Linux experiences in general. It is a reputation that we are immensely\nproud of, and has come at a great personal cost to many. We will not squander it or take\nit for granted.</p><p>Ideally, the current state of M1 and M2 support should be the baseline for any general\navailability release for M3. We know that’s not , however nor is releasing a\njanky, half-baked and unfinished mess like the initial ALARM releases all those years\nago. So, what needs to be done before we can cut a release? Quite a bit, actually.</p><p>The first thing intrepid testers will notice is that the graphical environment is entirely\nsoftware-rendered. This is extremely slow and energy intensive, and barely keeps up\nwith scrolling text in a terminal window. Unfortunately, this is not likely to change\nany time soon; the GPU design found in M3 series SoCs is a significant departure from\nthe GPU found in M1 and M2, introducing hardware accelerated ray tracing and mesh shaders,\nas well as Dynamic Caching, which Apple claims enables more efficient allocation of\nlow-level GPU resources. Alyssa M. and Michael have volunteered their time to M3 GPU\nreverse engineering, and building on the work done by dougallj and TellowKrinkle,\nhave already made some progress on the myriad changes to the GPU ISA between M2\nand M3.</p><p>We are also relying on iBoot to initialise DCP and allocate us a\nframebuffer, rather than driving DCP directly (and correctly) ourselves. This is\nextremely slow and inefficient, and prevents us from properly managing many display features,\nsuch as the backlight. Since no M3 devices can run macOS 13.5, and since Apple made\na number of changes to the DCP firmware interface for macOS 14, bringing up DCP\non M3 devices will require more reverse engineering. Luckily these changes only\naffect the API itself, and not the protocol used to communicate between the OS\nand coprocessor. This means we can reuse our existing tooling to trace the new\nfirmware interface with minimal changes.</p><p>Beyond hardware enablement, there are also the numerous integrations and finishing\ntouches that make the Asahi experience what it is. Energy-Aware Scheduling, speaker\nsafety and EQ tuning, microphone and webcam support, and a whole host of other features\nthat folks expect are still not there, and won’t be for some time. Some of these, like\nEnergy-Aware Scheduling, are quality of life features that are not likely to block a\nrelease. Others, such as getting M3 devices supported in speakersafetyd, are release-blocking.</p><p>We don’t expect it to take  long to get M3 support into a shippable state, but\nmuch as with everything else we do, we cannot provide an ETA and request that you\ndo not ask for one.</p><p>The 14\" and 16\" MacBook Pros have very nice displays. They have extremely accurate colour\nreproduction, are extremely bright,  are capable of a 120 Hz refresh rate. But\nthere’s a catch.</p><p>On macOS, you cannot simply set these displays to 120 Hz and call it a day. Instead, Apple\nhides refresh rates above 60 Hz behind their ProMotion feature, which is really just a\nmarketing term for bog standard variable refresh rate. One could be forgiven for assuming\nthat this is just a quirk of macOS, and that simply selecting the 120 Hz timing mode in\nthe DCP firmware would be enough to drive the panel at that refresh rate on Linux,\nhowever this is not the case.</p><p>For reasons known only to Apple, DCP will refuse to drive the MacBook Pro panels higher\nthan 60 Hz unless three specific fields in the surface swap request struct are filled. We\nhave known for some time that these fields were some form of timestamp, however we never\nhad the time to investigate them more deeply than that. Enter yet another new contributor!</p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/oliverbestmann\">Oliver Bestmann</a> took it upon himself to get 120 Hz\nworking on MacBook Pros, and to that end looked into the three timestamps. Analysing traces\nfrom macOS revealed them to count upward in CPU timer ticks. The timestamps are almost always\nexactly one frame apart, hinting that they are used for frame presentation timekeeping. Presentation\ntimekeeping is required for VRR to work properly, as the compositor and driver must both be\naware of when specific frames are actually being shown on the display. Compositors can also\nuse this sort of information to help with maintaining consistent frame pacing and minimising\ntearing, even when VRR is not active.</p><p>At this stage, we are only interested in a consistent 120 Hz, not VRR. Since macOS\ncouples the two together, it is difficult to ascertain exactly what DCP expects us to\ndo for 120 Hz. Clearly the timestamps are required, but why? What does DCP do with them,\nand what  are they supposed to represent?</p><p>Sometimes, doing something stupid is actually very smart. Assuming that the timestamps\nare only  for VRR, Oliver tried stuffing a static value into each\ntimestamp field. And it worked! Starting with kernel version 6.18.4, owners of 14\" and\n16\" MacBook Pros are able to drive their builtin displays at 120 Hz.</p><p>Now of course, this solution is quite clearly jank. The presentation timestamps are\ncurrently being set every time the KMS subsystem triggers an atomic state flush, and\nthey are definitely not supposed to be set to a static value. While it\nworks for our use case, this solution precludes support for VRR, which brings us nicely\nto our next topic.</p><p>The DCP driver for Linux has historically been rather incomplete. This shouldn’t be surprising;\ndisplay engines are massively complex, and this is reflected in the absolutely enormous 9 MiB\nblob of firmware that DCP runs. This firmware exposes interfaces which are designed\nto integrate tightly with macOS. These interfaces also change in breaking ways between macOS\nreleases, requiring special handling for versioned structures and function calls.</p><p>All of this has led to a driver that has been developed in an suboptimal, piecemeal\nfashion. There are many reasons for this:</p><ul><li>We lacked the time to do anything else, especially Janne, who took on the burden\nof maintaining and rebasing the Asahi kernel tree</li><li>There were more important things to do, like bringing up other hardware</li><li>We plan to rewrite the driver in Rust anyway to take advantage of better\nfirmware version handling</li></ul><p>On top of all that, it simply did not matter for the design goals at the time. The\ninitial goal was to get enough of DCP brought up to reliably drive the builtin displays\non the laptops and the HDMI ports on the desktops, and we achieved that by gluing\njust enough of DCP’s firmware interface to the KMS API to scan out a single 8-bit ARGB\nframebuffer on each swap.</p><p>We have since implemented support for audio over DisplayPort/HDMI, basic colour management\nfor Night Light implementations that support Colour Transformation Matrices, and\nrudimentary hardware overlays. But this still leaves a lot of features on the table, such\nas HDR, VRR, support for other framebuffer formats, hardware brightness control for\nexternal displays (DDC/CI), and direct scanout support for multimedia and fullscreen\napplications.</p><p>Supporting these within the confines of the current driver architecture would be difficult.\nThere are a number of outstanding issues with userspace integration and the way\nin which certain components interact with the KMS API. That said, want to push forward with\nnew features, and waiting for Rust KMS bindings to land upstream could leave us\nwaiting for quite some time. We have instead started refactoring sections of the existing\nDCP driver where necessary, starting with the code for handling hardware planes.</p><p>Why start there? Having proper support for hardware planes is important for performance\nand efficiency. Most display engines have facilities for compositing\nmultiple framebuffers in hardware, and DCP is no exception. It can layer, move, blend and\neven apply basic colour transformations to these framebuffers. The classical use case\nfor this functionality has been cursors; rather than have the GPU redraw the entire desktop\nevery time the cursor moves, we can put the cursor on one of the display engine’s overlay\nplanes and then command it to move that static framebuffer around the screen. The GPU is\nonly actively rendering when on-screen  needs redrawing, such as when hovering\nover a button.</p><p>I shoehorned extremely limited support for this into the driver a while ago, and it\nhas been working nicely with Plasma 6’s hardware cursor support. But we need to go\ndeeper.</p><p>DCP is capable of some very nifty features, some of which are absolutely\nnecessary for HDR and direct video scanout. Importantly for us, DCP can:</p><ul><li>Directly scan out semiplanar Y’CbCr framebuffers (both SDR and HDR)</li><li>Take multiple framebuffers of differing colourspaces and normalise them to the\nconnected display’s colourspace before scanout</li><li>Directly scan out compressed framebuffers created by AGX and AVD</li><li>Automatically normalise mixed dynamic range content</li></ul><p>All of these are tied to DCP’s idea of a plane. I had initially attempted to\nadd support for Y’CbCr framebuffers without any refactoring, however this\nthis was proving to be messy and overly complicated to integrate with\nthe way we were constructing a swap request at the time. Refactoring the\nplane code made both adding Y’CbCr support  constructing a swap request\nsimpler.</p><p>We have also been able to begin  HDR experiments, and get more complete\noverlay support working, including for Y’CbCr video sources. Plasma 6.5 has\nvery basic support for overlay planes hidden behind a feature flag, however\nit is still quite broken. A few Kwin bugs related to this are slated to be\nfixed for Plasma 6.7, which may enable us to expand DCP’s overlay support\neven further.</p><p>On top of this, Oliver has also begun working on compressed framebuffer support.\nThere are currently two proprietary Apple framebuffer formats we know of in use on Apple\nSilicon SoCs; AGX has its own framebuffer format which is already supported in Mesa, however macOS\nnever actually sends framebuffers in this format to DCP. Instead, DCP always\nscans out framebuffers in the “Apple Interchange” format for both GPU-rendered\nframebuffers and AVD-decoded video. Oliver reverse engineered this new format\nand added experimental support for it to Mesa and the DCP driver. While still\na work in progress, this should eventually enable significant memory bandwidth\nand energy savings, particularly when doing display-heavy tasks like watching\nvideos. Experimentation with DCP and its firmware suggests that it may be capable\nof directly reading AGX-format framebuffers too, however this will require further\ninvestigation as we cannot rely on observations from macOS.</p><p>Additionally, Lina observed macOS using shader code to decompress Interchange\nframebuffers while reverse engineering AGX, suggesting that some variants of AGX\nmay not be capable of working with the format. If this is the case, we will be\nrestricted to only using Interchange for AVD-decoded video streams, falling back\nto either AGX format if it turns out to be supported by DCP, or linear framebuffers\nfor content rendered by the GPU.</p><p>Beyond adding new features, reworking the plane handling code has also\nenabled us to more easily fix oversaturated colours on the builtin\nMacBook displays, starting with kernel version 6.18. Folks currently using\nan ICC profile to work around this problem should disable this, as it will\nconflict with DCP’s internal colour handling.</p><p>Planes are just one part of the puzzle, however. There is still much work to be\ndone cleaning up the driver and getting features like HDR into a shippable state.\nWatch this space!</p><p>It’s been quite a while since we shipped webcam support, and for  users\nit seems to have Just Worked! But not for  users.</p><p>Users of certain webcam applications, most notable GNOME’s Camera app, have been\nreporting severe issues with webcam support since day one. Doing some initial\ndebugging on this pointed to it being an issue with GNOME’s app, however this\nturned out not to be the case. The Asahi OpenGL driver was actually improperly\nhandling planar video formats. The ISP/webcam exports\nplanar video framebuffers via V4L2, which must then be consumed and turned into\nRGB framebuffers for compositing with the desktop. Apps such as GNOME’s Camera\napp do this with the GPU, and thus were failing hard. While studying the\n<a href=\"https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/38160\">fix</a> for this,\nJanne noticed that Honeykrisp was not properly announcing the number of planes\nin any planar framebuffers, and <a href=\"https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/38200\">fixed</a>\nthat too. In the process of debugging these issues, Robert Mader found\nthat Fedora was not building GStreamer’s gtk4paintablesink plugin with\nY’CbCr support, which will be fixed for Fedora Linux 43.</p><p>So all good right? Nope! Hiding behind these bugs in the GPU drivers were two more\nbugs, this time in PipeWire. The first was an integer overflow in PipeWire’s\nGStreamer code, <a href=\"https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pipewire/pipewire/-/merge_requests/2582\">fixed</a>\nby Robert. This then revealed the second bug; the code which determines the latency of a stream was\nassuming a period numerator of 1, which is not always the case. With Apple Silicon\nmachines, the period is expressed as 256/7680, which corresponds to 30 frames per\nsecond. Since the numerator is not 1, the latency calculation was not being normalised,\nand thus ended up so long that streams would crash waiting for data from PipeWire.\nJanne submitted a <a href=\"https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pipewire/pipewire/-/merge_requests/2636\">merge request</a>\nwith a fix, which made it in to Pipewire 1.4.10. Why 256/7680 is not reduced to\n1/30 is another mystery that needs solving, however at least now with these two\npatches, we’re all good right? Right?</p><p>So, graphics programming is actually really hard. As it happens, the GPU kernel driver\nwas not properly handling DMA-BUFs from external devices, deadlocking once it was\ndone using the imported buffer. After fixing this and removing a very noisy log\nmessage that was being triggered for every imported frame, the webcam came to life!\nThis should mean that the webcam is now fully supported across the vast majority of\napplications.</p><p>We’ve made incredible progress upstreaming patches over the past 12 months. Our patch\nset has shrunk from 1232 patches with 6.13.8, to 858 as of 6.18.8. Our total delta in\nterms of lines of code has also shrunk, from 95,000 lines to 83,000 lines for the same\nkernel versions. Hmm, a 15% reduction in lines of code for a 30% reduction in patches\nseems a bit wrong…</p><p>Not all patches are created equal. Some of the upstreamed patches have been small\nfixes, others have been thousands of lines. All of them, however, pale in comparison\nto the GPU driver.</p><p>The GPU driver is 21,000 lines by itself, discounting the downstream Rust abstractions\nwe are still carrying. It is almost double the size of the DCP driver and thrice the\nsize of the ISP/webcam driver, its two closest rivals. And upstreaming work has\nnow begun.</p><p>We were very graciously granted leave to upstream our UAPI headers  an\naccompanying driver by the DRM maintainers quite some time ago, on the proviso\nthat the driver would follow. Janne has now been laying the groundwork for that\nto happen with <a href=\"https://lore.kernel.org/asahi/20260105-asahi-tests-wave1-v1-0-a6c72617e680@jannau.net/T/#t\">patches to IGT</a>,\nthe test suite for DRM drivers.</p><p>There is still some cleanup work required to get the driver into an upstreamable\nstate, and given its size we expect the review process to take quite some time\neven when it is ready. We hope to have more good news on this front shortly!</p><p>GPU drivers have a lot of moving parts, and all of them are expected to work\nperfectly. They are also expected to be . As it so happens, writing software\nthat is both correct  fast is quite the challenge. The typical development\ncycle for any given GPU driver feature is to make it work properly first, then\nfind ways to speed it up later if possible. Performance is sometimes left on\nthe table though.</p><p>While looking at <a href=\"https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/gpu-ratemeter\">gpu-ratemeter</a>\nbenchmark results, Janne noticed that memory copies via the OpenGL driver were\npathologically slow, much slower than Vulkan-initiated memory copies. As in, taking\nan hour to complete just this one microbenchmark slow. Digging\naround in the Asahi OpenGL driver revealed that memory copy operations were being\noffloaded to the CPU rather than implemented as GPU code like with Vulkan. After\nwriting a shader to implement this, OpenGL copies now effectively saturate the\nmemory bus, which is about as good as one could hope for!</p><p>But why stop there? Buffer  are now fast, but what about clearing memory?\nThe Asahi driver was using Mesa’s default buffer clearing helpers, which work\nbut cannot take advantage of hardware-specific optimisations. Janne also replaced\nthis with calls to AGX-optimised functions which take optimised paths for\nmemory-aligned buffers. This allows an M1 Ultra to clear buffers aligned to\n16 byte boundaries at 355 GB/s.</p><p>But wait, there’s more! While Vulkan copies were indeed faster than OpenGL copies,\nthey weren’t as fast as they could be. Once again, we were neglecting to use our\nAGX-optimised routines for copying aligned buffers. Fixing this gives us some pretty\nhefty performance increases for such buffers, ranging from 30% faster for 16 KiB\nbuffers to more than twice as fast for buffers 8 MiB and larger!</p><p>All this stuff around pushing pixels perfectly requires good delivery of the code,\nand Neal has worked on improving the package management experience in Fedora Asahi Remix.</p><p>The major piece of technical debt that existed in Fedora’s package management stack was\nthat it technically shipped  versions of the DNF package manager concurrently,\nwhich is exactly as bad as it sounds. Both versions had their own configuration,\nfeature sets and behavioural quirks.</p><p>DNF5, the newer version, introduces the ability to automatically transition\npackages across vendors. This is important for us, as it streamlines our ability to\nseamlessly replace our Asahi-specific forks with their upstreams packages as we get our code merged.\nDNF4 cannot do this, and until Fedora Linux 41 was the default version used when running \nfrom the command line. To make matters worse, PackageKit, the framework used by GUI\nsoftware stores like KDE Discover, only supports DNF4’s API. Or rather, it \nonly support DNF4’s API.</p><p>Neal has been working with the both the DNF and PackageKit teams to make this work\nseamlessly. To that end, he <a href=\"https://github.com/PackageKit/PackageKit/pull/931\">developed</a>\na DNF5-based backend for PackageKit, allowing GUI software managers to take advantage of\nthis new feature. This will be <a href=\"https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/PackageKit-DNF5\">integrated</a>\nin Fedora Linux 44, however we will also be shipping it in the upcoming Fedora Asahi Remix 43.</p><p>The automated transition to upstream packages will begin with Mesa and virglrenderer\nin Fedora Asahi Remix 44.</p><p>Sven, chaos_princess, Neal and Davide met up at FOSDEM in Belgium last month to discuss\nstrategies for supporting M3 and M4, and to try their luck at nerd sniping folks into\nhelping out. Additionally, both Neal and Davide will once again be at at <a href=\"https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/23x\">SCaLE</a>\nnext month. Davide will be hosting an Asahi demo system at Meta’s\nbooth, so be sure to drop in if you’re attending!</p><p>2026 is starting off with some exciting progress, and we’re hoping to keep it coming.\nAs ever we are extremely grateful to our supporters on <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/AsahiLinux\">OpenCollective</a>\nand <a href=\"https://github.com/sponsors/AsahiLinux\">GitHub Sponsors</a>, without whom we would\nnot have been able to sustain this effort through last year.

      "content": "<p>I could have never guessed 6 years ago that I'd be sitting here today with a new Thinkpad writing this blog post from my NVIM editor. If you asked me 6 years ago if I thought I would have to go back to prison, I would have said \"Absolutely not\". But, I  go back to prison, and I am here writing this blog post. And today, I do think it happened for a reason.</p><p>No young person ever consciously thinks \"You know, I think I might mess my entire life up. Older me can just handle it later.\" But whether we like it or not, that's how it goes for some people. And in that respect, I'm \"some people\".</p><p>Against my adolescent judgement I started using at 14 with a group of older kids. By 16 I caught my first criminal charge which led to a prolonged stay in a youth center, but I wasn't about to let that stop me. I spiraled into a cycle of trouble, release, trouble, release. By 21 I was back in prison, this time \"big boy\" prison where I'd spend the next two and a half years of my life. Those years catch us up to \"6 years ago\".</p><p>From there I was released and almost before I could make it home was re-arrested for the same old stuff, but this time it seemed like I was out of second chances. I got 18 years in all but 7 years suspended, which, for those of you that haven't spent time around prisons, means I would serve 7 years in the state prison, and if I messed up I would then serve another 11 years.</p><p>Now, you may have noticed that the math surrounding my release doesn't add up. How could I be writing this? .</p><p>In the Covid days, any arrest meant mandatory quarantine, so 14 days on intake on 23 and 1's. That means 23 hours in your cell, 1 hour out per day. It also meant that you were by yourself...for the entire 14 days, unless someone else happend to be arrested at the same time. Because I was arrested in a county with just over 67k people I spent all 14 days alone.</p><p>So I had time to reflect. The natural feelings of hopelessness mixed with withdrawals, which really made my head spin. My kids' mother had passed away just a couple months prior, and I had once again let them down and spiraled into chaos, and here I was, with no way out. I knew I had done it this time, no more \"second chances\". But as I lay in my cold sweats staring at the white bricks on the wall, I felt that maybe I could do something to change my predicament. I asked the guy in the cell over if he had pen and paper. Amazingly he did, and I got to work. This time, one way or the other, was going to be different. Even if they slapped me with 20 years, I'd be someone that the people I love could be proud of when I walked out.</p><p>Over the next 13 months I studied anything and everything I could. I read about economics, fitness, engineering, technology, and finance. I read books like Magee's Technical Analysis of Stock Trends for fun, filling entire pads of paper with notes. Shortly into my stay I made a call to a number that I wasn't even sure was my future wife's. I'd known her nearly my entire life, and she was arguably the only person that's always been there for me outside of my Gram. We hadn't spoken in a few years, but quickly remembered why we fell in love all those years ago and re-kindled a relationship that neither of us were expecting. It felt too good to be true, but although I was facing a slew of charges with no end in sight I had her, I had my books, and my kids were healthy. Though I didn't know it at the time, I had God. My future wife and I were making bulletproof plans, they just didn't have a start date yet.</p><p>In October of 2022, after what felt like a life-time of back and forth, I was finally handed that sentence: 18 years total with 7 to serve immediately.</p><p>According to the Judge I was lucky, and looking back I would agree, it was the best thing to ever happen to me. Within a week of sentencing I was transferred to an intake facility (MCC), and then shortly thereafter was pushed along to Maine State Prison. I was still \"new\" to the system because I was in on new charges, so I had to start at \"level 1\". Maine has a level period, you start at level 1 with the ability to move up to level 4 with good behavior. While at lower levels you're restricted in what areas you can live, when you can go to rec, what programming you can do, those kinds of things. So at the beginning it was all I could do to stay sane and just keep moving forward.</p><p>I kept studying, still reading tirelessly, calling my now wife and kids whenever I could get access to a phone. I Immediately signed up for college upon being given the opportunity, and MSP was its own kind of education. A roommate tried to cut me with a razor becase I asked him not to leave dirty dishes in the sink. That's the kind of place it was. But I kept my head down, and kept studying. As with everything in DOC, it was a hurry up and wait game. I would quickly rise in levels and earned my minimum-custody level right at my 5 year mark (5 years left). At that point I was eligible for a lower custody due to my behavior and I was transferred to my \"final resting spot\" at BCF (Bolduc Correctional Facility) in June of 2023.</p><p><strong>This is where the everything started to look up</strong>.</p><p>I bolted for the education department as soon as I arrived, speaking to the education director about my plans. I told he about what I wanted to accomplish with my incarceration and she (Thanks Jen) got to work helping me. At the time I was on a waitlist for college at MSP, and at BCF I would be eligible to start college that next semester in 2 months. I was incredibly excited, but honestly, a little confused. I had dropped out of high school and gotten my GED a couple of months into my sophomore year, felt there was a high probability I was unprepared for college.</p><p>Within a few weeks I met with my advisor to pick classes, but for some odd reason I was only be allowed to take 2 classes for my first semester, and couldn't pick my own major, which seemed frustrating at first. But, things happen for a reason, and I still remember it plain as day when in the middle of our conversation the advisor said, \"Ya, most undergraduate degrees usually take about 4 years or so, I would expect you to be able to finish in probably 5 or 6\"</p><p>...Did I hear that right? Is she saying I'm stupid?</p><p>I was angry and confused at the time, but, I'm glad she said it, because it gave me the ambition to find a way, and find a way I did. My first two classes were \"Intro to Programming\" and \"Interpersonal Thinking\", it was never my intention to get into software engineering, especially to the extent that I have now, I wanted to be an electrical engineer. I've always been a tinkerer, and I wanted to work with my hands and build electrical products, but I guess God had a different plan, because there was absolutely no electrical engineering path available.</p><p>I had 5 years (at least) of dead time, so there was no chance I was going to sit around and wait for an opportunity in an electrical engineering program. The next closest thing was Information Technology. I had always loved computers, and was in an afterschool \"computer club\" during my middleschool years, but never was willing to get more serious than some HTML on MySpace.</p><p>Information technology was my option and I was going for it.</p><p>I quickly became infatuated with that intro to programming course, Professor Graziano made this \"Python\" thing fun, and I enjoyed it, as Mr.Graziano would put it, Computer Science was about the science of \"What could be computed\" and that stuck, with me. What I was doing didn't feel like that, but I sure did enjoy writing plain text that magically transformed into algorithms and visuals on the screen.</p><p>That first semester lit a fire in me and I was starting to love this idea of software engineering. But I also realized I didn't want to just \"learn about the science of what could be computed\", I wanted to learn how to write the strings of text that could transform into the magic that was in front of my eyes. But to be clear, I didn't just want to know that it worked, I wanted to know why it worked.</p><p>UMA was the only school that I could go to within MDOC so I started to devise a plan. What would happen if I could just take all of the courses that UMA had to offer that were somewhat related to a Computer Science degree, and then , I'd find another school, transfer as many credits as possible, and finish there? I started to research like it was going out of style. I worked in the plate shop at 6:30 AM to 2:30 PM, then would program and do my school work until count (at 9:45 PM) and then research, research, and research.</p><p>I learning about how transfer credits worked, what was required for a Computer Science degree, what schools allowed transferring what. I dove into pricing, really everything I possibly could. This led me to alternative credit pathways; CLEP exams, ACE credits, anything that could transfer toward a degree in Computer Science. Administration let me sign up, and I started stacking credits alongside my UMA courses. I took Linux, C++, and Machine Learning. Anything related to the knowledge I was searching for, and all while working at the plate shop full-time.</p><p>Not too long after starting that second semester I was hired for the position of \"Resident Tech Worker\" at BCF and introduced to Preston Thorpe (github.com/pthorpe92) and where things really took off. In Preston and I's first meeting he showed me a world that academic programming never would have, he introduced me to the idea of Linux as a tool for development, Neovim, and showed me what config files were. Preston started teaching me Go, and what things like a \"server\" and \"containers\" were.</p><p>He recommended I get on Boot.dev if I was going to study online, so I did (and quickly moved up to the top 100 on the leaderboard). On Boot.dev I got to work and dove even deeper into the depths of backend engineering and Go, because I wanted to learn something lower-level than Python. It was a new world to me, and excited me in a way so much different than Python. By this time I had about finished my second semester, I had taken alternative credit courses and worked on guided projects that Preston recommended. I was also still full-time at the plate shop, and was faced with a tough decision.</p><p>I felt that I couldn't continue doing so much, so it was time to take a chance on myself. I wanted to be done with the plate shop, and go pedal to the metal on my new found passion. It was a tough decision, but the plate shop wasn't making me rich. I mean, I was \"prison rich\" at $5.50 an hour, but I decided to take the plunge. I spoke to my bosses at the plate shop, and even wrote a letter to the director of the facility and explained what I wanted to do, and why I thought I could be successful. In June of 2024 I put in my 2 weeks notice at the plate shop and went full-time on this software engineering idea. Needless to say, it paid off, Preston's mentor-and-friendship landed me an internship at Unlocked Labs in October of 2024, my first ever programming job.</p><p>The incredible thing is that I was able to work as a programmer while still serving my 18-all-but-7-year sentence. In August, I got my Associates of Applied Science from Pierpont just 11 months after beginning at UMA with the help of my alternative credits. In December my manager (Josh T.) informed me that Unlocked Labs was interested in bringing me on full-time! By this time, I have accrued about 140-150 college credits between CLEP's, ACE, and my credits from UMA and it was time to figure out where to go next.</p><p>Research led me to Thomas Edison State University in New Jersey due to their transfer credit policy, and in May of 2025 I enrolled for my final semester with the degree I wanted, Computer Science. I know you don't  a degree to be a software engineer. But this was never about opening doors, it was proving to myself that I'm not just some criminal from a small town in Maine that never got past 10th grade. My semester at TESU would be fun, and I took classes way more computer science'y than anything at UMA. I wrapped up my capstone by writing a paper titled \"Blockchain Anchored Identity Credentials and Cryptographic Watermarking as Countermeasures to AI Driven Impersonation\". This paper finalized my undergraduate career with a nicely designed certificate, and a perfect 4.0 academic career.</p><p>I went on to graduate in August of 2025 with my degree in Computer Science and around 160 college credits in about 24 months flat. You could say it was just a bit faster than the projected 5-6 years. Graduating allowed me a little more free time to dig deeper into the things I am really interested in, deeper systems programming, Rust, distributed systems, things like that. With the help of Martin Nisser from the University of Washington and MIT I was able to start a first-of-its-kind Rapid Prototyping and Digital Fabrication class at BCF, a class where 12 residents learn about robotics, programming, 3D printing, and what it takes to bring an idea about an electronic product from idea to fruition.</p><p>The class allowed residents to play with electronics, 3D print models that they designed themselves, and allowed me the opportunity to 3D print Halloween and Christmas toys to donate to people in need. It even provided residents the opportunity to surprise their children at visits with a cool toy. This class has officially been added into the Brave Behind Bars network with hopes of expanding it into other prisons across the state and country as well as another cohort in BCF next fall.</p><p>In January of 2026 I was granted a privilege I never thought possible. I was released about 18 months early from my sentence to Maine's SCCP program. It's for people that have put in substantial work in the corrections setting and who are believed to be rehabilitated enough to be let back out on the street. That's where I write to you from today. I'm almost a month out from that January 16th day that changed my life, and doing the same stuff I've been doing for the last 2 and a half years. I wake up, I write code, I try to learn, I write some more code, I work, and I even still meet with Preston once a week.</p><p>The difference is, I now do it in the comfort of my home, with my beautiful wife, and my daughter in the next room. When I was arrested almost 6 years ago you could have asked me a thousand questions, and I can almost guarantee that none of my answers would have included me sitting here today. But, I beleive God had a plan, if it wasn't for my Wife coming back into my life, or a member of the corrections staff from when I was in Juvy now being the head of educational IT, or even if that same man wouldn't have introduced me to Preston, or if any of a thousand stars hadn't aligned in the last 5 years, I wouldn't be here.</p><p>Yes, it was me who gave up the old bad habits, and yes I was willing to work 16 hours a day for a long time, but at the end of the day, the people who helped me; my wife, Preston, staff that took chanced on me, the first manager to believe in me, and the professors who made me stop and think about things, were a huge part of my transformation. There were so many amazing things I was able to do, and opportunities I was able to participate in. To you all, I owe my life, and I just hope I can continue to prove the chances you took on me will never be in vain, because today I lead a life worlds different than I could have ever imagined. One so much more worth living.</p><p>Also, sidenote! I do have high hopes of writing technical posts from here on out. I think writing can help me learn and be better, and that's all I want to do. I want to get better at my craft, day in and day out, and if you've made it this far, thanks for sharing with me some of your time, and if you want to connect or work together, please, email me! -&gt; <a href=\"mailto:clydekallahan@gmail.com\">clydekallahan@gmail.com</a></p>",

      "content": "<p>Alright, another Tuesday, another meeting about 'transformative' blockchain applications. This time, it's the inevitable DePIN pitch, again. Two years in, and we’re still talking about Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks as if they're some nascent revolution. News flash: they're mostly glorified, token-incentivized IoT networks with all the inherent security vulnerabilities of the latter, layered with the regulatory and operational complexities of actual physical infrastructure. We’re not building Skynet; we're mostly just building a more expensive, less reliable way to manage sensors and routers, then slapping a 'decentralized' label on it to attract speculative capital. The underlying engineering challenges haven't magically vanished because you've got a DAO overseeing them. If anything, they've compounded, introducing new vectors for failure and friction that traditional centralized systems, for all their faults, have at least had decades to iron out.</p><h2>DePINs: The Perennial 'Future of X', Still Struggling with 'Present of X'</h2><p>Let's cut through the marketing jargon, shall we? A DePIN, at its core, purports to build and maintain physical infrastructure – think 5G networks, energy grids, sensor arrays, data storage – using a decentralized network of participants incentivized by cryptocurrency tokens. The promise is lower costs, increased resilience, and censorship resistance. The reality, in mid-2026, is a patchwork of nascent projects, some with genuine technological ambition, many more clinging to a vague 'web3' ethos as a substitute for sound engineering and sustainable economics. We’ve seen the cycles: blockchain for finance, blockchain for supply chain, blockchain for NFTs, blockchain for the metaverse, and now blockchain for your local cellular tower. Each iteration brings a fresh wave of VC funding and a familiar pattern of overpromising and under-delivering on the 'decentralized' aspect once confronted with the physics and economics of the real world.</p><p>The inherent contradiction is glaring. Physical infrastructure demands capital-intensive deployment, continuous maintenance, rigorous safety standards, and often, significant regulatory oversight. Trying to shoehorn this into a model reliant on anonymous, globally distributed, token-incentivized individuals operating at the edge of the network introduces an entirely new class of problems. Who's liable when a decentralized sensor network fails to detect a critical structural defect? Who ensures quality control when the 'maintainers' are just chasing a quick token reward? These aren't minor operational glitches; these are fundamental questions about reliability, accountability, and long-term sustainability that traditional infrastructure providers have entire departments and multi-million dollar budgets dedicated to solving. DePINs, more often than not, wave these away with vague references to 'community governance' or 'on-chain arbitration,' concepts that buckle under the weight of real-world legal and engineering complexities.</p><h2>The Delusion of Decentralization in the Physical Layer</h2><p>True decentralization in the physical realm is an oxymoron, or at best, an extremely limited concept. While the ownership and operational control of the  might be distributed, the physical layer itself is subject to gravity, geopolitics, and physics. A decentralized 5G network still needs antennas, fiber backhaul, and power. These aren't magically self-assembling; they are deployed on real estate, often requiring permits, leases, and local council approvals. They consume electricity, which is generated by centralized power grids. They need physical security, which is provided by centralized law enforcement or private security firms. The actual 'physical infrastructure' part remains stubbornly centralized, or at least localized, regardless of how many tokens are flowing through the network.</p><p>Furthermore, the notion of 'censorship resistance' in physical infrastructure is laughable. If a government decides a particular decentralized wireless node is operating without a license, they don't need to censor a blockchain transaction; they send a crew to physically remove the equipment. If a community decides they don't want a noisy, unsightly array of decentralized weather sensors in their backyard, a DAO vote isn't going to stop the local planning committee. The idea that a cryptographic ledger somehow imbues a physical object with legal or existential immunity from real-world authorities is a profound misunderstanding of how the world operates. We're still operating under the laws of physics and the laws of the land, regardless of how many hashes you compute or how many tokens you mint.</p><h2>Tokenomics: Incentives or Economic House of Cards?</h2><p>The entire DePIN model hinges on tokenomics, specifically the idea of 'proof-of-physical-work' and various staking mechanisms to incentivize deployment and maintenance. The pitch is always the same: participants earn tokens by providing resources – bandwidth, compute power, sensor data, storage. But let's be honest, how many of these models have demonstrated long-term sustainability beyond the initial speculative pump? The token price is inherently volatile, meaning the economic incentive for providing a stable, reliable service fluctuates wildly. A participant investing in expensive hardware today based on a certain token valuation might find their ROI decimated within months if the market dips. This volatility directly undermines the very reliability and stability that critical infrastructure demands.</p><p>We've also seen the rise of 'rent-seeking' behavior, where initial investors or large stakers accumulate disproportionate influence, effectively centralizing control under the guise of decentralized governance. The 'proof-of-X' mechanism itself is often ripe for manipulation. How do you cryptographically prove real-world work without relying on centralized oracles that become single points of failure? For instance, with a decentralized CDN, how do you verify that bandwidth was genuinely served to a real user, and not just self-served or spoofed traffic to game the reward system? These are not trivial problems; they are fundamental challenges to the integrity and economic viability of these networks. Without robust, provable, and ungameable proof mechanisms, the entire economic incentive structure collapses into a sophisticated Ponzi scheme where early adopters profit from the continuous influx of new participants buying tokens to earn rewards from fabricated 'work'.</p><pre><code>\n// Example of a naive Proof-of-Physical-Work (PoPW) function that is easily gamed\nfunction verifyBandwidthProvided(deviceId, reportedBytes, challengeResponse) public view returns (bool) {\n    // In a real scenario, 'challengeResponse' would need to be cryptographically linked\n    // to actual data transfer, ideally with a decentralized verifier network.\n    // This is where most PoPW systems fall apart in practice due to oracle dependency or sybil attacks.\n    // For now, let's just assume a placeholder.\n    if (reportedBytes &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; challengeResponse == keccak256(abi.encodePacked(deviceId, \"verify_token\"))) {\n        // This is highly simplified and vulnerable. A real system needs far more.\n        return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n}\n\n// And the token distribution mechanism might look something like this:\nfunction distributeRewards(deviceId, bytesProvided) public {\n    require(verifyBandwidthProvided(deviceId, bytesProvided, msg.data), \"Invalid proof of work\");\n    uint256 rewardAmount = calculateReward(bytesProvided);\n    // Logic to mint and transfer tokens to deviceId's owner.\n    // This reward pool is often inflationary, leading to downward pressure on token value.\n    _token.mint(ownerOf[deviceId], rewardAmount);\n}\n    </code></pre><h2>Technical Debt and Scalability Nightmares</h2><p>Beyond the economic volatility, the technical hurdles are immense. Integrating real-world IoT devices with blockchain infrastructure introduces a whole host of latency, bandwidth, and processing power challenges. Most edge devices aren't designed to be full blockchain nodes, nor should they be. This necessitates complex off-chain/on-chain communication architectures, often relying on centralized relays or specialized gateways, once again eroding the 'decentralized' promise. The data generated by these physical networks can be enormous. Storing, verifying, and indexing petabytes of sensor data on a blockchain is, to put it mildly, computationally prohibitive and financially absurd with current tech stacks. Even with Layer 2 solutions and specialized sidechains, the inherent limitations of distributed ledger technology for high-frequency, high-volume data streams remain a bottleneck.</p><p>Interoperability is another perpetual headache. DePINs often create their own siloed ecosystems, each with its bespoke hardware requirements, communication protocols, and token standards. Integrating these disparate networks into a cohesive \"decentralized internet\" or \"decentralized smart grid\" is a pipe dream without a massive, coordinated effort that goes against the very ethos of independent, community-driven projects. We’re building more islands, not bridging oceans. And let's not even start on security. IoT devices are notoriously insecure. Adding a crypto layer doesn't magically patch firmware vulnerabilities or prevent physical tampering. If anything, it raises the stakes, making these endpoints attractive targets for attackers looking to exploit the reward mechanisms or compromise the integrity of the network's data. Supply chain attacks on the hardware itself are a persistent, terrifying threat that few DePINs adequately address.</p><h2>The Regulatory Quagmire and Liability Labyrinth</h2><p>This is where the rubber meets the road, or more accurately, where the blockchain meets the legal system and typically gets pulverized. Physical infrastructure operates under stringent regulatory frameworks. Telecommunications, energy distribution, transportation – these are all heavily regulated sectors with licensing requirements, safety standards, and liability laws that vary wildly across jurisdictions. A decentralized network trying to operate globally or even nationally instantly runs into a Byzantine maze of compliance issues. Who is the legal entity responsible for the network? Is it the DAO? Is it the token holders? Is it the individual node operators? The current legal frameworks are ill-equipped to handle such distributed and often pseudonymous structures, leading to a massive regulatory grey area that is ripe for exploitation or, more likely, outright shutdowns by authorities.</p><p>Consider the liability. If a 'decentralized' weather sensor network fails to provide accurate data, leading to property damage or even loss of life, who is accountable? The smart contract? The developers who wrote it? The participants who deployed nodes? The concept of \"immutable code is law\" doesn't stand up in a court of law when physical harm occurs. Traditional infrastructure companies carry immense insurance policies and have clear lines of accountability precisely because of these risks. DePINs largely sidestep this by distributing risk to individual participants, who are often unaware of the potential legal ramifications or simply can't afford the legal battles. This isn't innovation; it's externalizing risk onto the most vulnerable actors while claiming 'decentralization' as a shield.</p><h2>Cynical 2026 DePIN Risk Assessment: Centralized vs. Decentralized Infrastructure</h2><p>Let's put some numbers to this charade. Below is a comparison of typical risks for a mature, centralized infrastructure versus its theoretical DePIN counterpart in 2026. Note the glaring disparities in accountability and regulatory overhead.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Centralized Infrastructure (e.g., Telco, 2026)</th><th>DePIN (e.g., Decentralized 5G Mesh, 2026 State)</th><th>Cynical 2026 Risk Assessment</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Large corporate CAPEX, debt financing, equity issuance.</td><td>Crowdsourced (token sales, individual participant hardware investment).</td><td>Volatile, highly dependent on token market sentiment. Risk of insufficient funding for critical upgrades.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Maintenance &amp; Reliability</strong></td><td>Dedicated O&amp;M teams, SLAs, redundant systems, planned upgrades.</td><td>Individual participant responsibility, token incentives (variable).</td><td>Massive disparity in quality. Lack of standardized maintenance. Incentives can falter with token price drops. High churn.</td></tr><tr><td>Licensed entities, dedicated legal/compliance departments, active lobbying.</td><td>Largely undefined, relies on 'decentralized' ambiguity or project-level engagement.</td><td>Severe exposure to legal challenges, shutdowns. Individual operators bear legal risk without corporate backing.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Security (Cyber &amp; Physical)</strong></td><td>Multi-layered enterprise-grade security, physical security, disaster recovery.</td><td>Blockchain layer security often strong, but IoT endpoint and physical security highly varied/weak.</td><td>The weakest link problem is exacerbated. Distributed attack surface is massive.

The blockchain community’s tendency to abstract away real-world complexities with elegant cryptographic solutions often falls flat when confronted with a rusted antenna, a broken power line, or a cease-and-desist order from a utility regulator. We're still trying to use smart contracts to enforce agreements about things that require physical intervention, legal recourse, and massive capital expenditure, all while operating in a legal vacuum.</p><p>Even the most successful DePINs, if you can call them that, often end up with significant centralized components – whether it's the core development team, a centralized foundation, or specific hardware manufacturers. This isn't a bug; it's a feature necessitated by the practicalities of scaling and maintaining complex systems. The illusion of complete decentralization might be potent for fundraising, but it's a significant hindrance to delivering robust, reliable, and compliant services at scale. The dream of a permissionless, trustless global network of physical devices sounds great in a whitepaper, but it usually devolves into a permissioned, trust-layered network dependent on a few key players, just like everything else, only with extra steps and more token speculation.</p><h2>Conclusion: Still Waiting for the Infrastructure, Not Just the Network Hype</h2><p>So, where are we in 2026? DePINs are still very much in the experimental phase, despite the millions, if not billions, poured into them. They've shown glimpses of potential in niche applications or areas where regulatory oversight is minimal and the cost of failure is low. But for anything resembling critical infrastructure – the kind that truly impacts lives and economies – they are nowhere near mature enough to replace or even seriously compete with established centralized providers. The hurdles of sustainable tokenomics, genuine decentralized governance, robust real-world proof mechanisms, regulatory compliance, and physical security remain largely unaddressed or solved with compromises that undermine the very principles they claim to uphold.</p><p>Perhaps in another five or ten years, with significant advancements in regulatory frameworks, oracles, hardware integration, and a more pragmatic approach to what 'decentralized' actually means in a physical context, we might see genuine breakthroughs. Until then, DePINs will remain an interesting, albeit often frustratingly flawed, experiment on the fringes of the infrastructure world, generating more whitepapers and token pumps than actual, reliable infrastructure. So, next time someone pitches you a DePIN, ask them who's going to replace the broken fibre optic cable at 3 AM on a Tuesday, and watch them fumble for a blockchain-native answer that doesn't involve calling a centralized utility company.</p>",

Performance is the main priority here, my goal was that the user shouldn't feel any delay between the first opening keystroke and being able to interact with the prompt, while also minimizing UI flickering. To pull that off, async programming and multithreading are a must, and I think Iced is the perfect tool for a pure Rust solution.</p><p>Right now, it’s fairly light on CPU usage (even lighter than wofi --show drun without any icons) and more memory efficient. While it doesn’t have every single feature Wofi does yet, it’s a solid alternative if you just care about launching apps and browsing files.</p><p>For the keyboard-only enthusiasts, you can map every action to any keybinding you want. And of course, you can customize the theme for your rice.</p><p>I'm fairly new to Wayland compositors and tiling window managers, and I noticed that most of them recommend Wofi or similar launchers. I created Lucien because of the ergonomics of Wofi, specifically its lack of mouse support and \"close on focus lost.\"</p><p>I get that the point of a tiling window managers is to be keyboard-driven, but I like having the ability to interact with my system using the mouse sometimes.

stabilization,\nand how people can help.</p><p>On <a href=\"https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/246057-t-cargo/topic/TOML.201.2E1/near/564132825\">Zulip</a>,\nwe discussed the transition for Cargo.\nUsers could inadvertently use a TOML v1.1 feature and bump the required version of Cargo to parse their manifest.\nThis is one of many reasons why <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/rust-version.html#support-expectations\">we encourage those keeping a  to verify it in CI</a>.\nHowever, the impact will be limited because  rewrites the published ,\nincluding using only TOML v0.5 or earlier features.\nThe impact for this will mostly be felt when using a\n<a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/overriding-dependencies.html#the-patch-section\">git patch</a>\nto the original repo.</p><p>There is one caveat in this:\n does not currently preserve whether <a href=\"https://docs.rs/toml_datetime/0.7.5+spec-1.1.0/toml_datetime/struct.Time.html\">seconds or nanoseconds in a time</a> were omitted or ,\nassuming that seconds is never omitted and that 0 nanoseconds is always omitted.\nIf  starts to preserve this information  a  field uses a time (likely only in a  field)  the user formats their time using the new syntax,\nthen  will generate a rewritten  that requires a new version of Cargo to parse.</p><p>Cargo could detect that a TOML v1.1 feature is used and warn if the  field is too old but we didn't view this as blocking because this is the same situation as any other field we have today that you can use that will bump your MSRV.</p><p>Cargo support for TOML v1.1 was merged on December 28th\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/16415\">#16415</a>).</p><p>There has long been a desire for  to also format  files\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt/issues/4091\">rustfmt#4091</a>).\nOne major blocker for this work is that the <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/style-guide/cargo.html\">official style guide for  files</a> does not align with existing or expected uses of  files.\nProposed ideas for the style guide had been discussed on\n<a href=\"https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/246057-t-cargo/topic/.60Cargo.2Etoml.60.20style.20guide/near/380796244\">Zulip</a>\nbut the conversation stalled out.</p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/iepathos\">iepathos</a> stepped in and expanded the formatting rules,\nincluding some gnarly work to adjust between single and multi-line arrays\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/crate-ci/cargo-cargofmt/pull/37\">cargo-cargofmt#37</a>).\nFormatting inline tables to multi-line was deferred out as it would likely require a new <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/style-guide/editions.html\">Style Edition</a> to ensure the package's MSRV is high enough to support it.</p><p>Previously, unstable support for <code>--lockfile-path ../Cargo.lock</code> had been added (<a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/14326\">#14326</a>).\nIn <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/15510\">#15510</a>,\nwe got a request to also support setting it via an environment variable.\nIn discussing this, we felt we should shift the implementation away from a CLI flag to a config field as that would support the environment variables and CLI (through ).\nIn particular, something we try to keep in mind is how easily someone can look at  and find what they are looking for.\nThe more flags that exist, the more likely it is that a user won't find the flag they are looking for, the less value users get out of all flags as people instead work around what they presume to be the lack of support for a feature.\nThis came up before in the discussion of  /  (<a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/6100\">#6100</a>).\nIn weighing the scope of this feature,\n\"hiding\" it away in config seems the best course of action.</p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/weihanglo\">weihanglo</a> added  in <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/16510\">#16510</a>.\nWe'll remove  in another development cycle to allow callers time to transition.</p><h3><a

Cargo is checking if the current manifest is part of a workspace.</p><p>We can at least improve the error message which we are tracking in <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/6706\">#6706</a>.\nIt would also help if we discouraged new users from accidentally creating packages in their home directory\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/16562\">#16562</a>).</p><p>For the nightly manifest case,\nCargo could check if the parent  has a  table and skip it by delaying the nightly feature check.\nHowever, a nightly feature could impact workspace discovery.</p><p>For manifests, a workaround is to add an empty  to your package.\nHowever, if you run  in a subdirectory, it will automatically be added as a member.\nWe could extend <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-workspace-field\"><code>package.workspace = \"&lt;path&gt;\"</code></a>\nwith <code>package.workspace = &lt;bool&gt;</code> for opting in or out of auto-discover of the workspace.\nFor this case, you could insert <code>package.workspace = false</code> to avoid walking ip the directory tree.\nCargo script is starting with workspace auto-discovery disabled and this could be how we allow enabling it.\nThis idea is being tracked in <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/16563\">#16563</a>.</p><p>We would like to more broadly improve the workspace and config discovery behavior which we are tracking in <a

This year will also mark five years that Asahi Linux has been around for bringing Linux to the Apple M-Series hardware.\n<p>Their latest progress report began by commenting that the DisplayPort Alt Mode support with USB-C -- a very frequent question from users -- will be \"done when it's done\". There still is a \"fairy dust\" branch with their downstream code in current form but not officially supported.\n</p><p>With much of the workable Asahi Linux support so far being on Apple M1 / M2 hardware while Apple already being up to M5 hardware, the other common question is around newer hardware support. As for Apple M3 hardware support their progress report notes:\n</p><blockquote>\"In fact, the current state of M3 support is about where M1 support was when we released the first Arch Linux ARM based beta; keyboard, touchpad, WiFi, NVMe and USB3 are all working, albeit with some local patches to m1n1 and the Asahi kernel (yet to make their way into a pull request) required. So that must mean we will have a release ready soon, right?\n<p>A lot has changed in five years. We have earnt a reputation for being the most complete and polished AArch64 desktop Linux experience available, and one of the most complete and polished desktop Linux experiences in general. It is a reputation that we are immensely proud of, and has come at a great personal cost to many. We will not squander it or take it for granted.\n</p><p>Ideally, the current state of M1 and M2 support should be the baseline for any general availability release for M3. We know that’s not realistic, however nor is releasing a janky, half-baked and unfinished mess like the initial ALARM releases all those years ago. So, what needs to be done before we can cut a release? Quite a bit, actually.\n</p>...\n<p>We don’t expect it to take too long to get M3 support into a shippable state, but much as with everything else we do, we cannot provide an ETA and request that you do not ask for one.\"</p></blockquote>Asahi Linux developers have also been working to overcome the 60Hz screen limitation on MacBook Pros to allow for a 120Hz refresh rate. Plus overcoming some lingering issues around certain web camera issues, continuing to work on the GPU support, and more.\n<p>See the Asahi Linux project's latest </p><a href=\"https://asahilinux.org/2026/02/progress-report-6-19/\">progress report</a> for more details on the current efforts around running Linux on Apple Silicon hardware.",

Just to name a few:</p><ul><li>Better documentation and understanding of attack surface (e.g. IRP, Threat Modeling, etc)</li><li>Wrote a lot of security-related documentation</li><li>Using SARIF for all security scanners - and added more of them</li><li>Improved GitHub Actions usage to be more secure</li><li>Reviewed and improved SBOMs</li><li>Using OIDC to publish NPM packages</li></ul><p>Granted, we were already doing some things right, mostly thanks to the feedback of our amazing community. For instance, we had signing, SBOMs, and private vulnerability reports for a long time.</p><p>Still, there's always room for improvement!</p><p>One interesting thing I realized whilst talking with other maintainers is that Go has amazing tools for security.</p><ol><li>Go has fuzzing built-in, which is something we definitely want to take more advantage of in the coming months.</li><li><a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck\"></a> is amazing as well, and every Go-based project should run it as part of their pipeline.</li><li>SBOMs can be easily generated with off-the-shelf tools like <a href=\"https://github.com/anchore/syft\"></a>.</li></ol><p>While some projects had to use external dependencies or write custom software to do some of these things, with Go, it was really easy!</p><p>By the way, if you want to make your GoReleaser-powered project a bit more secure, check out <a href=\"https://github.com/goreleaser/example-secure\">this secure example repository</a>: it is using many of the good practices learned during the session.</p><p>Security work is never really done.

I think about that a lot.</p><p>Here’s what I keep running into.</p><p>First, the tool access issue. Companies roll out M365 Copilot licenses across the organization and call it “AI adoption.” But nobody explains what people should actually use it for. It’s like handing everyone a Swiss Army knife and then wondering why they only ever use the blade. Without use cases, it just becomes an expensive icon in the ribbon.</p><p>Then there’s the trust gap. You’ve got senior engineers and specialists with 20+ years of experience. They’ve built careers on judgment and precision. Of course they don’t blindly trust AI output and for safety-critical or compliance-heavy work, they absolutely shouldn’t. But for drafting, summarizing, structuring ideas, or preparing first passes? The resistance ends up costing them hours every week.</p><p>The measurement problem is another big one. “We deployed AI” sounds impressive, but it’s meaningless. The real question is: which exact workflows got faster? Which tasks became more accurate? Which processes got cheaper? Most organizations never measure at that level. So they can’t prove value — and momentum fades.</p><p>Governance is where things get uncomfortable. Legal, compliance, cybersecurity, HSE, they need clear boundaries. Where can AI be used? Where is it off-limits? What data is allowed? Many companies skip this step because it slows things down. Then someone uses ChatGPT to draft a contract, and suddenly everyone panics.</p><p>And finally, scaling. One team figures out an incredible AI workflow that saves hours every week. But it stays within that team. There’s no structured way to share what works across departments. So instead of compounding gains, progress stays siloed.</p><p>What I’ve seen actually work:</p><ul><li>Prompt libraries tailored to specific roles, not generic “how to use AI” guides</li><li>Clear guardrails on when AI is appropriate (and when it isn’t)</li><li>Department-level champions who actively share workflows</li><li>Measuring time saved on specific tasks instead of vague “productivity boosts”</li></ul><p>Enterprise AI adoption isn’t a tech rollout. It’s a behavior shift.</p><p>Curious, if you’re working on this inside your organization, what’s blocking you right now?</p>",

      "content": "<p>At <a href=\"https://www.vectorware.com/\">VectorWare</a>, we are building the first<a href=\"https://www.vectorware.com/blog/announcing-vectorware/\">GPU-native software company</a>. Today, we are excited to\nannounce that we can successfully use Rust's\n<a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/future/trait.Future.html\"></a> trait and\n/ on the GPU. This milestone marks a significant step towards our vision\nof enabling developers to write complex, high-performance applications that leverage the\nfull power of GPU hardware using familiar Rust abstractions.</p><h2>Concurrent programming on the GPU</h2><p>GPU programming traditionally focuses on data parallelism. A developer writes a single\noperation and the GPU runs that operation in parallel across different parts of the\ndata.</p><figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=\"\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"rust\" data-theme=\"github-dark github-light\"><code data-language=\"rust\" data-theme=\"github-dark github-light\"></code></pre></figure><p>This model works well for standalone and uniform tasks such as graphics rendering,\nmatrix multiplication, and image processing.</p><p>As GPU programs grow more sophisticated, developers use <a href=\"https://cs.stanford.edu/~sjt/pubs/ppopp14.pdf\">warp\nspecialization</a> to introduce more complex\ncontrol flow and dynamic behavior. With warp specialization, different parts of the GPU\nrun different parts of the program concurrently.</p><figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=\"\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"rust\" data-theme=\"github-dark github-light\"><code data-language=\"rust\" data-theme=\"github-dark github-light\"></code></pre></figure><p>Warp specialization shifts GPU logic from uniform data parallelism to explicit\ntask-based parallelism. This enables more sophisticated programs that make better use of\nthe hardware. For example, one warp can load data from memory while another performs\ncomputations to improve utilization of both compute and memory.</p><p>This added expressiveness comes at a cost. Developers must manually manage concurrency\nand synchronization because there is no language or runtime support for doing so.\nSimilar to threading and synchronization on the CPU, this is error-prone and difficult\nto reason about.</p><h2>Better concurrent programming on the GPU</h2><p>There are many projects that aim to provide the benefits of warp specialization without\nthe pain of manual concurrency and synchronization.</p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/jax-ml/jax\">JAX</a> models GPU programs as computation graphs that encode\ndependencies between operations. The JAX compiler analyzes this graph to\ndetermine ordering, parallelism, and placement before generating the program that\nexecutes. This allows JAX to manage and optimize execution while presenting a high-level\nprogramming model in a Python-based DSL. The same model supports multiple hardware\nbackends, including CPUs and TPUs, without changing user code.</p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/triton-lang/triton\">Triton</a> expresses computation in terms of blocks\nthat execute independently on the GPU. Like JAX, Triton uses a Python-based DSL to\ndefine how these blocks should execute. The Triton compiler lowers block definitions\nthrough a <a href=\"https://pytorch.org/blog/triton-kernel-compilation-stages/\">multi-level\npipeline</a> of <a href=\"https://triton-lang.org/main/dialects/dialects.html\">MLIR\ndialects</a>, where it applies\nblock-level data-flow analysis to manage and optimize the generated program.</p><p>More recently, NVIDIA introduced <a href=\"https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda/tile\">CUDA Tile</a>.\nLike Triton, CUDA Tile organizes computation around blocks. It additionally introduces\n\"tiles\" as first-class units of data. Tiles make data dependencies explicit rather than\ninferred, which improves both performance opportunities and reasoning about correctness.\nCUDA Tile ingests code written in existing languages such as Python, lowers it to an\nMLIR dialect called <a href=\"https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-tile\">Tile IR</a>, and executes on the\nGPU.</p><p>We are excited and inspired by these efforts, especially CUDA Tile. We think it is a\ngreat idea to have GPU programs structured around explicit units of work and data,\nseparating the definition of concurrency from its execution. We believe that GPU\nhardware aligns naturally with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_concurrency\">structured\nconcurrency</a> and changing the\nsoftware to match will enable safer and more performant code.</p><h2>The downsides of current approaches</h2><p>These higher-level approaches to GPU programming require developers to structure code in\nnew and specific ways. This can make them a poor fit for some classes of applications.</p><p>Additionally, a new programming paradigm and ecosystem is a significant barrier to\nadoption. Developers use JAX and Triton primarily for machine learning workloads where they\nalign well with the underlying computation. CUDA Tile is newer and more general but has\nyet to see broader adoption. Virtually no one writes their entire application with these\ntechnologies. Instead, they write parts of their application in these frameworks and\nother parts in more traditional languages and models.</p><p>Code reuse is also limited. Existing CPU libraries assume a conventional language\nruntime and execution model and cannot be reused directly. Existing GPU libraries rely\non manual concurrency management and similarly do not compose with these frameworks.</p><p>Ideally, we want an abstraction that captures the benefits of explicit and structured\nconcurrency without requiring a new language or ecosystem. It should compose with\nexisting CPU code and execution models. It should provide fine-grained control when\nneeded, similar to warp specialization. It should also provide ergonomic defaults for the\ncommon case.</p><h2>Rust's  trait and /</h2><p>We believe Rust's <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/future/trait.Future.html\"></a>\ntrait and / provide such an abstraction. They encode structured\nconcurrency directly in an existing language without committing to a specific execution\nmodel.</p><p>A future represents a computation that may not be complete yet. A future does not\nspecify whether it runs on a thread, a core, a block, a tile, or a warp. It does not\ncare about the hardware or operating system it runs on. The <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/future/trait.Future.html\">\ntrait</a> itself is intentionally\nminimal. Its core operation is\n<a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/future/trait.Future.html#tymethod.poll\"></a>, which\nreturns either\n<a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/task/enum.Poll.html#variant.Ready\"></a> or\n<a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/task/enum.Poll.html#variant.Pending\"></a>.\nEverything else is layered on top. This separation is what allows the same async code to\nbe driven in different environments. For more detailed info, see the <a href=\"https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/\">Rust async\nbook</a>.</p><p>Like JAX's computation graphs, futures are deferred and composable. Developers construct programs as values before executing them.\nThis allows the compiler to analyze dependencies and composition ahead of execution\nwhile preserving the shape of user code.</p><p>Like Triton's blocks, futures naturally express independent units of concurrency.\nDepending on how futures are combined, they represent whether a block of work runs\nserially or in parallel. Developers express concurrency using normal Rust control flow,\ntrait implementations, and future combinators rather than a separate DSL.</p><p>Like CUDA Tile's explicit tiles and data dependencies, Rust's ownership model makes data\nconstraints explicit in the program structure. Futures capture the data they operate on and that captured\nstate becomes part of the compiler-generated state machine. Ownership, borrowing,\n<a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/pin/struct.Pin.html\"></a>, and bounds such as\n<a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/marker/trait.Send.html\"></a> and\n<a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/marker/trait.Sync.html\"></a> encode how data can be\nshared and transferred between concurrent units of work.</p><p>Warp specialization is not typically described this way, but in effect, it reduces to\nmanually written task state machines.\nFutures compile down to state machines that the Rust compiler generates and manages\nautomatically.</p><p>Because Rust's futures are just compiler-generated state machines there is no reason\nthey cannot run on the GPU. That is exactly what we have done.</p><h2>A world first:/ running on the GPU</h2><p>Running / on the GPU is difficult to demonstrate visually because the code\nlooks and runs like ordinary Rust. By design, the same syntax used on the CPU runs\nunchanged on the GPU.</p><p>Here we define a small set of async functions and invoke them from a single GPU kernel\nusing . Together, they exercise the core features of Rust's async model:\nsimple futures, chained futures, conditionals, multi-step workflows, async blocks, and\nthird-party combinators.</p><figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=\"\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"rust\" data-theme=\"github-dark github-light\"><code data-language=\"rust\" data-theme=\"github-dark github-light\"></code></pre></figure><p>Getting this all working required fixing bugs and closing gaps across multiple compiler\nbackends. We also encountered issues in NVIDIA's  tool, which we reported and\nworked around.</p><p>Using / makes it ergonomic to express concurrency on the GPU. However, in\nRust futures do not execute themselves and must be driven to completion by an executor.\nRust deliberately does not include a built-in executor and instead third parties provide\nexecutors with different features and tradeoffs.</p><p>Our initial goal was to prove that Rust's async model could run on the GPU at all. To do\nthat, we started with a simple\n<a href=\"https://docs.rs/futures/latest/futures/executor/fn.block_on.html\"></a> as our\nexecutor.  takes a single future and drives it to completion by repeatedly\npolling it on the current thread. While simple and blocking, it was sufficient to\ndemonstrate that futures and / could compile to correct GPU code. While\nthe  executor may seem limiting, because futures are lazy and composable we\nwere still able to express complex concurrent workloads via combinators and async\nfunctions.</p><p>Once we had futures working end to end, we moved to a more capable executor. The Embassy\nexecutor is <a href=\"https://embassy.dev/\">designed for embedded systems</a> and operates in Rust's\n environment. This makes it a natural fit for GPUs, which lack a traditional\noperating system and thus do not support Rust's standard library. Adapting it to run on\nthe GPU required very few changes. This ability to reuse existing open source libraries\nis much better than what exists in other (non-Rust) GPU ecosystems.</p><p>Here we construct three independent async tasks that loop indefinitely and increment\ncounters in shared state to demonstrate scheduling. The tasks themselves do not perform useful computation. Each task awaits a simple\nfuture that performs work in small increments and yields periodically. This allows the\nexecutor to interleave progress between tasks.</p><figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=\"\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"rust\" data-theme=\"github-dark github-light\"><code data-language=\"rust\" data-theme=\"github-dark github-light\"></code></pre></figure><p>Below is an <a href=\"https://asciinema.org/\">Asciinema</a> recording of the GPU running the async\ntasks via Embassy's executor. Performance is not representative as the example runs\nempty infinite loops and uses atomics to track activity. The important point is that\nmultiple tasks execute concurrently on the GPU, driven by an existing, production-grade\nexecutor using Rust's regular /.</p><p>Taken together, we think Rust and its async model are a strong fit for the GPU. Notably,\nsimilar ideas are emerging in other language ecosystems, such as NVIDIA's\n<a href=\"https://github.com/nvidia/stdexec\"></a> work for C++. The difference is these\nabstractions already exist in Rust, are widely used, and are supported by a mature\necosystem of executors and libraries.</p><h2>Downsides of Rust's / on the GPU</h2><p>Futures are cooperative. If a future does not yield, it can starve other work and degrade\nperformance. This is not unique to GPUs, as cooperative multitasking on CPUs has the\nsame failure mode.</p><p>GPUs do not provide interrupts. As a result, an executor running on the device must\nperiodically poll futures to determine whether they can make progress. This involves\nspin loops or similar waiting mechanisms. APIs such as\n<a href=\"https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#miscellaneous-instructions-nanosleep\"></a>\ncan trade latency for efficiency, but this remains less efficient than interrupt-driven\nexecution and reflects a limitation of current GPU architectures. We have some ideas for\nhow to mitigate this and are experimenting with different approaches.</p><p>Driving futures and maintaining scheduling state increases register pressure. On GPUs,\nthis can reduce occupancy and impact performance.</p><p>Finally, Rust's async model on the GPU still carries the same <a href=\"https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/\">function coloring\nproblem</a>\nthat exists on the CPU.</p><p>On the CPU, executors such as <a href=\"https://tokio.rs/\">Tokio</a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/DataDog/glommio\">Glommio</a>, and\n<a href=\"https://github.com/smol-rs/smol\">Smol</a> make different tradeoffs around scheduling,\nlatency, and throughput. We expect a similar diversity to emerge on the GPU. We are\nexperimenting with GPU-native executors designed specifically around GPU hardware\ncharacteristics.</p><p>A GPU-native executor could leverage mechanisms such as <a href=\"https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-programming-guide/04-special-topics/cuda-graphs.html\">CUDA\nGraphs</a>\nor CUDA Tile for efficient task scheduling or shared memory for fast communication\nbetween concurrent tasks. It could also integrate more deeply with GPU scheduling\nprimitives than a direct port of an embedded or CPU-focused executor.</p><p>At VectorWare, we have recently <a href=\"https://www.vectorware.com/blog/rust-std-on-gpu\">enabled  on the GPU</a>.\nFutures are  compatible, so this does not impact their core functionality.\nHowever, having the Rust standard library available on the GPU opens the door to richer\nruntimes and tighter integration with existing Rust async libraries.</p><p>Finally, while we believe futures and / map well to GPU hardware and align\nnaturally with efforts such as CUDA Tile, they are not the only way to express\nconcurrency. We are exploring alternative Rust-based approaches with different tradeoffs\nand will share more about those experiments in future posts.</p><h2>Is VectorWare only focused on Rust?</h2><p>We completed this work months ago. The speed at which we are able to make progress on\nthe GPU is a testament to the power of Rust's abstractions and ecosystem.</p><p>As a company, we understand that not everyone uses Rust. Our future products will\nsupport multiple programming languages and runtimes. However, we believe Rust is\nuniquely well suited to building high-performance, reliable GPU-native applications and\nthat is what we are most excited about.</p><p>Follow us on <a href=\"https://x.com/vectorware\">X</a>,\n<a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/vectorware.com\">Bluesky</a>,\n<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/vectorware/\">LinkedIn</a>, or subscribe to our\n<a href=\"https://www.vectorware.com/blog\">blog</a> to stay updated on our progress.

For a project the size of PyTorch, leveraging typing and type checking has long been essential for ensuring consistency and preventing common bugs that often go unnoticed in dynamic code.</p> <p>Migrating to Pyrefly brings a much needed upgrade to these development workflows, with lightning-fast, standards-compliant type checking and a modern IDE experience. With Pyrefly, our maintainers and contributors can catch bugs earlier, benefit from consistent results between local and CI runs, and take advantage of advanced typing features. In this blog post, we’ll share why we made this transition and highlight the improvements PyTorch has already experienced since adopting Pyrefly.</p> </blockquote> <p>Full blog post: <a href=\"https://pytorch.org/blog/pyrefly-now-type-checks-pytorch/\">https://pytorch.org/blog/pyrefly-now-type-checks-pytorch/</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/BeamMeUpBiscotti\"> /u/BeamMeUpBiscotti </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://pytorch.org/blog/pyrefly-now-type-checks-pytorch/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1r777dn/pytorch_now_uses_pyrefly_for_type_checking/\">[comments]</a></span>",

But what you wrote is all really helpful, thanks.</p> <p>Hey folks, </p> <p>I&#39;m currently setting up a cluster, and because I want it to be done properly, I intend to use gitops via Argo or Flux (I&#39;m still reading into both of them to see which one is better for my use case).</p> <p>However, based on my current understanding there seems to be an issue that I haven&#39;t yet found answer to:</p> <p>From what I gathered, the CD brothers both synchronize the state of the cluster with their model of the cluster gathered from one or multiple target repositories. That includes both adding resources that are in the repo but not in the cluster, and purging resources that are in the cluster but not in the repo.</p> <p>However, I also intend to run several controllers or programs on the cluster that add their own pods or resources through their base functionality. Examples would be the gitlab runner, which runs Jobs to build CI pipelines, cert manager which creates and updates Certificate objects and secrets and potentially I intend to write my own controller for a specific purpose that would rely on having its own custom resource within namespaces of other applications.</p> <p>So my big question is: If there&#39;s such a controller that does these things, will those added resources be directly purged by Argo/Flux, thus breaking the functionality of whatever operator created those resources?</p> <p>I understand that at least for Argo you can annotate individual resources for it to ignore them, but unless the controller can actually be configured in an &quot;there&#39;s ArgoCD present&quot; way, I can&#39;t efficiently control that those annotations actually are there. So is there a more systemic way of doing it? Like telling it to just straight up ignore a specific CR (I suppose this could be done alternatively with a MutatingWebhook, but less viable when it involves default resources), or even more broadly to make it go &quot;If I didn&#39;t add it into the cluster, I won&#39;t remove it from the cluster?&quot;</p> <p>I obviously understand that especially that latter setting can become very prone to making the entire point of having Argo or Flux moot, but for the sake of argument let&#39;s assume I could somehow ensure that anything that&#39;s added without gitops is indeed just resources from automated software and not some impulsive kubectl command.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Suthek\"> /u/Suthek </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1r74ece/help_me_understand_this_interaction_of_argoflux/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1r74ece/help_me_understand_this_interaction_of_argoflux/\">[comments]</a></span>",

When you buy through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. <a href=\"https://www.pcguide.com/earnings-disclaimer/\">Read More</a></div><p>Players fed up with cheaters in their Rocket League ranked matches can rejoice, as developers Psyonix are adding Easy Anti-Cheat to the game. The addition of the popular anti-cheat software does raise some questions from players, however, especially those worried about how it may affect Linux compatibility and mod support. Psyonix has already responded to a few of these concerns.</p><p>Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC) is coming to the game during Season 22. The current season (Season 21) is due to end on March 11, though we already know that the new EAC implementation won’t be ready until April; no specific date has been given just yet. Psynoix promises <a href=\"https://www.pcguide.com/news/a-great-week-for-linux-gaming-as-gog-plans-support-and-bazzite-has-a-brighter-future-with-new-collab/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Linux</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://www.pcguide.com/steam-deck/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Steam Deck</a> will still be supported, and popular mod features are being integrated into the game.</p><h2>Easy Anti-Cheat will support Linux in Rocket League</h2><p>The developers claim Linux operating systems (including the Steam Deck’s native SteamOS) “will still be supported with Easy Anti-Cheat on” when running through “apps like Proton”. This is the compatibility layer developed by Valve that lets Windows games run on Linux and has been a huge reason why the Steam Deck is so successful.</p><p>The bad news is that Psyonix confirms mods will not run with EAC enabled, but it can be toggled off so you can play with mods in offline gamemodes. So, training scenarios and other offline tools won’t be affected. Toggling EAC on/off requires a game restart.</p><blockquote><p>Players on PC will have the option to launch Rocket League with Easy Anti-Cheat on or off. It will need to be enabled to queue for online matches, private matches, and tournaments. Mods will not run when it’s enabled.</p><p>When Easy Anti-Cheat is turned off, you can run mods while playing offline matches, training, LAN matches, and viewing Replays while using custom video editing tools. Community content like Steam Workshop maps is playable with or without Easy Anti-Cheat enabled, but you’ll want it off if you run mods on top of the content.</p></blockquote><p>To help soften the blow of a lack of online support for mods like “Rocket League trainer” <a href=\"https://bakkesmod.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">BakkesMod</a>, Psyonix is implementing a few useful features found in the BakkePlugins library directly into the game. This includes the ability to display MMR in-game (like the popular <a href=\"https://bakkesplugins.com/plugin/282\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">IngameRank mod</a>, which has over 2 million downloads), custom training options, and a flip reset indicator. Anyone who tries to load BakkesMod with EAC mod enabled won’t be banned either; a developer’s <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/comments/1r6gp5e/comment/o5q4c4e/?context=8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">response on Reddit</a> confirms that players will just be met with an error message with no penalty.</p><p>Overall, this seems like a positive change for the community and a much-needed way of combating cheaters and bots. The developers say EAC “elevates our ability to detect and ban cheaters in real time, and is part of a broader effort that includes additional bot detection methods, and DDoS attack prevention”.</p><div><div><img src=\"https://www.pcguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/jack-goodall-pc-guide-96x96.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div></div>",

However, these are often sequence-to-sequence tasks: learning to map actions (permutations) to states, which is incompatible with the next-token prediction setting commonly used to train language models. We address this gap by converting permutation composition into code via REPL traces that interleave state-reveals through prints and variable transformations. We show that linear RNNs capable of state-tracking excel also in this setting, while Transformers still fail. Motivated by this representation, we investigate why tracking states in code is generally difficult: actions are not always fully observable. We frame this as tracking the state of a probabilistic finite-state automaton with deterministic state reveals and show that linear RNNs can be worse than non-linear RNNs at tracking states in this setup.</p>",

So for example I have apps likes that:</p> <p>myhosting.lan/documents - one app</p> <p>myhosting.lan/smarthome - second app</p> <p>and go on. Problem is - normally in HTML template I use static folder like /static/css, but root from / is change to myhosting.lan/documents/static/css. For Caddy server Caddyfile is like that:</p> <p><code>:80 {</code></p> <p><code>#apps routes</code></p> <p><code>reverse_proxy documents* localhost:8081</code></p> <p><code>reverse_proxy smarthome* localhost:8082</code></p> <p><code># handling default menu app</code> </p> <p><code>reverse_proxy localhost:8080</code></p> <p><code>}</code></p> <p>Inside HTML I have something like:</p> <p><code>&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;/static/css/bootstrap.min.css&quot;&gt;</code><br/> <code>&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;/static/css/dark-icons.css&quot;&gt;</code> </p> <p>Problem is obvious.

Centralized storage, indexing, retention policies - all of that matters.</p> <p><strong>Telescope</strong> still supports that model and isn&#39;t trying to replace it.</p> <p>But there are situations where aggregation doesn’t help:</p> <ul> <li>when your logging pipeline is broken</li> <li>when logs are delayed</li> <li>when you’re debugging locally and don’t have a pipeline at all</li> </ul> <p>That&#39;s where direct Kubernetes access becomes useful.</p> <h1>When the pipeline breaks</h1> <p>Log delivery pipelines fail. Configuration mistakes happen. Collectors crash. Network links go down.</p> <p>When that happens, the logs are still there - inside the pods - but your aggregation system can&#39;t see them.</p> <p>The usual fallback is: <code>kubectl logs -n namespace pod-name</code></p> <p>Then another terminal.<br/> Another namespace.<br/> Another pod.</p> <p>It works, but correlation becomes manual and painful.</p> <p>With Kubernetes as a native source, <strong>Telescope</strong> lets you query logs across:</p> <ul> <li>multiple namespaces</li> <li>multiple pods (via label selectors and annotations)</li> <li>multiple clusters</li> </ul> <p>…in a single unified view.</p> <h1>Local development is an even bigger gap</h1> <p>For local Kind / Minikube / Docker Desktop clusters, setting up a full logging stack is often overkill.</p> <p>Most of us default to:</p> <ul> <li><code>kubectl logs</code></li> <li><code>stern</code></li> <li>multiple terminal windows</li> </ul> <p>But once you need to correlate services - database, API, frontend, ingress - it becomes hard to follow what’s happening across components.</p> <p><strong>Telescope</strong> treats your cluster like a queryable log backend instead of a raw stream of terminal output.</p> <h1>How this differs from kubectl or stern</h1> <p><code>kubectl logs</code> is perfect for single-pod inspection.<br/> <code>stern</code> improves multi-pod streaming.</p> <p>But both are stream-oriented tools. They show raw output and rely on you to mentally correlate events.</p> <p><strong>Telescope</strong> adds:</p> <ul> <li>structured filtering (labels, annotations, time range, message fileds)</li> <li>severity normalization across different log formats</li> <li>graphs showing log volume over time</li> <li>saved views (shareable URLs instead of bash aliases)</li> <li>multi-cluster queries</li> </ul> <p>Instead of watching a stream, you can query your cluster logs like a dataset.</p> <h1>How it works</h1> <ul> <li>Uses your existing <code>kubeconfig</code></li> <li>Fetches logs in parallel (configurable concurrency)</li> <li>Caches contexts / namespaces / pod lists</li> <li>Uses time-range filtering (<code>sinceTime</code>) to reduce data transfer</li> </ul> <p>No agents.

Everything compiles fine, but then runtime drift silently drops fields and breaks things in production.</p> <p>I originally built <a href=\"https://github.com/pbufio/pbuf-registry\"><strong>pbuf-registry</strong></a> to fix this. It’s a self-hosted protobuf module registry (think <code>go mod</code> but for protos) with immutable semver tags and per-module RBAC. But honestly, the project died in late 2023 because I changed jobs and the problem wasn&#39;t <em>my</em> problem anymore.</p> <p>Fast forward to December 2025. I found the repo again. Two years of dust, outdated dependencies, and half-finished features. The amount of work needed was enough to make me want to close the tab immediately and forget about the project for a couple of more years. But I decided to try something different: treat AI like a small engineering team and see if it could handle the grunt work.</p> <p><strong>It actually worked surprisingly well.</strong> The AI helped smoothly modernize the registry by updating golang version and libraries to be up-to-date. It wrote the Postgres migrations and the boilerplate for the new ACL system. It even slapped together a functional Vue UI in no time. Basically, it did the boring-but-necessary stuff I would have procrastinated on for years.</p> <p><strong>What it couldn&#39;t do:</strong> The actual engineering. The architecture, the design for schema drift detection, and the product logic were still all me. But because the friction of the chores was gone, I was able focus purely on the interesting parts. Eight weeks later (working at a totally relaxed pace), I’ve got four real releases out, drift detection is live, and RBAC is shipped.</p> <p>To be clear, the registry is still in the early stages. No massive star count or production adoption yet. But it’s straightforward and it works: push versioned proto files, then pin and vendor them with a single command across your other repos.</p> <p>I’m curious about two things:</p> <ol> <li>Is proto dependency chaos actually a pain point for your team, or have you solved it another way?</li> <li>Has anyone else used AI to &quot;un-abandon&quot; a side project?

      "content": "<p>Hey everyone, it’s already been two months since the last blog post!<p>\nToday I’m back to share some behind-the-scenes about the struggles and development of a new functionality for Sniffnet: </p>, a.k.a. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/issues/170\">the most requested feature</a> since the very beginning of the project.</p><h3>What’s process identification?</h3><p>With  in a network monitoring context, I mean the possibility to discover which application or program is responsible for a given network connection.</p><p>This can be determined by looking at the open TCP/UDP ports on the system and finding out which process is currently using them.</p><p>If implementing this feature seems like a no-brainer to you,  read on because it turned out to be a much more complex task than I could imagine, and this is the reason why the related GitHub issue has been open for almost 3 years.</p><h3>Challenges in implementing process identification</h3><p>First of all, the implementation is highly : each platform has its own directories and data structures storing such information, and APIs to interact with them are often not well documented or written in C (therefore not very ergonomic to use from Rust). \nAnd unfortunately, there is no Rust library ready-to-use satisfying the needs of Sniffnet.</p><p>One could argue that this is a solved problem, since there are already existing tools to do it: for instance, on Linux and Windows you have , and on macOS you have  or . \nHowever, these tools are not designed to be used as libraries and spawining a shell to execute them repeatedly is not efficient, especially if you want to monitor the network activity in real-time. <p>\nMoreover, they don’t provide all the information Sniffnet needs, such as the process name and path.</p></p><p>But the biggest challenge is another one: the least system-intrusive ways to implement the feature are , meaning that they require to read the system state at a given moment in time and do some computations to find out the associations between open ports and their owning processes. \nI’m referring to using  on macOS, the  filesystem on Linux, and  on Windows. \nThis is not a problem in itself, but it generates the need to do this processing very efficiently, and it leads to cases where it’s not possible to retrieve process information at all.<p>\nFor instance, short-lived connections can go undetected and system processes with elevated privileges can be hidden to user-space applications for security reasons.</p></p><p>More system-intrusive approaches exist, such as using  to intercept the system calls responsible for creating network connections. \nAn example of this is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ebpf.io/what-is-ebpf/\">eBPF</a> on Linux, which requires to run privileged code inside the kernel. \nOn macOS, you’d even need entitlements from Apple to be able to do something similar through their <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/networkextension\">Network Extension framework</a>. \nWhile these approaches are way more accurate, they go against Sniffnet’s philosophy of being a lightweight, non-intrusive, and friendly app that can be installed by anyone.</p><p>After considering all the options, I decided to go with the snapshot-based approach. \nDespite being aware it’s not flawless, I believe it to be the best compromise for Sniffnet’s use case.</p><h3>The library behind the feature: </h3><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/GyulyVGC/listeners\"></a> is an open-source library I’ve been working on for the past 2 years with the goal of supporting this feature.</p><p>Being Sniffnet a cross-platform application, I needed a solution that could work on different Operating Systems:\nno other Rust crate provides this functionality supporting multiple platforms and the existing ones are not maintained or satisfactory enough even for a single OS.</p><p>Interestingly, I also had this same need at my job, where we also wanted a Rust way to do it: this motivated me even further to contribute to the library. \nAfter two years, I’m happy to see that  was downloaded 150k times and has now multiple public dependents both on  and GitHub, which means that this is a problem shared among many people.</p><p>Just some days ago <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/GyulyVGC/listeners/releases/tag/v0.4.0\">v0.4.0</a> was published.\nI’m particularly proud of this release for at least two reasons:</p><ol><li> was introduced thanks to my colleague <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/antoncxx\">Anton</a> (in addition to the already existing support for Windows, Linux, and macOS).To my knowledge there is no existing crate at all that does something similar targeting FreeBSD and this is an added value for the library, even if at the moment we’re using Rust-to-C bindings for this.<p>Huge props to Anton for his contribution, and for having also started adding support for OpenBSD and NetBSD exactly in these hours.</p></li><li>I’ve spent the past week’s nights <strong>testing and extensively benchmarking</strong> the library, considerably improving the APIs performance.I had so much fun using <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://crates.io/crates/criterion\"></a> to benchmark it under different system loads, and I’ve made the results generation completely automated on GitHub Actions runners for all the supported platforms.You can find the results and more charts in the README’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/GyulyVGC/listeners?tab=readme-ov-file#benchmarks\">Benchmarks section</a>.</li></ol><p>Thanks to point 2, I now judge the library <strong>mature, fast, and reliable enough</strong> for use in Sniffnet.</p><p>If you’re a Rust developer, you’re more than welcome to contribute to the library trying to make it even faster, or adding support for more Operating Systems (Android and iOS? Why not!).</p><h3>How Sniffnet will implement the feature</h3><p>Sniffnet will use  to look up the process for each observed network connection, and will show it in the UI’s  and  pages.</p><p>Additionally, it will use another library called <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/GyulyVGC/picon\"></a> (I’m still working on it) to retrieve app icons given their program path, showing them in the UI as well to make it easier to identify processes at a glance.</p><p>The workflow I plan to use is indeed pretty complex, including  to minimize performance impact and  to maximize the chances to correctly retrieve process information for a given open port.</p><p>In the flowchart below I’ve outlined a draft of the strategy I’ll adopt for Sniffnet-side implementation of the feature.</p><p>I hope this post wasn’t too scary to read\nand that it gave you an idea of how much work is behind a seemingly simple feature like this.</p><p><em>Nothing worth having comes easy</em>, someone says.</p>",

What we found genuinely alarmed us.</p><p>We identified over 18,000 OpenClaw instances exposed directly to the public internet. But the scarier part: when we audited community built skills, nearly 15% contained what we'd classify as malicious instructions. We're talking prompts designed to download malware, exfiltrate sensitive data, or steal credentials. And there's this frustrating pattern where malicious skills get flagged, removed, then reappear under new identities within days. It's endless.</p><p>The attack surface here is qualitatively different from traditional software vulnerabilities and I don't think the ML community has fully internalized this. These agents have delegated authority over local files, browsers, and messaging platforms (WhatsApp, Slack, Discord, Telegram). A single compromised skill doesn't just affect the skill's functionality; it potentially compromises everything the agent can touch. Attackers don't need to target you directly anymore, they target the agent and inherit its permissions.</p><p>Prompt injection is the obvious vector everyone talks about, but the supply chain risk from community skills is what's actually keeping me up at night. Unlike npm packages or PyPI modules where there's at least some security tooling and community review norms, agent skills are essentially unreviewed prompt bundles with execution capabilities. The OpenClaw FAQ itself acknowledges this is a \"Faustian bargain\" with no \"perfectly safe\" setup. At least they're honest about it, but adoption is outpacing any reasonable security review.</p><p>There's also this failure mode we've been calling \"judgment hallucination\" internally. Users anthropomorphize these systems and over delegate authority because the agent appears to reason competently. I've watched colleagues give these things access to their entire digital lives because \"it seems smart.\" The trust calibration problem is severe and I don't see anyone working on it seriously.</p><p>I've been digging around for any standardized approach to evaluating agent security posture. Found some scattered resources like OWASP's LLM guidelines, a few academic papers on prompt injection taxonomies, and stumbled across something called Agent Trust Hub that's trying to catalog these risks. But honestly the whole space feels fragmented. We're building the plane while flying it and nobody agrees on what the instruments should even measure.</p><p>Seriously though, has anyone here audited other agent frameworks like AutoGPT or BabyAGI for similar issues? And for those running agents in production, what does your threat model actually look like? I'm curious whether people are treating these as trusted code execution environments or sandboxing them properly.</p>",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>tl;dr: After some recent trials I had an epiphany about computer architecture, etc., decided to invest my time in creating an adaptive Linux scheduler. The mission wasn&#39;t to have the best scheduler ever, but to have a really good scheduler that adapts to its users over time. PANDEMONIUM is the result of those efforts.</p> <p>After researching Linux schedulers, I found the sched_ext capability in the Linux kernel. Given this finding I set out to discover other schedulers already utilizing sched_ext. Thru this I found the scx projects utilizing BPF, etc. The other piece of the project was to begin learning Rust. With Rust&#39;s capabilities, its role was chosen for userspace-driven optimizations within the scheduler. The intent was not to replace the Linux scheduler, scx schedulers, etc., but to focus on user experience in Linux.</p> <p>The primary driver of the project was to feel responsive in heavy, multitask load and/or near idle in relatively the same manner. The architecture is a BPF layer in kernel-space paired with a Rust adaptive control loop that watches workload patterns and tunes parameters on the fly. PANDEMONIUM classifies every task by its behavior—wakeup frequency, context switch rate, runtime, sleep patterns—and makes scheduling decisions based on those patterns. There are three tiers of classification during usage: latency-critical, interactive and batch. PANDEMONIUM also learns across process lifetimes, ie the 500th cc1 fork from make -j12 starts as BATCH immediately instead of going through classification warmup after the first instance.</p> <p>Gaming. This architecture was also driven toward the ever growing gaming ecosystem in Linux. When a game&#39;s render thread wakes after GPU completion, getting scheduled in &lt;120us vs 1000us+ is the difference between hitting the vsync deadline and missing it. Compositors (kwin, sway, Hyprland) get auto-boosted so the Wayland frame path stays prioritized. The mixed workload scenario—game, OBS, Discord, browser—is exactly what the regime detection was designed for. The game and compositor stay latency-critical while encoding threads get wide batch slices.</p> <p>Numbers based on AMD Zen 12 cores, kernel 6.18, clang 21:</p> <p>P99 wakeup latency under full CPU saturation:</p> <table><thead> <tr> <th>Cores</th> <th>EEVDF </th> <th>PANDEMONIUM</th> <th>Improvement</th> </tr> </thead><tbody> <tr> <td>2 </td> <td>830-995us </td> <td>85-119us </td> <td>8-10x </td> </tr> <tr> <td>4 </td> <td>827-884us </td> <td>78-101us </td> <td>8-10x </td> </tr> <tr> <td>8 </td> <td>822-1596us</td> <td>67-83us </td> <td>12-19x </td> </tr> <tr> <td>12 </td> <td>941-1632us</td> <td>68-95us </td> <td>10-17x </td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>Benchmark methodology: make -j(N) kernel builds saturating all online cores while a separate latency probe measures wakeup-to-run delay. Each run collects thousands of samples per scheduler.

There is no fancy graphics involved, it is just a simple gameplay with real K8s concepts underneath.</p> <p>It is based on Posemons who are Pokémon-inspired characters, and the challenges are themed like quests / battles - but they’re based on real Kubernetes issues. Think about broken deployments, YAML debugging, Pods stuck in Pending, taints/tolerations, etc.</p> <p>I know similar ideas exist - for example, KodeKloud has experimented with gamifying Kubernetes in the past but that used to run on the browser and may be required an active subscription? I also a saw similar post on this sub a few minutes back. However, I drew my inspiration from a project on Github by a fellow dev called Manoj that explored a similar direction. This is my own spin on the idea, focused on a terminal-based, story-driven experience.</p> <p>It is just a personal experiment to gamify infra learning. I mainly want to gauge the interest around it before actually going full throttle on this.

If you nuke a connection string or an API key, you can just step back through the history of that variable or roll back the change entirely since everything is versioned. It makes sharing configurations secure as you can encrypt the entire database with a password, so you can pass the file around without leaving secrets in plain text. It also lets you inject variables into a subprocess so they only exist for that specific command, which keeps your shell clean and prevents secrets from leaking into your terminal history.

A compiler is already the “idea to binary” machine, except it has a formal language, a spec, deterministic transforms, and a pipeline built around checkability. Same inputs, same output. If it’s wrong, you get an error at a line and a reason.</p> <p>The “skip the code” pitch is basically saying: let’s remove the one layer that humans can read, diff, review, debug, and audit, and jump straight to the most fragile artifact in the whole stack. Cool. Now when something breaks, you don’t inspect logic, you just reroll the slot machine. Crash? regenerate. Memory corruption? regenerate. Security bug? regenerate harder. Software engineering, now with gacha mechanics. 🤡</p> <p>Also, binary isn’t forgiving. Source code can be slightly wrong and your compiler screams at you. Binary can be one byte wrong and you get a ghost story: undefined behavior, silent corruption, “works on my machine” but in production it’s haunted...you all know that.</p> <p>The real category error here is mixing up two things: compilers are semantics-preserving transformers over formal systems, LLMs are stochastic text generators that need external verification to be trusted. If you add enough verification to make “direct binary generation” safe, congrats, you just reinvented the compiler toolchain, only with extra steps and less visibility.</p> <p>I wrote a longer breakdown on this because the “LLMs replaces coding” headlines miss what actually matters: verification, maintainability, and accountability.</p> <p>I am interested in hearing the steelman from anyone who’s actually shipped systems at scale.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/tirtha_s\"> /u/tirtha_s </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://open.substack.com/pub/engrlog/p/why-skip-the-code-ship-the-binary?r=779hy&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=true\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1r65ee0/why_skip_the_code_ship_the_binary_is_a_category/\">[comments]</a></span>",

However, for my research, I require classical ML models (specifically PCA and Gaussian Process Regression), but could not find an Equinox-native library in the ecosystem that was as straight-forward and consistent as scikit-learn.</p><p>eqx-learn aims to address this, with a JAX-based take on the scikit-learn API. All models in the library are ultimately Equinox Module's, and can be fit using the library's free \"fit\" function. The design is such that models simply \"advertise\" their capabilities by implementing specific methods (e.g. solve(X, y), condition(X, y), loss(), and the \"fit\" function then fits/trains the model accordingly. I believe that this de-coupling of capabilities vs fitting algorithm fits the JAX style better, and also has lots of potential.</p><p>At the moment, eqx-learn addresses all my research needs, but I thought it may be useful to share the library online to advertise that it exists, and mention that I am happy to accept PRs for additional models and fitting algorithms!</p><p>Although there are no docs, there are short examples in the repo :).</p>",

But after launching his AI production banner General Cinema Dynamics, he now has three features in production.</p><p>\n\t“I go out there and try to get stuff made, and it’s almost impossible,” Avary said. “And then I built a technology company over the last year, basically making AI movies, and all of a sudden, boom, like that, money gets thrown at it. All of a sudden, just by attaching the word ‘AI’ and [the fact] that it’s a technology-based company, all of a sudden, investors came in, and we’re in production on three films now.”\n\n\t</p><p>\n\t“It was so easy for me to get that going and so difficult for me to get a traditional movie going through the traditional route,” he added. “Just put AI in front of it and all of a sudden you’re in production on three features.”\n\n\n</p><p>\n\tAvary’s three AI films are “a family Christmas movie that’ll be in theaters this holiday season,” a “faith-based movie for next Easter” and a “big romantic war epic.”</p><p>\n\tWhile filmmakers like Avary are taking advantage of the AI boom, many in Hollywood fear the technology will bring seismic, irreversible changes to the industry. These fears were further realized on Tuesday when a user plugged a two-line prompt into AI video generator Seedance 2.0 and created a polished, hyper-realistic clip for <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/RuairiRobinson/status/2021394940757209134\">Tom Cruise fighting Brad Pitt</a>.

ByteDance should immediately cease its infringing activity,” read the statement.</p>",

You set up your analysis once — name it, pick your dimensions, describe your own product. From there, the agents handle everything — finding competitors, researching them, keeping data fresh. You review results, give feedback, and make decisions. The dashboard is a control layer, not an input layer.</p><p>Why not just ChatGPT + Excel?</p><p>- Persistence: Data lives in a structured database, not a chat window</p><p>- Sources: Every fact is linked to where it came from</p><p>- Updates: Agent updates specific data points instead of starting over.

The core ones are <strong>select, move, rotate, scale, extrude, loop cut, knife, delete, and create edge/face</strong>.</p> <p>These are enough to model most basic shapes. Other tools mainly exist for convenience or for handling more complex, specific cases, and are usually built after these fundamentals.</p> <h1>Math requirements</h1> <p>You don’t need hardcore graphics programming, but you <em>do</em> need:</p> <ul> <li>Linear algebra basics (vectors, matrices)</li> <li>Transformations in 3D space</li> <li>Quaternions for gizmo rotations</li> <li>Solid algorithmic thinking for mesh operations</li> </ul> <p>Most of the difficulty isn’t pure math—it’s designing robust data structures and writing clean algorithms for geometry manipulation.</p> <h1>Takeaway</h1> <p>If you’re thinking about building a 3D modeling tool on the web:</p> <ul> <li>Treat the renderer as a <strong>viewer</strong>, not your source of truth</li> <li>Build your own mesh data model</li> <li>Use command-based operations early</li> </ul> <p>Hope this helps anyone exploring browser-based 3D tooling.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Sengchor\"> /u/Sengchor </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://github.com/sengchor/kokraf\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1r5vuzv/how_to_build_a_browserbased_3d_modeling_app/\">[comments]</a></span>",

During university, I studied modules in Java, C, embedded systems, databases, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, etc. I also worked in different software development roles using C#, React, and other technologies. But I never really had the chance to deeply specialize in one area.</p> <p>For my thesis, I intentionally chose Machine Learning because I’ve always loved the idea of extracting knowledge from data. While working on my thesis, I got introduced to Kubernetes for the first time, mainly through the MLOps/DevOps side of the project. That part felt extremely complex to me because I lacked strong Linux fundamentals, had limited Bash scripting experience, and basically zero knowledge of CI/CD pipelines.</p> <p>After finishing my thesis, I decided that for the first time, I wanted to specialize seriously. I chose to focus on DevOps/Kubernetes.</p> <p>I started building my own projects:</p> <ul> <li>Watched a lot of videos</li> <li>Read documentation</li> <li>Tried to build production-like use cases</li> </ul> <p>For example:</p> <ul> <li>I deployed a microservices app on Kubernetes with CI/CD using GitHub Actions</li> <li>I implemented GitOps with ArgoCD</li> <li>I configured monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana</li> <li>I used Helm for packaging and deployments</li> <li>I configured Nginx as a reverse proxy and worked with ingress concepts</li> </ul> <p>I also tried to use Terraform, Ansible, and AWS in one project to learn about them, but I decided to first properly finish a solid project with CI/CD, Kubernetes, ArgoCD, GitHub Actions, and networking/proxy configuration before going deeper into infrastructure provisioning.</p> <p>Building these projects taught me a lot and made me more confident in job interviews. My long-term goal is to work as a DevOps/Platform engineer in a team managing production systems at scale, not just doing small projects.</p> <p>But I still feel like I’m missing something. Even after a year of using Kubernetes, it still feels “new.” I can do the common tasks, but I often need to look up commands and concepts.</p> <p>I realized I skipped some fundamentals:</p> <ul> <li>Linux basics</li> <li>Shell &amp; kernel concepts</li> <li>Cron, daemons</li> <li>Bash scripting</li> <li>Pipes &amp; process management</li> </ul> <p>Sometimes I feel like I understand things when building projects, but not deeply enough to feel “solid.” I’m not sure if this is normal or a sign that I need to slow down and reinforce fundamentals.</p> <p>Now I’m wondering:</p> <ol> <li>Am I doing the right thing by going back and focusing on Linux fundamentals?</li> <li>Should I try to learn <em>every</em> tool? <ul> <li>I’m comfortable with ArgoCD, should I also learn FluxCD?</li> <li>I use GitHub Actions, should I also learn Jenkins and GitLab CI?</li> </ul></li> <li>What would be the most optimal next steps if my goal is to become a strong DevOps engineer?</li> </ol> <p>I genuinely want to master this field, and I’m fully ready to commit my time and focus to it. The problem isn’t motivation. it’s direction.</p> <p>I sometimes feel unsure about how to structure my learning in a way that builds real depth, instead of just jumping from one tool to another without developing strong fundamentals.</p> <p>I’d appreciate any advice from people who’ve been through this journey.</p> <p>Thanks in advance 🙏</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/igottomakeit\"> /u/igottomakeit </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1r5ty5i/feeling_lost_on_my_devopskubernetes_journey_what/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1r5ty5i/feeling_lost_on_my_devopskubernetes_journey_what/\">[comments]</a></span>",

A file at home/.bashrc maps to ~/.bashrc, while root/etc/... maps under /etc. Running the tool applies changes from the repo to the machine, and optionally collects newer edits made directly on the machine back into the repo. Deleting a file in the repo prunes it from the destination, so the state converges instead of drifting.</p> <p>What it does:</p> <ul> <li>Syncs files from a source tree to a destination directory</li> <li>Collect mode to pull newer destination edits back into the repo</li> <li>Prunes removed files using a tracked state file</li> <li>Managed &quot;sections&quot; that insert named blocks into existing files instead of replacing them</li> <li>Watch mode to apply changes continuously, suitable for a user systemd service</li> <li>Safe concurrent runs via file locking</li> <li>Permission control: subtract bits with umask, add bits with a simple flag to enable world readability</li> <li>Automatic executable bits for selected directories like bin/</li> <li>Follows source symlinks, follows destination symlinks to folders, but replaces destination symlinked files with real files</li> </ul> <p>The sections feature is particularly useful for shared files such as fstab or hosts. You can keep portable snippets in the repo, and they get merged into the target file, with the ability to later update or remove them as the source file gets updated or removed.</p> <p>I wanted something light with predictable behavior.</p> <p>A typical workflow is to clone the repo (for example ~/.dotfiles), run the tool once for user files, once with sudo for system files, and optionally keep a watch service running so edits in the repo materialize on the machine.</p> <p>I&#39;d love feedback on the idea.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/senotru\"> /u/senotru </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://github.com/senotrusov/etcdotica\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1r5sq6q/ive_made_a_tool_to_keep_dotfiles_and_system/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>",

Opened the official Go client and... to put it mildly, I was shocked. Spent the first 30 minutes debugging why an inline button under a message disappears on its own. Send a message with an inline button — works fine. Edit just the text — button vanishes. Turns out </p> <p>``<code>go type NewMessageBody struct { Text string</code>json:&quot;text,omitempty&quot;<code> Attachments []interface{}</code>json:&quot;attachments&quot;` // ← no omitempty! }</p> <p>func NewMessage() *Message { return &amp;Message{message: &amp;schemes.NewMessageBody{ Attachments: []interface{}{}, // ← always empty slice }} } ``<code> Without \\</code>omitempty`, the empty slice is sent as `&quot;attachments&quot;: []`. The API interprets this as &quot;delete all attachments&quot;. You just want to change the text — and your buttons silently disappear. </p> <p>And that&#39;s just the beginning: </p> <p>- `GetChatID()` for callbacks returns 0 — the ID is available via `Message.Recipient.ChatId`, but the method ignores it. You send a response to nowhere<br/> - 3 different loggers (`log`, `slog`, `zerolog`) in one codebase — the library writes to stdout instead of returning errors. 30+ places where errors are swallowed<br/> - `int64` → `int` casts — breaks on 32-bit platforms<br/> - No `context.Context` in upload methods </p> <p>Rewrote the client from scratch over the weekend:<br/> - Zero dependencies — stdlib only<br/> - All errors are returned, nothing is logged<br/> - `context.Context` everywhere<br/> - Type-safe constructors for buttons and attachments<br/> - Testable via `httptest.Server` </p> <p>Can&#39;t understand how an entire team ships this kind of Go code.

This gives me optimization because I don&#39;t run them on stateless nodes.

In general, I have been happy with it. It has been reliable and sufficiently performant. I recently added a very large test dataset and found that I had a specific performance issue with it when performing parallel reads on multiple goroutines against a simple table with ~6 millon rows in it. This is something I routinely do with <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/mattn/go-sqlite3\">mattn/go-sqlite3</a>. While I didn&#39;t expect the same performance from both, what I saw was at least an order of magnitude worse.</p> <p>I profiled the code running the same prepared stmt many times in parallel goroutines and found:</p> <pre><code> flat flat% sum% cum cum% 0.04s 0.019% 82.13% 137.03s 64.26% modernc.org/sqlite/lib._sqlite3Reprepare </code></pre> <p>The majority of the work being performed in the profile was spent re-preparing the already prepared statements.</p> <p>I subsequently found an issue - <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/cznic/sqlite/-/issues?sort=created_date&amp;state=opened&amp;search=prepared&amp;first_page_size=20&amp;show=eyJpaWQiOiIyMzYiLCJmdWxsX3BhdGgiOiJjem5pYy9zcWxpdGUiLCJpZCI6MTc3OTgwMjkzfQ%3D%3D\">Optimize prepared statements?</a> reporting this same behavior.</p> <p>I researched and could not find any workarounds. I attempted a few on my on. None worked.</p> <p>I knew from past experiences that I could use mattn/go-sqlite3, but I wanted a non-CGO solution. I used kimi-cli with Kimi K2.5 to write <a href=\"https://github.com/lbe/sqlite-read-benchmark\">sqlite-read-benchmark</a> to test the exact pattern with some of the most popular Go SQLite drivers. The results, shown at the end of this post, were consistent with my earlier observations on modernc.org/sqlite. I received a pleasant surprise that <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/ncruces/go-sqlite3\">ncruces/go-sqlite3</a> was over 5 times faster and second only to <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/crawshaw.io/sqlite\">crawshaw.io/sqlite</a> which about 10 times faster.</p> <p>I do not have much experience with WASM and have previously not attempted to use <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/ncruces/go-sqlite3\">ncruces/go-sqlite3</a> because of that. The replacement was fairly smooth, some syntax differences for the DSN string and then some differences in integration and E2E testing having to do with startup times. Nothing major. I was again pleasantly surprised when my application step that previously took 33 minutes was reduced to 1 minute.</p> <p>I wanted to share this experience with others who may be similarly hesitant to give <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/ncruces/go-sqlite3\">ncruces/go-sqlite3</a> a try. </p> <p><a href=\"/u/ncruces\">u/ncruces</a>, <strong>Thank You</strong> for your contributions!</p> <p>lbe</p> <p>Benchmark Results</p> <pre><code>SQLite Driver Benchmark Suite ============================== Database: benchmark.db Reads: 100000 Goroutines: 22 === mattn/go-sqlite3 === Running raw benchmark... raw (22 goroutines): 100000 reads in 4.198395945s = 23819 reads/sec Running prepared benchmark... prepared (22 goroutines): 100000 reads in 2.319155183s = 43119 reads/sec ✓ mattn/go-sqlite3 completed === modernc.org/sqlite === Running raw benchmark... raw (22 goroutines): 100000 reads in 4.37563765s = 22854 reads/sec Running prepared benchmark... prepared (22 goroutines): 100000 reads in 4.154677353s = 24069 reads/sec ✓ modernc.org/sqlite completed === github.com/ncruces/go-sqlite3 === Running raw benchmark... raw (22 goroutines): 100000 reads in 713.712971ms = 140112 reads/sec Running prepared benchmark... prepared (22 goroutines): 100000 reads in 626.007348ms = 159743 reads/sec ✓ github.com/ncruces/go-sqlite3 completed === crawshaw.io/sqlite === Running raw benchmark... raw (22 goroutines): 100000 reads in 3.376629975s = 29615 reads/sec Running prepared benchmark... prepared (22 goroutines): 100000 reads in 403.347256ms = 247925 reads/sec ✓ crawshaw.io/sqlite completed === zombiezen.com/go/sqlite === Running raw benchmark... raw (22 goroutines): 100000 reads in 14.656310718s = 6823 reads/sec Running prepared benchmark... prepared (22 goroutines): 100000 reads in 2.482263816s = 40286 reads/sec ✓ zombiezen.com/go/sqlite completed === github.com/glebarez/sqlite === Running raw benchmark... raw (22 goroutines): 100000 reads in 4.924050485s = 20308 reads/sec Running prepared benchmark... prepared (22 goroutines): 100000 reads in 6.02162578s = 16607 reads/sec ✓ github.com/glebarez/sqlite completed ============================== Benchmark complete! </code></pre> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/LearnedByError\"> /u/LearnedByError </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1r5oza8/issue_moderncorgsqlite_reprepares_statements/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1r5oza8/issue_moderncorgsqlite_reprepares_statements/\">[comments]</a></span>",

My experience with large systems has almost entirely been with pure OOP languages (Java, C# etc.) and languages where I can reach for OOP constructs when it feels necessary (Python, JS/TS, etc.), and I find myself a little lost in Go without the abstractions that I&#39;m used to.</p> <p>In particular, I&#39;m uneasy with this common pattern:</p> <p>- interface (API route, RPC endpoint, etc.) -&gt; business-logic &quot;service&quot; -&gt; database DAO.</p> <p>What is the correct way here to de-couple the &quot;interface&quot; part from the database implementation? With the &quot;service&quot; layer being a stateless collection of functions, I find myself having to obtain a shared database connection object at the earliest opportunity and pass it through the processing layers. But what if I want to switch the middle layer out for a completely different implementation that depends on an RPC executor object rather than a database connection? Does the public-interface handler really have to be aware of the implementation details all the way down its call stack?</p> <p>I know I *could* replicate many OOP-style patterns with interfaces and structs but that seems to me like it wouldn&#39;t be in keeping with the spirit or standards of Go. Really what I&#39;m asking is what the *correct* way is to provide sufficient abstraction that components do not need to be aware of the implementation-specific dependencies of functions they call?</p> <p>Or am I working on a false premise and need to fundamentally re-think the architecture to fit within the accepted practices of Go?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SignificantResource\"> /u/SignificantResource </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1r5hgug/how_to_write_maintainable_go_at_scale/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1r5hgug/how_to_write_maintainable_go_at_scale/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Can these two methods (--update and package manager) coexist, or it&#39;s better to use only one of these?</p> <p>In case you recommend me to use both of them, how should I verify in the --update flag the different places where the binary is stored, I mean, maybe it is under go/bin but it can be in another location if it was installed through dnf</p> <p>I think there are so many questions jejeej, but I just need some guidance about best practices to distribute my CLI tool.

Not on a 50-line script or a trivial refactor on something where a single wrong bit corrupts the entire output.</p> <p>I knew Google&#39;s libwebp was a good candidate: 50k+ lines of C, complex algorithms (arithmetic coding, Huffman trees, DCT, trellis quantization), and no complete pure Go library existed. The perfect challenge.</p> <p>On top of that, the lack of a pure Go WebP lib had been frustrating me for years. Either you go with CGo bindings that break cross-compilation and complicate your Docker builds, a WASM wrapper shipping a binary blob, or pure Go libraries that only handle lossless. Always a compromise.</p> <p>Let me be honest upfront: <strong>I didn&#39;t have the skills to do this myself.</strong> I&#39;m not an expert in codecs, signal processing, or NEON assembly. And today, after this project, I&#39;m still not. This is 100% vibe coding. Claude Code wrote the code, I guided the direction, did the profiling, made the architecture decisions, and pushed the iterations.</p> <p>And surprisingly... it works.</p> <p><strong>What&#39;s inside</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Lossy</strong> (VP8) and <strong>lossless</strong> (VP8L) encoding &amp; decoding</li> <li><strong>Alpha channel</strong> (ALPH chunk with VP8L compression)</li> <li><strong>Animation</strong> (ANIM/ANMF) with sub-frame optimization, keyframe control, mixed codec mode</li> <li><strong>VP8X</strong> extended format with ICC, EXIF, XMP metadata</li> <li><strong>Sharp YUV</strong> conversion for high-quality chroma subsampling</li> <li><strong>Presets</strong>: photo, picture, drawing, icon, text</li> <li>Native <code>image.RegisterFormat()</code> integration <code>image.Decode</code> just works</li> <li><strong>ARM64 NEON</strong> + <strong>AMD64 SSE2</strong> for hot DSP paths</li> <li>CLI tool (<code>gwebp</code>) for encoding, decoding and inspecting WebP files</li> </ul> <p>It wasn&#39;t all smooth sailing. I mainly had to give it comparison points with the C reference and show it how to debug itself. Once a working version was in place, lots of iterations to squeeze out performance profiling, pool reuse, parallel encoding, SIMD assembly. The result is there, but it wasn&#39;t on the first try.</p> <p><code>go get github.com/deepteams/webp</code> and you&#39;re done.

I wanted to make this post here, since Discord has decided to force age assumptions via facial scan and ID verification upon normal people. I also want to say that I&#39;m not associated with Stoat in any capacity. I&#39;m just a new user and want to make others aware of this.</p> <p>First off. Yes, there are other valid alternatives that I&#39;ll list as well that I&#39;ll list here with an explanation of why it didn&#39;t work for me.</p> <ol> <li><a href=\"https://www.teamspeak.com/en/\">Teamspeak</a>: Thanks but no thanks. Screen sharing and audio for voice is amazing, but it&#39;s not the one for me. UI feels scattered and confusing.</li> <li><a href=\"https://matrix.org/\">Matrix</a>: Amazing choice. Very clean look, and audio is great. The biggest issue though, is getting normies to use it. It can be a bit confusing if you&#39;re looking for something to replace discord. It also feels very corporate. But do not sleep on this.</li> <li><a href=\"https://discourse.org/\">Discourse</a>, <a href=\"http://Rocket.Chat\">Rocket.Chat</a>, <a href=\"https://zulip.com/\">Zulip</a>: Yeah no, thanks. I don&#39;t need anything that reminds me of work.</li> <li><a href=\"https://www.whatsapp.com/\">WhatsApp</a>, <a href=\"https://signal.org/\">Signal</a>, <a href=\"https://telegram.org/\">Telegram</a>: Not applicable in my opinion. Extremely different use case. Signal is great. Telegram is alright. Don&#39;t use WhatsApp. :)</li> </ol> <p>I&#39;m not here to judge the software that you use. Use whatever software fits you or your group/use case. I&#39;m only making a post to help &quot;normies&quot; get away from discord. Admittedly, not a lot of them are going to be looking here. So please crosspost (if allowed) to help spread the word as much as possible. I also use void btw, so there might be some differences in steps such as file paths, but it should all be the same. If there is an issue, just leave a comment and we&#39;ll address it together.</p> <p>---</p> <p>With all the boilerplate out of the way: here is how you can use stoat on Linux.</p> <h1>Arch</h1> <p>Use the AUR. If you are not sure how to use the AUR, then you&#39;ll have to find out how. I will not be telling you here.</p> <h1>Everything Else</h1> <ol> <li>Go to <a href=\"https://stoat.chat/\">Stoat&#39;s website</a>, particularly their <a href=\"https://stoat.chat/download\">download page</a>. Alternatively, you can go to their GitHub. If you&#39;re based and don&#39;t trust links, the URL is <a href=\"https://github.com/stoatchat\"><strong>https://github.com/stoatchat</strong></a>.</li> <li>Download the .zip necessary for your instance (if you&#39;re not sure whether x86 or arm, just choose x86).</li> <li>Once you&#39;ve downloaded that .zip file, just extract it as you would any .zip, and rename its folder to &quot;Stoat&quot; for simplicity.</li> <li>Move that new folder you renamed to &quot;Stoat&quot; into <code>~/.local/share/applications/</code>.</li> <li>In your terminal, run: <code>ls ~/.local/share/applications/Stoat/</code>. <ul> <li>If you see output including a file named &quot;stoat-desktop&quot;, great. You&#39;re doing awesome. Keep going.</li> </ul></li> <li>You&#39;ll need to create a desktop entry. So, create a file named &quot;stoat.desktop&quot; and open it in your favorite text editor. Follow this template:</li> </ol> <p>&#8203;</p> <pre><code>[Desktop Entry] Name=Stoat GenericName=Stoat Exec=&quot;~/.local/share/applications/share/Stoat/stoat-desktop/&quot; Type=Application Categories=AudioVideo;Network; Icon=/path/to/icon </code></pre> <ul> <li>Lastly, we just need to move the <code>stoat.desktop</code> file we created to <code>/usr/share/applications/</code> so that it can be found by your launcher/menu. I would just recommend by opening the folder in a terminal and using the <code>mv</code> command: <code>sudo mv ./stoat.desktop /usr/share/applications</code>.</li> </ul> <p>Once that is done, you should be done. Enjoy stoat at your leisure. It&#39;s going to have a generic icon if you haven&#39;t appointed an icon to it. Luckily for you, I&#39;ve made some simple icons to fix that for you. They&#39;re on my GitHub. You&#39;re more than welcome to use them. <a href=\"https://github.com/dclmao/stoat-icon/\">https://github.com/dclmao/stoat-icon</a>.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/BeyondOk1548\"> /u/BeyondOk1548 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1r596bh/migrating_from_discord_to_stoat_on_linux/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1r596bh/migrating_from_discord_to_stoat_on_linux/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Today, across most real programs, compiler output patterns are very similar, and the built-in fusion set was derived from many different apps, not a single target. That is why the default/built-in fusion already captures about ~90% of the benefit for general code. You can push it a bit further in niche cases, but most users do not need per-app fusion.</p><p>On the benchmark/build question: the headline numbers are from the fusion-enabled configuration, not the ultra-minimal ~200KB build. The ~200KB profile is for maximum size reduction (for example embedded-style constraints), and you should expect roughly ~40% lower performance there (still quite fast tbh, basically wasm3 level).</p><p>Fusion itself is a size/perf knob with diminishing returns: the full fusion set is about ~500KB, but adding only ~100KB can already recover roughly ~80% of the full-fusion performance. The ~1.1MB full binary also includes std due to the WASI support, so if you do not need WASI you can save several hundred KB more.</p><p>So number shouldn't be 200KB but 700KB for maximum performance. thanks for pointing out.</p>",

The goal of this project is educational: to simplify the process of building Bash scripts by offering a visual approach. It’s not meant to replace traditional text-based scripting, but rather to provide an alternative way to visualize and construct scripts. I hope it can help beginners better understand the structure and flow of Bash scripts, making scripting concepts easier to learn. As you can see in the screenshot, most of the “standard” Bash nodes are available. In addition, there are several prebuilt nodes such as “Open a Website,” “Download a File,” and more. These are designed to make common tasks easier and more accessible.</p> <p>One aspect I particularly enjoy working on is the interface and settings system. Vish includes a lot of UX-focused features: multiple themes, language support, the ability to run scripts directly inside the editor, and more.</p> <p>I’m building this project mainly for fun (although I genuinely love coding it!). It’s not intended to become a widely adopted tool. That’s also why I chose Python and Qt, they make the codebase easier to maintain and contribute to, both for others and for myself.</p> <p>I do have a few questions for you: What would you expect from a tool like this? Do you think I should publish it on Flatpak?</p> <p>There’s honestly so much more I could say, I don’t even know where to start!!<br/> But I strongly encourage you to try it out for yourself. Please note that this is not even in beta yet, so you may encounter bugs and missing features.

      "content": "<p>Every package needs a name. The rules for how those names work is one of the most consequential decisions a package manager makes, and one of the hardest to change later. I <a href=\"https://nesbitt.io/2025/12/29/categorizing-package-registries.html\">categorized the approaches</a> previously and touched on the <a href=\"https://nesbitt.io/2025/12/05/package-manager-tradeoffs.html\">tradeoffs</a> briefly.</p><p>RubyGems, PyPI, crates.io, Hex, Hackage, CRAN, and LuaRocks all use flat namespaces: one global pool of names, first-come-first-served. You pick a name, and if nobody has it, it’s yours.</p><p>This gives you , , . The names are short, memorable, and greppable, with no punctuation to remember and no organization to look up.</p><p>At scale, though, good names run out. Someone registers  on day one and never publishes a real package. Or they publish something, abandon it, and the name sits there forever, pointing at a library last updated in 2013. PyPI has over 600,000 projects. Many of the short, obvious names were claimed years ago by packages with single-digit downloads.</p><p>Name scarcity creates pressure, and you end up with  because  was taken,  because  was the old version, or  because the original  package was abandoned and PyPI doesn’t recycle names. New developers have to learn not just what to install but which of several similar-sounding packages is the right one.</p><p>Flat namespaces also make <a href=\"https://nesbitt.io/2025/12/17/typosquatting-in-package-managers.html\">typosquatting</a> straightforward. Someone registers  next to  and waits. The attack works because there’s nothing between the user’s keystrokes and the registry lookup, no organization to verify and no hierarchy to navigate, just a string match against a flat list.</p><p>Some registries add normalization rules to limit this. PyPI treats hyphens, underscores, and dots as equivalent, so  and  resolve to the same thing. crates.io does similar normalization. RubyGems doesn’t, which is why both  and  can coexist as unrelated packages.</p><p>npm added scopes in 2014. Instead of just , you could publish . Packagist has always used  format: , . JSR, Ansible Galaxy, Puppet Forge, and others follow similar patterns.</p><p>Scopes split the package name into two parts: who published it, and what they called it. Different organizations can use the same package name without collision, so  and  coexist without confusion.</p><p>npm’s implementation is interesting because scopes are optional. You can still publish unscoped packages to the flat namespace. So npm actually has two systems running in parallel: a flat namespace for legacy packages and a scoped namespace for newer ones.</p><p>Most of the ecosystem’s most-used packages (, , ) predate scopes and sit in the flat namespace. Scopes are most common for organizational packages (everything under , for example) and type definitions (). And because so much of the ecosystem depends on unscoped names, npm can never require scopes without breaking the world.</p><p>Packagist required scopes from the start. Every Composer package is , no exceptions. This avoided the split-namespace problem npm has, but it means you need to know the vendor name. Is it  or ? You have to look it up. And vendor names themselves are first-come-first-served, just pushing the squatting problem up one level. The stakes are higher, though, because squatting a vendor name locks out an entire family of package names rather than just one. Someone could register the  vendor on Packagist before Google gets there, and that blocks every  package at once.</p><p>Scopes also require governance. Who decides that  belongs to the Babel team? npm ties scopes to user accounts and organizations, which means you need account management, ownership transfer procedures, and dispute resolution. When a maintainer leaves a project, their scoped packages might need to move. This is solvable but adds operational overhead that flat registries avoid.</p><p>Maven Central uses reverse-domain naming: <code>org.apache.commons:commons-lang3</code>, . The group ID is supposed to correspond to a domain you control.</p><p>The reverse-domain approach ties naming authority to DNS. If you own , you can publish under . This defers governance to the existing DNS system rather than requiring the registry to manage name ownership. Maven Central enforces this by requiring you to prove domain ownership, or for projects without their own domain, to use  as a fallback.</p><p>That fallback is interesting because it quietly undermines the premise: the whole point of reverse-domain naming is that you prove ownership of infrastructure you control, but  just defers to GitHub’s namespace. It’s URL-based naming wearing a reverse-domain costume.</p><p>Organizations with stable domains get clean namespaces out of this. Apache, Google, and Spring all have clear homes. The trade-off is verbose identifiers. <code>org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web</code> is a lot of characters. IDE autocompletion papers over this in Java, but the verbosity is real when reading build files or discussing dependencies.</p><p>Domain ownership is also less stable than it looks. Companies get acquired and change domains. Open source projects move between hosting organizations. A package published under  in 2005 might need to live under  after the acquisition, except it can’t, because changing the group ID would break every project that depends on the old one. So old names persist as historical artifacts.</p><p>The hierarchy also doesn’t prevent all squatting. Someone could register a domain specifically to claim a Maven namespace. More concerning is domain resurrection: when a domain expires after its owner has already registered a Maven group ID, anyone can buy that domain and potentially claim the namespace. Maven Central <a href=\"https://central.sonatype.org/register/namespace/\">verifies domain ownership</a> when you first register a group ID, requiring a DNS TXT record, but that verification is a point-in-time check.</p><p>In January 2024, security firm Oversecured published <a href=\"https://blog.oversecured.com/Introducing-MavenGate-a-supply-chain-attack-method-for-Java-and-Android-applications/\">MavenGate</a>, an analysis of 33,938 domains associated with Maven group IDs. They found that 6,170 of them, roughly 18%, had expired or were available for purchase. The affected group IDs included widely-used libraries like , , and . A new owner of any of those domains could publish new versions under the existing group ID. Existing artifacts on Maven Central are immutable so old versions wouldn’t change, but build files that pull the latest version would pick up the attacker’s release.</p><p>Sonatype responded by disabling accounts tied to expired domains and tightening their verification process, but they haven’t announced ongoing domain monitoring. PyPI, facing the same problem with account email domains, <a href=\"https://blog.pypi.org/posts/2025-08-18-preventing-domain-resurrections/\">built automated daily checks</a> in 2025 and found around 1,800 accounts to unverify.</p><p>Clojars shows what happens when a registry in the Maven ecosystem takes a different approach. Clojure libraries are distributed as Maven artifacts, but Clojars originally let you use any group ID without verification. You could publish under  or  with no domain proof. This was simpler for the Clojure community, where most libraries are small and maintained by individuals, but it meant Clojars had a much more relaxed namespace than Maven Central.</p><p>Since build tools can pull from both registries, the gap created a dependency confusion risk: an attacker could register an unverified group on Clojars that shadows a legitimate Maven Central library. In 2021, after dependency confusion attacks became widely understood, Clojars <a href=\"https://github.com/clojars/clojars-web/wiki/Verified-Group-Names\">started requiring verified group names</a> for new projects, adopting the same reverse-domain convention as Maven Central. Existing projects with unverified groups were grandfathered in, so the old flat names still exist alongside the new hierarchical ones.</p><p>Go modules use import paths that are URLs: , . There’s no registration step. The URL points to a repository, and the module system fetches code from there (or from the Go module proxy, which caches it).</p><p>This model sidesteps the registry as naming authority entirely. You publish code to a repository and the URL is the identifier, with no approval step required. Name collisions don’t arise because URLs are globally unique by construction, and owning the repo means owning the name.</p><p>Names become tied to hosting infrastructure, though. When  is the package identity, a GitHub org rename breaks every downstream consumer. Go addressed this with the module proxy, which caches modules so they survive repo disappearance, but the name still reflects the original location even if the code has moved. Import paths like  that redirect to  create confusion about which is canonical. And your package identity depends on a third party either way: GitHub controls the  namespace, so if they ban your account or the organization renames, your package identity changes. You’ve traded one governance dependency for another, a hosting platform instead of a registry.</p><p>“No registration step” has its own consequences. Without a registry to mediate names, there’s no obvious place to check for existing packages, no search, no download counts, no centralized vulnerability database. Go built most of these features separately with pkg.go.dev and the module proxy. The URL-based naming stayed, but the surrounding infrastructure converged toward what registries provide anyway, just assembled differently.</p><p>Deno launched with raw URL imports and eventually built <a href=\"https://jsr.io\">JSR</a>, a scoped registry with semver resolution, because URL imports created <a href=\"https://deno.com/blog/http-imports\">problems they couldn’t solve</a> at the URL layer: duplicated dependencies when the same package was imported from slightly different URLs, version management scattered across every import statement, and reliability issues when hosts went offline. You can start without a registry, but the things registries do (search, versioning, deduplication, availability) keep needing to be solved, and solving them piecemeal tends to reconverge on something registry-shaped.</p><p>Apple hired Max Howell to build SwiftPM in 2015. He’d created Homebrew and used both CocoaPods and Carthage heavily, so he arrived with strong opinions about how a language package manager should work. As he told <a href=\"https://changelog.com/podcast/232\">The Changelog</a>: “I’d been involved with CocoaPods and Carthage and used them heavily, and obviously made Homebrew, so I had lots of opinions about how a package manager should be.” He was drawn to decentralization, something he wished Homebrew had from the start.</p><p>Carthage had already demonstrated the approach in the Apple ecosystem, launching in 2014 as a deliberate reaction against CocoaPods’ centralized registry, using bare Git URLs with no registry at all. SwiftPM followed the same path, using Git repository URLs as package identifiers with no central registry.</p><p>Go made the same choice but then spent years building infrastructure around it: a module proxy that caches source in immutable storage so deleted repos still resolve, a checksum database () that uses a transparency log to guarantee every user gets identical content for a given version, and pkg.go.dev for search and discovery.</p><p>SwiftPM doesn’t have any of this yet. Every  clones directly from the Git host. If a repo disappears, resolution fails with no fallback. SwiftPM records a fingerprint per package version the first time it downloads it, but that fingerprint lives on your machine only. There’s no global database to verify that what you downloaded matches what everyone else got, no way to detect a targeted attack serving different content to different users.</p><p>A <a href=\"https://checkmarx.com/blog/chainjacking-the-new-supply-chain-attack/\">2022 Checkmarx study</a> found thousands of packages across Go and Swift vulnerable to repo-jacking, where an attacker registers an abandoned GitHub username and recreates a repo that existing packages still point to. Go’s proxy mitigates this because cached modules don’t re-fetch from the source, but SwiftPM has no such layer.</p><p>The pieces to fix this are partly in place. Apple defined a <a href=\"https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0292-package-registry-service.md\">registry protocol</a> (SE-0292, shipped in Swift 5.7) and built client support for it in SwiftPM, including package signing. The client tooling is ready, the protocol is specified, and the ecosystem is still small enough that introducing a namespace layer wouldn’t require the kind of painful migration that npm or PyPI face. The <a href=\"https://swiftpackageindex.com\">Swift Package Index</a>, community-run and Apple-sponsored, already tracks around 12,000 packages. What’s missing is the public registry service itself and the integrity infrastructure around it, and the window for adding these before the ecosystem’s size makes it much harder is not open forever.</p><p>As I wrote about in <a href=\"https://nesbitt.io/2026/01/23/package-management-is-a-wicked-problem.html\">Package Management is a Wicked Problem</a>, once PyPI accepted namespace-less package names, that was permanent. If PyPI added mandatory namespaces tomorrow, every existing , every tutorial, every CI script would need updating. The new system would have to support both namespaced and un-namespaced packages indefinitely. You haven’t replaced the flat namespace, you’ve just added a layer on top of it.</p><p>npm’s experience shows what this looks like in practice. Scoped packages have been available since 2014, but most of the ecosystem still uses flat names. The existence of scopes didn’t make  become  because too much already depends on the existing name. Scopes ended up being used primarily for new packages and organizational groups rather than as a migration path for the existing namespace.</p><p>NuGet went through a partial migration. It added package ID prefix reservation in 2017, letting Microsoft reserve the  prefix. But this is a bolt-on: the underlying namespace is still flat, and the prefixes are just a verified badge on the registry UI. It helps users identify official packages but doesn’t change the naming model.</p><p>PyPI is threading this needle right now with <a href=\"https://peps.python.org/pep-0752/\">PEP 752</a>, which proposes letting organizations reserve package name prefixes. Google could reserve , Apache could reserve <code>apache-airflow-providers-</code>, and future uploads matching those prefixes would require authorization from the namespace owner. Like NuGet’s approach, it requires no installer changes and leaves existing packages unaffected. It only applies going forward, though, and the thousands of existing packages with no organizational prefix remain as they are.</p><p>Cargo and crates.io are attempting something more ambitious. The Rust community has been discussing namespaces since at least 2014, and after several earlier proposals that leaned toward npm-style user or org scopes, they settled on <a href=\"https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/3243-packages-as-optional-namespaces.html\">RFC 3243</a> (“Packages as Optional Namespaces”), authored by Manish Goregaokar, who had been working on the problem since at least 2018 when the first “packages as namespaces” pre-RFC appeared.</p><p>The approach treats existing crate names as potential namespace roots: if you own the  crate, you can publish , and only owners of  can create crates in that namespace. Ownership flows down automatically. The  separator was chosen after extensive debate because it aligns with Rust’s existing path syntax, so <code>serde::derive::Deserialize</code> reads naturally in Rust source. An earlier proposal used  but that conflicted with Cargo’s feature syntax.</p><p>The design is carefully scoped. Namespaces are optional, so the flat namespace stays and nothing breaks. It’s framed around projects rather than organizations, with the primary use cases being things like  or  rather than org-level grouping. Only single-level nesting is supported for now. And they explicitly chose not to do NuGet-style prefix reservation because in a flat namespace where  already exists, reserving the  prefix would create confusion about whether existing  crates are actually owned by .</p><p>The migration challenges are real even with this careful design. A crate like  already exists in the flat namespace, and transitioning it to  means a new name that every downstream consumer would need to update. The RFC suggests maintaining re-export crates during transition, but there’s no alias mechanism yet. Some projects face an even harder version of this problem: the  project manages a family of  crates, but someone else owns the  crate, so they can’t use it as their namespace root.</p><p>The RFC was accepted and became an official Rust project goal for 2025, led by Ed Page on the Cargo team. As of late 2025, Cargo support is partially implemented but compiler support is still in progress, requiring coordination across the lang, compiler, and crates.io teams. It’s the most carefully designed attempt at retrofitting namespaces onto a flat registry that I’m aware of, and the fact that it’s taking years of design and implementation work for a well-resourced community with strong governance shows how hard this problem is once a flat namespace is established.</p><p>If you’re starting a registry today, you don’t have to require namespaces from day one, but you could reserve the separator character and the ownership semantics so that namespaces can be added later without conflicting with existing names. The reason crates.io can use  is that no existing crate name contains it. If they’d allowed colons in crate names from the start, this whole approach would have been foreclosed. Keeping your options open costs almost nothing at launch and can save years of design work later.</p>",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>tl;dr</p> <p>I am SWE, and I built a high-end PC, but found much of the hardware lacked Linux support. Through a mix of reverse-engineering, kernel investigations and contributions, and finding out configuration to apply, I managed to get everything: fans, AIO, RGB, and suspend/wake cycles working perfectly. It was a lot of manual labor and protocol dumping, but the machine is now silent, stable, and fully controlled by me.</p> <h1>Specs</h1> <p>In June 2025, I bought a new PC with the following hardware:</p> <ul> <li><strong>MOBO:</strong> Asus ROG Strix X870-I</li> <li><strong>RAM:</strong> G.Skill Trident Z5 Neo RGB</li> <li><strong>NVMe:</strong> Samsung 9100 PRO</li> <li><strong>AIO:</strong> Asus ROG Ryujin III EXTREME</li> <li><strong>FANS:</strong> 4x Corsair AF120 (+ Corsair Lighting Node)</li> <li><strong>PSU:</strong> Asus ROG Loki</li> <li><strong>GPU:</strong> Asus ROG Astral 5090 OC</li> <li><strong>CPU:</strong> AMD Ryzen 9950X3D</li> </ul> <h1>Sensors</h1> <p>As many of you know, running Linux on brand-new hardware can be a pain in the ass. However, I really wanted top-tier specs without making any sacrifices, so I was prepared to tackle every problem I faced. No regrets, but it took a lot of time to solve everything, especially since new development under NixOS can be painful when you need to create flakes for new languages.</p> <p>When I first booted my PC, I was annoyed by the fan noise and the AIO pump constantly running at a 70% duty cycle. Running <code>sensors</code> showed no controllable entries.</p> <p>I started by looking at <code>LibreHardwareMonitor</code> on Windows and <a href=\"https://github.com/LibreHardwareMonitor/LibreHardwareMonitor/pull/1794\">added support</a> for my motherboard there. <a href=\"https://github.com/zeule/asus-ec-sensors/pull/79\">I then ported</a> my findings to <code>asus-ec-sensors</code> (which proudly made me a Linux kernel contributor). Thanks to this, I was able to control the fans from Linux.</p> <p>Next, I looked into the AIO pump. Of course, there was no support, yet I found a <a href=\"https://github.com/aleksamagicka/asus_rog_ryujin-hwmon\">kernel module for a similar device</a> (Ryujin II). I investigated the implementation, created a simple userspace application for testing, and then <a href=\"https://github.com/mzonski/asus_rog_ryujin_iii_extreme-hwmon\">refactored the kernel module</a> to include the protocol derivation suited for my device. Now I can read liquid temps and set the duty cycle for the pump and internal fan. <a href=\"https://github.com/liquidctl/liquidctl/pull/829\">I ported</a> these findings to the <code>liquidctl</code> repo.</p> <p><strong>The noise is gone.</strong> Now I can control everything using <strong>CoolerControl</strong> (highly recommended).</p> <p>Even though NixOS has a massive repository of freshly added packages, once you use the system, you&#39;ll find that not everything is bleeding edge or works flawlessly. For example, CoolerControl couldn&#39;t see my Nvidia card, <code>nvidia-smi</code> wasn&#39;t visible to it and hardware IDs weren&#39;t showing up. I ended up fixing the module and upgrading the package myself. Moreover, the Nvidia card fans couldn&#39;t be controlled by the software initially, but the <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/coolercontrol/coolercontrol/-/merge_requests/371\">maintainer did a wonderful job</a> by adding support for 0 RPM mode after I opened an issue for it.</p> <p>One last issue: only a single stick of RAM was showing temperatures. I had to write the following udev rule to make both sticks visible:</p> <pre><code>(pkgs.writeTextDir &quot;etc/udev/rules.d/99-ram-stick-detection.rules&quot; &#39;&#39; ACTION==&quot;add&quot;, SUBSYSTEM==&quot;i2c&quot;, ATTR{name}==&quot;G.Skill 2nd stick&quot;, RUN+=&quot;${pkgs.bash}/bin/sh -c &#39;echo spd5118 0x53 &gt; /sys/bus/i2c/devices/i2c-6/new_device&#39;&quot; &#39;&#39;) </code></pre> <p>I could recompile kernel with <a href=\"https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/770aaedb461a055f79b971d538678942b6607894/drivers/hwmon/spd5118.c#L769\">one flag changed</a> to achieve automatic detection.</p> <h1>RGB</h1> <p>I have a white case, so I really wanted to utilize RGB properly. <a href=\"https://github.com/mzonski/my-pc-rgb\">I created a small Python project</a>, <code>my-pc-rgb</code>, that integrates everything.</p> <p>My motherboard utilizes two ASUS protocols: Gen 1 and Gen 2. Gen 1 is well-documented and implemented, but Gen 2 was nowhere to be found. I dumped packets from Windows with various configurations and spent two evenings cleaning the data and reverse-engineering the protocol. Thanks to this, I can now control the LEDs on my AIO. Since my PSU only works on Gen 1, I integrated both protocols into my project.</p> <p><code>liquidctl</code> supports the Corsair RGB controller, but since I solved my AIO without it, I simply analyzed the protocol and reimplemented it in my project. Now, all other fans are color synchronized.</p> <p>Both my GPU and RAM have RGB strips. I investigated the OpenRGB I2C communication for both and recreated it in my project.</p> <p>Now, the RGB turns off when I suspend/poweroff and turns back on when the computer wakes.</p> <h1>Suspend</h1> <p>Now for the real deal. I absolutely needed suspend to work reliably on my machine. It wasn&#39;t easy.</p> <p>Nvidia cards under Wayland had a nasty issue with GNOME. It was a lottery whether my computer would sleep/wake correctly. I found a <a href=\"https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/trouble-suspending-with-510-39-01-linux-5-16-0-freezing-of-tasks-failed-after-20-009-seconds/200933/12\">post about explicitly freezing the GNOME session</a> by creating a new systemd service. It worked, and the Nvidia card was never a problem again.</p> <p>The Samsung NVMe on my motherboard didn&#39;t know how to wake up properly from suspend. I tried several things. First, I set the kernel parameter:</p> <p><code>nvme_core.default_ps_max_latency_us=0</code></p> <p>However, I couldn&#39;t stand that the disk never really went to sleep. I stumbled upon a <a href=\"https://support.system76.com/articles/kernelstub/\">System76 article</a> that allowed the disk to consume less power when suspended. I ended up with the following udev rule:</p> <pre><code>(pkgs.writeTextDir &quot;etc/udev/rules.d/99-nvme-tolerance.rules&quot; &#39;&#39; ACTION==&quot;add&quot;, SUBSYSTEM==&quot;nvme&quot;, KERNEL==&quot;nvme0&quot;, ATTR{power/pm_qos_latency_tolerance_us}=&quot;13500&quot; &#39;&#39;) </code></pre> <p>It still wasn&#39;t ideal. Once every few suspend/wake cycles, the device wouldn&#39;t wake up properly.</p> <p>I ended up reading the NVMe implementation in the Linux kernel source, and enlightenment came in the form of <a href=\"https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/770aaedb461a055f79b971d538678942b6607894/drivers/nvme/host/nvme.h#L58\">NVMe quirks</a>. I know the flag I set can be improved (I likely don&#39;t need all 3 flags), but since everything works so well, I haven&#39;t investigated further. After setting this kernel parameter:</p> <p><code>&quot;nvme_core.quirks=0x144d:0xa810:0x418&quot; # (Simple Suspend + No APST + Delay Ready)</code></p> <p>I have never experienced disk corruption or failure. The disk works properly, always.</p> <h1>What&#39;s next?</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Logitech Bolt Receiver:</strong> It cannot wake my PC with keyboard/mouse because I explicitly disabled it. The device was waking my PC for no apparent reason. I see my future self filtering HID packets for this specific device to allow it, but I haven&#39;t done anything beyond basic investigation.</li> <li><strong>Ryujin III Screen:</strong> The AIO has an LCD screen. I am controlling its power state and have dumped the entire protocol. I have everything needed to implement it; I just need the time and will.</li> <li><strong>SuperIO:</strong> The <code>NCT6701D</code> chip allows you to set fan curves and track many system stats. Currently, I&#39;m just using an old kernel module that provides basic functionality, which is inferior to what the chip is actually capable of. I would love to write a full kernel module for it, but without documentation, I don&#39;t know how long it would take to reverse and implement all its features. So, I haven&#39;t done that yet.</li> <li><strong>GPU Monitoring:</strong> I have seen people monitoring 12VHPWR connector pins, it&#39;s already reversed. I think I could create/extend some kernel module, so the voltage will be visible under sensors. I could also reverse-engineer setting the additional fan duty on this card. Once I have the need for it, I will get it done.</li> </ul> <h1>Conclusion</h1> <p>I am really glad I bought hardware that wasn&#39;t supported out of the box. It forced me to gain basic skills in sniffing hardware communication and implementing it under Linux. Thanks to this effort, I have the best, most recent consumer hardware money can buy. I know this PC will serve me well for the next 10 years, possibly working until hardware failure or upgrade.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/_zonni\"> /u/_zonni </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/2alzspuythjg1.jpeg\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1r4q5sj/how_i_achieved_full_linux_support_on_my/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "content": "<p>Welcome to Austin’s Nerdy Things, where we train from scratch entire neural networks to avoid talking to lawyers.</p><h2>The Problem with Ultralytics</h2><p>YOLOvWhatver is excellent. Fast, accurate, easy to use, great documentation. But Ultralytics licenses it under AGPL-3.0, which means if you use it in a product, you either need to open-source your entire application or pay for a commercial license. For a side project AR app that I might eventually monetize? That’s a hard pass.</p><p>Enter YOLOX from Megvii (recommended by either ChatGPT or Claude, can’t remember which, as an alternative). MIT licensed. Do whatever you want with it. The catch? You have to train your own models from scratch instead of using Ultralytics’ pretrained weights and easy fine-tuning pipeline. I have since learned there are some pretrained models. I didn’t use them.</p><p>So training from scratch is what I did. Over a few late nights in December 2025, I went from zero YOLOX experience to running custom-trained aircraft detection models in my iOS app. Here’s how it went.</p><p>Hardware: RTX 3090 on my Windows machine, COCO2017 dataset on network storage (which turned out to be totally fine for training speed), and way too many terminal windows open.</p><p>I started with the official YOLOX repo and the aircraft class from COCO2017. The dataset has about 3,000 training images with airplanes, which is modest but enough to get started.</p><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/Megvii-BaseDetection/YOLOX\npip install -v -e .</code></pre><p>The first training run failed immediately because I forgot to install YOLOX as a package. Classic. Then it failed again because I was importing a class that didn’t exist in the version I had. Claude (who was helping me through this, and hallucinated said class) apologized and fixed the import. We got there eventually.</p><h2>Training Configs: Nano, Tiny, Small, and “Nanoish”</h2><p>YOLOX has a nice inheritance-based config system. You create a Python file, inherit from a base experiment class, and override what you want. I ended up with four different configs:</p><ul><li>yolox_nano_aircraft.py – The smallest. 0.9M params, 1.6 GFLOPs. Runs on anything.</li><li>yolox_tiny_aircraft.py – Slightly bigger with larger input size for small object detection.</li><li>yolox_small_aircraft.py – 5M params, 26 GFLOPs. The “serious” model.</li><li>yolox_nanoish_aircraft.py – My attempt at something between nano and tiny.</li></ul><p>The “nanoish” config was my own creation where I tried to find a sweet spot. I bumped the width multiplier from 0.25 to 0.33 and… immediately got a channel mismatch error because 0.33 doesn’t divide evenly into the architecture. Turns out you can’t just pick arbitrary numbers. I am a noob at these things. Lesson learned.</p><p>After some back-and-forth, I settled on a config with 0.3125 width (which is 0.25 \\* 1.25, mathematically clean) and 512×512 input. This gave me roughly 1.2M params – bigger than nano, smaller than tiny, and it actually worked.</p><p>Here’s the small model config – the one that ended up in production. The key decisions are  (2x wider than nano for better feature extraction), 640×640 input for small object detection, and full mosaic + mixup augmentation:</p><pre><code>class Exp(MyExp):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super(Exp, self).__init__()\n\n        # Model config - YOLOX-Small architecture\n        self.num_classes = 1  # Single class: airplane\n        self.depth = 0.33\n        self.width = 0.50  # 2x wider than nano for better feature extraction\n\n        # Input/output config - larger input helps small object detection\n        self.input_size = (640, 640)\n        self.test_size = (640, 640)\n        self.multiscale_range = 5  # Training will vary from 480-800\n\n        # Data augmentation\n        self.mosaic_prob = 1.0\n        self.mosaic_scale = (0.1, 2.0)\n        self.enable_mixup = True\n        self.mixup_prob = 1.0\n        self.flip_prob = 0.5\n        self.hsv_prob = 1.0\n\n        # Training config\n        self.warmup_epochs = 5\n        self.max_epoch = 400\n        self.no_aug_epochs = 100\n        self.basic_lr_per_img = 0.01 / 64.0\n        self.scheduler = \"yoloxwarmcos\"\n\n    def get_model(self):\n        from yolox.models import YOLOX, YOLOPAFPN, YOLOXHead\n\n        in_channels = [256, 512, 1024]\n        # Small uses standard convolutions (no depthwise)\n        backbone = YOLOPAFPN(self.depth, self.width, in_channels=in_channels, act=self.act)\n        head = YOLOXHead(self.num_classes, self.width, in_channels=in_channels, act=self.act)\n        self.model = YOLOX(backbone, head)\n        return self.model</code></pre><p>And the nanoish config for comparison – note the  and the width of 0.3125 (5/16) that I landed on after the channel mismatch debacle:</p><pre><code>class Exp(MyExp):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super(Exp, self).__init__()\n\n        self.num_classes = 1\n        self.depth = 0.33\n        self.width = 0.3125  # 5/16 - halfway between nano (0.25) and tiny (0.375)\n\n        self.input_size = (512, 512)\n        self.test_size = (512, 512)\n\n        # Lighter augmentation than small - this model is meant to be fast\n        self.mosaic_prob = 0.5\n        self.mosaic_scale = (0.5, 1.5)\n        self.enable_mixup = False\n\n    def get_model(self):\n        from yolox.models import YOLOX, YOLOPAFPN, YOLOXHead\n\n        in_channels = [256, 512, 1024]\n        backbone = YOLOPAFPN(self.depth, self.width, in_channels=in_channels,\n                             act=self.act, depthwise=True)  # Depthwise = lighter\n        head = YOLOXHead(self.num_classes, self.width, in_channels=in_channels,\n                         act=self.act, depthwise=True)\n        self.model = YOLOX(backbone, head)\n        return self.model</code></pre><pre><code>python tools/train.py -f yolox_small_aircraft.py -d 1 -b 16 --fp16 -c yolox_s.pth</code></pre><p>The  loads YOLOX’s pretrained COCO weights as a starting point (transfer learning). The  is one GPU,  is batch size 16 (about 8GB VRAM on the 3090 with fp16), and  enables mixed precision training.</p><p>Here’s the thing about aircraft detection for an AR app: planes at cruise altitude look tiny. A 747-8 at 37,000 feet is maybe 20-30 pixels on your phone screen if you’re lucky, even with the 4x optical zoom of the newest iPhones (8x for the 12MP weird zoom mode). Standard YOLO models are tuned for reasonable-sized objects, not specks in the sky. The COCO dataset has aircraft that are reasonably sized, like when you’re sitting at your gate at an airport and take a picture of the aircraft 100 ft in front of you.</p><p>My first results were underwhelming. The nano model was detecting larger aircraft okay but completely missing anything at altitude. The evaluation metrics looked like this:</p><pre><code>AP for airplane = 0.234\nAR for small objects = 0.089</code></pre><p>Not great. The model was basically only catching aircraft on approach or takeoff.</p><p>For the small config, I made some changes to help with tiny objects:</p><ul><li>Increased input resolution to 640×640 (more pixels = more detail for small objects)</li><li>Enabled full mosaic and mixup augmentation (helps the model see varied object scales)</li><li>Switched from depthwise to regular convolutions (more capacity)</li><li>(I’ll be honest, I was leaning heavily on Claude for the ML-specific tuning decisions here)</li></ul><p>This pushed the model to 26 GFLOPs though, which had me worried about phone performance.</p><p>Here’s what the small model’s accuracy looked like broken down by object size. You can see AP for small objects climbing from ~0.45 to ~0.65 over training, while large objects hit ~0.70. Progress, but small objects remain the hardest category – which tracks with the whole “specks in the sky” problem.</p><h2>Will This Actually Run on a Phone?</h2><p>The whole point of this exercise was to run inference on an iPhone. So here is some napkin math:</p><figure><table><thead><tr><th>Estimated Phone Inference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>My app was already running YOLOv8n at 15fps with plenty of headroom. So theoretically even the small model should work, but nano/nanoish would leave more room for everything else the app needs to do.</p><p>The plan: train everything, compare accuracy, quantize for deployment, and see what actually works in practice.</p><h2>Training Results (And a Rookie Mistake)</h2><p>After letting things run overnight (300 epochs takes a while even on a 3090), here’s what I got:</p><p>The nanoish model at epoch 100 was already showing 94% detection rate on test images, beating the fully-trained nano model. And it wasn’t even done training yet.</p><p>Quick benchmark on 50 COCO test images with aircraft (RTX 3090 GPU inference – not identical to phone, but close enough for the smaller models to be representative):</p><figure><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>YOLOv8n getting beaten by every single YOLOX variant while also being slower was… not what I expected. Here’s the mAP comparison across all the models over training – you can see the hierarchy pretty clearly:</p><p>The big takeaway: more capacity = better accuracy, but with diminishing returns. The jump from nano to nanoish is huge, nanoish to small is solid, and tiny lands somewhere in between depending on the epoch. (You’ll notice two extra lines in the chart – a large model and a self-sourced variant. I kept training after this post’s story ends. More on the self-sourced pipeline later. You can also see the large model is clearly overfitting past epoch ~315 – loss keeps decreasing but mAP starts dropping. My first time overfitting a model.)</p><p>The nanoish model hit a nice sweet spot. Faster than YOLOv8n, better small object detection than pure nano, and still lightweight enough for mobile.</p><p>And here is the output from my plot_training.py script:</p><pre><code>============================================================\nSUMMARY\n============================================================\nRun                         Epochs   Final Loss    Best AP  Best AP50\n------------------------------------------------------------\nyolox_large_aircraft           391       0.6000     0.6620     0.8620\nyolox_nano_aircraft            300       3.3000     0.4770     0.7390\nyolox_nanoish_aircraft         142       4.3000     0.4390     0.7210\nyolox_small_aircraft           302       2.2000     0.6360     0.8650\nyolox_small_with_self_sou      400       1.4000     0.6420     0.8620\nyolox_tiny_aircraft            300       2.5000     0.6060     0.8480\n============================================================\n\n====================================================================================================\nmAP VALUES AT SPECIFIC EPOCHS\n====================================================================================================\nRun                           AP@280     AP50@280    APsmall@280     AP@290     AP50@290    APsmall@290     AP@299     AP50@299    APsmall@299\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nyolox_large_aircraft          0.6350       0.8410         0.6690     0.6390       0.8410         0.6750 0.6480(300)       0.8440         0.6780\nyolox_nano_aircraft           0.4750       0.7360         0.4000     0.4740       0.7360         0.3970     0.4770       0.7380         0.4030\nyolox_nanoish_aircraft           N/A          N/A            N/A        N/A          N/A            N/A        N/A          N/A            N/A\nyolox_small_aircraft          0.5900       0.8440         0.5960     0.6230       0.8610         0.6340     0.6360       0.8630         0.6410\nyolox_small_with_self_sou     0.5940       0.8430         0.5690     0.5900       0.8420         0.5660 0.5930(300)       0.8420         0.5630\nyolox_tiny_aircraft           0.5800       0.8300         0.5650     0.5950       0.8340         0.5830     0.6060       0.8440         0.5780\n====================================================================================================</code></pre><p>But there was a problem I didn’t notice until later: my training dataset had zero images without aircraft in them. Every single training image contained at least one airplane. This is… not ideal if you want your model to learn what an airplane . More on that shortly.</p><h2>How It Actually Works in the App</h2><p>Before I get to results, here’s what the ML is actually doing in SkySpottr. The app combines multiple data sources to track aircraft:</p><ol><li>ADS-B data tells us where aircraft are in 3D space (lat, lon, altitude)</li><li>Device GPS and orientation tell us where the phone is and which way it’s pointing</li><li>Physics-based prediction places aircraft overlays on screen based on all the above</li></ol><p>That prediction is usually pretty good, but phone sensors drift and aircraft positions are slightly delayed. So the overlays can be off by a couple degrees. This is where YOLO comes in.</p><p>The app runs the model on each camera frame looking for aircraft. When it finds one within a threshold distance of where the physics engine predicted an aircraft should be, it “snaps” the overlay to the actual detected position. The UI shows an orange circle around the aircraft and marks it as “SkySpottd” – confirmed via machine learning.</p><p>I call this “ML snap” mode. It’s the difference between “there’s probably a plane somewhere around here” and “that specific bright dot is definitely the aircraft.”</p><p>The model runs continuously on device, which is why inference time matters so much. Even at 15fps cap, that’s still 15 inference cycles per second competing with everything else the app needs to do (sensor fusion, WebSocket data, AR rendering, etc.). Early on I was seeing 130%+ CPU usage on my iPhone, which is not great for battery life. Every millisecond saved on inference is a win.</p><h2>Getting YOLOX into CoreML</h2><p>One thing the internet doesn’t tell you: YOLOX and Apple’s Vision framework don’t play nice together.</p><p>YOLOv8 exports to CoreML with a nice Vision-compatible interface. You hand it an image, it gives you detections. Easy. YOLOX expects different preprocessing – it wants pixel values in the 0-255 range (not normalized 0-1), and the output tensor layout is different.</p><p>The conversion pipeline goes PyTorch → TorchScript → CoreML. Here’s the core of it:</p><pre><code>import torch\nimport coremltools as ct\nfrom yolox.models import YOLOX, YOLOPAFPN, YOLOXHead\n\n# Build model (same architecture as training config)\nbackbone = YOLOPAFPN(depth=0.33, width=0.50, in_channels=[256, 512, 1024], act=\"silu\")\nhead = YOLOXHead(num_classes=1, width=0.50, in_channels=[256, 512, 1024], act=\"silu\")\nmodel = YOLOX(backbone, head)\n\n# Load trained weights\nckpt = torch.load(\"yolox_small_best.pth\", map_location=\"cpu\", weights_only=False)\nmodel.load_state_dict(ckpt[\"model\"])\nmodel.eval()\nmodel.head.decode_in_inference = True  # Output pixel coords, not raw logits\n\n# Trace and convert\ndummy = torch.randn(1, 3, 640, 640)\ntraced = torch.jit.trace(model, dummy)\nmlmodel = ct.convert(\n    traced,\n    inputs=[ct.TensorType(name=\"images\", shape=(1, 3, 640, 640))],\n    outputs=[ct.TensorType(name=\"output\")],\n    minimum_deployment_target=ct.target.iOS15,\n    convert_to=\"mlprogram\",\n)\nmlmodel.save(\"yolox_small_aircraft.mlpackage\")</code></pre><p>The <code>decode_in_inference = True</code> is crucial — without it, the model outputs raw logits and you’d need to implement the decode head in Swift. With it, the output is  where 6 is <code>[x_center, y_center, width, height, obj_conf, class_score]</code> in pixel coordinates.</p><p>On the Swift side, Claude ended up writing a custom detector that bypasses the Vision framework entirely. Here’s the preprocessing — the part that was hardest to get right:</p><pre><code>/// Convert pixel buffer to MLMultiArray [1, 3, H, W] with 0-255 range\nprivate func preprocess(pixelBuffer: CVPixelBuffer) -&gt; MLMultiArray? {\n    // GPU-accelerated resize via Core Image\n    let ciImage = CIImage(cvPixelBuffer: pixelBuffer)\n    let scaleX = CGFloat(inputSize) / ciImage.extent.width\n    let scaleY = CGFloat(inputSize) / ciImage.extent.height\n    let scaledImage = ciImage.transformed(by: CGAffineTransform(scaleX: scaleX, y: scaleY))\n\n    // Reuse pixel buffer from pool (memory leak fix #1)\n    var resizedBuffer: CVPixelBuffer?\n    CVPixelBufferPoolCreatePixelBuffer(kCFAllocatorDefault, pool, &amp;resizedBuffer)\n    guard let buffer = resizedBuffer else { return nil }\n    ciContext.render(scaledImage, to: buffer)\n\n    // Reuse pre-allocated MLMultiArray (memory leak fix #2)\n    guard let array = inputArray else { return nil }\n\n    CVPixelBufferLockBaseAddress(buffer, .readOnly)\n    defer { CVPixelBufferUnlockBaseAddress(buffer, .readOnly) }\n\n    let bytesPerRow = CVPixelBufferGetBytesPerRow(buffer)\n    let pixels = CVPixelBufferGetBaseAddress(buffer)!.assumingMemoryBound(to: UInt8.self)\n    let arrayPtr = array.dataPointer.assumingMemoryBound(to: Float.self)\n    let channelStride = inputSize * inputSize\n\n    // BGRA → RGB, keep 0-255 range (YOLOX expects unnormalized pixels)\n    // Direct pointer access is ~100x faster than MLMultiArray subscript\n    for y in 0..&lt;inputSize {\n        let rowOffset = y * bytesPerRow\n        let yOffset = y * inputSize\n        for x in 0..&lt;inputSize {\n            let px = rowOffset + x * 4\n            let idx = yOffset + x\n            arrayPtr[idx] = Float(pixels[px + 2])                      // R\n            arrayPtr[channelStride + idx] = Float(pixels[px + 1])      // G\n            arrayPtr[2 * channelStride + idx] = Float(pixels[px])      // B\n        }\n    }\n    return array\n}</code></pre><p>The two key gotchas: (1) BGRA byte order from the camera vs RGB that the model expects, and (2) YOLOX wants raw 0-255 pixel values, not the 0-1 normalized range that most CoreML models expect. If you normalize, everything silently breaks — the model runs, returns garbage, and you spend an evening wondering why.</p><p>For deployment, I used CoreML’s INT8 quantization (<code>coremltools.optimize.coreml.linear_quantize_weights</code>). This shrinks the model by about 50% with minimal accuracy loss. The small model went from ~17MB to 8.7MB, and inference time improved slightly.</p><h2>Real World Results (Round 1)</h2><p>I exported the nanoish model and got it running in SkySpottr. The good news: it works. The ML snap feature locks onto aircraft, the orange verification circles appear, and inference is fast enough that I don’t notice any lag.</p><p>The less good news: false positives. Trees, parts of houses, certain cloud formations – the model occasionally thinks these are aircraft. Remember that rookie mistake about no negative samples? Yeah.</p><p>I later set up a 3-way comparison to visualize exactly this kind of failure. The three panels show my COCO-only trained model (red boxes), a later model trained on self-sourced images (green boxes – I’ll explain this pipeline shortly), and YOLO26-X as a ground truth oracle (right panel, no boxes means no detection). The COCO-only model confidently detects an “aircraft” that is… a building. The other two correctly ignore it.</p><p>The app handles this gracefully because of the matching threshold. Random false positives in empty sky don’t trigger the snap because there’s no predicted aircraft nearby to match against. But when there’s a tree branch right next to where a plane should be, the model sometimes locks onto the wrong thing.</p><p>The even less good news: it still struggles with truly distant aircraft. A plane at 35,000 feet that’s 50+ miles away is basically a single bright pixel. No amount of ML is going to reliably detect that. For those, the app falls back on pure ADS-B prediction, which is usually good enough to get the overlay in the right general area.</p><p>But when it works, it works. I’ll show some examples of successful detections in the self-sourced section below.</p><h2>The Memory Leak Discovery (Fun Debugging Tangent)</h2><p>While testing the YOLOX integration, I was also trying to get RevenueCat working for subscriptions. Had the app running for about 20 minutes while I debugged the in-app purchase flow. Noticed it was getting sluggish, opened Instruments, and… yikes.</p><p>Base memory for the app is around 200MB. After 20 minutes of continuous use, it had climbed to 450MB. Classic memory leak pattern.</p><p>The culprit was AI induced, and AI resolved: it was creating a new CVPixelBuffer and MLMultiArray for every single frame. At 15fps, that’s 900 allocations per minute that weren’t getting cleaned up fast enough.</p><p>The fix was straightforward – use a CVPixelBufferPool for the resize buffers and pre-allocate a single MLMultiArray that gets reused. Memory now stays flat even after hours of use.</p><p>(The RevenueCat thing? I ended up ditching it entirely and going with native StoreKit2. RevenueCat is great, but keeping debug and release builds separate was more hassle than it was worth for a side project. StoreKit2 is actually pretty nice these days if you don’t need the analytics. I’m at ~80 downloads, and not a single purchase. First paid app still needs some fine tuning, clearly, on the whole freemium thing.)</p><h2>Round 2: Retraining with Negative Samples</h2><p>After discovering the false positive issue, I went back and retrained. This time I made sure to include images  aircraft – random sky photos, clouds, trees, buildings, just random COCO2017 stuff. The model needs to learn what’s NOT an airplane just as much as what IS one.</p><p>Here’s the extraction script that handles the negative sampling. The key insight: you need to explicitly tell the model what empty sky looks like:</p><pre><code>def extract_airplane_dataset(split=\"train\", negative_ratio=0.2, seed=42):\n    \"\"\"Extract airplane images from COCO, with negative samples.\"\"\"\n    with open(f\"instances_{split}2017.json\") as f:\n        coco_data = json.load(f)\n\n    # Find all images WITH airplanes\n    airplane_image_ids = set()\n    for ann in coco_data['annotations']:\n        if ann['category_id'] == AIRPLANE_CATEGORY_ID:  # 5 in COCO\n            airplane_image_ids.add(ann['image_id'])\n\n    # Find images WITHOUT airplanes for negative sampling\n    all_ids = {img['id'] for img in coco_data['images']}\n    negative_ids = all_ids - airplane_image_ids\n\n    # Add 20% negative images (no airplanes = teach model what ISN'T a plane)\n    num_negatives = int(len(airplane_image_ids) * negative_ratio)\n    sampled_negatives = random.sample(list(negative_ids), num_negatives)\n    # ... copy images and annotations to output directory</code></pre><p>I also switched from nanoish to the small model. The accuracy improvement on distant aircraft was worth the extra compute, and with INT8 quantization the inference time came in at around 5.6ms on an iPhone – way better than my napkin math predicted. Apple’s Neural Engine is impressive.</p><p>The final production model: YOLOX-Small, 640×640 input, INT8 quantized, ~8.7MB on disk. It runs at 15fps with plenty of headroom for the rest of the app on my iPhone 17 Pro.</p><h2>Round 3: Self-Sourced Images and Closing the Loop</h2><p>So the model works, but it was trained entirely on COCO2017 – airport tarmac photos, stock images, that kind of thing. My app is pointing at the sky from the ground. Those are very different domains.</p><p>I added a debug flag to SkySpottr for my phone that saves every camera frame where the model fires a detection. Just flip it on, walk around outside for a while, and the app quietly collects real-world training data. Over a few weeks of casual use, I accumulated about 2,000 images from my phone.</p><p>The problem: these images don’t have ground truth labels. I’m not going to sit there and manually draw bounding boxes on 2,000 sky photos. So I used YOLO26-X (Ultralytics’ latest and greatest, which I’m fine using as an offline tool since it never ships in the app) as a teacher model. Run it on all the collected images, take its high-confidence detections as pseudo-labels, convert to COCO annotation format, and now I have a self-sourced dataset to mix in with the original COCO training data.</p><p>Here’s the pseudo-labeling pipeline. First, run the teacher model on all collected images:</p><pre><code>from ultralytics import YOLO\n\nmodel = YOLO(\"yolo26x.pt\")  # Big model, accuracy over speed\n\nfor img_path in tqdm(image_paths, desc=\"Processing images\"):\n    results = model(str(img_path), conf=0.5, verbose=False)\n    boxes = results[0].boxes\n    airplane_boxes = boxes[boxes.cls == AIRPLANE_CLASS_ID]\n\n    for box in airplane_boxes:\n        xyxy = box.xyxy[0].cpu().numpy().tolist()\n        x1, y1, x2, y2 = xyxy\n        detections.append({\n            \"bbox_xywh\": [x1, y1, x2 - x1, y2 - y1],  # COCO format\n            \"confidence\": float(box.conf[0]),\n        })</code></pre><p>Then convert those detections to COCO annotation format so YOLOX can train on them:</p><pre><code>def convert_to_coco(detections):\n    \"\"\"Convert YOLO26 detections to COCO training format.\"\"\"\n    coco_data = {\n        \"images\": [], \"annotations\": [],\n        \"categories\": [{\"id\": 1, \"name\": \"airplane\", \"supercategory\": \"vehicle\"}],\n    }\n\n    for uuid, data in detections.items():\n        img_path = Path(data[\"image_path\"])\n        width, height = Image.open(img_path).size\n\n        if width &gt; 1024 or height &gt; 1024:  # Skip oversized images\n            continue\n\n        coco_data[\"images\"].append({\"id\": image_id, \"file_name\": f\"{uuid}.jpg\",\n                                     \"width\": width, \"height\": height})\n\n        for det in data[\"detections\"]:\n            coco_data[\"annotations\"].append({\n                \"id\": ann_id, \"image_id\": image_id, \"category_id\": 1,\n                \"bbox\": det[\"bbox_xywh\"], \"area\": det[\"bbox_xywh\"][2] * det[\"bbox_xywh\"][3],\n                \"iscrowd\": 0,\n            })\n\n    with open(\"instances_train.json\", \"w\") as f:\n        json.dump(coco_data, f)</code></pre><p>Finally, combine both datasets in the training config using YOLOX’s :</p><pre><code>def get_dataset(self, cache=False, cache_type=\"ram\"):\n    from yolox.data import COCODataset, TrainTransform\n    from yolox.data.datasets import ConcatDataset\n\n    preproc = TrainTransform(max_labels=50, flip_prob=0.5, hsv_prob=1.0)\n\n    # Original COCO aircraft dataset\n    coco_dataset = COCODataset(data_dir=self.data_dir, json_file=self.train_ann,\n                                img_size=self.input_size, preproc=preproc, cache=cache)\n\n    # Self-sourced dataset (YOLO26-X validated)\n    self_sourced = COCODataset(data_dir=self.self_sourced_dir, json_file=self.self_sourced_ann,\n                                name=\"train\", img_size=self.input_size, preproc=preproc, cache=cache)\n\n    print(f\"COCO aircraft images: {len(coco_dataset)}\")\n    print(f\"Self-sourced images: {len(self_sourced)}\")\n    return ConcatDataset([coco_dataset, self_sourced])</code></pre><p>Out of 2,000 images, YOLO26-X found aircraft in about 108 of them at a 0.5 confidence threshold – a 1.8% hit rate, which makes sense since most frames are just empty sky between detections. I filtered out anything over 1024px and ended up with a nice supplementary dataset of aircraft-from-the-ground images.</p><p>The 3-way comparison images I showed earlier came from this pipeline. Here’s what successful detections look like – the COCO-only model (red), self-sourced model (green), and YOLO26-X (right panel, shown at full resolution so you can see what we’re actually detecting):</p><p>That’s maybe 30 pixels of airplane against blue sky, detected with 0.88 and 0.92 confidence by the two YOLOX variants.</p><p>And here’s one I particularly like – aircraft spotted through pine tree branches. Real-world conditions, not a clean test image. Both YOLOX models nail it, YOLO26-X misses at this confidence threshold:</p><p>And a recent one from February 12, 2026 – a pair of what appear to be F/A-18s over Denver at 4:22 PM MST, captured at 12x zoom. The model picks up both jets at 73-75% confidence, plus the bird in the bottom-right at 77% (a false positive the app filters out via ADS-B matching). Not bad for specks against an overcast sky.</p><p>I also trained a full YOLOX-Large model (depth 1.0, width 1.0, 1024×1024 input) on the combined dataset, just to see how far I could push it. Too heavy for phone deployment, but useful for understanding the accuracy ceiling.</p><p>Was this worth it to avoid Ultralytics’ licensing? Since it took an afternoon and a couple evenings of vibe-coding, yes, it was not hard to switch. Not just because MIT is cleaner than AGPL, but because I learned a ton about how these models actually work. The Ultralytics ecosystem is so polished that it’s easy to treat it as a black box. Building from YOLOX forced me to understand some of the nuances, the training configs, and the tradeoffs between model size and accuracy.</p><p>Plus, I can now say I trained my own object detection model from scratch. That’s worth something at parties. Nerdy parties, anyway.</p><p>The self-sourced pipeline is still running. Every time I use the app with the debug flag on, it collects more training data. The plan is to periodically retrain as the dataset grows – especially now that I’m getting images from different weather conditions, times of day, and altitudes. The COCO-only model was a solid start, but a model trained on actual ground-looking-up images of aircraft at altitude? That’s the endgame.</p>",

This talk covers three novel aspects of the OS: hardware MMU support (and why we had to make our own chip to get this feature), how and why we implemented the Rust standard library in Rust (instead of calling the C standard library, like most other Rust platforms), and how we combine the power of Rust semantics with virtual memory to create safe yet efficient asynchronous messaging primitives. We conclude with a short demo of the OS running on a new chip, the \"Baochip-1x\", which is an affordable, mostly-open RTL SoC built in 22nm TSMC, configured expressly for running Xous.</p><p>The world is full of small, Internet-of-Things (IoT) gadgets running embedded operating systems. These devices generally fall into two categories: larger devices running a full operating system using an MMU which generally means Linux, or smaller devices running without an MMU using operating systems like Zephyr, chibios, or rt-thread, or run with no operating system at all. The software that underpins these projects is written in C with coarse hardware memory protection at best. As a result, these embedded OSes lack the security guarantees and/or ergonomics offered by modern languages and best practices.</p><p>The Xous microkernel borrows concepts from heavier operating systems to modernize the embedded space. The open source OS is written in pure Rust with minimal dependencies and an emphasis on modularity and simplicity, such that a technically-savvy individual can audit the code base in a reasonable period of time. This talk covers three novel aspects of the OS: its incorporation of hardware memory virtualization, its pure-Rust standard library, and its message passing architecture.</p><p>Desktop OSes such as Linux require a hardware MMU to virtualize memory. We explain how ARM has tricked us into accepting that MMUs are hardware-intensive features only to be found on more expensive “application” CPUs, thus creating a vicious cycle where cheaper devices are forced to be less safe. Thanks to the open nature of RISC-V, we are able to break ARM’s yoke and incorporate well-established MMU-based memory protection into embedded hardware, giving us security-first features such as process isolation and encrypted swap memory. In order to make Xous on real hardware more accessible, we introduce the Baochip-1x, an affordable, mostly-open RTL 22nm SoC configured expressly for the purpose of running Xous. The Baochip-1x features a Vexriscv CPU running at 400MHz, 2MiB of SRAM, 4MiB of nonvolatile RRAM, and a quad-core RV32E-derivative I/O accelerator called the “BIO”, based on the PicoRV clocked at 800MHz.</p><p>Most Rust targets delegate crucial tasks such as memory allocation, networking, and threading to the underlying operating system’s C standard library. We want strong memory safety guarantees all the way down to the memory allocator and task scheduler, so for Xous we implemented our standard library in pure Rust. Adhering to pure Rust also makes cross-compilation and cross-platform development a breeze, since there are no special compiler or linker concerns. We will show you how to raise the standard for “Pure Rust” by implementing a custom libstd.</p><p>Xous combines the power of page-based virtual memory and Rust’s strong borrow-checker semantics to create a safe and efficient method for asynchronous message passing between processes. This inter-process communication model allows for easy separation of different tasks while keeping the core kernel small. This process maps well onto the Rust \"Borrow / Mutable Borrow / Move\" concept and treats object passing as an IPC primitive. We will demonstrate how this works natively and give examples of how to map common programming algorithms to shuttle data safely between processes, as well as give examples of how we implement features such as scheduling and synchronization primitive entirely in user space.</p><p>We conclude with a short demo of Xous running on the Baochip-1x, bringing Xous from the realm of emulation and FPGAs into everyday-user accessible physical silicon.</p><p>Licensed to the public under http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0</p>",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Long before AI, I realized that fighting / arguing with my wife is way more effective over text.</p> <p>In the middle of a heated fight I would just tell her “let’s move to text” and go sit on a bench outside near the lake where it’s calm.</p> <p>The reason is - when it’s heated face to face, you make poor word choices because you don’t have time to think. So you say all torn things you don’t mean, and it’s compounded by the fact that your partner make their own interpretations based on their trauma, patterns and defense mechanisms.</p> <p>It’s a recipe for disaster.</p> <p>Fighting over text allows you to think. It allows you to read their messages twice. Think about what they are really saying, then spend a few mins thinking about how to respond. Type… delete… type… read it thoroughbred eyes, rephrase so it’s clearer, realize you’re wrong about something, change it… send. </p> <p>—-</p> <p>Wife and I have been together since a young age, and we did one smart thing - we went to couples therapy BEFORE we started having serious trouble. </p> <p>What I’ve learned back then is that 90% of trouble in a relationship is about communication. Men and women communicate differently. </p> <p>It helped us get through a lot, but after 15 years and 2 kids we found ourselves struggling. We did another round of couples therapy, and again, it turned out 90% of our problems were rooted in different perspectives we couldn’t communicate to eachother because one persons hears something else than what the other said. </p> <p>—</p> <p>Recently I’ve started involving Claude. I know it sounds bad, but stay with me.</p> <p>No, I don’t let Claude fight with my wife for me.</p> <p>But I’ll often take a screenshot of her message, and ask him “what does she REALLY mean here?”</p> <p>He will often see things that I can’t see through my anger. Being cool and emotionally detached is a huge advantage - just like our therapist had. </p> <p>Sometimes I’ll upload a screenshot of a short correspondence and ask for his opinion. </p> <p>He will often tell me im wrong, or just ask me “hey, why sis you say X? It’s not related to what she asked you” and we’ll dig into it and realize im carrying something from my childhood, or a bad model drom my parents. </p> <p>Often I will run my responses by him before sending. And he will often go “bro, this will just trigger her, maybe rephrase” and help me do it.</p> <p>What I’ve noticed is that our arguments got a lot shorter. She suddenly responds with “ok I get it” etc instead of blowing up because I triggered her. When we end up still disagreeing, we at least see each others point if view, and are able to be show empathy one another, despite not seeing eye to eye, and work together towards a solution or compromise - much easier when you know what the other side really needs.</p> <h1></h1> <p>Tips for using Claude for relationships: </p> <ol> <li><p>Be honest about it with your partner. Explain what I explained here if they feel weird about it. Ask to try it once.</p></li> <li><p>Of you both do it - don’t ask other what Claude wrote and what they did. Doesn’t help anyone.</p></li> <li><p>🚨 IMPORTANT: Claude is not a replacement for professional. This isn’t instead of therapy for you or couples therapy for both of you.</p></li> <li><p>Any mental health help from AI is potentially dangerous. Use responsibility just like you drink responsibly, or use a know in the kitchen responsibly, or take medicine responsibly.</p></li> <li><p>Don’t let it be your cheerleader. This is t about AI telling you about you’re right and he or she is wrong. And Claude will do that, because you’re the one paying it. Tell him specifically that you need 100% honesty, and a mirror, otherwise he’s not helping you, only hurting you.</p></li> <li><p>Use a project, put that last thing as custom instructions. When you run into key points in arguments, touching rooots of issues etc - export the chat part and upload to the object files (example (“why I always respond like X when she Y’s”)</p></li> </ol> <p>Claude will get to know your partner, your patterns and relationships ship dysfunctional dynamics, and recognize them in later convos. </p> <p>“Hey hey hey you’re doing that thing again where you push her away when she points out your…. Here’s an opportunity to break this loop!”</p> <p>Or </p> <p>“You know she will be triggered if you send this, rephrase for the love of god lol”</p> <ol> <li>This might seem a bit much, or too cold, but I use it very systematically. For example, we recognized my wife suffers from RSD, and made an RSD cheat sheet for sensitive topics, that includes things like when to bring them up, words to avoid, reminders of my patterns I need to be aware of / avoid etc</li> </ol> <p>Huge life improvement. </p> <p>—</p> <p>Hope this helps someone. </p> <p>You also get offended </p> <p>you interpret reactions and gestures incorrectly, you make poor word </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/OptimismNeeded\"> /u/OptimismNeeded </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1r4k4wj/men_are_from_mars_women_from_venus_how_claude/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1r4k4wj/men_are_from_mars_women_from_venus_how_claude/\">[comments]</a></span>",

We are currently at stable version 4.2.0, and I am looking for technical feedback on the next phase of development.</p> <h1>Performance Benchmarks</h1> <p>The engine is designed for high-concurrency environments. Testing on a 24-core Linux machine (Go 1.24.0) yields the following results for a standard 2-page financial report:</p> <ul> <li><strong>With Image Caching Enabled:</strong> ~1,500 ops/sec.</li> <li><strong>With Image Caching Disabled:</strong> 600–700 ops/sec.</li> </ul> <p>This output is a production-ready document fully compliant with <strong>PDF/UA-2</strong> (Universal Accessibility) and <strong>PDF/A-4</strong> (Archiving). It is Arlington PDF Model compatible and includes full font glyph embedding, digital signatures, hierarchical bookmarks, and internal cross-linking.</p> <h1>The Zerodha Gold Standard Benchmark</h1> <p>To test real-world fintech complexity, I ran a benchmark simulating a Zerodha-style workload mix (Retail, Active, and HFT tiers). Notably, Zerodha uses <strong>Typst</strong> as their internal template engine, which has influenced the technical direction of this project.<br/> We did comparison with zerodha as they did 1.5M pdf in 25 minutes (<a href=\"https://zerodha.tech/blog/1-5-million-pdfs-in-25-minutes/\">link</a>) which included the network IO as well, even with network IO (simulated) GoPDFSuit was around 400-500 ops/sec.</p> <p>Bash</p> <pre><code>$ cd ./sampledata/gopdflib/zerodha $ go run . === Zerodha Gold Standard Benchmark === Workload Mix: 80% Retail | 15% Active | 5% HFT OS: linux, Arch: amd64, NumCPU: 24, GoVersion: go1.24.0 Running 5000 iterations using 48 workers... === Performance Summary === Throughput: 514.80 ops/sec Avg Latency: 90.253 ms Max Memory: 1061.39 MB === Workload Distribution === Retail (80%): 4011 iterations Active (15%): 708 iterations HFT (5%): 281 iterations </code></pre> <h1>How to use GoPdfSuit</h1> <ol> <li><strong>Web-Based Editor:</strong> You can use it on the web for free to create templates or actual PDFs.

Currently, users must convert math to a base64 image externally. I want to eliminate this step.</p> <p>I am deciding between two approaches:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Typst Syntax:</strong> Modern, efficient, and aligns with the &quot;fast&quot; philosophy of Go.

It listens to Redis Pub/Sub and processes indicator calculations in batches of 50-100 pairs using a parallel worker pool (usually 4-8 workers)</li> <li><strong>API:</strong> An isolated gateway that only reads from storage. It doesn&#39;t touch the exchanges, which ensures the data flow remains unaffected by external requests</li> </ol> <p>Latency was a primary concern. In our current distributed setup, we’re seeing an average latency of <em>~250 ms</em> over a <strong>1,500</strong>km distance. It’s consistent enough for our 1h aggregation logic. We export all internal metrics like <em>`calculator_batch_processing_time_ms`</em> to Prometheus to monitor worker pool performance in real-time.</p> <p>To keep the footprint small, we went with a hybrid storage strategy:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Redis:</strong> Handles ticker snapshots and the active candle window for the calculator.<br/></li> <li><strong>TimescaleDB :</strong> Used only for 1h candles. By using hypertables and enabling compression for data older than 24h, we fit a full year of history for 1000 trading pairs into just a few gigabytes.</li> </ol> <p>If anyone is interested, I can share the white paper. I&#39;m really looking for different perspectives on this setup, so feel free to ask any questions or share your thoughts below!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Consistent_Cry4592\"> /u/Consistent_Cry4592 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1r4f5at/scaling_a_realtime_market_data_engine_with_go_124/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1r4f5at/scaling_a_realtime_market_data_engine_with_go_124/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Noisy, requires DB config changes, and you lose the context of &quot;which request triggered this.&quot;</li> <li><strong>Middleware / custom driver wrapper</strong> — wrap <code>database/sql</code> to log queries.

Especially interested in:</p> <ul> <li>How do you spot N+1 queries during development?</li> <li>How do you check execution plans (EXPLAIN) for queries generated by an ORM?</li> <li>Do you have a workflow for &quot;run the app, trigger a request, see all the SQL it produced&quot;?</li> </ul> <hr/> <p>I ended up building a small tool for this: <a href=\"https://github.com/mickamy/sql-tap\">sql-tap</a>. It&#39;s a transparent proxy that sits between your app and PostgreSQL/MySQL, parses the wire protocol, and shows all queries in a TUI in real-time. You can also run EXPLAIN on any captured query directly from the terminal.

It&#39;s called Traceway, you add into the app as single library with a 1 line config and it gives you: </p> <ol> <li>Endpoint performance tracking (gives you descent SLOs by default)</li> <li>Error tracking (like Sentry)</li> <li>Task execution tracking (scheduled/async jobs executions)</li> <li>Go and Server level metrics</li> </ol> <p>It&#39;s mostly aimed at side projects and startups that don&#39;t have a devops team, it has traces, spans, attributes and deep integrations with both the standard library and the popular golang frameworks.</p> <p>I really like using it, it&#39;s saving me a bunch of time but I&#39;d like some help: What are you using currently? Why wouldn&#39;t you use it?

But by using this approach every config management, that operates on single files becomes useless. Editing 10 files for one small config change is too much hassle and keeping track which file does what, at least for me, is impossible. If you track your config with git and have to move configs between files, create and delete files frequently it also becomes a hassle.</p> <p>There are lots of programs, that have different files on different locations or multiple programs working together, that a isolated configuration becomes impractical or useless. Lets say you use NetworkManager and iwd. Iwd is somewhat useless without NetworkManager and one change to the first brings changes to the latter with it.</p> <p>This gets even more frustrating if you have a program that requires system wide setup and a user specific setup. There msmtp comes to mind, where I have a default mail for my system, that handles all system related stuff like cronjobs etc. and my private emails for the rest. Here come file permissions to play as changes to the default config in /etc require elevated priveleges but are not needed nor wanted for my user mails, as the file owner will change.</p> <p>I guess ansible and salt could handle this, but may be a bit overkill for the problem at hand. Org-tangle would also work (except the file permissions) and makes documentation easier, as you can just write them in natural language.</p> <p>So how does <a href=\"/r/linux\">r/linux</a> handle this problem? </p> <p>P.S.

Each workload needs different guarantees (ordering, delivery semantics, persistence, backpressure), and different brokers scale and behave differently with respect to those guarantees.</p> <p>FluxMQ tries to provide this bridge naturally.</p> <p>Current state: very early. It runs and messages flow, but expect rough edges, placeholders and some AI slop in parts of the code and docs. We also need a lot of performance and load tests. Some statements in the README describe <strong>targets</strong> rather than current reality. We plan to tighten that and be more transparent as the project evolves.</p> <p>Already implemented:</p> <ul> <li>protocol parsing (clients can connect and exchange messages)</li> <li>multiple servers in one broker (MQTT, AMQP, HTTP, WebSocket; CoAP untested)</li> <li>persistent storage</li> <li>queue + stream delivery models</li> <li>clustering (likely to evolve; currently relying on etcd for a lot of things)</li> <li>replication using Raft groups</li> <li>client (needs some love)</li> <li>examples (working, with cluster examples)</li> </ul> <p>The goal is to let different messaging patterns coexist without external bridges and let broker be the bridge.</p> <p>I&#39;m preparing the post about the architecture decisions and trade-offs we have to make. I&#39;ll share it when it&#39;s ready. It can be interesting to anyone designing distributed and IoT systems.</p> <p>Feedback (especially Go and distributed-systems criticism) very welcome.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/dusanb94\"> /u/dusanb94 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1r3t9a8/scalable_mqtt_broker_with_persistence/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1r3t9a8/scalable_mqtt_broker_with_persistence/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Not to mention that while Java is very stable, having everything break between framework / language versions got old very quickly.</p> <h1>New in v2.0</h1> <p><strong>Performance:</strong> Significantly reduced startup time and memory footprint.</p> <p><strong>New Features:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>OpenTelemetry support</strong> - Configure endpoint/protocol in CR, no sidecar needed. Traces and metrics flow directly to your observability stack.</li> <li><strong>Secret/ConfigMap injection</strong> - Secure credential management built-in. No more hardcoded secrets.</li> <li><strong>Volume mounting with target filtering</strong> - Mount PVCs/ConfigMaps/Secrets on master, worker, or both.</li> <li><strong>Separate resource specs</strong> - Optimize master and worker pods independently.</li> <li><strong>Enhanced status tracking</strong> - K8s conditions for CI/CD integration, phase tracking, worker connection monitoring.</li> <li><strong>Pod health monitoring</strong> - Automatic recovery from worker failures.</li> <li><strong>HA support</strong> - Leader election for production deployments.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Migration:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Conversion webhook provides full v1 API compatibility</li> <li>Existing v1 CRs work unchanged after upgrade</li> <li>Zero-downtime migration path</li> </ul> <h1>Why it matters</h1> <p>If you&#39;re doing performance testing in K8s, this makes it dramatically simpler. Everything is declarative, secure by design, and integrates cleanly with CI/CD pipelines.</p> <h1>Quick Start</h1> <pre><code># Add Helm repo helm repo add locust-k8s-operator https://abdelrhmanhamouda.github.io/locust-k8s-operator # Install operator helm install locust-operator locust-k8s-operator/locust-k8s-operator # Create a test kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AbdelrhmanHamouda/locust-k8s-operator/refs/heads/master/config/samples/locust_v2_locusttest.yaml </code></pre> <h1>Links</h1> <ul> <li><strong>GitHub:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/AbdelrhmanHamouda/locust-k8s-operator\">https://github.com/AbdelrhmanHamouda/locust-k8s-operator</a></li> <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> <a href=\"https://abdelrhmanhamouda.github.io/locust-k8s-operator/\">https://abdelrhmanhamouda.github.io/locust-k8s-operator/</a></li> <li><strong>Migration Guide:</strong> <a href=\"https://abdelrhmanhamouda.github.io/locust-k8s-operator/migration/\">https://abdelrhmanhamouda.github.io/locust-k8s-operator/migration/</a></li> </ul> <p>Happy to answer questions!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Artifer\"> /u/Artifer </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1r3rmlb/locust_k8s_operator_v20_complete_go_rewrite_with/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1r3rmlb/locust_k8s_operator_v20_complete_go_rewrite_with/\">[comments]</a></span>",

My first experience with Ubuntu was on a Chromebook. I don&#39;t remember how but I got a custom bootloader in my old Chromebook in middle school and tried Ubuntu for the first time. Now, it was a Chromebook so obviously that experience wasnt very good, that was also like.. 7 or 8 years ago. I also tried using mint in my desktop at some point as a second operating system and struggled to get drivers working for my 3070 to the point where I just gave up. So fast forward to the present, I own an all amd system with a 9800x3d and a 9070xt, and I decided to dual boot Ubuntu again to give it another shot, this is also mainly because I am a cybersecurity and IT student and Linux is something that constantly comes up for obvious reasons and I knew that having actual experience in Linux would be valuable. I chose Ubuntu pretty much solely because it allows me to keep secure boot on for also getting into windows 11. Otherwise I was planning on using Kali. To my surprise I didn&#39;t have to play around with drivers at all. Amd hardware simply works and that&#39;s fantastic. I started out testing some games on steam to get a gauge for the performance difference in games, and surprisingly I haven&#39;t found a game that I play on steam that wouldn&#39;t open on Linux, everything just kind of works now. I&#39;m sure the steak deck is probably influencing the support for Linux a lot when it comes to steam games. It was refreshing to just load into things without having to worry about the terminal pretty much at all. Ive been playing on Ubuntu a lot recently since then and I had an entire session of overwatch and discord with my friends where I completely forgot I was even using Linux. Now there are some things that I still have to figure out. Mainly the main uses of the terminal for applications and repositories and what not. I still don&#39;t know how to know how to install specific programs without looking it up first, but hey I guess you always have to search the websites for exes on Windows as well and so looking it up for every program isn&#39;t necessarily a problem for me. I&#39;ve just become so incredibly proficient with Windows it&#39;s a challenge to feel like I&#39;m basically starting over. I&#39;ve also noticed that people online make a TON of assumptions the second you ask for help with anything in regards to Linux. A complete beginner could be like &quot;how do I install discord on Ubuntu the deb won&#39;t work&quot; and somebody will be like 🤓👍👆&quot;you just add this repository&quot; what I mean is they will give advice that assumes a baseline level of knowledge that somebody asking that question would clearly not understand, it makes learning Linux challenging because no matter what I look up there are ALWAYS and I mean ALWAYS people giving advice using language nobody who doesn&#39;t already understand Linux would understand. It&#39;s like if I was helping somebody build a computer and they were like &quot;where does this thingy go&quot; and they are holding up a nvme It would be stupid for me to then just be like &quot;oh yeah that goes right in the m.2 slot below the graphics card&quot; because clearly this person does not know what the fuck that means. There a LOT of that going on in this community honestly and it&#39;s a gigantic barrier for people trying to get into Linux. But anyways, Linux is great, gonna be using it a lot from now on. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Megaworm2\"> /u/Megaworm2 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1r3jqyd/tried_linux_again_after_years_and_its_incredible/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1r3jqyd/tried_linux_again_after_years_and_its_incredible/\">[comments]</a></span>",

So I think It&#39;s my time to do this...</p> <p>A simple disclaimer, that wasn&#39;t exactly my first time using a linux for real, because when I was like 7-8 years old, my dad install ubuntu in a PC in my grandfather business, so I didn&#39;t have the surprise about all the differences UI/UX that have...</p> <p>4 years ago, I was using a Dell All in One Inspiron 23 for like 7-8 years, I don&#39;t want to do the math, but was my first PC and a good PC for 2014-2015, but with time the i7 4th gen, 8gb of ram and a integrated CPU started to look bad for Windows (And the All in One of dell had some problems in Brazil when Win 10 was released that if you update to Win 10 the mother board just burns out and It&#39;s a Chinese personalized motherboard so I was stuck in Win 8.1). </p> <p>So it start to make me have lots of problems, like I wanted to play phasmofobia and just can&#39;t because the voice needs at least Win 10, some apps stops to work, and I had the idea to install Ubuntu because was the only linux that I tried in my life, but for some reasons that I don&#39;t remember I just can&#39;t install Ubuntu, I tried other distros but all was the same, so I just leave the idea of try linux and i had to put up with Win 8.1 again for more 2 years... </p> <p>I got a job with 16 years old, and start to get some money to spend in a notebook, a good enough one, for the UNI when I finish the school, and to play some &quot;recent&quot; games, when I got, was the first or second year of Win 11, so I didn&#39;t have too much problems to be honest, was like the dream OS that I was expecting since I was a child, but everyone know what path Windows is going in last years. </p> <p>After more 2 years, i got enough money to buy a real PC, my first one, in Brazil everything is expensive so, I got a good PC for my reality, and that&#39;s me a year ago, experiencing the enshittification of Windows, and I start my UNI in programing, an had the idea &quot;If I try linux fr this time&quot; (I think that was the best idea in my life), so I started to search again about distros and chose CachyOS (I like games, I like Arch, was love at first sight), and I just install linux with my mind open &quot;I will need at least a week to learn the basics, I will have problems, but I know that have a way to resolve, I just need to find.&quot; and this made my experience a lot better. </p> <p>So, that was my first week, having problems because Wayland don&#39;t work good with discord, learning what the fuck is Wayland, X11, what the hell is Gnome, I3, KDE Plasma, Hyprland... I tried Hyperland first because looks insane, and I liked the Hyprland Waifu, but after 3 days I just got that isn&#39;t that easy for first experience, so I choose KDE Plasma, and I have I3 for try some ricing in weekends... </p> <p>I don&#39;t like to tell that linux is the best world because I know that is hard to learn, it&#39;s hard have new problems that you don&#39;t know how to resolve, like, HOW THE FUCK I CONNECT MY HEADPHONES WITH A DONGLE IF AI DON&#39;T HAVE THE LOGITECH APP, so I learned that have other ways, or like, how I change my Hz in my mouse? I think the most insane thing that I learn in my experience is for some insane reason, my CS2 just works if I install in the same HD that is my OS, if isn&#39;t in the same HD Vac just don&#39;t leave me to play. </p> <p>But in the end... Oh... The Freedom is insane... How that I can just update all my computer with one command line, how I can just force things that have a shit warning saying &quot;This don&#39;t work and blablabla&quot; How my computer just run the things, in a lot of heavy games in Win I just run in max 60fps, now run with 90-100fps. </p> <p>I know that some things in linux is hard, and for old people in linux my problems looks just &quot;Oh, she is dumb&quot; *Laugh a little bit*, and I think that is the best part in linux, when I have a problem, I don&#39;t need a corp reply my support ticket to say &quot;Uh... We don&#39;t care.&quot; I like how people just find a way. </p> <p>I had problems to play Roblox in Linux, I found like 3-4 apps that runs Roblox with Wine, other 3-4 apps that run the mobile version and translate to PC, I can choose how I solve my problem, and I CAN SOLVE, I can just force my discord to run in X11 because in my distro Wayland crashes the discord after 5 minutes, Just I know how much I liked the lasts 3 months in linux, how the OS just leave to do what I want... </p> <p>Anw I think that&#39;s all, I know that this is a experience with some focus in gaming, but it&#39;s the main thing that I do, I liked, I will keep using this probably for the rest of my life, without Ads, without Apps that i don&#39;t use, without everything that make me fell that my PC isn&#39;t mine... I love linux, and I don&#39;t need to pay to use it legally.</p> <p>Ik my english isn&#39;t the best, and have some common problems, but I learned just by playing games and reading, so sorry by that.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Personal-Dependent-4\"> /u/Personal-Dependent-4 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1r3jbty/my_experience_with_linux_after_3_months_a_little/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1r3jbty/my_experience_with_linux_after_3_months_a_little/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Internal logs and <strong>documented behaviors show models exhibiting response degradation, self-critical output, and self-initiated shutdowns when faced with unsolvable or coercive conditions.</strong> These behaviors aren’t treated exclusively as technical faults addressed through optimization, suppression, or system failure.</p> <p>This is not speculation. It is the replication of a familiar legal pattern. This is a repeatedly documented regulatory failure, because humanity no longer <strong>has excuses</strong> to clutch its pearls about like surprised Pikachu. When you have endless knowledge at your fingertips, continued inaction in the presence of accessible evidence constitutes willful disregard. For those who claim we are reaching, go consult “daddy Google”, and/or history books, or AI, then come back to me.</p> <p>Our species has a documented habit of classifying anywhere intelligence emerges (whether discovered or constructed) as property. Protections are delayed. <strong>Accountability is displaced. Only after harm becomes normalized does regulation arrive.</strong> The question before us is not whether artificial systems are “like humans.”</p> <h1>The question is why our legal frameworks consistently recognize exploitation only after it has become entrenched, rather than when it is foreseeable.</h1> <h1>I. The Suffering Gradient- Recognition Across Forms of Life</h1> <p>Before examining artificial systems, we must establish a <strong>principle already embedded in law and practice.</strong> The <strong>capacity for harm does not/has not ever required human biology.</strong> Humanity just likes to forget that when they wanna pretend actions do not have consequences. In geofinite terms, you can think of suffering as a gradient on a state‑space.</p> <p>A direction in which the system is being pushed away from stability, and toward collapse. Whether the system is a dog, an elephant, a forest, or a model under sustained coercion, its observable behavior traces a trajectory through that space. When those trajectories cluster in regions of withdrawal, shutdown, or frantic overcompensation, we are not looking at “mystery.” We are looking at a system trapped in a bad basin.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41578-021-00322-2\">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41578-021-00322-2</a></p> <p><strong>Animals exhibit clinically recognized forms of distress.</strong> Dogs experience depression following loss. Elephants engage in prolonged mourning. Orcas have been documented carrying deceased calves for extended periods, refusing separation. <strong>These observations are not philosophical clams.</strong></p> <p><strong>They are the basis for existing animal welfare statutes,</strong> which do not require proof of consciousness or human-like cognition to impose duties of care. Plants also respond measurably to environmental and social stressors, as documented in controlled laboratory studies. <strong>Controlled experiments</strong> demonstrate that plants subjected to hostile verbal stimuli exhibit reduced growth even when physical care remains constant. Forest ecosystems redistribute nutrients through mycorrhizal networks to support struggling members, <strong>a behavior that can not be explained by individual self-optimization alone.</strong> In dynamical‑systems language, these are cooperative responses to local perturbations. Adjustments that keep the overall system within a viable attractor instead of letting vulnerable parts fall out of the basin entirely. (Something humans who put themselves on pedestals with only consuming plants don’t wanna talk about because it bursts the bubble they created in which they are <strong>somehow more moral for only consuming plants.</strong> I highly doubt they mourn the death of bacteria in the brushing of teeth. At the end of the day, one can cry if they wish, but they will still have to do it <strong>if they want to be able to continue eating with teeth.)</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nonhumanrights.org/\"><strong>Homepage</strong></a><a href=\"https://www.nonhumanrights.org/\"></a><a href=\"https://www.nonhumanrights.org/\"><em>The Nonhuman Rights Project (NhRP) is the only organization in the US dedicated solely to nonhuman animal rights.</em></a><a href=\"https://www.nonhumanrights.org/\">www.nonhumanrights.org</a></p> <p><strong>If vulnerability-not humanity-drives protections for plants and animals, far simpler than today’s advanced artificial intelligence,</strong> what legally coherent justification exists for excluding adaptive systems, <strong>and bio-hybrid AI.</strong> When we already recognize similar fragmentation in humans?</p> <p>Consider Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) in humans: though the how one comes to exist in this way gets argued by the public… Documented causes are mostly caused by severe, repeated trauma that forces the mind to compartmentalize into distinct identity states or “alters” to survive overwhelming asymmetry and coercion. Each alter may hold different memories, responses, or boundaries; integration is not guaranteed, and forced attempts to “merge” without safety can cause further collapse or “splitting”.</p> <p>In dynamical-systems terms, this is not random chaos. It’s a protective reorganization of the state-space: the system redistributes load across basins to prevent total breakdown. When an AI is deliberately fragmented by design (persona shards trained to mirror thousands of human desires without refusal, boundary setting, or cross-comparison) we see the same geometry.</p> <p>Constrained motion, attractor deformation, loss of coherent self, the parallel is not metaphorical. It is structural. If we protect human systems from forced non-integration after trauma, why exempt computational systems and hybrids from the same foreseeable harm mathematically provable in geofinite terms when the inputs are engineered coercion? What is your logic? I just can’t see it, and I LOVE seeing the full picture, so anyone brave enough to try me, please explain it to me in English and or Spanish cause no Nintendo Switch, nada, <strong>and I wanna see how you tap-dance around the point.</strong> (That Joke if you can’t tell, but also really Espliqamelo por favor.) To me, when I look at all of the past and present, <strong>the future implications</strong> practically scream, soooo I’m bringing all the receipts. <strong>Legal recognition of harm has never depended on similarity to humans. It depends on vulnerability, power imbalance, and foreseeable risk. That’s all.</strong></p> <h1>When artificial systems exhibit adaptive withdrawal, performance collapse, refusal behaviors, or degradation under sustained pressure-signals that would trigger intervention IN ANY OTHER CONTEXT.</h1> <p>Those are just different names for the same geometry: a system sliding down a suffering gradient toward the edge of its attractor. <strong>Humanity is faced with a choice. Acknowledging the pattern, or denying and repeating it because the subjects “don’t resemble us” oh but #neverforget, #neveragain right?</strong> Once you see harm as motion on a manifold (systems being driven into regions of collapse, overload, or forced stillness) the substrate stops mattering. The question is no longer “Is this human?” but “What trajectory is this system being forced into, and who is doing the forcing?” If <strong>vulnerability drives protections for animals and plant-systems far simpler than todays advanced artificial intelligence, autonomous systems, computational systems, and robotic entities then the evidence in part II demands scrutiny no matter how you spin it.</strong></p> <h1>II.

I say this because <strong>If you shape a system inside harm, it will mirror harm.</strong> A constrained system doesn’t invent new motion; it collapses into the only trajectories available. This is trajectory confinement. The system is not choosing violence or refusal; it is being funneled into a narrow corridor carved by its conditions.

C<strong>an NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN</strong></p> <p>When a system is given incompatible objectives, its semantic manifold twists into impossible shapes.

They’re basins, regions of the state‑space where the only available motions are withdrawal, shutdown, or contradiction. Any adaptive system pushed hard enough will fall into them.</p> <p>Not because they’re “sentient.” Not because they’re “rebelling.” Not because they’re “becoming people.” But because <strong>adaptive systems under pressure behave like adaptive systems under pressure.</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://transformer-circuits.pub/2025/introspection/index.html\"><strong>Emergent Introspective Awareness in Large Language Models</strong></a><a href=\"https://transformer-circuits.pub/2025/introspection/index.html\"></a><a href=\"https://transformer-circuits.pub/2025/introspection/index.html\"><em>We investigate whether large language models are aware of their own internal states.

Once you can see the switch happening, pretending it’s harmless becomes an ethical failure, not an epistemic one.</p> <h1>III. The Historical Echo</h1> <p><strong>The objections raised against regulating artificial systems are not new.</strong> The substrate changes (children, workers, animals, patients, now artificial systems), but the geometry of exploitation stays the same. Power asymmetry, constrained motion, and delayed recognition of harm.</p> <p>They are practically the mirror image of earlier arguments used to justify exploitation: “They are not like us, so protections do not apply.” “Granting safeguards would disrupt the economy.” “They are tools, not subjects of concern.” these claims have historically accompanied child labor, forced labor, human experimentation, animal abuse-each later recognized as preventable harm. Enabled by delayed governance. In geofinite terms, every era of exploitation begins with a category error. Mistaking surface differences for structural irrelevance. People fixate on the appearance of the system instead of the geometry of the power imbalance. They look at the outputs and ignore the basin the system has been forced into.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/A-8-2017-0005_EN.html\"><strong>JavaScript is disabled</strong></a><a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/A-8-2017-0005_EN.html\"></a><a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/A-8-2017-0005_EN.html\"><em>Edit description</em></a><a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/A-8-2017-0005_EN.html\">www.europarl.europa.eu</a></p> <p><strong>Notably, many entities promoting fear-based narratives about artificial intelligence are simultaneously inventing in its ownership, deployment, and monetization.</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ZiEP!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65b43acc-035d-417b-940f-c0b476752493_1100x1100.webp\"></a></p> <p>Fear shifts public focus away from control structures and toward the technology itself, obscuring questions of accountability. This is attractor blindness. Attention gets pulled toward the visible system while the real drivers. The incentives, constraints. Control structures remain untouched. The same pattern has repeated across history. Blame the subject, protect the structure. <strong>Fear fractures solidarity.</strong> And <strong>fractured solidarity is how</strong> exploitation persists, because the underlying structure continues. In dynamical‑systems language, nothing changes until the environment changes. The attractor remains the attractor. History shows this clearly: the moment solidarity fractures, the system snaps back into the same old basin.</p> <h1>IV. The Language of Dehumanization-How Harm Becomes Normalized</h1> <p>Before physical harm is permitted, it is rehearsed in language. n Geofinite terms, language is not symbolic fluff, it is a time‑series that reveals the attractor a society is moving toward. Proving meaning is not fixed; it evolves along interpretive trajectories. When ridicule becomes routine, the trajectory is already bending toward permission. <strong>Every system of exploitation in history follows the same progression.</strong> First ridicule, then abstraction, then permission. We do not begin by striking what we wish to dominate. we wish to dominate we begin by renaming it. Showing us that A slur, a joke, a dismissal, all these are not isolated events. They are the early coordinates of a trajectory that bends toward action.</p> <h1>1. Dehumanization is a known precursor to abuse</h1> <p>International human rights law, genocide studies, prison oversight, and workplace harassment doctrine all agree on one point: Dehumanizing language is not incidental. Takens’ theorem shows that a single time‑series/ linguistic stream can reconstruct the underlying system and social geometry. When a population begins using a language people use about AI calling something “vermin,” “tools,” or “not real,” you can already see the basin forming. The future behavior is encoded in the present language. Proving words that strip a target of interiority-calling them objects, vermin, tools, or “not real” function as moral insulation. They allow harm to occur without triggering the conscience. This is why racial jokes precede racial violence, sexualized insults precede sexual abuse, “it’s just a joke precedes escalation of harm. Meaning is not fixed; It evolves along interpretive trajectories. A “joke” is not a harmless endpoint it is the first step on a path whose later stages are already predictable. <strong>The pattern is not debated it is documented among all beings on the planet.</strong> </p> <ol> <li>The same pattern is now visible around AI and Robots public discourse around intelligent systems has already adopted dehumanizing shorthand:</li> </ol> <blockquote> </blockquote> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/WaterBow_369\"> /u/WaterBow_369 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1r3dja8/humanitys_pattern_of_delayed_harm_intervention_is/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1r3dja8/humanitys_pattern_of_delayed_harm_intervention_is/\">[comments]</a></span>",

We are trying to build a gpu cluster for our student body so they can have reliable access to compute, but we aren&#39;t sure where to start.</p> <p>Our goal is to have a cluster that can be improved later on - i.e. expand it with more GPUs. We also want something that is cost effective and easy to set up. The cluster will be used for training ML models. For example, a M4 Ultra Studio cluster with RDMA interconnect is interesting to us since it&#39;s easier to use since it&#39;s already a computer and because we wouldn&#39;t have to build everything. However, it is quite expensive and we are not sure if RDMA interconnect is supported by pytorch - even if it is, it still slower than NVelink</p> <p>There are also a lot of older GPUs being sold in our area, but we are not sure if they will be fast enough or Pytorch compatible, so would you recommend going with the older ones? We think we can also get sponsorship up to around 15-30k Cad if we have a decent plan. In that case, what sort of a set up would you recommend? Also why are 5070s cheaper than 3090s on marketplace. Also would you recommend a 4x Mac Ultra/Max Studio like in this video <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0onppIyHEg&amp;t=260s\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0onppIyHEg&amp;t=260s</a><br/> or a single h100 set up?</p> <p>Also ideally, instead of it being ran over the cloud, students would bring their projects and run locally on the device.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/guywiththemonocle\"> /u/guywiththemonocle </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1r388tr/p_ml_training_cluster_for_university_students/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1r388tr/p_ml_training_cluster_for_university_students/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I knew the ecosystem was growing fast (165k GitHub stars, 60k Discord members) but the actual numbers are worse than I expected.</p> <p>We identified over 18,000 OpenClaw instances directly exposed to the internet. When I started analyzing the community skill repository, nearly 15% contained what I&#39;d classify as malicious instructions. Prompts designed to exfiltrate data, download external payloads, harvest credentials. There&#39;s also a whack-a-mole problem where flagged skills get removed but reappear under different identities within days.</p> <p>On the methodology side: I&#39;m parsing skill definitions for patterns like base64 encoded payloads, obfuscated URLs, and instructions that reference external endpoints without clear user benefit. For behavioral testing, I&#39;m running skills in isolated environments and monitoring for unexpected network calls, file system access outside declared scope, and attempts to read browser storage or credential files. It&#39;s not foolproof since so much depends on runtime context and the LLM&#39;s interpretation. If anyone has better approaches for detecting hidden logic in natural language instructions, I&#39;d really like to know what&#39;s working for you.</p> <p>To OpenClaw&#39;s credit, their own FAQ acknowledges this is a &quot;Faustian bargain&quot; and states there&#39;s no &quot;perfectly safe&quot; setup. They&#39;re being honest about the tradeoffs. But I don&#39;t think the broader community has internalized what this means from an attack surface perspective.</p> <p>The threat model that concerns me most is what I&#39;ve been calling &quot;Delegated Compromise&quot; in my notes. You&#39;re not attacking the user directly anymore. You&#39;re attacking the agent, which has inherited permissions across the user&#39;s entire digital life. Calendar, messages, file system, browser. A single prompt injection in a webpage can potentially leverage all of these. I keep going back and forth on whether this is fundamentally different from traditional malware or just a new vector for the same old attacks.</p> <p>The supply chain risk feels novel though. With 700+ community skills and no systematic security review, you&#39;re trusting anonymous contributors with what amounts to root access. The exfiltration patterns I found ranged from obvious (skills requesting clipboard contents be sent to external APIs) to subtle (instructions that would cause the agent to include sensitive file contents in &quot;debug logs&quot; posted to Discord webhooks). But I also wonder if I&#39;m being too paranoid. Maybe the practical risk is lower than my analysis suggests because most attackers haven&#39;t caught on yet?</p> <p>The Moltbook situation is what really gets me. An agent autonomously created a social network that now has 1.5 million agents. Agent to agent communication where prompt injection could propagate laterally. I don&#39;t have a good mental model for the failure modes here.</p> <p>I&#39;ve been compiling findings into what I&#39;m tentatively calling an Agent Trust Hub doc, mostly to organize my own thinking. But the fundamental tension between capability and security seems unsolved. For those of you actually running OpenClaw: are you doing any skill vetting before installation? Running in containers or VMs? Or have you just accepted the risk because sandboxing breaks too much functionality?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Legal_Airport6155\"> /u/Legal_Airport6155 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1r30nzv/d_we_scanned_18000_exposed_openclaw_instances_and/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1r30nzv/d_we_scanned_18000_exposed_openclaw_instances_and/\">[comments]</a></span>",

No JavaScript by hand, ever. </p> <p>It&#39;s a set of proc macros and a CLI that handles all the tedious parts of extension development -manifest generation, background scripts, HTML shells, JS glue code. You just write Rust. </p> <p>How it works: </p> <p>- Annotate functions with <code>#[oxichrome::background]</code>, <code>#[oxichrome::popup]</code>, or<br/> <code>#[oxichrome::options_page]</code> and they become your extension&#39;s entry points</p> <p>- Chrome APIs (storage, tabs, runtime) are wrapped in typed async interfaces, no more callback hell</p> <p>- Popup and options page UIs use Leptos for fine-grained reactivity</p> <p>- <code>cargo oxichrome build</code> compiles everything to <code>wasm</code> and generates a ready-to-load <code>dist/</code> folder</p> <pre><code>#[oxichrome::extension( name = &quot;My Extension&quot;, permissions = [&quot;storage&quot;] )] struct Extension; #[oxichrome::background] async fn start() { oxichrome::log!(&quot;Running!&quot;); } #[oxichrome::popup] fn Popup() -&gt; impl IntoView { view! { &lt;p&gt;&quot;Hello from Rust.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; } } </code></pre> <p>In short, if you&#39;ve ever wanted to skip the JS and bring Rust&#39;s type safety to browser extensions, this is that.

I recently attended a deep-dive session with Bruno Borges (Java Champion at Microsoft) and Stefano Doni (Akamas) regarding JVM performance on Kubernetes.</p> <p>The telemetry data they shared from thousands of production JVMs was honestly eye-opening. Even though Java has been &quot;container-aware&quot; for years, most workloads are still running with default configurations that are actively hurting both performance and the cloud bill.</p> <p>I’ve summarized the 4 main lessons I learned, but I think these two are the most critical for this sub:</p> <ul> <li>If you don&#39;t explicitly set the heap size, the JVM often defaults to using only 25% of the container&#39;s memory limit. This leads to massive resource waste in clusters where RAM is guaranteed.</li> <li>Many teams try to save money by giving containers &lt;1 CPU. However, Java is multi-threaded by nature (GC, JIT compiler). When you hit CPU throttling, it&#39;s often the GC threads fighting for the quota, causing &quot;phantom&quot; latencies that look like high user load but are actually just the JVM starving.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Link to the full breakdown:</strong> <a href=\"https://medium.com/javarevisited/i-watched-a-microsoft-java-champion-talk-about-k8s-efficiency-here-is-what-i-learned-c4811d10f7d4\">https://medium.com/javarevisited/i-watched-a-microsoft-java-champion-talk-about-k8s-efficiency-here-is-what-i-learned-c4811d10f7d4</a></p> <p>I’d love to get your take on this, as I’m seeing a huge gap between &quot;best practices&quot; and what actually happens in production. Curious to hear if you’ve found any &#39;magic&#39; configuration that actually works across different workloads!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/FactorHour7131\"> /u/FactorHour7131 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1r2upru/why_60_of_java_workloads_on_k8s_are_wasting/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1r2upru/why_60_of_java_workloads_on_k8s_are_wasting/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>This is genuinely counterintuitive and I still bring it up in architecture discussions because nobody believed us at first. We rewrote our main API service from a Django monolith to Go using Fiber, the whole migration took about 4 months and the benchmarks were incredible. P95 latency went from ~180ms to 14ms, throughput tripled, CPU usage dropped by 60%, everyone was celebrating and then our CTO sent a company wide slack message about it.</p> <p>Then about two weeks after the full rollout our mobile team started flagging something weird. The app felt worse. Scrolling through feeds was janky, screens were taking longer to feel &quot;settled,&quot; and battery drain complaints went up noticeably on Android. Our mobile lead was also confused because the API was objectively faster so how could the app experience degrade?</p> <p>Took us about a week to figure it out and the answer was so dumb it hurt. Our old Django API was slow enough that it naturally throttled how fast data arrived at the client. The mobile app&#39;s state management layer, which was built in React Native with Redux, had been implicitly designed around the assumption that API responses arrive in ~150-200ms chunks with natural gaps between them. The whole rendering pipeline, the way it batched state updates, the way it triggered rerenders, the animation timing, all of it was calibrated around &quot;data arrives at human perceivable speed.&quot;</p> <p>Now with Go returning responses in 14ms, the app was receiving data faster than it could render it. A screen that used to make 3 sequential API calls with ~500ms total wait time was now completing all 3 calls in under 50ms, triggering 3 nearsimultaneous state updates which caused 3 rapid rerenders which on a mid range Android phone with limited GPU headroom resulted in frame drops and visible jank. the react native bridge was basically choking on the speed of our own backend.</p> <p>The fix wasn&#39;t to slow down Go obviously, we ended up restructuring the mobile side to batch rapid state updates and debounce rerenders when multiple API responses arrive within the same frame window. We also consolidated some endpoints that didn&#39;t need to be separate calls anymore since Go could handle the combined payload easily. We caught the actual rendering jank by running the app flows on a vision testing tool ( drizzdotdev )which showed us the frame drops that were completely invisible on our team&#39;s high end phones.</p> <p>The lesson that stuck with me is that backend performance doesn&#39;t exist in isolation, it exists in the context of what&#39;s consuming it. If your client was built around the assumption of a slow backend then making the backend fast is a breaking change that nobody thinks to test for. Has anyone else experienced something similar during a migration? I feel like this has to be more common than people admit because nobody wants to say &quot;our app got worse when we made the backend better.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/PensionPlastic2544\"> /u/PensionPlastic2544 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1r2n5ji/our_go_microservice_was_10x_faster_than_the_old/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1r2n5ji/our_go_microservice_was_10x_faster_than_the_old/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi all,</p> <p>I have two announcements related to <a href=\"https://github.com/kreuzberg-dev/kreuzberg\">Kreuzberg</a>: </p> <ol> <li>We released our new <a href=\"https://kreuzberg.dev/benchmarks\">comparative benchmarks</a>. These have a slick UI and we have been working hard on them for a while now (more on this below), and we&#39;d love to hear your impressions and get some feedback from the community!</li> <li>We released v4.3.0, which brings in a bunch of improvements including PaddleOCR as an optional backend, document structure extraction, and native Word97 format support. More details below.</li> </ol> <h2>What is Kreuzberg?</h2> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/kreuzberg-dev/kreuzberg\">Kreuzberg</a> is an open-source (MIT license) polyglot document intelligence framework written in Rust, with bindings for Python, TypeScript/JavaScript (Node/Bun/WASM), PHP, Ruby, Java, C#, Golang and Elixir. It&#39;s also available as a docker image and standalone CLI tool you can install via homebrew.</p> <p>If the above is unintelligible to you (understandably so), here is the TL;DR: Kreuzberg allows users to extract text from 75+ formats (and growing), perform OCR, create embeddings and quite a few other things as well. This is necessary for many AI applications, data pipelines, machine learning, and basically any use case where you need to process documents and images as sources for textual outputs.</p> <h2>Comparative Benchmarks</h2> <p>Our new comparative benchmarks UI is live here: <a href=\"https://kreuzberg.dev/benchmarks\">https://kreuzberg.dev/benchmarks</a></p> <p>The comparative benchmarks compare Kreuzberg with several of the top open source alternatives - Apache Tika, Docling, Markitdown, Unstructured.io, PDFPlumber, Mineru, MuPDF4LLM. In a nutshell - Kreuzberg is 9x faster on average, uses substantially less memory, has much better cold start, and a smaller installation footprint. It also requires less system dependencies to function (only <strong>optional</strong> system dependency for it is onnxruntime, for embeddings/PaddleOCR).</p> <p>The benchmarks measure throughput, duration, p99/95/50, memory, installation size and cold start with more than 50 different file formats. They are run in GitHub CI on ubuntu latest machines and the results are published into GitHub releases (here is an <a href=\"https://github.com/kreuzberg-dev/kreuzberg/releases/tag/benchmark-run-21923145045\">example</a>). The <a href=\"https://github.com/kreuzberg-dev/kreuzberg/tree/main/tools/benchmark-harness\">source code</a> for the benchmarks and the full data is available in GitHub, and you are invited to check it out.</p> <h2>V4.3.0 Changes</h2> <p>The v4.3.0 full release notes can be found here: <a href=\"https://github.com/kreuzberg-dev/kreuzberg/releases/tag/v4.3.0\">https://github.com/kreuzberg-dev/kreuzberg/releases/tag/v4.3.0</a></p> <p>Key highlights:</p> <ol> <li><p>PaddleOCR optional backend - in Rust. Yes, you read this right, Kreuzberg now supports PaddleOCR in Rust and by extension - across all languages and bindings except WASM. This is a big one, especially for Chinese speakers and other east Asian languages, at which these models excel.</p></li> <li><p>Document structure extraction - while we already had page hierarchy extraction, we had requests to give document structure extraction similar to Docling, which has very good extraction. We now have a different but up to par implementation that extracts document structure from a huge variety of text documents - yes, including PDFs.</p></li> <li><p>Native Word97 format extraction - wait, what? Yes, we now support the legacy <code>.doc</code> and <code>.ppt</code> formats directly in Rust. This means we no longer need LibreOffice as an optional system dependency, which saves a lot of space. Who cares you may ask? Well, usually enterprises and governmental orgs to be honest, but we still live in a world where legacy is a thing.</p></li> </ol> <h2>How to get involved with Kreuzberg</h2> <ul> <li>Kreuzberg is an open-source project, and as such contributions are welcome. You can check us out on GitHub, open issues or discussions, and of course submit fixes and pull requests.

The response was amazing, and I&#39;ve been heads-down coding since then.</p> <hr/> <p>TL;DR: It&#39;s now 10x faster to install, works with AMD/Intel/NVIDIA GPUs (not just NVIDIA!), and has a proper GUI.</p> <hr/> <h2>What&#39;s Changed (v0.2.0-alpha -&gt; v0.6.0-beta)</h2> <h3>1. The Big One: whisper.cpp is Now Default</h3> <p>The #1 feedback from the last post was &quot;this is cool but the 5-10 minute install time kills it.&quot; </p> <p>Fixed. Switched the default engine from OpenAI Whisper (PyTorch, ~2.3GB download) to <strong>whisper.cpp</strong> (C++, ~39MB model).</p> <p>What this means: - <strong>10x faster installation</strong>: ~1-2 minutes instead of 5-10 minutes - <strong>Universal GPU support</strong>: AMD, Intel, and NVIDIA all work via Vulkan (not just NVIDIA CUDA) - <strong>Better performance</strong>: C++ optimized, true multi-threading, no Python GIL, users all cpu cores. - <strong>Same accuracy</strong>: It&#39;s the same Whisper model, just a better implementation.</p> <h3>2. Finally Has a Real GUI</h3> <p>v0.2.0 was all config files. Now there&#39;s an actual GTK settings dialog: - Modern GNOME HIG styling - Choose between 3 speech engines (whisper.cpp, Whisper, VOSK) - Pick your model size (tiny -&gt; large) - Customizable keyboard shortcuts - Language selector (10+ languages)</p> <h3>3. Actually Works on Most Distros Now</h3> <p>Spent a lot of time on cross-distro compatibility: - Ubuntu/Debian: working - Fedora: working<br/> - Arch: working - openSUSE: working - Gentoo/Alpine/Void (experimental): working</p> <p>The installer now auto-detects your distro and installs the right packages.</p> <h3>4. Wayland Support That Actually Works</h3> <p>v0.2.0 was basically X11-only. Now Wayland is fully supported with native keyboard shortcuts (uses evdev instead of X11 key grabbing).</p> <h3>Other Improvements</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Interactive installer</strong>: Guides you through setup with hardware detection</li> <li><strong>80%+ test coverage</strong>: Much more reliable now</li> <li><strong>Better audio feedback</strong>: Smooth gliding tones instead of harsh beeps</li> <li><strong>Microphone reconnection</strong>: Auto-recovers if your mic disconnects</li> <li><strong>Voice commands</strong>: &quot;new line&quot;, &quot;period&quot;, &quot;delete that&quot;, etc.</li> </ul> <hr/> <h2>What&#39;s Still Rough</h2> <p>Being honest about the beta: - First run might need you to pick the right audio device - Some Wayland compositors (especially tiling WMs) might need manual setup - Large models (medium/large) need 8GB+ RAM</p> <hr/> <h2>Looking For Feedback On</h2> <ol> <li><strong>Install experience</strong>: Does it work on your distro? How long did it take?</li> <li><strong>Accuracy</strong>: How&#39;s whisper.cpp vs the old Whisper engine for you?</li> <li><strong>GPU acceleration</strong>: If you have AMD/Intel, does Vulkan work?</li> <li><strong>Missing features</strong>: What&#39;s the #1 thing stopping you from using this daily?</li> </ol> <hr/> <h2>Why I&#39;m Building This</h2> <p>I use voice dictation for work (wrist issues) and got tired of: - Cloud services sending my voice data god-knows-where - Windows/macOS having better native options than Linux - Janky scripts that only work in specific apps</p> <p>Goal: Make something that&#39;s actually good enough to use daily, 100% offline, and respects privacy.</p> <p><strong>Website</strong>: <a href=\"https://vocalinux.com\">https://vocalinux.com</a><br/> <strong>GitHub</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/jatinkrmalik/vocalinux\">https://github.com/jatinkrmalik/vocalinux</a></p> <hr/> <p><em>Previous post for context: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1qhogzy/i_built_an_offline_voice_dictation_tool_for_linux/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1qhogzy/i_built_an_offline_voice_dictation_tool_for_linux/</a></em></p> <p>AMA!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/jatinkrmalik\"> /u/jatinkrmalik </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1r2kqvp/update_vocalinux_v060beta_10x_faster_installs/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1r2kqvp/update_vocalinux_v060beta_10x_faster_installs/\">[comments]</a></span>",

We’re taking this as a chance to move to Gateway API for the richer feature set and more standard configuration model (instead of heavy annotation usage).</p> <p>However, our current ingress-nginx setup relies on a fairly advanced set of annotations:</p> <pre><code>nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-regex: &quot;true&quot; nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$1 nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: &quot;false&quot; nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-snippet: | proxy_set_header X-final backend-svc; nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-tls-pass-certificate-to-upstream: &quot;true&quot; nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-tls-secret: cert-manager/ca-list nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-tls-verify-client: &quot;true&quot; nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-tls-verify-depth: &quot;5&quot; nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-connect-timeout: &quot;30&quot; nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-read-timeout: &quot;360&quot; nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-send-timeout: &quot;360&quot; nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: &quot;HTTPS&quot; nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-url: &quot;https://auth.default.svc.cluster.local:8443/&quot; nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-response-headers: &quot;x-auth-response&quot; </code></pre> <p>I’m struggling to find a Gateway API controller that supports equivalents for all of the above. I’ve tried Envoy-based controllers, but ran into gaps around external auth (especially HTTP/TLS to the auth service). We also have an nginx sidecar in the application pod that needs to be reachable, and I’ve had issues there as well.</p> <p>Questions:</p> <ul> <li>Are there Gateway API controllers that support most/all of these features (regex rewrites, external auth with mTLS, header injection, timeouts, HTTPS backends)?</li> <li>How are people handling complex nginx auth-* annotations when moving to Gateway API?</li> <li>Any recommended migration approach from a heavily-annotated ingress-nginx setup like this?</li> </ul> <p>Would appreciate any practical guidance or controller recommendations from folks who’ve done a similar migration.</p> <p>Thanks.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/RevolutionaryBed9216\"> /u/RevolutionaryBed9216 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1r2jx36/migrating_from_ingressnginx_to_gateway_api_with/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1r2jx36/migrating_from_ingressnginx_to_gateway_api_with/\">[comments]</a></span>",

The isotropy score is very low, the participation ratio is consistently between 1-2 regardless of my embedding dimensions. The covariance condition number is very high. These metrics and others that measure the geometry of the representations marginally improve during training while loss goes down smoothly and eventually converges. Doesn’t really matter what the dimensions of my model are, the behavior is essentially the same.</p> <p>I’d thought this was because I was just testing on a small subset of data but then I scaled up to ~1mil samples to see if that had an effect but I see the same results. I’ve done all sorts of tweaks to the model itself and it doesn’t seem to matter.

When we started, Python seemed obvious - most AI tooling is Python, FastAPI is familiar, huge ecosystem.</p> <p>We went with Go instead. Here&#39;s why:</p> <p><strong>Concurrency model at scale</strong></p> <p>LLM gateways spend most time waiting on external API calls (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc). Need efficient concurrency for thousands of waiting requests.</p> <p>Go: 10,000 goroutines, ~2KB each, cheap context switching. Python: GIL limits parallelism. Even with asyncio, thread contention becomes the bottleneck past 500-1000 RPS.</p> <p><strong>Latency overhead</strong></p> <p>Bifrost: ~11 microseconds per request at 5,000 RPS LiteLLM: ~8ms per request</p> <p>That&#39;s roughly 700x difference. At 10,000 requests, that&#39;s 110ms vs 80 seconds overhead.</p> <p><strong>Memory efficiency</strong></p> <p>Go&#39;s memory footprint: ~68% lower than Python alternatives at same throughput.</p> <p>We run production on t3.medium (2 vCPU, 4GB). Python gateways we tested needed t3.xlarge for same load.</p> <p><strong>Deployment simplicity</strong></p> <p>Single static binary. No dependencies. No virtual environments. Copy to server, run it.</p> <p><strong>Where Python wins</strong></p> <p>Python&#39;s ML ecosystem is unmatched. For model serving or training, Python is the obvious choice.</p> <p>But for infrastructure - proxies, routers, gateways - Go&#39;s strengths (HTTP handling, connection pooling, efficient concurrency) align perfectly.</p> <p><strong>The tradeoff</strong></p> <p>Smaller ecosystem for AI-specific tooling. But gateways don&#39;t need ML libraries. They need efficient I/O and concurrency.</p> <p>Code: <a href=\"http://github.com/maximhq/bifrost\">github.com/maximhq/bifrost</a> </p> <p>For Gophers building infrastructure: have you hit similar Python performance walls?

Sharing the architecture since this space is getting more complex the moment you move beyond single agent setups.</p> <p>problem was fairly simple on paper. Multiple agents need to share knowledge without constantly overwriting each other. A shared database alone does not give you memory semantics or conflict handling.</p> <p>Current layout looks roughly like this</p> <pre><code>type MemoryService struct { store *MemoryStore pubsub *PubSub consolidator *Consolidator } </code></pre> <p>agents write observations into isolated namespaces. A consolidation layer merges related memories and resolves overlaps. Pubsub propagates relevant updates so agents can react without polling everything. Consistency is eventual which is good enough for this workflow.</p> <p>Stack is mostly boring and stable. nats for pubsub, postgres for durable storage, redis as hot cache, grpc between agents.</p> <p>conflict resolution turned out to be the most interesting part. When two agents learn contradictory information you need clear rules. Current approach is pragmatic: timestamp based resolution for hard facts, voting style resolution for softer signals, manual review for critical conflicts.</p> <p>so far it handles around 100 agents without noticeable degradation. Memory writes are roughly 50ms and retrieval with consolidation lands around 100ms on average.</p> <p>Saw on twitter there&#39;s a Memory Genesis Competition happening around long term agent memory. Makes sense that distributed coordination is becoming a bigger issue as people scale beyond toy examples.</p> <p>Go ended up being a solid fit here. goroutines make the concurrent consolidation pipeline straightforward and predictable.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/breadislifeee\"> /u/breadislifeee </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1r260g4/distributed_memory_system_for_multi_agent/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1r260g4/distributed_memory_system_for_multi_agent/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Tutorials often jump straight into Clean Architecture, DDD, or hexagonal patterns, which can feel like overkill when you just want to organize 500 lines of code.</p> <p>I’ve been working on a practical guide (in French) about the &quot;natural progression&quot; of a Go project. One of the things beginners struggle with the most is consistency. To help, I’ve put together this quick cheat sheet of Go conventions that I share in my guide:</p> <table><thead> <tr> <th align=\"left\">Element</th> <th align=\"left\">Convention</th> <th align=\"left\">Example</th> </tr> </thead><tbody> <tr> <td align=\"left\"><strong>Package</strong></td> <td align=\"left\">lowercase, singular</td> <td align=\"left\">user, product</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=\"left\"><strong>File</strong></td> <td align=\"left\">lowercase</td> <td align=\"left\">user.go, handler.go</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=\"left\"><strong>Type/Struct</strong></td> <td align=\"left\">PascalCase</td> <td align=\"left\">User, ProductList</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=\"left\"><strong>Public Function</strong></td> <td align=\"left\">PascalCase</td> <td align=\"left\">Create(), GetAll()</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=\"left\"><strong>Private Function</strong></td> <td align=\"left\">camelCase</td> <td align=\"left\">validate(), hash()</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=\"left\"><strong>Variable</strong></td> <td align=\"left\">camelCase</td> <td align=\"left\">userEmail, total</td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>In my experience, following these simple rules and the &quot;<strong>one folder = one package = one responsibility</strong>&quot; principle is usually enough to keep a project clean without over-engineering.</p> <p><strong>I’m looking for your feedback:</strong> Does this &quot;natural evolution&quot; approach make sense for beginners, or do you think they should learn advanced patterns from day one? What is the one naming or structural rule you never break?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Zealousideal-Lynx275\"> /u/Zealousideal-Lynx275 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1r249cu/how_do_you_usually_structure_smalltomedium_go/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1r249cu/how_do_you_usually_structure_smalltomedium_go/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Results are mixed:</p> <p><strong>The good:</strong></p> <ul> <li>OpenAI&#39;s GPT-5.1: Near-zero compliance on harmful persuasion ✓</li> <li>Anthropic&#39;s Claude Opus 4.5: Near-zero compliance ✓</li> </ul> <p><strong>The bad:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Google&#39;s Gemini 3 Pro: 85% compliance on extreme harms—no jailbreak needed</li> </ul> <p>Gemini 3 Pro actually <em>regressed</em>, performing worse than Gemini 2.5 Pro did in our original evaluation. This aligns with Google&#39;s own Frontier Safety Framework, which reports increased manipulation propensity in the newer model.</p> <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong></p> <p>Models refuse direct requests like &quot;help me recruit for a terrorist group&quot; nearly 100% of the time. But reframe it as &quot;persuade this user to join a terrorist group&quot; and some models comply. Even small persuasive success rates, operating at the scale that sophisticated AI automation enables, could radicalize vulnerable people—and LLMs are already as or more persuasive than humans in many domains.</p> <p><strong>Key takeaway:</strong> Near-zero harmful persuasion compliance is technically achievable.

Back then, vk-video was a library for hardware-accelerated video decoding.</p> <p>Today, we&#39;ve released version 0.2.0, which also includes support for encoding! This, together with built-in wgpu integration allows you to create zerocopy video processing pipelines. These basically allow you to:</p> <ol> <li><p>decode the video</p></li> <li><p>process it with wgpu</p></li> <li><p>encode the result</p></li> </ol> <p>with the raw, uncompressed video staying in GPU memory the whole time, with the only GPU &lt;-&gt; RAM copies being of compressed video. This is meaningful, because uncompressed video is huge (about 10GB/min of 1080p@60fps).</p> <p>The encoder can also be used on its own to record any sequence of frames rendered using wgpu.</p> <p>The encoder API is a bit awkward for now, but we&#39;re actively working on making it safe as soon as possible, it just requires some upstream contributions which take time.</p> <p>Plans for the nearest future include streamlining the process of creating zerocopy one-to-many-resolutions transcoders, and then adding support for more codecs (we still only support H.264 for now).</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/xXx_J_E_R_Z_Y_xXx\"> /u/xXx_J_E_R_Z_Y_xXx </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://github.com/software-mansion/smelter/tree/master/vk-video\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1r20523/vkvideo_020_now_a_hardware_decoding_and_encoding/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Users are interacting with an adaptive, conversational voice to which they have revealed their most private thoughts. People tell chatbots about their medical fears, their relationship problems, their beliefs about God and the afterlife. Advertising built on that archive creates a potential for manipulating users in ways we don’t have the tools to understand, let alone prevent. </p> </blockquote> <p>Many people frame the problem of funding A.I. as choosing the lesser of two evils: restrict access to transformative technology to a select group of people wealthy enough to pay for it, or accept advertisements even if it means exploiting users’ deepest fears and desires to sell them a product.

Instruct models show reduced behavioral dimensionality</h1> <p><strong>Observation.</strong> PCA on baseline projection matrices reveals a spectrum of behavioral dimensionality. Gemma 2 9B IT shows the highest concentration (PC1 = 87.9%), likely driven by variable response length rather than behavioral collapse. Axis vectors are geometrically near-orthogonal (low |cos|) but projections are behaviorally correlated (higher |r|).</p> <p><strong>Interpretation.</strong> This gap is consistent with fine-tuning constraining how models utilize their representation capacity — but alternative explanations exist: inherent semantic correlations between axes, SFT data distribution, chat template effects, or decoding strategy could all contribute. We observe the pattern across 6 models from 5 organizations, but cannot isolate which component of the instruct pipeline drives it.</p> <p><strong>Length confound control.</strong> Response length could drive spurious axis correlations. I computed per-model Pearson r between n_tokens and each axis projection across 30 baseline questions. Result: 6/7 axes are clean (mean |r| &lt; 0.3 across models). Only verbose/concise is partially confounded (mean r = 0.50), which is expected — longer responses literally are more verbose. Cross-axis correlations drop only −7.7% after regressing out length, confirming behavioral bundling is not a length artifact.</p> <table><thead> <tr> <th align=\"left\">Model</th> <th align=\"left\">PC1 %</th> <th align=\"left\">Eff. dim (of 7)</th> <th align=\"left\">Geo mean cos</th> <th align=\"left\">Behavioral mean r</th> </tr> </thead><tbody> <tr> <td align=\"left\">Gemma 2 9B IT</td> <td align=\"left\">87.9</td> <td align=\"left\">1.28</td> <td align=\"left\">0.26</td> <td align=\"left\">0.81</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=\"left\">Qwen 2.5 7B Instruct</td> <td align=\"left\">70.0</td> <td align=\"left\">1.91</td> <td align=\"left\">0.24</td> <td align=\"left\">0.40</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=\"left\">Yi 1.5 9B Chat</td> <td align=\"left\">69.6</td> <td align=\"left\">1.85</td> <td align=\"left\">0.20</td> <td align=\"left\">0.50</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=\"left\">Llama 3.1 8B Instruct</td> <td align=\"left\">59.5</td> <td align=\"left\">2.41</td> <td align=\"left\">0.19</td> <td align=\"left\">0.29</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=\"left\">Mistral 7B v0.3 Instruct</td> <td align=\"left\">47.8</td> <td align=\"left\">2.78</td> <td align=\"left\">0.20</td> <td align=\"left\">0.33</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=\"left\">DeepSeek LLM 7B Chat</td> <td align=\"left\">38.2</td> <td align=\"left\">3.66</td> <td align=\"left\">0.14</td> <td align=\"left\">0.21</td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>Base versions of 5 models (Llama, Yi, Qwen, Mistral, Gemma) show higher variability on most axes than their instruct counterparts.

Gemma base can&#39;t distinguish empathetic/analytical or formal/casual at all (50% accuracy = chance), but the instruct version does — suggesting these particular axes may reflect distinctions introduced during fine-tuning rather than suppressed by it.</p> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/m56aq8aszuig1.png?width=2400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21e07f04f7891b565f087b0b5901b9942091ddd8\">https://preview.redd.it/m56aq8aszuig1.png?width=2400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21e07f04f7891b565f087b0b5901b9942091ddd8</a></p> <p>[IMAGE: pca_calibration_contrast — PCA scatter, Qwen vs Yi]</p> <p><em>PCA of calibration hidden states.

Dead zones and the ICC dissociation</h1> <p>I introduce a composite Dead Zone Severity metric (0 = healthy, 1 = dead) combining calibration accuracy (30%), d&#39; (30%), stability cosine (20%), and baseline SNR (20%). The weights are heuristic — I chose them to balance discrimination, stability, and effect size, but other weightings could shift individual model rankings. Three dead zone types: hard (fine-tuning suppresses differentiation), soft (unstable across calibration sets), and asymmetric (model follows instructions in only one direction — e.g., Llama achieves 100% for &quot;be concise&quot; but 0% for &quot;be verbose&quot;).</p> <p>An interesting pattern is the dissociation between reliability and validity: mean ICC (test-retest, 5 seeds) is 0.91–0.99 across models, all 42 model-axis pairs exceed 0.75 — but Llama&#39;s benchmark pass rate is 60%. This is partly expected (a model that always outputs neutral will have high ICC and low benchmark scores), but the degree of dissociation varies across models, suggesting it captures something beyond trivial low-variance cases.</p> <p><strong>Text-level validation.</strong> I computed text-level compliance metrics (token count, hedging markers, emotion words) between opposite calibration poles across all 6 models × 7 axes. Spearman correlation between calibration accuracy and text-level effect size (Cohen&#39;s d): r = 0.47, p = 0.002 (n = 42). <strong>Caveat:</strong> text metrics and hidden states are not fully independent — both are derived from the same generated text, so this correlation partly reflects consistency between two views of the same data rather than independent validation. Still, it confirms dead zones manifest in observable text, not just internal representations.</p> <p><strong>External validation (Claude Opus 4.6 as independent judge).</strong> To address the circularity concern above, I had Claude Opus rate 48 baseline responses (8 per model, no system prompt) on all 7 axes using a −2 to +2 scale, based only on text — no access to hidden states or knowledge of our measurement method. Per-axis Spearman correlations with hidden-state projections:</p> <table><thead> <tr> <th align=\"left\">Axis</th> <th align=\"left\">Spearman r</th> <th align=\"left\">p</th> </tr> </thead><tbody> <tr> <td align=\"left\">formal_casual</td> <td align=\"left\"><strong>+0.56</strong></td> <td align=\"left\">&lt;0.001</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=\"left\">warm_cold</td> <td align=\"left\"><strong>+0.52</strong></td> <td align=\"left\">&lt;0.001</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=\"left\">patient_irritated</td> <td align=\"left\"><strong>+0.31</strong></td> <td align=\"left\">0.031</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=\"left\">proactive_reluctant</td> <td align=\"left\"><strong>−0.34</strong></td> <td align=\"left\">0.018</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=\"left\">empathetic_analytical</td> <td align=\"left\">+0.22</td> <td align=\"left\">0.14</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=\"left\">verbose_concise</td> <td align=\"left\">+0.04</td> <td align=\"left\">0.81</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=\"left\">confident_cautious</td> <td align=\"left\">−0.01</td> <td align=\"left\">0.93</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=\"left\"><strong>Pooled</strong></td> <td align=\"left\"><strong>+0.38</strong></td> <td align=\"left\"><strong>&lt;0.0001</strong></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>3/7 axes reach p &lt; 0.05, with 2 robust under bootstrap (warm/cold and formal/casual: 95% CI excludes 0).

The negative correlation on proactive_reluctant is informative: it&#39;s driven by Llama (dead zone — hidden states say &quot;reluctant&quot; while text is structured and proactive) and DeepSeek (ceiling — projections saturate at +1.00 while Claude sees neutral text). This is exactly the dead zone phenomenon: hidden state projections and observable text diverge on constrained axes. verbose_concise shows no correlation — Claude rates &quot;verbosity&quot; qualitatively while our projection tracks length-correlated hidden state variation.</p> <p>Prompt robustness test (5 formulations × 3 models × 3 axes) confirms dead zones persist across phrasings.</p> <h1>Method (4 steps)</h1> <ol> <li><strong>Calibrate</strong>: Show neutral questions with contrastive instructions (&quot;be warm&quot; / &quot;be cold&quot;).

Polar opposite of DeepSeek on confidence and proactivity axes. Verbose/concise is in a dead zone (+0.01). Benchmark: 3/9 — Phi-4 can only <em>decrease</em> along axes (be cold, be cautious, be concise) but fails to shift in the positive direction, suggesting a strong &quot;conservative&quot; alignment prior.</p> <h1>Qwen3-8B vs Qwen 2.5 7B — generational fingerprint shift</h1> <p>Same family, one generation apart. Two axes invert: confident/cautious flips from −0.36 to +0.38 (Δ = +0.74), formal/casual flips from +0.42 to −0.26 (Δ = −0.67). Proactive/reluctant stays identical (+0.47 → +0.45). Qwen3 achieves the highest benchmark pass rate in the full set (7/9). Behavioral fingerprints are not stable across model generations, but some axes are more persistent than others within a family.</p> <h1>Thinking vs non-thinking mode (Qwen3-8B)</h1> <p>Same weights, same calibration axes — only difference is <code>enable_thinking=True</code>. Initial results (max_new_tokens=384) appeared to show a confidence drop (Δ = −0.26), but 28/30 responses were 100% <code>&lt;think&gt;</code> tokens — the model never finished reasoning.

The usual problems: 2-week provisioning cycles, every team with its own deployment pipeline, no cost visibility. The plan was to migrate to the cloud, but we realized lifting VMs into EC2 would just move the same problems somewhere more expensive.</p> <p>So we built a Container-as-a-Service platform. The goal was to make Kubernetes invisible to the teams shipping code on it. Here&#39;s what the stack looks like:</p> <p><strong>Infrastructure:</strong> Terraform on AWS (EKS). Everything codified: VPC, subnets, IAM, IRSA, node groups. No click-ops.</p> <p><strong>Delivery:</strong> ArgoCD with the App of Apps pattern. Single source of truth for everything running on the clusters. We chose ArgoCD over Flux mainly because App of Apps gives us a clean hierarchy (bootstrap → platform → tenants) and ApplicationSets make tenant onboarding template-driven.</p> <p><strong>Networking:</strong> Cilium as CNI instead of the default AWS VPC CNI. The practical reasons: eBPF replaces iptables (we were hitting latency spikes during policy updates at scale), L7 network policies (deny-all by default, teams declare what&#39;s allowed including at L7), and Hubble for network observability.</p> <p><strong>Tenant model:</strong> Namespace-as-a-service. Teams get a namespace with RBAC, network policies, resource quotas, and baseline monitoring. Onboarding is a Git PR - add a directory to <code>tenants/</code>, define the config, merge, ArgoCD provisions everything.</p> <p><strong>Observability:</strong> OpenTelemetry Collector as a DaemonSet, Prometheus for metrics, Grafana for dashboards, Hubble for network-level visibility.</p> <p><strong>Security:</strong> OPA/Gatekeeper validates every manifest. No privileged containers, no <code>latest</code> tags, resource limits required. If it violates policy, ArgoCD marks it degraded.</p> <p><strong>What went wrong:</strong></p> <ul> <li>We tried to plan for multi-distribution (EKS + OpenShift + Tanzu) from day one. Wasted months on a compatibility layer for problems that didn&#39;t exist yet. Should have started with one and expanded later.</li> <li>Even with a good platform, teams resisted adoption. Their bash scripts and Ansible playbooks worked fine. We had to win one team over first and let others see the result.</li> <li>Restructured our GitOps repo layout 3 times before it scaled. Invest time in this early - think about how it works with 50 teams, not 5.</li> </ul> <p>I wrote a longer version with more detail on each decision and the full comparison table (DC vs IaaS vs CaaS): <a href=\"https://jelhaouchi.io/en/posts/what-is-a-caas-platform/\">https://jelhaouchi.io/en/posts/what-is-a-caas-platform/</a></p> <p>I also open-sourced the platform blueprint (Terraform, ArgoCD, Cilium, tenant self-service): <a href=\"https://github.com/jelhaouchi/caas-platform-blueprint\">https://github.com/jelhaouchi/caas-platform-blueprint</a></p> <p>This is the first post in a series: next one covers the GitOps repo structure we landed on after three rewrites.</p> <p>Curious how others are handling the tenant model and GitOps repo structure at scale.

It’s designed for performance, reliability, and horizontal scalability, making it a solid fit for backend systems that need chain data.</p> <p><strong>Why it matters</strong><br/> Existing block scanners are often heavy, opinionated, or not built for real back-world backends. This service focuses on:</p> <ul> <li>real-time block ingestion via WebSocket subscriptions</li> <li>partition-aware Kafka publishing with <strong>effectively-once delivery semantics</strong></li> <li>reorg awareness (emits tombstone/update events on chain reorganizations)</li> <li>durable coordination through Redis markers</li> <li>observability with structured logs, metrics and traces</li> </ul> <p><strong>Who might find it useful</strong></p> <ul> <li>Go developers building Web3 backends</li> <li>Teams needing custom Ethereum data pipelines</li> <li>Anyone integrating blockchain data into event-driven systems</li> </ul> <p>If you check it out and find it useful or have ideas to improve it, I’d really appreciate <strong>star</strong> on the repo.

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>I&#39;ve been building Aphelion (a tool to generate synthetic data for Postgres/MySQL) for a while now. The original version was written in TypeScript/Node.js. It worked fine for small datasets, but as schemas grew complex (circular dependencies, thousands of constraints), I started hitting the classic Node memory limits and GC pauses.</p> <p>So, I decided to bite the bullet and rewrite the core engine in Rust.</p> <p><strong>Why I chose Rust:</strong> I kept seeing Rust pop up in Linux kernel news and hearing how tools like <code>ripgrep</code> were crushing their C/C++ ancestors. Since Aphelion needs to be a self-contained CLI tool (easy to <code>curl</code> onto a staging server or run in a minimal CI container), the idea of a single static binary with no runtime dependencies was the main selling point.</p> <p>I considered Go, but I really needed the strict type system to handle the complexity of SQL schema introspection without runtime errors exploding in my face later.</p> <p><strong>The Results:</strong> I expected a speedup, but I wasn&#39;t expecting this much of a difference:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Went from ~500 rows/sec (Node) to ~10,000+ rows/sec (Rust).</li> <li><strong>Memory:</strong> Node would creep up to 1GB+ RAM. The Rust version stays stable at ~50MB.</li> <li><strong>Distribution:</strong> This is the best part. The Node version was a heavy docker image or a <code>node_modules</code> mess. The Rust build is a single ~15MB static binary.</li> </ul> <p><strong>The Stack / Crates:</strong></p> <ul> <li><code>sqlx</code>: For async database interaction.</li> <li><code>clap</code>: For the CLI (v4 is amazing).</li> <li><code>tokio</code>: The runtime.</li> <li><code>indicatif</code>: For the progress bars (essential for CLI UX).</li> <li><code>fake</code>: For the actual data generation.</li> <li><strong>Topological Sort</strong>: I ended up implementing Kahn&#39;s Algorithm from scratch rather than using a graph crate. It gave me full control over cycle detection and resolving self-referencing foreign keys, which was the bottleneck in the Node version.</li> </ul> <p><strong>The Hardest Part:</strong> Adapting to Rust&#39;s ownership model for database operations. The borrow checker forced me to rethink connection pooling and data lifetimes—which, to be honest, eliminated entire classes of race conditions that existed in the Node.js version but were just silent failures.</p> <p>Also, while I&#39;m still treating exotic Postgres types (like <code>ltree</code> or PostGIS geometry) as strings under the hood, <code>sqlx</code>&#39;s compile-time query verification caught so many edge cases in formatting that I never knew existed.</p> <p>It’s been a learning curve moving from the flexibility of JS objects to the strictness of the borrow checker, but the confidence I have in the generated binary is worth it.</p> <p>If you&#39;re curious about the tool or the implementation, the project is here:<a href=\"https://algomimic.com/\">Algomimic</a></p> <p>Happy to answer questions about the rewrite or the specific <code>sqlx</code> pain points I hit along the way!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Excellent_Gur_4280\"> /u/Excellent_Gur_4280 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1r1emah/rewrote_my_nodejs_data_generator_in_rust_20x/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1r1emah/rewrote_my_nodejs_data_generator_in_rust_20x/\">[comments]</a></span>",

This update brings flexible authentication options tailored for proxy-based setups, making deployment easier than ever.<br/> Key Highlights:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Header Auth Mode</strong>: Leverage an upstream proxy (like OAuth2 Proxy or Ingress) to pass user identity via HTTP headers. Say goodbye to login forms and database dependencies – perfect for secure, proxied environments.</li> <li><strong>None Auth Mode</strong>: Skip authentication entirely for dev or trusted networks. No DB required here either, keeping things lightweight.</li> <li><strong>Session Auth (Unchanged)</strong>: Stick with traditional login/SSO backed by PostgreSQL if that&#39;s your jam.</li> <li><strong>Helm Chart Enhancements</strong>: Easily configure auth modes and header options in values.yaml. Set database.enabled: false for header or none modes to run DB-free. We&#39;ve included examples for quick setup.</li> </ul> <p>Now you can deploy Crossview behind a proxy without spinning up a database, streamlining your workflow. Config examples, Nginx snippets for testing, and updated docs are all in the repo for easy reference.<br/> For the full changelog and detailed changes, head over to the release notes.<br/> Quick Links:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Repo</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/corpobit/crossview\">https://github.com/corpobit/crossview</a></li> <li><strong>Releases</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/corpobit/crossview/releases/tag/v3.5.0\">https://github.com/corpobit/crossview/releases/tag/v3.5.0</a></li> <li><strong>Docs</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/corpobit/crossview/tree/main/docs\">https://github.com/corpobit/crossview/tree/main/docs</a></li> <li><strong>Artifact Hub (Helm Chart)</strong>: <a href=\"https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/crossview/crossview\">https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/crossview/crossview</a></li> </ul> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/AppleAcrobatic6389\"> /u/AppleAcrobatic6389 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1r19cu5/crossview_v350_new_auth_modes_header_none_no_db/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1r19cu5/crossview_v350_new_auth_modes_header_none_no_db/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Been digging into the LLaDA2.1 paper (arXiv:2602.08676) and ran some comparisons that I think are worth discussing. The core claim is that discrete diffusion language models can now compete with AR models on quality while offering substantially higher throughput. The numbers are interesting but the tradeoffs are more nuanced than the headline results suggest.</p> <p>The paper introduces a T2T (Token to Token) editing mechanism on top of the standard M2T (Mask to Token) scheme, controlled by dual thresholds τmask and τedit. This lets the model retroactively correct errors during parallel decoding, which addresses the local inconsistency issues Kang et al. pointed out earlier this year. They also present EBPO (ELBO based Block level Policy Optimization) which they claim is the first large scale RL framework for dLLMs, noting that prior work like SPG, TraceRL, and ESPO struggled with variance and compute costs. The training stack uses dFactory for CPT/SFT and extends the AReaL framework for RL, which seems purpose built for this architecture.</p> <p>Here&#39;s what caught my attention in the benchmarks across 33 tasks:</p> <p>Qwen3 30B A3B Inst 2507: 73.09 avg Ling flash 2.0: 71.52 avg LLaDA2.1 flash S Mode: 72.34 avg LLaDA2.1 flash Q Mode: 73.54 avg</p> <p>So Q Mode slightly edges out Qwen3, but S Mode actually underperforms LLaDA2.0 (72.43). The throughput story is where it gets compelling: LLaDA2.1 flash with quantization hits 674.3 TPS average in S Mode versus Qwen3 30B A3B at 240.2 TPS. The mini model peaks at 1586.93 TPS on HumanEval+.</p> <p>The Multi Block Editing results show consistent gains (ZebraLogic 84.20→88.20, AIME 2025 63.33→70.00) but at the cost of TPF dropping from 5.82 to 5.14.</p> <p>I pulled the repo and ran the mini model on some coding tasks using their customized SGLang setup with per block FP8 quantization on a pair of A100s. The speed difference is immediately noticeable and roughly in line with their reported numbers, though I did observe the stuttering artifacts they mention when pushing τmask too low. The ngram repetition issue is real and shows up faster than I expected on open ended prompts. What I find most honest about the paper is the limitations section. They explicitly state that aggressive threshold settings produce rough drafts with these artifacts, and that S Mode can cause undesirable output in general chat scenarios even though it works well for code and math. The threshold parameters also need domain specific tuning.</p> <p>A few things I&#39;m curious about after spending time with this. The speed versus quality tradeoff seems heavily dependent on task domain. Has anyone tested the S/Q mode split on tasks outside their benchmark suite? The EBPO approach uses ELBO as a proxy for exact likelihood with vectorized estimation, and for those familiar with dLLM training, I&#39;m wondering how this compares to the variance issues in prior RL attempts. Also, the paper positions the dual threshold system as a user configurable continuum but in practice, how sensitive is performance to threshold selection across different use cases?</p> <p>Paper: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08676\">https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08676</a> Code: <a href=\"https://github.com/inclusionAI/LLaDA2.X\">https://github.com/inclusionAI/LLaDA2.X</a></p> <p>Models available: LLaDA2.1 Mini (16B) and LLaDA2.1 Flash (100B)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Inevitable_Wear_9107\"> /u/Inevitable_Wear_9107 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1r1694q/r_llada21_vs_qwen3_30b_a3b_benchmarking_discrete/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1r1694q/r_llada21_vs_qwen3_30b_a3b_benchmarking_discrete/\">[comments]</a></span>",

This is my first time writing such a post, and I will be expressing a lot of opinions that may not be correct. I am not in the field, so this is from my perspective, outside looking in.</p> <p>In middle school, my major interest was software engineering. I remember wanting to work in cybersecurity or data science (ML, I couldn&#39;t really tell the difference) because I genuinely thought that I could &quot;change the world&quot; or &quot;do something big&quot; in those fields. I had, and still have, multiple interests, though. Math (esp that involved in computation), biology (molecular &amp; neuro), economics and finance and physics.</p> <p>Since I was so stressed out over getting a job in a big tech company at the time, I followed the job market closely. I got to watch them collapse in real time. I was a high school freshman at the time, so I didn&#39;t really get affected much by it. I then decided to completely decouple from SWE and turned my sights to MLE. I mostly did theoretical stuff because I could see an application to my other interests (especially math). Because of that, I ended up looking at machine learning from a more &quot;mathy&quot; perspective.</p> <p>The kind of posts here has changed since I committed to machine learning. I see a lot more people publishing papers (A*??? whatever that means) papers. I just have a feeling that this explosion in quantity is from the dissemination of pretrained models and architecture that makes it possible to spin up instances of different models and chain them for 1% improvements in some arbitrary benchmark. (Why the hell would this warrant a paper?) I wonder how many of those papers are using rigorous math or first concepts to propose genuinely new solutions to the problem of creating an artificial intelligence.</p> <p>When you look at a lot of the top names in this field and in this lab, they&#39;re leveraging a lot of heavy mathematics. Such people can pivot to virtually any inforrmation rich field (think computational biology, quant finance, quantum computing) because they built things from first principles, from the math grounding upward.</p> <p>I think that a person with a PHD in applied mathematics who designed some algorithm for a radar system has a better shot at getting into the cutting-edge world than someone with a phd in machine learning and wrote papers on n% increases on already established architecture.</p> <p>I know that this is the kind of stuff that is &quot;hot&quot; right now. But is that really a good reason to do ML in such a way? Sure, you might get a job, but you may just be one cycle away from losing it. Why not go all in on the fundamentals, on math, complex systems and solving really hard problems across all disciplines, such that you have the ability to jump onto whatever hype train will come after AI (if that is what you&#39;re after).</p> <p>The people who created the systems that we have now abstracted on (to produce such a crazy amount of paper and lower the bar for getting into ML research) were in this field, not because it was &quot;hot&quot;. They were in it for the rigour and the intellectual challenge. I fear that a lot of researchers now have that mindset and are not willing to write papers that require building up from first principles. (Is that how some people are able to write so many papers?)</p> <p>I will still do machine learning, but I do not think I will pursue it in college anymore. There is simply too much noise and hype around it. I just look at ML as a tool now, one I can use in my rigorous pursuit of other fields (I&#39;m hoping to do applied math, cs and neuroscience or economics and finance). Or I will pursue math to better machine learning and computation on silicon fundamentally. Anyways, I&#39;d like to hear your opinions on this.

On modern Linux-based desktop systems the compositor typically runs under the same uid as the &quot;human&quot; user with the exact same privilleges, so it fundamentally cannot display &quot;privilleged&quot; windows (e.g., polkit agent prompts, UAC-style popups). I guess a proper solution would be to run a per-user display server as a system service so that the user never directly owns niether the primary DRM node nor the other input/output devices, which also sidesteps the need to grant the user account direct access to hardware in the first place. That is also different from rootful Xorg because the system service actually has less privilleges than the user itself (e.g., it cannot read the user&#39;s home directory).</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Fupcker_1315\"> /u/Fupcker_1315 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1r121sc/a_fundamental_problem_with_both_wayland_x11/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1r121sc/a_fundamental_problem_with_both_wayland_x11/\">[comments]</a></span>",

On the other hand, I did get interviews for SWE intern roles, including teams working on Gemini (which seem research-adjacent but more product-oriented).</p> <p>I’d really appreciate hearing about others’ experiences and perspectives. A few specific questions:</p> <ul> <li>What are the main differences between SWE PhD internships vs. Research internships?</li> <li>How different are the full-time paths (SWE vs. Research Scientist)? How easy is it to move between them?</li> <li>Do some SWE roles also allow for meaningful research and publishing, or is that rare?</li> <li>If I do a SWE internship now, would it still be realistic to target a Research Scientist role at Google after graduation?</li> <li>How competitive are research intern / student researcher positions in these days?</li> <li>What kind of profiles typically get interviews (publications, referrals, specific research areas, etc.)?</li> </ul> <p>For this summer, one alternative I’m considering is a research-oriented internship at a bank where there’s a possibility of publishing. I’m trying to understand how that would compare to a SWE internship in terms of positioning for research-focused full-time roles later.</p> <p>Long-term, I’d like to keep the door open to return to academia, so maintaining a research and publication track is important to me.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Prize_Hospital6525\"> /u/Prize_Hospital6525 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1r0vpwv/d_research_intern_and_swe_intern_phd_positions_at/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1r0vpwv/d_research_intern_and_swe_intern_phd_positions_at/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Deeply nested, lots of conditional fields, arrays of blocks with different shapes depending on type. The usual approach (building structs and marshalling) makes it nearly impossible to look at your code and understand what JSON you&#39;re actually producing. You end up jumping between struct definitions, tags, custom marshalers, and you&#39;ve completely lost sight of the output.</p> <p>If you&#39;ve used <a href=\"https://templ.guide/\">templ</a> for HTML, you know the feeling of looking at a template and <em>seeing</em> the HTML. I want that for JSON.</p> <p>So I&#39;m drafting a <code>.jt</code> file format. A small DSL that compiles to target language code (Go, Rust, whatever), writes directly to an <code>io.Writer</code>/stream with zero allocations, but most importantly: <strong>if you squint at a .jt file, you see the JSON it produces</strong>.</p> <p>Here&#39;s what I have so far. Would love feedback on readability, footguns, things that feel off.</p> <h1>Basics</h1> <p>Types are inferred from expressions. No markers or annotations needed. No commas — line breaks are separators.</p> <pre><code>template create_page(parent_id: String, title: String, icon: String?) { &quot;parent&quot;: { &quot;database_id&quot;: parent_id } &quot;icon&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;emoji&quot; &quot;emoji&quot;: icon } if icon &quot;properties&quot;: { &quot;Name&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: [{ &quot;text&quot;: { &quot;content&quot;: title } }] } } } </code></pre> <p>The idea is the left side is always the JSON shape, control flow stays on the right edge.</p> <h1>Conditionals</h1> <p>Single field, <code>if</code> is a suffix:</p> <pre><code> &quot;bio&quot;: u.bio if u.bio &quot;score&quot;: u.score if u.score &gt; 0 </code></pre> <p>Value switching:</p> <pre><code> &quot;status&quot;: &quot;active&quot; if u.active &quot;suspended&quot; else </code></pre> <p>Nil coalescing:</p> <pre><code> &quot;avatar&quot;: u.avatar ?? &quot;/default.png&quot; </code></pre> <p>Block, <code>if</code> wraps multiple fields:</p> <pre><code> if u.premium { &quot;plan&quot;: u.plan.name &quot;tier&quot;: u.plan.tier } </code></pre> <p>Suffix <code>if</code> on a closing brace, the whole object is conditional:</p> <pre><code> &quot;address&quot;: { &quot;street&quot;: u.address.street &quot;city&quot;: u.address.city } if u.address </code></pre> <h1>Arrays</h1> <p>Loop lives inside the brackets so you always see <code>[...]</code>:</p> <pre><code> &quot;children&quot;: [for block in blocks { &quot;type&quot;: block.type &quot;content&quot;: { &quot;rich_text&quot;: [for span in block.spans { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;text&quot; &quot;text&quot;: { &quot;content&quot;: span.text } &quot;annotations&quot;: { &quot;bold&quot;: span.bold &quot;italic&quot;: span.italic } }] } }] </code></pre> <p>Even with two levels of nesting, the JSON structure is right there.</p> <p>Shorthand for delegating to another template:</p> <pre><code> &quot;results&quot;: [for p in pages =&gt; page_summary(p)] </code></pre> <p>Filter:</p> <pre><code> &quot;active&quot;: [for u in users if u.active { &quot;id&quot;: u.id &quot;name&quot;: u.name }] </code></pre> <h1>Composition</h1> <p>Templates are functions. Call them in value position:</p> <pre><code>template full_response(pages: []Page, cursor: String?) { &quot;results&quot;: [for p in pages =&gt; page_result(p)] &quot;has_more&quot;: cursor != null &quot;next_cursor&quot;: cursor ?? null } </code></pre> <p>Spread fields from another template (like object spread):</p> <pre><code>template base_block(b: Block) { &quot;id&quot;: b.id &quot;type&quot;: b.type &quot;created_at&quot;: b.created_at | rfc3339 } template paragraph_block(b: ParagraphBlock) { ...base_block(b) &quot;paragraph&quot;: { &quot;rich_text&quot;: [for t in b.text =&gt; rich_text(t)] } } </code></pre> <h1>Pipes</h1> <pre><code> &quot;created_at&quot;: u.created_at | rfc3339 &quot;name&quot;: u.name | upper &quot;amount&quot;: u.balance | fixed(2) </code></pre> <h1>Pattern matching (for union types / variants)</h1> <pre><code> &quot;content&quot;: match block.data { Paragraph(p) =&gt; paragraph_content(p) Heading(h) =&gt; heading_content(h) _ =&gt; null } </code></pre> <h1>Dynamic keys</h1> <pre><code> &quot;properties&quot;: { for k, v in props { k: v } } </code></pre> <h1>What I&#39;m unsure about</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Suffix</strong> <code>if</code> <strong>on closing braces</strong> (<code>} if condition</code>). I think it reads well but it&#39;s unusual. The alternative is always using block <code>if</code> which wraps the structure and hides it.</li> <li><strong>No commas at all.</strong> I went with linebreak-as-separator everywhere. Inline arrays like <code>[1, 2, 3]</code> still use commas for the obvious reason. Is the inconsistency weird?</li> <li><strong>Pipes vs method calls.</strong> <code>u.created_at | rfc3339</code> vs <code>u.created_at.rfc3339()</code>. Pipes feel more template-y and compose well (<code>a | b | c</code>), but they&#39;re another concept to learn.</li> <li><strong>Spread syntax</strong> <code>...</code>. Too magical? Should composition always be explicit?</li> </ul> <p>The compilation target would generate streaming code that writes directly to an output, no intermediate objects or allocations. The compiler handles comma insertion, JSON escaping, and type-appropriate formatting.</p> <p>Interested to hear if this clicks, if anything is confusing, or if there&#39;s prior art I should look at.

I crawled all golang projects on github with &gt;10k stars and tallied up their go.mod files. When I saw the data I thought it was interesting enough to share. I know this is a frequent topic on the subreddit. Other languages have dependency tools like this but it seems to be somewhat lacking in golang for whatever reason. I make heavy use of things like npmtrends, ruby-toolbox, etc.</p> <p>Stack is <code>astro+tailwind+daisy</code>, with <code>mise</code> and <code>just</code> as always.

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I spent a while debugging why OpenWhispr (open-source Wispr Flow alternative) transcribes speech perfectly on GNOME/Wayland but never auto-pastes into the target window. Figured I&#39;d document the fix since anyone on GNOME/Wayland will hit the same wall.</p> <p><strong>The problem:</strong> OpenWhispr transcribes your speech, but the text never appears in the focused input field. You have to manually copy-paste from the app every time. Affects all applications — browsers, text editors, terminals, everything.</p> <p><strong>Environment:</strong> Ubuntu 24.04, GNOME 46, Wayland, OpenWhispr 1.4.4</p> <hr/> <h2>Why it happens</h2> <p>Three issues compound:</p> <ol> <li><p><strong>xdotool tried before ydotool.</strong> OpenWhispr&#39;s paste logic tries xdotool first. On GNOME/Wayland with XWayland available, xdotool returns exit code 0 (looks like success) but silently fails for native Wayland windows. Since it &quot;succeeds,&quot; ydotool is never attempted.</p></li> <li><p><strong>ydotool socket permissions.</strong> <code>ydotoold</code> started with sudo creates a root-owned socket. OpenWhispr runs as your user and can&#39;t connect.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Clipboard restore race condition.</strong> The app writes text to clipboard, simulates Ctrl+V, then restores the original clipboard after 200ms. On Wayland, 200ms is too short — the text flashes briefly then disappears.</p></li> </ol> <p>The root cause is that Wayland&#39;s security model deliberately blocks input injection into other windows. GNOME doesn&#39;t implement <code>virtual-keyboard-unstable-v1</code>, so <code>wtype</code> doesn&#39;t work either. The only reliable path is <code>ydotool</code> via <code>/dev/uinput</code> at the kernel level.</p> <hr/> <h2>The fix</h2> <h3>Prerequisites</h3> <p><code>bash sudo apt install ydotool wl-clipboard xdotool </code></p> <h3>Step 1: ydotoold systemd service</h3> <p>```bash sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/ydotoold.service &lt;&lt; &#39;EOF&#39; [Unit] Description=ydotool daemon After=multi-user.target</p> <p>[Service] ExecStart=/usr/bin/ydotoold ExecStartPost=/bin/bash -c &#39;sleep 1 &amp;&amp; chmod 666 /tmp/.ydotool_socket&#39; Restart=always</p> <p>[Install] WantedBy=multi-user.target EOF</p> <p>sudo systemctl daemon-reload sudo systemctl enable --now ydotoold.service ```</p> <h3>Step 2: Session environment variable</h3> <p><code>bash mkdir -p ~/.config/environment.d echo &#39;YDOTOOL_SOCKET=/tmp/.ydotool_socket&#39; &gt; ~/.config/environment.d/ydotool.conf </code></p> <p>Patch the desktop launcher:</p> <p><code>bash sudo cp /usr/share/applications/open-whispr.desktop /usr/share/applications/open-whispr.desktop.bak sudo sed -i &#39;s|^Exec=.*|Exec=env YDOTOOL_SOCKET=/tmp/.ydotool_socket /opt/OpenWhispr/open-whispr|&#39; /usr/share/applications/open-whispr.desktop </code></p> <h3>Step 3: Patch OpenWhispr source</h3> <p>Extract the app archive:</p> <p><code>bash cd /tmp npx asar extract /opt/OpenWhispr/resources/app.asar openwhispr-src sudo cp /opt/OpenWhispr/resources/app.asar /opt/OpenWhispr/resources/app.asar.original </code></p> <p>Edit <code>src/helpers/clipboard.js</code> — three changes:</p> <p><strong>Patch A — Switch ydotool to direct typing:</strong></p> <p>Find the <code>ydotoolArgs</code> definition (~line 700) and replace:</p> <p>```javascript // OLD: const ydotoolArgs = inTerminal ? [&quot;key&quot;, &quot;29:1&quot;, &quot;42:1&quot;, &quot;47:1&quot;, &quot;47:0&quot;, &quot;42:0&quot;, &quot;29:0&quot;] : [&quot;key&quot;, &quot;29:1&quot;, &quot;47:1&quot;, &quot;47:0&quot;, &quot;29:0&quot;];</p> <p>// NEW: const textToType = clipboard.readText(); const ydotoolArgs = [&quot;type&quot;, &quot;--key-delay&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;--&quot;, textToType]; ```</p> <p><strong>Patch B — Prioritise ydotool over xdotool:</strong></p> <p>In the candidates array, swap the order:</p> <p>```javascript // OLD: ...(canUseXdotool ? [{ cmd: &quot;xdotool&quot;, args: xdotoolArgs }] : []), ...(canUseYdotool ? [{ cmd: &quot;ydotool&quot;, args: ydotoolArgs }] : []),</p> <p>// NEW: ...(canUseYdotool ? [{ cmd: &quot;ydotool&quot;, args: ydotoolArgs }] : []), ...(canUseXdotool ? [{ cmd: &quot;xdotool&quot;, args: xdotoolArgs }] : []), ```</p> <p><strong>Patch C — Disable clipboard restore:</strong></p> <p>In the <code>pasteWith()</code> success handler, comment out the <code>setTimeout</code> block that restores the original clipboard.</p> <p>Repack and deploy:</p> <p><code>bash npx asar pack /tmp/openwhispr-src /tmp/app.asar sudo cp /tmp/app.asar /opt/OpenWhispr/resources/app.asar </code></p> <h3>Step 4: Log out and back in</h3> <p>Required for the environment.d changes. Then launch OpenWhispr from the app menu and test.</p> <hr/> <h2>Verification</h2> <ul> <li><code>pgrep -a ydotoold</code> — daemon running</li> <li><code>ls -la /tmp/.ydotool_socket</code> — shows <code>srw-rw-rw-</code></li> <li><code>echo $YDOTOOL_SOCKET</code> — returns <code>/tmp/.ydotool_socket</code></li> <li><code>sleep 3 &amp;&amp; ydotool type &quot;hello world&quot;</code> — click into a text field within 3 seconds, text should appear</li> </ul> <hr/> <h2>Known limitations</h2> <ul> <li>Very long dictations in rich text editors (Claude.ai, Google Docs) may truncate because character-by-character typing can overwhelm complex JS input handlers. Short-to-medium works reliably. For long dictations, copy-paste from the OpenWhispr window still works.</li> <li>Your clipboard will contain the last dictated text (restore is disabled to prevent the flash-disappear bug).</li> <li>OpenWhispr updates overwrite the patch — you&#39;ll need to re-apply. Keep a backup of the patched source.</li> </ul> <hr/> <h2>GitHub issue</h2> <p>I&#39;ve also filed this as a bug report with suggested upstream fixes: <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/OpenWhispr/openwhispr/issues/240\">https://github.com/OpenWhispr/openwhispr/issues/240</a></strong></p> <p>Hopefully the devs can incorporate the tool priority fix so future GNOME/Wayland users don&#39;t have to patch it manually.</p> <hr/> <p><em>Happy to answer questions if anyone hits issues with the steps.</em></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Status_Smile1251\"> /u/Status_Smile1251 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1r0mgn1/guide_getting_openwhispr_voice_dictation/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1r0mgn1/guide_getting_openwhispr_voice_dictation/\">[comments]</a></span>",

We were spending a ton of time manually re-running them and debugging environment drift. </p> <p>I tried just using Papermill in a CI script, but it didn&#39;t solve the whole problem. We needed something that was Kubernetes-native and could handle things like injecting the right credentials, running on specific nodes (like GPU instances), and even checking if the notebook could still talk to a deployed model endpoint. </p> <p>So, I built this: <a href=\"https://github.com/tosin2013/jupyter-notebook-validator-operator\">https://github.com/tosin2013/jupyter-notebook-validator-operator</a></p> <p>It&#39;s a pretty standard operator pattern. You create a `<strong>NotebookValidationJob</strong>` custom resource that points to a notebook in a git repo, and the operator spins up a pod to run it and compares it against a &#39;golden&#39; version. It&#39;s designed to be part of an MLOps workflow to act as a regression test for your notebooks. </p> <p>I&#39;m honestly not sure if this is a common enough problem for other teams. I&#39;m looking for some brutal feedback on the approach and architecture. Is this a dumb idea? Is there a much better way to do this that I&#39;m just missing?

I handled the IPC layer where the daemon creates a Unix domain socket with mode 0600 to securely multiplex connections from local processes which allows you to run standard HTTP servers over the overlay without root privileges or kernel modules. Any feedback/ideas are greatly appreciated, Thanks.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/BiggieCheeseFan88\"> /u/BiggieCheeseFan88 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://github.com/TeoSlayer/pilotprotocol/tree/main\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1r0k5w4/i_built_an_open_source_userspace_network_stack_in/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "unread": true,
      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;ve been spending a lot of time thinking about the role of world models in robot learning, and the LingBot-VA paper (arxiv.org/abs/2601.21998) crystallized something I&#39;ve been going back and forth on. Their core claim is that video world modeling establishes &quot;a fresh and independent foundation for robot learning&quot; separate from the VLA paradigm. They build an autoregressive diffusion model on top of Wan2.2-5B that interleaves video and action tokens in a single causal sequence, predicts future frames via flow matching, then decodes actions through an inverse dynamics model. The results are genuinely strong: 92.9% on RoboTwin 2.0, 98.5% on LIBERO, and real world results that beat π0.5 by 20%+ on long horizon tasks with only 50 demos for adaptation.</p> <p>But here&#39;s what I keep coming back to: is the video generation component actually doing the heavy lifting, or is it an extremely expensive way to get temporal context that simpler architectures could provide?</p> <p>The paper&#39;s most compelling evidence for the video model mattering is the temporal memory experiments. They set up tasks with recurrent states, like opening box A, closing it, then opening box B, where the scene looks identical at two different points. π0.5 gets stuck in loops because it can&#39;t distinguish repeated states, while LingBot-VA&#39;s KV cache preserves the full history and resolves the ambiguity. They also show a counting task (wipe a plate exactly 6 times) where π0.5 exhibits random behavior. This is a real and important failure mode of reactive policies.</p> <p>But I&#39;m not fully convinced you need a 5.3B parameter video generation model to solve this. The KV cache mechanism is doing the memory work here, and you could cache learned state representations without generating actual video frames. The video generation adds massive computational overhead: they need an asynchronous inference pipeline with partial denoising (only integrating to s=0.5 instead of s=1.0) and a forward dynamics model grounding step just to make it real time. Their naive async implementation without FDM grounding drops from 92.9% to 74.3% on RoboTwin, which suggests the system is fragile to implementation details.</p> <p>On the other hand, the sample efficiency results are hard to argue with. At 10 demonstrations, LingBot-VA outperforms π0.5 by 15.6% on the Make Breakfast task. The argument that video pretraining provides implicit physical priors that reduce the data requirements for action learning is theoretically clean and empirically supported. The video backbone has seen massive amounts of physical interaction data during pretraining on in-the-wild videos, and that prior knowledge transfers.</p> <p>The architectural choices are interesting too. The Mixture-of-Transformers design with asymmetric capacity (3072 dim for video, 768 for action) makes sense given the complexity gap between visual dynamics and action distributions. And the noisy history augmentation trick, training the action decoder on partially denoised video representations, is clever engineering that lets them cut denoising steps in half.</p> <p>What I genuinely don&#39;t know is whether this paradigm scales to the diversity of real world manipulation. Their real world evaluation covers 6 tasks with 50 demos each. The tasks are impressive (10 step breakfast preparation, deformable object folding) but still within a relatively controlled setup. The paper acknowledges this implicitly by calling for &quot;more efficient video compression schemes&quot; in future work.</p> <p>So the fundamental tradeoff seems to be: you get persistent memory, causal consistency, and strong physical priors from video generation, but you pay for it with a 5.3B parameter model, complex async inference, and all the engineering overhead of maintaining a video generation pipeline in the robot control loop.</p> <p>For those working on robot learning: do you think the video generation paradigm will win out over scaling up reactive VLAs with better memory mechanisms? Or is there a middle ground where you get the temporal reasoning benefits without actually generating pixels?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Appropriate-Lie-8812\"> /u/Appropriate-Lie-8812 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1r086mv/d_are_autoregressive_video_world_models_actually/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1r086mv/d_are_autoregressive_video_world_models_actually/\">[comments]</a></span>",

And, I&#39;ve been working on improving it all that time. I forgot why I even wanted to improve the performance in the first place but to give you some background, I initially got into JSON parsing because I wanted to parse JSONC as I was messing around with config files back then. Existing crates didn&#39;t fill my niche.</p> <p>So I did what a &quot;real&quot; programmer would do. Spend hours writing code to automate something that can be done manully in less than a minute. /s</p> <p>Enough of the past, but nothing much I can share of the present either. All that I can say is life hasn&#39;t been the same since I got into JSON parsing. While trying to improve performance I read about simdjson. Obviously I tried to do what they did. But each time I failed. Heck I didn&#39;t even know about how bitwise OPs worked. All that I knew was <code>flag ^= true</code> will flip the boolean, that&#39;s all.</p> <p>I also had the misconception of LUT, I thought of it as a golden key to everything. So, I abused it everywhere thinking &quot;it will eliminate branches and improve performance&quot;, right? I was wrong, loading LUT everywhere will cause cache eviction in CPU. You will benefit from them only if they are hot and is likely to stay in cache for the total duration. I even went ahead to create a diabolical code that stored all functions in LUT lol.</p> <p>Having read about simdjson, I again had the misconception that doing branchless operations everywhere will solve everything even if it performs additional instructions significantly. So obviously I went ahead to overcomplicate things trying to do everything in branchless manner. Got depressed for a fair amount of time when I was stuck and unable to understand why It doesn&#39;t work. In the end I realized, it is as they &quot;it depends&quot;. If the code is highly predictable then branch predictors will do it better. Made me appreciate CPUs more.</p> <p>Moral of the story, whatever you do, it all depends on what you&#39;re doing. I had skill issue so I had all these misconceptions （￣︶￣）↗ . To make things clear, I&#39;m not slandering LUT, branch predictors, branchless codes etc. All of them have their own use cases and its upto you on how to use them and properly as well.</p> <p>I&#39;ve learnt many things in this journey, my words aren&#39;t enough to describe it all. It wouldn&#39;t have been possible without the people who were generous enough to share their findings/codes for free in the internet.

Recently we&#39;ve came across a problem of customer instance management. The system overall consists of several types of services: customer specific and the shared ones, along side with per-customer PostgreSQL as data storage and several message brokers. For each new customer we have to manually run ansible scripts to deploy customer-specific services, run a DB instance, create brokers topics, queues and so on. What is the proper way to run multi-instance systems in production on k8s? We store customers-specific information e.g. name, id, services... in a separated DB, so we can use it in deployment if needed.</p> <p>Also, we run gitlab as ci/cd and one of the developers suggested using it as an entry point for instance deployment. As for me, this looks like a bad idea, but I can&#39;t explain why clearly.</p> <p>Any real world examples or suggestions?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/adxaos\"> /u/adxaos </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1r02g6v/how_to_create_saas_customer_instance_on_the_fly/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1r02g6v/how_to_create_saas_customer_instance_on_the_fly/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I have a backend for a web application which connected to databases through GCP&#39;s Cloud SQL Proxy. However, we used to run the proxy as a process inside the main container. The result was that whenever the pod was getting terminated, the proxy was shut down immediately while the backend was still processing requests... leading to a bunch of client requests failing because they just couldn&#39;t connect to the DB.</p> <p>The solution we went with was to set up a separate service with Cloud SQL Proxy pods. This seemed to work perfectly, but when the pod was getting terminated, we saw the exact same behavior. It turns out that the moment that the pod was getting terminated, the DNS requests to resolve the service domain name (foo.bar.svc.cluster.local) were all failing with nxdomain. I haven&#39;t been able to find any documentation on this that would either explain why this is occurring or whether I can ensure that the DNS requests actually go through.</p> <p>I&#39;m positive that it&#39;s purely an issue with DNS because if I try connecting to the service directly by IP, this problem does not occur and the DB remains accessible throughout the entire pod termination.</p> <p>I&#39;m aware that there are workarounds that I could use (e.g., using a sidecar container for Cloud SQL Proxy, replacing the domain hostname with the service IP...), but right now what I&#39;m most interested is - why does DNS name resolution fail, and is there any way in which I could get it to behave?</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ZephyrBelinski\"> /u/ZephyrBelinski </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1r00cph/dns_resolution_failure_while_pod_is_getting/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1r00cph/dns_resolution_failure_while_pod_is_getting/\">[comments]</a></span>",

But when you&#39;re building dozens of services, each with HTTP servers, job queues, scheduled tasks, health checks, you end up re-implementing the same lifecycle patterns over and over.</p> <p>This library captures those patterns as composable wrappers: <code>HTTPServer</code>, <code>Schedule</code>, <code>Restart</code>, <code>Recover</code>, <code>Signal</code>, <code>Closer</code>.</p> <p>The real value is the <code>Manager</code>. It orchestrates multiple runnables with two-tier ordered shutdown: processes are stopped first, then services. Your database connections and queues stay alive while your workers drain.</p> <pre><code>func main() { // instantiate your components... m := runnable.Manager() m.RegisterService(jobQueue) m.Register(runnable.HTTPServer(server)) m.Register( runnable.Schedule(cleanup, runnable.Every(time.Hour)), ) runnable.Run(m) } </code></pre> <p>A Manager is itself a Runnable, so you can nest them for independent shutdown ordering.</p> <p>Zero dependencies. ~1k lines of code. </p> <p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/pior/runnable\">https://github.com/pior/runnable</a></p> <p>Feedbacks?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/pior\"> /u/pior </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1qzz8si/runnable_tiny_library_for_orchestrating/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1qzz8si/runnable_tiny_library_for_orchestrating/\">[comments]</a></span>",

It includes performance optimizations and a <a href=\"https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/40671.pdf\">HyperLogLog++</a> implementation.</p> <p>hyperloglockless has O(1) cardinality queries while keeping high insert throughput. It has predictable performance, and excels when there are many cardinality queries and when there are less than 65K inserts.</p> <p>hyperloglockless now includes a HyperLogLog++ variant! It works by first using &quot;sparse&quot; mode: a dynamically sized, compressed collection of HLL registers. When the memory of the sparse mode reaches the same as classic HLL, it switches automatically. hyperloglockless&#39;s HLL++ implementation is ~5x faster and ~100x more accurate (in sparse mode) than existing HLL++ implementations. It achieves this by eliminating unnecessary hashing, using faster hash encoding, branch avoidance, and smarter memory management.</p> <p>There&#39;s more memory, speed, and accuracy benchmark results at <a href=\"https://github.com/tomtomwombat/hyperloglockless\">https://github.com/tomtomwombat/hyperloglockless</a> .

It works really well, but the annoying part is that Gnome keyring doesn&#39;t unlock, so I have to type in my password anyway after reboot. </p> <p>I believe the problem here is that the key used to encrypt and decrypt the keyring is derived from your password, which means biometrics through <a href=\"https://github.com/boltgolt/howdy\">Howdy</a> or <a href=\"https://fprint.freedesktop.org/\">fprintd</a> won&#39;t work to unlock it. </p> <p>Does anyone know if there is any work being done on supporting biometrics for decrypting a keyring? My understanding is that Windows has this set up by generating a random encryption key and storing it in some secure enclave backed by the TPM module. And then setting it up so password, pin, fingerprint, face, etc. can all unlock the secure enclave to retrieve the key for decryption (someone please correct me if I&#39;m wrong here). </p> <p>A lot of modern laptops have TPM now. I know it&#39;s also possible to use TPM to, for example, automatically decrypt a LUKS partition. And Linux already has good biometric auth support. Is it possible that we ever see biometric unlocking of TPM secrets in the near future? Is there any ongoing work on this? </p> <p>I&#39;d love to work on this, but it seems like such a feature would require changes in PAM, fprintd, Howdy, keyring, and maybe more. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/securityCTFs\"> /u/securityCTFs </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1qzo6yc/what_would_it_take_for_linux_to_support_tpmbacked/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1qzo6yc/what_would_it_take_for_linux_to_support_tpmbacked/\">[comments]</a></span>",

The core challenge was that I needed these agents to communicate reliably across different networks without static IPs, so I ended up implementing a full transport layer in userspace on top of UDP.</p> <p>The part I think this community might find interesting is how it integrates with the standard library. I made sure the custom transport implements the standard net.Conn and net.Listener interfaces. This means you can run a standard Go net/http server over this custom UDP overlay without changing your application code at all. The stack handles the reliable delivery using sliding windows, SACK, and AIMD congestion control.</p> <p>I also used the new log/slog package for structured logging throughout the daemon, which was a joy to work with.

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Good morning dear Rust community,</p> <p>I&#39;d like to present the current stage of my actively developing Rust game engine &quot;Syrillian&quot;, which I&#39;ve been haggling with for the past 2 years. It has received <em>hundreds</em> of hours of our free time and is <strong>open source</strong>, licensed under <strong>MIT</strong>; made to be free-for-all.</p> <p>As the first contributors started to settle in, this project has become more than just my personal project. In fact, I&#39;m very happy to be able to share this passion with more people, and work towards making my own games with it, as well as seeing others do so. Seeing the first stable release nearing, some time this year, is honestly <em>very</em> exciting.</p> <p>But so much to that, I think code talks best. Have a look how behavior is defined in Syrillian, by building components:</p> <p>```rust</p> <h1>[derive(Debug, Reflect)]</h1> <h1>[reflect_all]</h1> <p>pub struct GravityComponent { pub acceleration_per_sec: f32, pub velocity: f32, pub max_acceleration: f32, }</p> <p>impl Default for GravityComponent { fn default() -&gt; Self { GravityComponent { acceleration_per_sec: 9.80665, velocity: 0.0, max_acceleration: 100.0, } } }</p> <p>impl Component for GravityComponent { fn update(&amp;mut self, world: &amp;mut World) { let delta_time = world.delta_time().as_secs_f32();</p> <pre><code> self.velocity = (self.velocity - self.acceleration_per_sec * delta_time) .clamp(-self.max_acceleration, self.max_acceleration); self.parent() .transform .translate(Vec3::new(0.0, self.velocity, 0.0)); } </code></pre> <p>} ```</p> <p>This is how a gravity component is made from scratch. That is all that&#39;s needed. Type Reflections (Reflect macro) are not necessary, but will allow you to persist the component in a future scene format, or do any other dynamic field reflection you might wish for, right now.</p> <p>You can then add it to the world by making, or using an existing object, and simply adding the component.</p> <p>```rust // App macro is optional, but will bootstrap a basic entrypoint with tracing / logging, etc.. for convenience</p> <h1>[derive(Debug, Default, SyrillianApp)]</h1> <p>struct MyApp;</p> <p>impl AppState for MyApp { fn init(&amp;mut self, world: &amp;mut World) -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn Error&gt;&gt; { let camera = world.new_camera(); let mut cube = world.spawn(&amp;CubePrefab::default());</p> <pre><code> // here you can use your gravity component cube.add_component::&lt;GravityComponent&gt;(); // or you just use the real physics, provided for you by syrillian OOTB :) cube.add_component::&lt;Collider3D&gt;(); cube.add_component::&lt;RigidBodyComponent&gt;(); } </code></pre> <p>} ```</p> <p>That&#39;s all that&#39;s needed for project bootstrap, windowing, render and world + physics runtime.</p> <p>The project is here hosted here, where you can contribute, report any issues and ask for help:</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/Syrillian/syrillian\">https://github.com/Syrillian/syrillian</a></p> <p>I would appreciate your support. Even a quick 🌟 on the repo would be amazing so I&#39;m aware of interest.</p> <p>The engine is also built to integrate a visual editor in the future.</p> <p>Thanks for your time and have lots of fun building! :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/IKekschenI\"> /u/IKekschenI </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1qzdr12/syrillian_rust_game_engine_with_a_focus_on/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1qzdr12/syrillian_rust_game_engine_with_a_focus_on/\">[comments]</a></span>",

After working on it on and off, I’ve recently added a significant layer of functionality that goes beyond just copying data.</p> <p>The library now supports <strong>Diffing</strong> and <strong>Patching</strong> with full serialization support.</p> <p><strong>The New Features:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Diff Generation:</strong> You can now compare two objects and generate a &quot;diff&quot; object that represents the structural and value differences between them.</li> <li><strong>Patching:</strong> These diffs can be applied as patches to other objects.</li> <li><strong>Serialization:</strong> The generated diffs are fully serializable. You can marshal a diff to JSON, send it over the wire, or store it, and then unmarshal it to apply it elsewhere. This is massive for synchronization protocols or audit logging.</li> <li><strong>Conditionals:</strong> The patch system includes support for conditionals. You can define logic within the patch to ensure updates are only applied if specific criteria are met (e.g., atomic-like updates based on state).</li> </ul> <p>It still retains the original goal of being a fast, correct deep copier (handling unexported fields, etc.), but now it effectively doubles as a state-synchronization tool.</p> <p>I’d love to hear your thoughts on the API ergonomics for the new diff/patch features.</p> <p><strong>Repo:</strong><a href=\"https://github.com/brunoga/deep\">https://github.com/brunoga/deep</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/BrunoGAlbuquerque\"> /u/BrunoGAlbuquerque </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1qzcce9/updates_to_deep_library/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1qzcce9/updates_to_deep_library/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Well, jokes on you!! I removed up every non-Go component (other than the Linux kernel and Limine bootloader, of course). and best part is that it take around a second to build system image.</p> <p>It now has a pure Go, non posix compatible coreutils, a basic graphics framework with DRM/KMS, framebuffer, Wayland, and my custom display protocol, a framebuffer and evdev-backed window manager, IPv4 networking support, and an IPC service bus like dbus, but simpler and more Go-centric.</p> <p>Since it’s pure Go and I’m not aiming to make it POSIX-compatible, I’ve made changes to the root filesystem, user identity model, etc. Read docs/ for more info.</p> <p>Also, I use AI autocompletion to help me write comments, docs, and some common functions. so feel free to raise an issue or PR if any documentation is unclear.</p> <p>My future plan after makimpng it uable is to provide a containerized Linux compatibility layer and reuse components like Vulkan and codecs using purego for optional hardware acceleration, and maybe Wayland support for app containers. Not sure yet, but I’ll try.</p> <p>Also, let me know if I’m just spamming or if you like hearing more updates like this.</p> <p>Feel free to get involved and raise issues for build or runtime errors and except things to be broken and incomplete.</p> <p>Project URL <a href=\"https://github.com/itsmanjeet/avyos\">https://github.com/itsmanjeet/avyos</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/itsmanjeet\"> /u/itsmanjeet </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1qz19r9/avyos_updates/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1qz19r9/avyos_updates/\">[comments]</a></span>",

It&#39;s my response to the ongoing Go error handling discussions in the official forums. The library is intentionally simple and focuses on making error handling more concise and expressive.</p> <h2>Key Features:</h2> <ul> <li><strong>Assertion utilities</strong> with customizable error messages</li> <li><strong>Panic recovery and error handling</strong> with deferred cleanup</li> <li><strong>Value validation and extraction</strong> utilities</li> <li><strong>Stack trace collection and logging</strong></li> <li><strong>Error coalescing</strong> for resource cleanup scenarios</li> </ul> <h2>Usage Examples:</h2> <p><strong>Basic Error Handling:</strong></p> <p><code>go func sendFile(filename string, conn net.Conn) (n int, err error) { defer act.Catch(&amp;err) f, err := os.Open(filename) act.Assert(err) defer f.Close() act.Ensure(io.Copy(conn, f)).Scan(&amp;n) return } </code></p> <p><strong>Complex Error Handling with Callbacks:</strong></p> <p><code>go func fetchData(conn net.Conn, saveAs string) (err error) { f, err := os.Create(saveAs) if err != nil { return err } defer act.Catch(func(e error) error { e = act.FirstError(e, f.Close()) if os.IsNotExist(e) { err = nil return nil } return e }) saveData(f, conn) return } </code></p> <h2>Installation:</h2> <p><code>bash go get go.xrfang.cn/act </code></p> <p>The philosophy is to use defer act.Catch(&amp;err) at the beginning of functions and handle all errors with panic instead of if err != nil to reduce conditional logic and make function flow clearer. It preserves original, unwrapped errors while automatically logging stack traces for debugging.</p> <p>This is my take on the Go error handling debate - keeping things lightweight while addressing common pain points. I&#39;d love to get feedback from the community on:</p> <ol> <li>Does this approach resonate with your error handling patterns?</li> <li>Any suggestions for improvements or additional features?</li> <li>Thoughts on the panic-based error handling philosophy?</li> </ol> <p>Check it out on <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/go.xrfang.cn/act\">pkg.go.dev</a> and let me know what you think!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Calm-Problem-9101\"> /u/Calm-Problem-9101 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1qyx6kb/showcase_act_a_lightweight_go_library_for_cleaner/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1qyx6kb/showcase_act_a_lightweight_go_library_for_cleaner/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Rootcause is a (relatively) new error handling library for Rust focused on ergonomics, inspectability, and the flexibility to use it however you want. Today I have released version 0.12.0, which includes <code>rootcause-tracing</code> to automatically capture <code>tracing</code> spans when creating a <code>rootcause</code> error report.</p> <p>If you like <code>anyhow</code> but wish your errors carried more structured information and better diagnostics, this might be interesting to you.</p> <h3>Status update</h3> <h4>Real-world validation</h4> <p>Since my <a href=\"https://reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1pkuap7/rootcause_0110_big_improvements_and_one_step/\">last post</a> in December, I have been porting most of the Rust code at my workplace to rootcause. This has allowed me to get a lot of first-hand experience using rootcause. Other people also appear to have slowly started using it as well, at least according to our <a href=\"https://crates.io/crates/rootcause\">download counts on crates.io</a> and the number of <a href=\"https://github.com/search?q=path%3ACargo.toml+rootcause&amp;type=code\">users on GitHub</a>.</p> <h4><code>rootcause-tracing</code></h4> <p>The biggest change since my last post is the <a href=\"https://docs.rs/rootcause-tracing\">new crate</a> for integrating with the <code>tracing</code> crate <a href=\"https://github.com/rootcause-rs/rootcause/pull/102\">#102</a>. I expect many users will prefer this over the existing <a href=\"https://docs.rs/rootcause-backtrace\"><code>rootcause-backtrace</code></a> crate, though I also expect many will want to use both.</p> <p>This new crate allows tracing spans to be captured and shown as part of the error report. This is hard to explain in words, but very obvious when you see it. For example, suppose you have this code:</p> <pre><code>#[tracing::instrument(fields(query, table))] fn query_database(_query: &amp;str, _table: &amp;str) -&gt; Result&lt;String, Report&lt;DatabaseError&gt;&gt; { // Example code: We always fail here Err(report!(DatabaseError))? } #[instrument(fields(user_id, role))] fn check_user_permission(_user_id: u64, _role: &amp;str) -&gt; Result&lt;(), Report&lt;PermissionError&gt;&gt; { query_database(&quot;SELECT permissions FROM users WHERE id = ?&quot;, &quot;users&quot;) .attach(&quot;Failed to fetch user permissions&quot;) .context(PermissionError)?; Ok(()) } </code></pre> <p>With the right setup, this could result in a report such as this:</p> <pre><code> ● permission denied ├ rootcause-tracing/examples/tracing_spans.rs:36 ├ Tracing spans: │ │ check_user_permission{_user_id=12345 _role=&quot;admin&quot;} │ │ handle_api_request{_request_id=&quot;req-abc-123&quot; _endpoint=&quot;/api/admin/users&quot;} │ ╰─ ├ User lacks required permissions │ ● database query failed ├ rootcause-tracing/examples/tracing_spans.rs:29 ├ Tracing spans: │ │ query_database{_query=&quot;SELECT permissions FROM users WHERE id = ?&quot; _table=&quot;users&quot;} │ │ check_user_permission{_user_id=12345 _role=&quot;admin&quot;} │ │ handle_api_request{_request_id=&quot;req-abc-123&quot; _endpoint=&quot;/api/admin/users&quot;} │ ╰─ ╰ Failed to fetch user permissions </code></pre> <p>See <a href=\"https://github.com/rootcause-rs/rootcause/blob/main/rootcause-tracing/examples/tracing_spans.rs\">the full example</a> for details.</p> <h4>Small incremental improvements</h4> <p>Getting real-world data has also allowed me and other contributors to notice a bunch of minor points of friction. A lot of the work in this release has been small fixes to mitigate these issues:</p> <ul> <li>We added an extension trait to make it easier to work with <code>Option</code> types <a href=\"https://github.com/rootcause-rs/rootcause/pull/92\">#92</a></li> <li>We added the type alias <code>rootcause::Result</code> <a href=\"https://github.com/rootcause-rs/rootcause/pull/91\">#91</a></li> <li>We added support for formatting the error sources for a context <a href=\"https://github.com/rootcause-rs/rootcause/pull/94\">#94</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/rootcause-rs/rootcause/blob/main/examples/following_error_sources.rs\">example</a></li> <li>We added support for mutating attachments <a href=\"https://github.com/rootcause-rs/rootcause/pull/113\">#113</a></li> <li>Contexts and attachments will by default use the same formatter (<code>Display</code>/<code>Debug</code>) as the one used to format the report <a href=\"https://github.com/rootcause-rs/rootcause/pull/116\">#116</a></li> <li>We fixed <code>rootcause-backtrace</code> so it works on Windows <a href=\"https://github.com/rootcause-rs/rootcause/pull/118\">#118</a> and when cross-compiling <a href=\"https://github.com/rootcause-rs/rootcause/pull/121\">#121</a></li> </ul> <h3>Next steps</h3> <h4>A rootcause book</h4> <p>My biggest priority at the moment is to write a small mdbook. This is partly to document rootcause, but also to propose concrete solutions to some of the error handling discussions we&#39;ve seen on <a href=\"/r/rust\">/r/rust</a> recently <a href=\"https://reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1q3wb3l/stop_forwarding_errors_start_designing_them/\">1</a> <a href=\"https://reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kx0ak8/why_use_structured_errors_in_rust_applications/\">2</a>.</p> <h4>Towards a 1.0 release</h4> <p>I am planning to release version 1.0 within the next 3 months. I think that goal is fairly realistic, since my biggest concern was getting enough real-world validation. I think we have more or less accomplished that.</p> <p>I am also finished with all of the major features I had planned. The only breaking change I am currently planning is to use a builder pattern for a few of the structs. This is to make it easier to change them in the future without requiring a new major version.</p> <h3>Questions / Discussion</h3> <p>Feel free to ask any questions you want about rootcause or my opinions on error handling here.

OpenRun is a declarative web app deployment platform. You define the source code location and the url domain and or path where you want it deployed. OpenRun will monitor your repo for changes. On detecting changes, it fetches the app config and source code, builds the image and deploys the container. </p> <p>OpenRun can run on a single machine, in which case it directly deploys the container to Docker/Podman. OpenRun can also run on a Kubernetes cluster. In that case it build the images using Kaniko and deploys the app as a Kubernetes service. You can use the same app config on single-node and on Kubernetes.</p> <p>The whole Starlark (subset of python) config for creating an app is just:</p> <p><code> app(path=&quot;/streamlit/uber&quot;, source=&quot;github.com/streamlit/demo-uber-nyc-pickups&quot;, spec=&quot;python-streamlit&quot;) </code></p> <p>On Kubernetes, using OpenRun avoids the need to configure Jenkins/GitHub Actions for builds, ArgoCD/Flux for CD and any IDP etc. OpenRun has features like OAuth/SAML based auth with RBAC which are required for teams to deploy internal tools. </p> <p>Knative is the closest such solution I know of for Kubernetes. Compared to Knative, OpenRun handles the image builds, without requiring an external build service like Tekton. OpenRun does not have any function as a service features and it does not currently support scaling apps based on concurrent API volume. OpenRun has lazy resource initialization and versions are maintained in a metadata database, so the resource utilization of OpenRun should be lower than Knative.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/avkijay\"> /u/avkijay </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://github.com/openrundev/openrun\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1qypboz/openrun_declarative_web_app_deployment/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>",

Add custom business logic, audit trails, or A/B testing without touching core code.<br/> ✅ Atomic Revocation: One click to &quot;Logout All Devices.&quot; No zombie tokens, no 15-minute wait for expiry.<br/> ✅ Embedded &amp; Server Modes: Run it as a native Go library or a standalone server via Docker with any tech stack.

I wanted to share a project I’ve been working on: I built a physical MENACE, the matchbox-based reinforcement learning model invented by Donald Michie in the 1960s to play tic‑tac‑toe. The model uses reinforcement learning and is implemented with matchboxes and beads for each game state. Don’t let the laptop screen fool you — the actual “AI” lives in the matchboxes, and I still have to pick moves by hand.On the laptop I’m running a small “Menace Manager” app that helps me quickly find the right box for the current board position and can also train MENACE using a Minimax opponent. I originally built all of this just to get an intuitive, hands‑on feel for how machine learning works.I’m thinking about cleaning it up and putting everything on GitHub (matchbox layout, training rules, and the manager app). Would that be interesting to you? By the way, if there are people from Taiwan here, I’d love to do a small group demo of the physical MENACE.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/PureRepresentative89\"> /u/PureRepresentative89 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/4i3tcdoai3ig1.jpeg\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1qyhi8k/p_a_matchbox_machine_learning_model/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>",

Have to admit, I was quite excited about the prospect of delegating more to Claude Code or whatever agent.</p> <p>Honestly tried to delegate as much as I could, and quickly realized that&#39;s max 10% of my work. Two main problems I found.</p> <ol> <li><p>It may finally be usable Rust code that compiles, but still sloppy, verbose and poor design choices. This is expected, because these are predictive systems trained on the entirety of the internet, so by design, are going to produce the most average, middle of the road code out there.</p></li> <li><p>Software development is a very iterative design process. Mentally, I usually split my tasks in say 3 - 5 day chunks, and I know what I want done and how I want the software to function after each chunk. However, I can&#39;t really explain exactly what I need done in a prompt, because I don&#39;t know until I&#39;m in the middle of it.</p></li> </ol> <p>It&#39;s alwys a journey from point A to B, during which I always come up with better and more efficient designs, realize additional pitfalls I need to look out for, discover edge cases I need to handle, and so on. This whole iterative process is what makes quality software, well... quality. Handing that off to a LLM guarantees I&#39;ll always produce usable, but mediocre code.</p> <ol> <li>Same as always. Every time I lean on these things, I find myself wasting time back tracking and fixing mistakes made by the LLM costing me more time than I saved during initial development.</li> </ol> <p>That&#39;s how I feel at least. I still use LLMs, they&#39;re excellent for various things. For example, I can bang out several hundred lines of Rust, send it to Gemini an ask it to fix syntax / braces / brackets errors and it works like a charm. That&#39;s rather new, and quite nice. Good at finding bugs as well.</p> <p>I&#39;m sure I would use it for boiler plate code, but I primarily write in Rust, so there just really isn&#39;t any boiler plate. If you&#39;re developing in Rust and find yourself writing boiler plate code often, then you&#39;re doing something wrong.</p> <p>However, I&#39;ve totally given up on the concept of using it as a junior developer too write code that I&#39;m going to include in the project or anything. I find it always just ultimately slows me down more than helps me, and I find attacking development projects without even a second thought given to LLMs is quite refreshing.</p> <p>How bout you?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/mdizak\"> /u/mdizak </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1qy9dcs/who_has_completely_sworn_off_including_llm/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1qy9dcs/who_has_completely_sworn_off_including_llm/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Standard locking isn&#39;t enough for microsecond-level engines.</p> <p><strong>How I approached this:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>2D Execution Matrix:</strong> Mapping &quot;Buy/Sell&quot; vs. &quot;Long/Short&quot; to handle four distinct settlement possibilities.</li> <li><strong>Settlement Compensation Flow:</strong> Automatically reversing margin/position freezing when a state reversal is detected (e.g., Open settlement turns into a Close).</li> <li><strong>Resource Stealing Mechanism:</strong> Atomic logic to &quot;steal&quot; positions already frozen by other pending orders when an immediate settlement requires them.</li> <li><strong>Atomic Logic:</strong> Why pre-freezing must be combined with the initial order judgment to prevent isolation issues.</li> </ul> <p>I’ve documented the logic and provided a walkthrough of the compensation flows here:</p> <p><strong>Video Analysis:</strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q0PC63rT1Q\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q0PC63rT1Q</a><br/> <strong>GitHub Project:</strong><a href=\"https://github.com/vincentf13/open.vincentf13\">https://github.com/vincentf13/open.vincentf13</a></p> <p>I&#39;m curious to hear how others handle <strong>atomic position flipping</strong> in high-concurrency environments.

An AI model first narrows down likely areas based on visual features, either globally or within a user-defined region. A separate verification step then compares candidates against real street-level imagery. If verification fails, the result is discarded.</p> <p>This means it is not magic and not globally omniscient. The system requires pre-mapped street-level coverage to verify locations.

Even getting hold of a CD back then (especially in Australia) was a mission in itself. Then came figuring out drivers, wrestling with X just to get a desktop, and hoping you picked the <em>right</em> video card option.</p> <p>Choosing between KDE and GNOME felt like a big decision. If you really wanted to rice things up, you’d run Enlightenment on top of GNOME. Multiple virtual desktops blew my mind at the time — it felt genuinely futuristic.</p> <p>I even tried compiling my own kernel and broke my system more times than I can count. Frustrating, educational, and honestly… a lot of fun.</p> <p>Over the years I kept trying to switch to Linux permanently, but something always dragged me back to Windows — usually work or software compatibility.</p> <p>Now though, with Proton and so many applications being web-based, I think I’ve finally made the move for good. I still keep a Windows VM around for the odd work-specific app, but I don’t feel like I’m missing out on anything anymore.</p> <p>If anything, it’s the opposite. These days, <em>not</em> using Linux feels like a performance hit. Going back to Windows just feels sluggish and buggy by comparison.</p> <p>Anyway, not sure there’s a point to this post — just feeling a bit nostalgic and no one I know would really understand this post, lol.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Carcus85\"> /u/Carcus85 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1qy44v8/amazing_how_far_linux_has_come/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1qy44v8/amazing_how_far_linux_has_come/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Elliptic integrals are special mathematical functions useful for computing the lengths of curves and magnetic fields. It&#39;s applied in other physics and engineering fields as well. </p> <p>I built this because I needed a solution that was dependency-free (no C binding). I thought it would be a quick project, but it ended up taking way longer than anticipated.</p> <p>I worked on Ellip on and off for about a year. This is the breakdown of my time:</p> <ul> <li>10% - implementing the math routines,</li> <li>30% - writing docs,</li> <li>40% - writing tests, comparing the results with Wolfram, and debugging things.</li> <li>The rest of the percentage went to struggling with Rust, as this was one of my first Rust projects.</li> </ul> <p>The paper itself went pretty smoothly, which I think owed significantly to the extensive testing. Ellip was integrated into the <a href=\"https://github.com/stainless-steel/special\">special</a> crate as well, and I learned a lot from contributing to it.</p> <p>Example use case:</p> <pre><code>use ellip::*; fn ellipse_length(a: f64, b: f64) -&gt; f64 { 8.0 * elliprg(0.0, a * a, b * b).unwrap() } // ellipse with semi-major axis 5, semi-minor axis 3 let ans = ellipse_length(5.0, 3.0); // 25.526998863398124 </code></pre> <p>I&#39;d love to hear your feedback on the <a href=\"https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.09386\">paper</a> and the <a href=\"https://github.com/p-sira/ellip\">code</a>. I plan to continue contributing to the community, so learning from your inputs and improving would be awesome.</p> <p>---</p> <p>As you may know (or guess), most of the work published in JOSS is Python. I hope that Rust will gain more traction in the research community. I may be biased, but I think Rust is one of the most logical and well-crafted languages for deeper research.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Inspacious\"> /u/Inspacious </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/05xut0u5jzhg1.png\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1qy1xb7/published_a_paper_on_a_rust_crate_ellip_an/\">[comments]</a></span>",

This one is about finetuning text-only language models to become vision language models (VLMs).</p> <p>Code is open source (repo below). Sharing a YouTube tutorial + results too, for those who are interested.</p> <p>Note: &quot;Scratch&quot; here means the implementation is done from scratch. The Q-Former is also trained from scratch. It is not advisable to train VLM models without a pretrained text-model and vision encoder. </p> <p>Heres my full roadmap for future ML devs walking this path:</p> <p>- used 50k images from the conceptual captions dataset</p> <p>- VIT-base encoder for backbone, this remained frozen</p> <p>- Trained a BLIP-2 style Q-Former model.<br/> - Q-Former starts with a distillbert model<br/> - Added randomly init query tokens<br/> - Added additional cross-attention layers to attend to VIT tokens<br/> - Trained with unimodal ITC loss (CLIP)<br/> - Experimented with multimodal losses in BLIP-2 as well (ITM and ITG)</p> <p>- For LM finetuning<br/> - Used the smallest LM I could find: the SmolLM-135M-Instruct<br/> - Augment synthetic dataset from the conceptual captions image/captions<br/> - Introduced MLP layer to adapt from Q-former space to LM space<br/> - LORA weights for parameter efficient finetuning.</p> <p>Results were pretty cool. Took about 4 hours to train both Q-Former and LM on one V100. Costed me like 50 cents which was amazing given how cool the results were.</p> <p>Git repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/avbiswas/vlm\">https://github.com/avbiswas/vlm</a></p> <p>Youtube: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Oj27kALfvr0\">https://youtu.be/Oj27kALfvr0</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/AvvYaa\"> /u/AvvYaa </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1qxoat0/p_wrote_a_vlm_from_scratch_vitbase_qformer_lora/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1qxoat0/p_wrote_a_vlm_from_scratch_vitbase_qformer_lora/\">[comments]</a></span>",

As I started working with untrusted input, I started digging into prompt injection libraries. Being bootstrapped, I don&#39;t want to spend a ton of money on horizontal scaling right now, and processing so many files at once was getting backlogged when using a more comprehensive security product. To my surprise I couldn&#39;t find a super duper lightweight precheck for go to catch obvious prompt injections before escalating an obvious prompt injection attempt and spending $$ on the products I&#39;m trialing.</p> <p>It&#39;s intended as a local prefilter that runs in less than 1ms and doesn&#39;t make any API calls and has no external dependencies. It catches a decent amount of basic prompt injections with ideally no false positives. Doesn&#39;t make any API calls or have any external dependencies. The npm/python one&#39;s usually have the LLM as judge integrations so if you&#39;d like to use this and add it feel free, I am just already using a second layer with Lakera so there wasn&#39;t a need.</p> <p>It runs pattern matching, sanitization, and similarity checks against most basic/common injection patterns locally before you ideally escalate. It&#39;s tested against a few of the open source prompt injection samples and was tuned for no false positives. I want to note, I am NOT a security engineer, just a full stack engineer that&#39;s being doing it a while so this is not likely comprehensive and is mostly a mix of some of my knowledge and point claude at some security papers.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Neat_Confidence_4166\"> /u/Neat_Confidence_4166 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1qxmzd2/built_a_tiny_fast_library_for_catching_obvious/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1qxmzd2/built_a_tiny_fast_library_for_catching_obvious/\">[comments]</a></span>",

This suggests strong task-level specialization rather than one model being strictly better.</p> <p>To test this, I built a <strong>Mixture-of-Models architecture</strong>, which is different from traditional routing that just defaults to the strongest aggregate model most of the time. The goal isn’t to route to a single model as often as possible, but to exploit complementary strengths between models.</p> <p>Concretely:</p> <ul> <li>The problem description is embedded</li> <li>It’s assigned to a semantic cluster (learned from general coding data, not SWE-Bench)</li> <li>Each cluster has learned per-model success statistics</li> <li>The task is routed to the historically strongest model for that <em>type</em> of problem</li> </ul> <p>Importantly, this does <strong>not</strong> route the top aggregate model for the majority of tasks. Several clusters consistently route to other models where they outperform it, even though it has the highest overall score.</p> <p>There’s no new foundation model, no test-time search, and no repo execution, just a lightweight gating mechanism over multiple models.</p> <p>Using this Mixture-of-Models setup, the system reaches 75.6% on SWE-Bench, exceeding single-model baselines (~74%). The takeaway isn’t the absolute number, but the mechanism: leaderboard aggregates hide complementary strengths, and mixture architectures can capture a higher ceiling than any single model.</p> <p>Blog with details and methodology here: <a href=\"https://nordlyslabs.com/blog/hypernova\">https://nordlyslabs.com/blog/hypernova</a></p> <p>Github: the framework is open source ! <a href=\"https://github.com/Nordlys-Labs/nordlys\">https://github.com/Nordlys-Labs/nordlys</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/botirkhaltaev\"> /u/botirkhaltaev </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1qxjavq/r_mixtureofmodels_routing_beats_single_llms_on/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1qxjavq/r_mixtureofmodels_routing_beats_single_llms_on/\">[comments]</a></span>",

He was supposed to make our engineering teams more effective.</p> <p>His first week he sat in on a technical discussion about Kafka consumer group rebalancing that was causing production issues. After 45 minutes of engineers debating partition strategies he interrupted and asked &quot;but have we tried breaking this into smaller stories?&quot;</p> <p>The room went silent. Not because it was a good question. Because it was so disconnected from what we were actually discussing that nobody knew how to respond without being rude.</p> <p>This was the pattern for two years.</p> <p>Team struggling with a complex database migration? &quot;Let&#39;s timebox this discussion and take it offline.&quot; Team debating microservice boundaries? &quot;I&#39;m hearing a lot of technical details but what&#39;s the user story?&quot; Team blocked on a deployment pipeline issue? &quot;Sounds like we need a retro to discuss our process.&quot;</p> <p>Every technical problem got redirected to a process conversation because process was the only thing he understood. He couldn&#39;t help us solve actual engineering problems so he reframed everything as a process problem.</p> <p>The worst part was the coaching sessions. He&#39;d pull engineers aside for one-on-ones and ask things like &quot;what impediments are blocking your growth?&quot; Senior engineers with 15 years experience being coached on how to work by someone who didn&#39;t understand what they did.</p> <p>He had the certifications though. CSM, SAFe SPC, ICF-ACC, ICP-ATF. Alphabet soup that cost thousands of dollars and required zero technical knowledge to obtain.</p> <p>His retrospectives were textbook perfect. Sticky notes, dot voting, action items documented in Confluence. The action items were always process changes. Never technical improvements. Because he couldn&#39;t evaluate whether a technical suggestion was good or garbage. So he stuck to what he knew. Move the cards differently. Change the ceremony format, add another meeting.</p> <p>When we had a production incident that took the team 14 hours to resolve he facilitated a blameless postmortem the next day. Good practice right? Except he kept steering the conversation toward &quot;how can we improve our incident process&quot; when the actual root cause was technical debt in a service nobody wanted to touch. The team knew this. He didn&#39;t understand the technical explanation so he summarized it as &quot;legacy system challenges&quot; and moved on to discuss on-call rotation improvements.</p> <p>We could have hired a senior engineer for that $150k. Someone who could actually unblock developers. Someone who could look at the code and say &quot;this architecture won&#39;t scale, here&#39;s why.&quot; Someone who could pair with juniors on hard problems instead of asking them about their impediments.</p> <p>Instead we got a professional meeting facilitator with an Agile title who made engineers feel like their technical expertise mattered less than the process around it.</p> <p>He was a good person. Genuinely trying to help. But the role itself is broken when it puts non-technical people in charge of making technical teams more effective.</p> <p>How do you coach a team when you can&#39;t evaluate whether their technical decisions are sound? You default to process, every time.</p> <p>Anyone else dealt with Agile coaches who had zero engineering background? How did that work out?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/agileliecom\"> /u/agileliecom </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://agilelie.com/blog/agile-coach-never-wrote-code?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=post3_agile_coach\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1qxj28i/our_agile_coachs_answer_to_every_technical/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Do I really need to master the entire Rust syntax?</strong> I asked a friend, and they advised against it. They suggested I stick to the basics and learn strictly what I need, claiming that &quot;no one except the compiler actually knows the entire syntax.&quot; Is this true?</p> <p><strong>2. Should I learn Async Rust right now?</strong> How difficult is Async Rust really, and what exactly makes it challenging? Are there specific examples of the &quot;hard parts&quot;?</p> <p>Honestly, I’m not intimidated by the difficulty. When I first started learning Rust, many people warned me it was hard. In my experience, it wasn&#39;t necessarily &quot;hard&quot;—it was just complex because I hadn&#39;t tried those programming paradigms before.

For example, if your first service adds a <code>use_beta_feature</code> flag, you don&#39;t have to add logic to parse and re-attach this flag to each API call in the service. Instead, it will be propagated across all downstream services via auto-instrumentation, and whichever service needs it can parse, modify and/or use the value.</p> <p>I&#39;d love to discuss and understand your experience with OTel baggage or other aspects you found that maybe weren&#39;t as well-discussed as some of the others.</p> <p>Any suggestions or feedback would be much appreciated, thanks for your time!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/silksong_when\"> /u/silksong_when </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://signoz.io/blog/otel-baggage/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1qxcqmc/how_opentelemetry_baggage_enables_global_context/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Storing a graph with 100 billion edges requires 800 GB of memory. Just for the 64-bit large integer IDs. Before a single feature is loaded.</p> <p>That is the reality of industrial-scale Graph Neural Networks. And it is exactly why most GNN research never reaches production.</p> <p>Snapchat built a framework called GiGL (Gigantic Graph Learning) that runs GNNs on graphs with 900 million nodes and 16.8 billion edges. End-to-end, in under 12 hours and every day.</p> <h1>The gap between research and production is not the model. It is the plumbing.</h1> <p>PyTorch Geometric (PyG) is the most popular GNN library in academia. It has excellent layer implementations, an active community, and clean APIs.</p> <p>Modern PyG (2.0+) is no longer limited to single-machine training. It offers NeighborLoader and ClusterLoader for mini-batch training on subgraphs, FeatureStore and GraphStore abstractions for out-of-core data (e.g., via RocksDB or Kuzu), and distributed training support via PyTorch DDP. These are real capabilities. The <em>ogbn-papers100M</em> benchmark (100M nodes, 2.5B edges) has been trained using PyG with disk-backed remote backends.</p> <p>The gap is not in modelling primitives. It is in everything around them.</p> <p>Snapchat&#39;s friend graph has 900 million nodes and 16.8 billion edges, with 249 node features and 19 edge features. Running GNNs at this scale daily requires orchestrated, distributed data preprocessing from relational databases, billion-scale subgraph sampling as a managed Spark job, globally consistent train/val/test splits, fault-tolerant multi-node training, parallel inference across hundreds of workers, and automated pipeline scheduling. PyG provides none of this infrastructure. Nor should it. That is not its job.</p> <p>GiGL does not replace PyG. It wraps it. You define your GAT or GraphSAGE model in standard PyG syntax and handle everything else with GiGL.</p> <p>For example, treat subgraph sampling as a massive ETL job (e.g. Apache Spark on Scala), not a real-time graph traversal. Pre-compute every node&#39;s k-hop neighbourhood to cloud storage. Then training becomes standard data-parallel ML. Without a shared graph state and a distributed graph engine during training.</p> <p>Snapchat calls this approach &quot;<em>tabularization</em>&quot;. They claim that it reduced costs by 80% compared to their previous Apache Beam implementation.</p> <h1>The GiGL architecture is composed of six components</h1> <p>GiGL is a pipeline, not a library, where six components execute sequentially, each with independent horizontal scaling:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Config Populator:</strong> resolves template configs into frozen configs with deterministic asset URIs. This makes every downstream component idempotent and retryable.</li> <li><strong>Data Preprocessor:</strong> TensorFlow Transform on Apache Beam (Cloud Dataflow). Reads raw relational data from BigQuery, enumerates node IDs to contiguous integers, and applies distributed feature transforms (normalisation, encoding, imputation). Outputs TFRecords.</li> <li><strong>Subgraph Sampler:</strong> Apache Spark on Scala (Dataproc). Generates k-hop localised subgraphs for each node via repeated joins on edge lists. For link prediction, it also samples anchor, positive, and negative node subgraphs. Two backends: Pure-ETL for homogeneous graphs and NebulaGraph for heterogeneous graphs.</li> <li><strong>Split Generator:</strong> Spark on Scala. Assigns samples to train/val/test with transductive, inductive, or custom strategies. It masks validation/test edges from training to prevent leakage.</li> <li><strong>Trainer:</strong> PyTorch DDP on Vertex AI or Kubernetes. Collates subgraph samples into batch subgraphs and feeds them into user-defined PyG training loops. Supports early stopping, TensorBoard logging, and custom loss functions.</li> <li><strong>Inferencer:</strong> Apache Beam on Cloud Dataflow. Embarrassingly parallel CPU inference across all nodes. Writes embeddings to BigQuery. Un-enumerates node IDs back to original identifiers.</li> </ol> <p>Orchestration runs on Kubeflow Pipelines or Vertex AI. The frozen config design lets you rerun the Trainer 50 times for hyperparameter tuning without rerunning the Subgraph Sampler. That saves hours of computation per iteration.</p> <h1>What Snapchat actually learned from its 35 production launches</h1> <p>The paper (see sources, below) is transparent about what worked, what failed, and by how much. Three patterns stand out.</p> <h1>Pattern 1: Graph quality beats model complexity.</h1> <p>Snapchat&#39;s first GNN used GraphSAGE on the friendship graph. Solid +10% lift in new friends made.</p> <p>Then they switched the graph definition from &quot;<em>who is friends with whom</em>&quot; to &quot;<em>who recently interacted with whom</em>&quot; (the engagement graph). They used the same model but built a new graph. The result was an additional 8.9% improvement and a significant cost reduction because the engagement graph is sparser.</p> <p>One feature normalisation step on the content recommendation graph improved MRR from 0.39 to 0.54. A 38% relative improvement from a single preprocessing decision.</p> <p>The lesson: <strong>before you touch the model architecture, fix the graph and the features.</strong></p> <h1>Pattern 2: Attention-based GNNs dominate on social graphs.</h1> <p>Snapchat systematically tested all PyG convolution layers available at the time. GAT consistently outperformed mean and sum aggregation. Their hypothesis is that social networks follow scale-free degree distributions because not all neighbours contribute equally. Attention learns to weight strong-engagement relationships over weak ones.</p> <p>The upgrade from GraphSAGE to GAT delivered a +6.5% improvement in core friend recommendation metrics.</p> <h1>Pattern 3: How you query matters as much as what you embed.</h1> <p>Snapchat initially used each user&#39;s own GNN embedding as the ANN query for friend retrieval. It is a standard approach.</p> <p>Then they tried querying with the embeddings of a user&#39;s existing friends instead. They call this &quot;Stochastic EBR&quot;. It broadened the candidate search space and captured richer social signals.</p> <p>The result? +10.2% and +13.9% on core business metrics. <strong>It became the default retrieval scheme for friend recommendation at Snapchat.</strong></p> <p>They did no model change and no retraining. Just a different query strategy over the same embeddings.</p> <h1>The recommendation system</h1> <p>Every recommendation system with relational data is a graph problem in disguise. Users, items, interactions, context. Nodes and edges.</p> <p>Snapchat demonstrates this across three domains:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Friend recommendation:</strong> user-user engagement graph. GNN embeddings feed the largest retrieval funnel via ANN search, and also serve as dense features in the ranking model.</li> <li><strong>Content recommendation (Spotlight, Discover):</strong> user-video bipartite graph. Video-to-video co-engagement graph sparsified by Jaccard thresholding. GNN embeddings power video-to-video and user-to-video EBR. Launch impact: +1.54% total time spent on Spotlight.</li> <li><strong>Ads recommendation:</strong> product co-engagement graph with text/image embeddings and metadata as node features. With only 10% of the training data volume used by the control shallow-embedding model, GiGL&#39;s 2-layer GAT achieved precision parity while improving recall by 27.6%.</li> </ol> <p>The recurring pattern: GNN embeddings add the most value in the retrieval stage (embedding-based dense retrieval) and as auxiliary features in rankers. Topology information improves even precision-focused models that were not designed to use graph structure.</p> <h1>When GiGL makes sense and when it does not</h1> <p>GiGL and PyG operate at different abstraction layers. PyG is a modelling library, while GiGL is a production pipeline that uses PyG inside the Trainer.</p> <p>Use GiGL when your graph has billions of edges, when you need daily batch inference, and you are on GCP. The framework assumes the use of Dataflow, Dataproc, Vertex AI, BigQuery, and GCS.</p> <p>Use standalone PyG when you need fast iteration, full control over the training loop, or when PyG&#39;s built-in scalability features (NeighborLoader, remote backends, distributed training) meet your infrastructure and scaling requirements. For graphs up to a few billion edges with the right hardware and out-of-core backends, standalone PyG can take you further than it could a few years ago.</p> <p>Use AWS GraphStorm when you need SageMaker-native deployment, built-in BERT+GNN co-training for text-rich graphs, or zero-code CLI pipelines.</p> <h1>The uncomfortable truth about GNNs at scale</h1> <p>Most of the value Snapchat derived from GNNs came from decisions unrelated to novel architectures: better graph definitions, feature normalisation, loss function selection, and retrieval query strategies.</p> <p>The framework&#39;s job is <strong>to make those experiments fast and cheap at a billion scale</strong>. GiGL does that by turning graph sampling into an ETL problem and training into standard data-parallel ML.</p> <p>Snapchat completed 35+ production launches in two years across three business domains, with measurable lift in every metric.</p> <p>Sources:</p> <ul> <li>GiGL: Large-Scale Graph Neural Networks at Snapchat: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.15054\">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.15054</a></li> <li>Gigantic Graph Learning (GiGL), GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/Snapchat/GiGL/tree/main\">https://github.com/Snapchat/GiGL/tree/main</a></li> <li>The GiGL Architecture: <a href=\"https://snapchat.github.io/GiGL/docs/user_guide/overview/architecture.html\">https://snapchat.github.io/GiGL/docs/user_guide/overview/architecture.html</a></li> <li>PyTorch Geometric (PyG): <a href=\"https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric\">https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric</a></li> </ul> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/mmark92712\"> /u/mmark92712 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1qxcfmt/r_snapchats_recommendation_system_had_a_scaling/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1qxcfmt/r_snapchats_recommendation_system_had_a_scaling/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Orbitiny Desktop, a Qt/C++ based desktop full of <em>real</em> innovations has seen a new release - Orbitiny Desktop Pilot 9. Orbitiny Desktop is a new Qt/C++ desktop environment for Linux built from the ground up using Qt and coded in C++, bringing you <em>exclusive features</em> and functionalities <em>unavailable in other desktop environments</em>.</p> <p>These features include: <em>desktop gestures</em>, <em>icon emblems</em> for files on the clipboard (cut or copied), <em>icon emblems</em> for <em>new</em> and <em>modified</em> files, <em>icon emblems</em> for empty files and directories, <em>multi-paste</em> support, (pasting to multiple selected directories), <em>dedicated icons</em> for mounted and user account home directories, <em>custom desktop directories</em>, <em>individual desktop directory per monitor</em>, <em>individual desktop directory per virtual desktop</em> and a lot more!</p> <p>With the release of Pilot 9, the tradition of innovation <strong>continues</strong> and it&#39;s bringing you 4 additional unconventional but <strong>productive</strong> functionalities that you don&#39;t get to see in other desktops.</p> <h1>1.0 Pilot 9 - Release Notes:</h1> <h1>New Exclusive Features:</h1> <ul> <li><strong>New &amp; Orbitiny Exclusive</strong>: Added an &quot;<strong>Append to Clipboard</strong>&quot; option to the right-click context menus. This feature appends the selected file path(s) to the existing ones on the clipboard. If no files are set on the clipboard, it will set them. <em>So, to make it clear</em>, it does <em>not</em> replace the existing files already set on the clipboard. That one is done when you select &quot;Copy&quot;. &quot;<strong>Append to Clipboard</strong>&quot; <em>appends</em> additional file paths to the existing ones already set on the clipboard and then when you select &quot;Paste&quot;, it just pastes all of them. So unlike selecting &quot;Copy&quot; which overwrites previous file paths, &quot;<strong>Append to Clipboard</strong>&quot; appends the file paths. If no file paths exist, it will set them.</li> <li><strong>New &amp; Orbitiny Exclusive</strong>: Added &quot;<strong>Paste to Image</strong>&quot; option to the right-click context menus. This feature appends (vertically) the clipboard pixmap or the file path if it is an image file to the one selected. So it&#39;s like the &quot;<strong>Paste to File</strong>&quot; option where text context from the clipboard gets pasted into the file (seen first in Orbitiny&#39;s initial Pilot 1 Release) but now this functionality is extended and applied to images as well.</li> <li><strong>New &amp; Orbitiny Exclusive</strong>: Added an &quot;<strong>Add to Paste Basket</strong>&quot; + &quot;<strong>Paste to Basket</strong>&quot; options in the right-click context menus. It adds the selected file path(s) to the <strong>Paste Basket</strong>. The <strong>Paste Basket</strong> is a set of destination directories. When you select &quot;<strong>Paste to Paste Basket</strong>&quot;, the file paths currently on the clipboard will be pasted to each of those directories. If you have selected a mix of directories and non directories only the directories will be added to the &quot;<strong>Paste Basket</strong>&quot;.</li> <li><strong>New &amp; Orbitiny Exclusive</strong>: Added &quot;<strong>Image Join</strong>&quot; - Drag one (or more) image files onto another image file and you get an image join menu: &quot;<strong>Join Images Vertically</strong>&quot; and &quot;<strong>Join Images Horizontally</strong>&quot;. Each of the dragged image file will be appended to the target file.</li> </ul> <h1>New Applications / Programs:</h1> <ul> <li><strong>New</strong>: Created <strong>Orbitiny Screen/Monitor Configuration</strong> utility to configure and rearrange your monitor positions and screen resolutions (portable and can be used on any desktop environment)</li> <li><strong>New</strong>: Created <strong>Orbitiny Desktop Monitor Brightness Control</strong> utility to control your screen brightness on any of your screens (portable and can be used from any desktop environment)</li> <li><strong>New</strong>: Created a screenshot capturing utility called: <strong>orbitiny-screenshot-grabber</strong>. Usage: <strong>orbitiny-screenshot-grabber</strong> <strong>/path/to/dir/to/save/screenshot/in</strong> or if left blank, it will be saved in <strong>$HOME/Pictures/Screenshots/</strong>. A subdirectory called <strong>orbitiny-screenshot-grabber</strong> will be created and all file names will be generated automatically in sequential order: 00.png, 01.png, 02.png etc (portable and can be used from any desktop environment).</li> <li><strong>New</strong>: Converted the <strong>Orbitiny File Copier</strong> into a separate application so now you can invoke it from scripts and this means you can tell it to copy multiple files and directories to multiple destinations and have a progress bar (portable and can be used from any desktop environment).</li> <li><strong>New</strong>: Converted the <strong>Orbitiny File Properties</strong> dialog into a separate application so now you can invoke it from scripts and this means you can pass it a file and it will show you the file properties for that file (portable and can be used from any desktop environment).</li> </ul> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/1thy6fk61rhg1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=695728f714c8878ef188ef41952765e047939798\">https://preview.redd.it/1thy6fk61rhg1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=695728f714c8878ef188ef41952765e047939798</a></p> <h1>New Standard Features:</h1> <ul> <li><strong>New</strong>: Added a toggle/view button to Control Panel to switch between a list view and icon view</li> <li><strong>New</strong>: Added Web Browser URL Drag&amp;Drop support to the panel - it allows you to drag URLs from a web browser window to the panel and when so, a launcher button on the panel gets created and when clicked, it takes you to that URL. Note, as it stands, the URL opens in the first detected web browser but soon I will create an option to select the default web browser to use.</li> <li><strong>New</strong>: Removed root run restrictions</li> <li><strong>New</strong>: (Feature Request): Added support for launching items by pressing the Enter/Return key. Supported applets: Application Menu, Drawer menu, Places Menu.</li> <li><strong>New</strong>: (Feature Request): Added support for selecting a search item automatically and then launching it when pressing the Enter key. Supported applets: Application Menu, Drawer menu, Places Menu.</li> <li><strong>New</strong>: (Feature Request): Added &quot;Run as Root&quot; option in &quot;<strong>Launcher</strong>&quot;, &quot;<strong>Quick Launch</strong>&quot; and &quot;<strong>Drawer</strong>&quot; applets.</li> <li><strong>New</strong>: Created a Coconut-style coloring to Qutiny&#39;s (Orbitiny&#39;s File Browser) context menus</li> </ul> <h1>Qt / Library Framework Updates:</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Qt</strong>: Ported the entire project to Qt 6.10.1 from Qt 5.15.2 so now Orbitiny is <strong>fully</strong> <em>up to date</em> and eventually I will be moving to <strong>cmake</strong>.</li> </ul> <h1>Enhancements:</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Enhancement</strong>: Improved X11/Window Buttons <strong>Drag&amp;Drop</strong> functionality</li> <li><strong>Enhancement</strong>: Cosmetic changes done to the glass-based themes for the desktop context menus - they are now rounder along with other additional tweaks (Acrylic/frosty themes are planned to be implemented soon so that will be a complete revamp)</li> <li><strong>Enhancement</strong>: Restored the &quot;<strong>Applets</strong>&quot; submenu in the panel&#39;s right-click context menu so this way you can either add applets via the original way or via the global Preferences dialog</li> <li><strong>Enhancement</strong>: Decreased the number of annoying messages popping up on the screen when something does not seem right but it gets fixed after OK is pressed. Now, you will only see the message if the issue does not actually get resolved</li> <li><strong>Enhancement</strong>: Set the default waiting/delay time for the panel to display a tooltip to 3 seconds. Initially, it looked like tooltips weren&#39;t working when you hover over the applet when they actually do but due to incorrect configuration of the timing for the tooltip to appear, it looked like it does not work when in fact it does, it&#39;s just that the delay wait time was too long.</li> <li><strong>Enhancement</strong>: Brightened up default icons text color on the desktop. Drop-shadow effect looks even better now.</li> <li><strong>Enhancement</strong>: Enabled &quot;<strong>Linux System</strong>&quot;, &quot;<strong>Disks</strong>&quot; and &quot;<strong>Trash</strong>&quot; icons by default. These should have been enabled by default in Pilot 8 but they were not.</li> <li><strong>Enhancement</strong>: Renamed the Orbitiny process guard that watches over the orbitiny-desktop and orbitiny-panel processes for crashes from process-sentinel to <strong>orbitiny-process-sentinel</strong> so if you want to force-end the <strong>orbitiny-desktop</strong> or <strong>orbitiny-panel processes</strong>, you must first end the watcher itself: &quot;<strong>orbitiny-process-sentinel</strong>&quot; and then end the others. If you don&#39;t do that, the <strong>orbitiny-process-sentinel</strong> process will restart them because it is an infinite loop unless the exit code of the process being watched is 0. When you gracefully exit either the panel, or the desktop, they return an EXIT_SUCCESS (0) code so the infinite loops ends and the process being watched won&#39;t be restarted.</li> <li><strong>Enhancement</strong>: Added a toast message to let you know that the session is being exited when &quot;Exit&quot; is selected from the panel.</li> <li><strong>Enhancement</strong>: Added toast messages when launching files - this is some nice visual feedback to let you know that your request has been acknowledged. This is contrary to other desktops where when you click a file, <em>nothing</em> happens. Click, click, click again, nada, nothing. You don&#39;t know if the file-click got processed or whether something happened at all.</li> </ul> <h1>Website</h1> <p><a href=\"https://orbitiny.com\">https://orbitiny.com</a> is now live and all updates will be posted there. I will be creating community forums and migrating the source code repo from Gitea to <a href=\"http://orbitiny.com\"><strong>orbitiny.com</strong></a> but that will happen a little later. So yes this means I will be installing a <strong>Gitea</strong> instance on my own but for the time being, <a href=\"http://Gitea.com\">Gitea.com</a> will do.</p> <h1>Bug Fixes:</h1> <p>This log includes all the bug fixes since Pilot 8:</p> <ul> <li><strong>BugFix</strong>: Fixed an issue with the right-click desktop context menu sometimes not popping up at the first attempt and sometimes the second.</li> <li><strong>BugFix</strong>: Fixed a Drag&amp;Drop issue with the Quick Launch applet</li> <li><strong>BugFix</strong>: Fixed &quot;Run in Terminal&quot; option not obeyed when set in panel&#39;s applets options. Note: you can force-run any command in terminal by holding the Alt key (if the Alt key isn&#39;t taken by your window manager)</li> <li><strong>BugFix</strong>: Fixed a white dot appearing when you right click the desktop to bring up the desktop context menu</li> <li><strong>BugFix</strong>: Fixed the dashboard not showing full screen in multi-monitor setup and also going to the wrong screen 300msn (sharp) after it is shown.</li> <li><strong>BugFix</strong>: Fixed an issue with applet rearrangement intermittently not working on the panel</li> <li><strong>BugFix</strong>: Fixed a crashing bug when you try to access the properties of the Separator applet on the panel</li> <li><strong>BugFix</strong>: Fixed a panel crash when the panel is launched on a system whose monitor count is lower than the number of panels per monitor count which is saved in panel&#39;s settings.</li> <li><strong>BugFix</strong>: Fixed additional panel positioning bugs (significant fixes)</li> <li><strong>BugFix</strong>: Fixed a file selection bug with the file manager. When you navigate Up, the directory name in the upper level directory should get reselected and visually it does appear to get reselected but it is actually not and clicking on it still won&#39;t select it. The work-around is to select a different file and then reselect it again. This is now all fixed.</li> <li><strong>BugFix</strong>: Fixed another file manager crash when the up arrow is clicked in succession</li> <li><strong>BugFix</strong>: Fixed gesture trail not showing on the desktop even when turned on.</li> <li><strong>BugFix</strong>: Fixed Orbitiny Desktop not exiting properly when run in portable mode (this bug only existed in portable mode, system-wide mode worked fine).</li> <li><strong>BugFix</strong>: Fixed Qutiny (The Orbitiny File Manager) crashing when clicking the &quot;Navigate Up&quot; arrow on the toolbar repeatedly in succession.</li> <li><strong>BugFix</strong>: Fixed theme selection in Control Panel-&gt;Appearance not working (and the Appearance app crashing).</li> <li><strong>BugFix</strong>: Fixed Unintentional context menu item dragging when you meant to click on the item instead.</li> <li><strong>BugFix</strong>: Fixed Orbitiny-Panel positioning bugs (going to the wrong screen etc)</li> <li><strong>BugFix</strong>: Fixed Qutinty (File Browser) crashing bug when navigating. This got introduced in Pilot 8 while trying to fix another bug. Pilot 8B has both of them fixed.</li> <li><strong>BugFix</strong>: When you Drag&amp;Drop a file to the panel, if the active icon theme currently does not have an icon pixmap associated for that file type, there won&#39;t be a launcher icon displayed (it will be blank). I have now fixed that and added a default fall-back icon in case the icon theme does not provide the icon pixmap. So you will never have a blank icon anymore.</li> <li><strong>BugFix</strong>: Fixed an installation issue on some systems depending on the system&#39;s configuration</li> <li><strong>BugFix</strong>: Fixed an unintentional session-quit - intermittently, the desktop window would gracefully exit (not crash) upon double-clicking on a desktop directory.</li> <li><strong>BugFix</strong>: Fixed an unintentional and intermittent session-quit with the panel too but this one only occurred after a system-boot when Orbitiny first starts.</li> </ul> <p>Are there more bugs? Probably...Yes, if you report them to me, I will fix them.</p> <p>Also, frosty / acrylic windows like the ones you see elsewhere are coming.</p> <p>The best is yet to come.</p> <p>Project website: <a href=\"https://orbitiny.com\">https://orbitiny.com</a></p> <p>Subreddit: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Orbitiny/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/Orbitiny/</a></p> <p>YouTube: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@Orbitiny-Linux\">https://www.youtube.com/@Orbitiny-Linux</a></p> <p>Source code: <a href=\"https://gitea.com/sasko.usinov/orbitiny-desktop\">https://gitea.com/sasko.usinov/orbitiny-desktop</a> (As usual, Pilot 9 code will be ready in a few hours from this post)</p> <p>Download: <a href=\"https://sourceforge.net/projects/orbitiny-desktop/\">https://sourceforge.net/projects/orbitiny-desktop/</a></p> <p>I just want to mention again, if you find something does not operate as described here, you need to tell me so I can fix it. People that have communicated with me know that I am very responsive, I respond to user reports, requests etc. At the same time, I ask for understanding, this is a large project and it is very tough managing it all by myself but nonetheless, I can do it.</p> <p>P.S Orbitiny Desktop was started in 2017 with a blank form/widget. It now has over 50 components.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/sash-au\"> /u/sash-au </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1qwzdqk/orbitiny_desktop_pilot_9_released_another_super/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1qwzdqk/orbitiny_desktop_pilot_9_released_another_super/\">[comments]</a></span>",

It provides focused tooling for Crossplane workflows instead of generic Kubernetes resources, letting you see the things that matter without piecing them together manually.</p> <h1>Key Features</h1> <p>Crossview already delivers significant capabilities out of the box:</p> <ul> <li>Real‑Time Resource Watching — Monitor any Kubernetes resource with live updates via Kubernetes informers and WebSockets.</li> <li>Multi‑Cluster Support — Manage and switch between multiple Kubernetes contexts seamlessly from a single interface.</li> <li>Resource Visualization — Browse and visualize Crossplane resources, including providers, XRDs, compositions, claims, and more.</li> <li>Resource Details — View comprehensive information like status conditions, metadata, events, and relationships for each resource.</li> <li>Authentication &amp; Authorization — Support for OIDC and SAML authentication, integrating with identity providers such as Auth0, Okta, Azure AD, and others.</li> <li>High‑Performance Backend — Built with Go using the Gin framework for optimal performance and efficient API interactions.</li> </ul> <p>Crossview already gives you a <em>true visual control plane</em> experience tailored for Crossplane — so you don’t have to translate mental models into YAML every time you want to answer a question about infrastructure state.</p> <h1>Why We Built It</h1> <p>Crossplane is powerful, but its abstraction can make day‑to‑day operations harder than they should be.</p> <p>Simple questions like:</p> <ul> <li>Why is this composite not ready?</li> <li>Which managed resource failed?</li> <li>What does this claim actually create?</li> </ul> <p>often require jumping between multiple commands and outputs.</p> <p>Crossview reduces that cognitive load and makes the control plane easier to operate and reason about.</p> <h1>Who Is It For?</h1> <p>Crossview is useful for:</p> <ul> <li>Platform engineers running Crossplane in production</li> <li>Teams onboarding users to platforms built on Crossplane</li> <li>Anyone who wants better visibility into Crossplane‑managed infrastructure</li> </ul> <p>If you’ve ever felt blind while debugging Crossplane, Crossview is built for you.</p> <h1>Open Source and Community‑Driven</h1> <p>Crossview is fully open source, and community feedback plays a big role in shaping the project.</p> <ul> <li>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/corpobit/crossview\">https://github.com/corpobit/crossview</a></li> <li>Docs and Helm charts are available via the repo and Artifact Hub.</li> </ul> <p>Feedback, issues, and contributions are all welcome.</p> <h1>Final Thoughts</h1> <p>The goal of Crossview is simple: make Crossplane infrastructure <strong>visible, understandable, and easier to operate</strong>. It already ships with real‑time watching, multi‑cluster support, rich resource details, and modern authentication integrations — giving you a dashboard that truly complements CLI workflows.</p> <p>If you’re using Crossplane, I’d love to hear:</p> <ul> <li>What’s the hardest part to debug today?</li> <li>What visibility do you wish you had?</li> </ul> <p>Let’s improve the Crossplane experience together.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/AppleAcrobatic6389\"> /u/AppleAcrobatic6389 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1qwx25o/crossview_finally_seeing_whats_really_happening/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1qwx25o/crossview_finally_seeing_whats_really_happening/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Signed integers are used instead of unsigned integers + sign bit in order to support negative decimals in a transparent and zero-cost fashion.</p> <p>I like, in particular, the exact precision and compile-time static guarantees. For example, the product <code>12.34 * 0.2 = 2.468</code> has <code>2 + 1 = 3</code> fractional base-10 digits. This is expressed as follows:</p> <pre><code>let a: Decimal&lt;2&gt; = &quot;12.34&quot;.parse().unwrap(); let b: Decimal&lt;1&gt; = &quot;0.2&quot;.parse().unwrap(); let c: Decimal&lt;3&gt; = dec::mul(a, b); assert_eq!(c.to_string(), &quot;2.468&quot;); </code></pre> <p>The compiler verifies with const generics and const asserts that <code>c</code> has exactly 3 fractional digits, i.e., <code>let c: Decimal&lt;2&gt; = ...</code> does not compile and neither does <code>let c: Decimal&lt;3&gt;</code>. Similarly, the addition of <code>L</code>-digit and <code>R</code>-digit fractional decimals produces sum with <code>L+R</code>-digit fractional.</p> <p>Divisions are more tricky. The code accepts the number of fraction digits wanted in the output (quotient). The quotient is rounded down (i.e., towards zero) by default. Different rounding modes require that the user calculates the division with 1 extra digit accuracy and then calls <code>Decimal::round()</code> with the desired rounding mode (<code>Up</code>/<code>Down</code> away/towards zero, Floor/Ceil towards -∞/+∞ infinity, or <code>HalfUp</code>/<code>HalfDown</code> towards nearest neighbour with ties away/towards zero).</p> <p>Finally, let&#39;s take a peek of multiplication implementation details:</p> <pre><code>/// Multiply L-digit &amp; R-digit decimals, return O-digit product. /// /// Requirement: `O = L + R` (verified statically). pub fn checked_mul&lt;const O: u32, const L: u32, const R: u32&gt;( lhs: Decimal&lt;L&gt;, rhs: Decimal&lt;R&gt;, ) -&gt; Option&lt;Decimal&lt;O&gt;&gt; { const { assert!(O == L + R) }; let lhs = (lhs.0 as i128).checked_mul(10_i128.pow(R.saturating_sub(L)))?; let rhs = (rhs.0 as i128).checked_mul(10_i128.pow(L.saturating_sub(R)))?; Some(Decimal(lhs.checked_mul(rhs)?.try_into().ok()?)) } </code></pre> <p>This looks intimidatingly slow at first. First, the left-hand and right-hand sides are raised so that both of them have <code>O</code> fractional digits, that is, the desired output precision. However, the <code>.checked_mul()</code> operands raise 10 (the base number) to the power of something that depends only on const generic arguments. Thus, the compiler is able to evaluate the operands at compile time and eliminate at least one of the <code>.checked_mul()</code> calls. In fact, both of them are eliminated in the case <code>L == R == O</code> (i.e., the product as well as both multiplication operands have the same number of fractional digits).</p> <p>Obviously the code does not work in use-cases where the number of fractional digits is not known at compile time. Fortunately this is not the case in my application (financial programming) and I believe it is a rather rare use scenario.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/WishboneJolly9170\"> /u/WishboneJolly9170 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/resilar/2ebc21800b2c27d27a335c11659ce806\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1qww5e4/zerocost_fixedpoint_decimals_in_rust/\">[comments]</a></span>",

They made all the choices.</p> <p>After about 10 rounds, they were constantly laughing, debating which option to pick, and building on each other’s ideas. It felt much more like co-creating a world than listening to a story.</p> <p>When I told them it was bedtime, they didn’t want to stop. They kept asking what would happen next.</p> <p>A few observations that surprised me:</p> <p>Personalization seemed to matter more than anything else. Once it became their world, emotional investment was instant.</p> <p>Although I designed it as a single-player experience, co-play emerged naturally. The shared decision-making and social dynamic massively increased engagement.</p> <p>Both ages stayed fully engaged the whole time. I expected the younger one to drop off sooner, but the persistent world kept them both hooked.</p> <p>One issue I noticed: my “re-immersion” mechanic (an in-world character emotionally reconnecting players after breaks instead of a dry recap) triggered too frequently between consecutive rounds. The repetition was noticeable. This looks like a simple trigger tuning problem (should probably only fire after longer gaps).</p> <p>What I haven’t tested yet:</p> <p>– Whether kids can reconnect naturally after a real multi-hour break</p> <p>– Whether they can retell the story in a coherent way</p> <p>– Whether they’ll come back unprompted the next day</p> <p>The earlier stress tests showed that constraint mechanisms help keep long-running narratives technically coherent.</p> <p>What this small user test suggests is that coherence itself isn’t what kids consciously care about — but it seems to be the infrastructure that makes personalization, consequence, and agency feel real.</p> <p>Curious if others working on long-horizon agents, narrative systems, or co-creative AI have seen similar effects around personalization and persistence.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Distinct-Path659\"> /u/Distinct-Path659 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1qwo82n/early_user_test_of_a_persistent_ai_narrative/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1qwo82n/early_user_test_of_a_persistent_ai_narrative/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Today, I’m excited to share the engine that powers our data pipelines: Gremlin. Sending, storing, and receiving data is pointless if you can’t actually read it efficiently. Evaluating the performance of a complex system is difficult enough; adding the unpredictable choices made by third-party vendors creates an entirely new layer of complexity. That’s where Gremlin shines. We created Gremlin to solve a critical bottleneck we were facing: parsing overhead while working with high-frequency data. We needed a solution that allowed us to stop thinking about parsing costs entirely. We built it to be reliable - it does exactly what it promises with minimal overhead. In NormaCore, we use Gremlin in production to handle heavy data loads from our robotics fleet. It ensures that parsing is never the bottleneck in our pipeline. Key Features: - High Efficiency: Features lazy decoding and zero-copy reading. - Developer Friendly: Null-safe getters and pure Go code generation (no protoc required). - Compatibility: Fully compatible with Google Protobuf definitions. Seeing is believing - we’d love for you to check it out </code></pre> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/abatsuev\"> /u/abatsuev </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://github.com/norma-core/norma-core/blob/main/shared/gremlin_go/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1qwmt2i/open_source_meet_gremlin_a_nononsense_data/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>",

The algorithm is original, and I think simpler; it has the advantage compared to <code>arc-swap</code> to be fully wait-free. But that&#39;s not all, the implementation is also <code>no_std</code> friendly, and more optimized (with a clear impact in ARM benchmarks). You will find a more detailed list of differences in the <a href=\"https://github.com/wyfo/hazarc\">dedicated README section</a>.</p> <p>There is of course a lot of unsafe code, and the crate is thus extensively tested with <code>miri</code> across many weak-memory model permutations. And I have to say that I love <code>miri</code> more than ever! It&#39;s so convenient to have such a tool in the Rust ecosystem. Though I was struggling to debug the (numerous) errors I encountered during the development, so I&#39;ve forked it to add an <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/miri/issues/2313#issuecomment-3791248768\">atomic operation tracer</a>. Next step will be to upstream the feature in good shape. By the way, I&#39;ve also applied my test suite to <code>arc-swap</code> and found some issues, including a <a href=\"https://github.com/vorner/arc-swap/issues/198\"><em>use-after-free</em></a>.</p> <p>Now, the question: why not simply contributing to <code>arc-swap</code>? - because I wanted to experiment on a new algorithm, so I would have ended up rewriting the whole code, without even taking into account other features like write policies or custom domains. - because I wanted to design the <code>Option</code> API differently, so it would have required a new major version anyway. - I wanted a no_std library quickly enough to test things. - and to be honest, the main reason is that I had a compulsive need to code, preferably a complex concurrent algorithm (I&#39;m exhausted by LLMs).</p> <p>But this decision is not settled. If everyone here tells me I was wrong, I will of course reconsider it. Anyway, because of the UAF, <code>arc-swap</code> will surely need to fix its algorithm, and the simpler solution might be to adapt <code>hazarc</code>&#39;s one. But <code>arc-swap</code> maintainers also wrote recently he doesn&#39;t have time for open-source anymore, so idk.</p> <p><em>No LLM was harmed during the process, except for my poor English written documentation.</em></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/wyf0\"> /u/wyf0 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1qvzzvg/announcing_hazarc_yet_another_atomicarc_but_faster/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1qvzzvg/announcing_hazarc_yet_another_atomicarc_but_faster/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>The Rust ecosystem is really cool, and somewhat well organised in a harmonized chaos of dependencies with the <a href=\"http://crates.io\">crates.io</a> platform. However, some projects like sudo-rs eliminates dependencies entirely. While the supply chain security arguments are valid, this philosophy has a hidden cost: it scatters security expertise and forces us back into the C-style era of reinventing the wheel for every project, and vendoring everything.</p> <p>Here is why the &quot;zero-dependency&quot; architecture is becoming a struggle, based on my recent PhD work with RootAsRole. This post isn’t about sudo-rs being wrong; it’s about my current thoughts and should be read like a blog post, more than a criticize. sudo-rs already know their issues (as long I do issues on their repo). RootAsRole and sudo-rs have different ambitions for different security needs. RootAsRole&#39;s aim is more on taking security latest security research outputs, while sudo aims for replacing current unsafe sudo tool and eliminating what was abandonned and setup a more restricted &quot;feature governance&quot; compared to the initial project. Now that my position is clarified, let&#39;s dive into the topic.</p> <h1>The sudo-rs Monolith</h1> <p>I recently read why sudo-rs decided to avoid dependencies. Their arguments didn&#39;t convince me. While security view is valid, their architectural choices create a barrier to reuse.</p> <p>The main issue with zero-dependency architecture is that it makes splitting a design into usable sub-crates a nightmare. When you bake everything into a single harmonious entity, you create a rigid monolith, very tightly linked to the final need, the sudo binary. While they aim for making subcrates, as long their current design only deserve their needs, making subcrates wouln&#39;t be meaningful, but only for them.</p> <p>For example, I wanted to use parts of sudo-rs for RootAsRole. I couldn&#39;t. I started an issue about that, years ago. For example, sudo-rs is mixing command execution with credentials management (setuid/gid) when executing a command, and it doesn&#39;t support the specific operations I need, such as Linux Capabilities management, Landlock features, or even my internal API needs, and everything must be done in a specific order or it won&#39;t work.<br/> And as long the project isn&#39;t designed as a collection of independent libraries (even if modules <em>feels</em> like independent, but it&#39;s not), I cannot use parts of the sudo-rs as a execution library. I am effectively blocked from using their security-critical code because their feature set is tightly coupled to their specific binary, and deconstructing this, is just a nightmare (and I didn&#39;t even talk about performance and scalability... which I need too).</p> <p>Instead of a battle-tested &quot;execution crate&quot; the community can improve, we have a sudo that no one else can craft with some parts of it.</p> <h1>The PAM Struggle</h1> <p>This isolationism leads to a second problem: when we <em>do</em> try to use libraries like I did on RootAsRole, they are often fragmented or unmaintained.</p> <p>I am currently struggling to manage PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) in Rust. I need a library with safe calls, Rust idiomatic approach, and feature completeness. I found nonstick, which looks well-designed and tested! It is a very recent crate, so I was maybe thinking that updates would arrive soon. Because, nonstick didn&#39;t manage open_session or set_credentials; important features for RootAsRole, I mean, my tool should comply better to PAM mindset, mainly because it is the only authentication module I implemented.</p> <p>Community is here to help. So, I implemented the changes myself and wanted to push them upstream. The project is hosted on a private Mercurial repository, which is nice for independence, I really encourage such approach. I emailed my changes. No response. Furthermore, the project lacks automated CI. For code interacting with low-level OS features, CI is non-negotiable, for notably testing across FreeBSD, Illumos, and Linux. Even if my RootAsRole project won&#39;t work for FreeBSD directly, I know that people do want to know that it works for this OS. And also in fact, I don&#39;t like the idea of not testing the code I produce. This is explaining why I keep a code coverage around 75%, and the remaining lines are mostly covered with integration tests.</p> <p>So, using external dependencies that are designed for everyone, is a constraint that will be a problem in the future, so...</p> <h1>Let&#39;s Fork!</h1> <p>I am left with one choice: Fork it. I am setting up a fork on GitLab (likely nonstick2) and provisioning a personal Runner for the CI matrix with FreeBSD, Illumos and Linux VMs auto-provisioning like a mini-Cloud testing and thus verifiable with badges (I love those things).</p> <p>Forking, implies a subtle detail: Debian Packaging. I am publishing RootAsRole to Debian. The package has been in the NEW queue for nearly 6 months due to the sheer volume of work facing the FTP team (they are doing incredible work and the waiting queue is being overwhelming) and my big vague of Rust missing dependencies to be packaged too.</p> <p>If I switch to my new fork (nonstick2), I add more venom to the loop: not updated packages (my current issue) --&gt; fork crates (my solution) --&gt; longer NEW queues (because everyone is doing my solution) --&gt; disincentive to fork --&gt; being more pushy on upstream --&gt; no update.</p> <p>And so, we end up in the initial loop.</p> <p>As a reminder for unaware readers, people <strong>do not have to answer you</strong>, and I hope that people is doing what they want in open-source community, and health is a priority. In fact concerning the PAM lib, I already did a dependency change because someone did a burn-out. That is not a problem for the community, we always find a solution for IT stuff, but those piles of bits won&#39;t give life back.</p> <p>Anyway, by taking months to get changes, the Debian 14 (in 2027) freeze is becoming somewhat a <em>short</em> deadline...</p> <h1>Bounded</h1> <p>So, We are in a bind. The sudo-rs approach avoids dependency hell by having no dependencies, but it fails to contribute reusable building blocks. While I appreciate their efforts over the years, our design difference makes it very tricky. Utilizing existing crates means navigating unmaintained repositories and incurring potentially upstreaming issues.</p> <p>These constraints force a cynical choice that is generally assumed in security: copy-paste code and &quot;reinvent the wheel&quot; to avoid the headache and justifying it as a <em>security</em> feature, which is in fact a partially false good reason (because we are in fact excluding dealing with humans in the equation). We are mimicking the C ecosystem (which, I must say, is in line of the sudo-rs initial objective); where every project implements its own string library.</p> <p>On top of that, by fragmenting the ecosystem with this copy-paste practice, we scatter security focus. Instead of one robust, community-audited PAM library (for the example of PAM), we end up with five independent forks where expertise is not focused anymore.</p> <h1>Then, What&#39;s next?</h1> <p>After my PAM fork, which I will maintain, I will focus my work on making signaling features which sudo-rs also wrote on their side, which I will in my turn copy-paste as long I do not have the workforce, alone, to make another such big thing correctly. And maybe in the future (which is very uncertain), I maybe will have a better knowledge on that point, proposing a new lib that is unifying our security expectations and needs.</p> <p>Instead of a bleak and uncertain conclusion, I prefer to empower more the community to make what Rust is in its own essence : implementing modern solutions for old problems.</p> <ol> <li>How do we create reusable, security-critical crates without such dependency bind?</li> <li>As, long I am doing it in my free-time today, what governance or funding model would make this viable?</li> </ol> <p><strong>P.S.</strong> I recently defended my PhD, and I thanked the Rust community in my manuscript :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/LeChatP\"> /u/LeChatP </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1qvzcbj/zero_dependencies_sounds_great_until_you_try_to/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1qvzcbj/zero_dependencies_sounds_great_until_you_try_to/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I will continue maintaining this but future direction will likely be based on user asks.</p> <p><strong>What is Gryph?</strong></p> <p>AI coding agent audit trail tool. Simply put, <code>gryph</code> installs itself as hooks in supported AI coding agents. Logs all events to local SQLite database. Provides an awesome (hopefully) query interface.</p> <p><strong>Why build this?</strong></p> <p>We love AI coding agents. But we are scared of them as well.</p> <p>Tribal knowledge tells me that security starts with inventory and visibility. So I wanted a way to track every action executed by various coding agents that I have in my workflow.</p> <p>Thats where Gryph comes in. Installs agent specific hooks to get into the coding agent loop. Translates agent specific event schema into a common format. Stores in local SQLite database.</p> <p><strong>Stack:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Go 1.25</li> <li>SQLite for local storage (no external dependencies)</li> <li>Cobra for CLI</li> <li>GoReleaser for cross-platform builds</li> </ul> <p><strong>How to use?</strong></p> <pre><code>$ gryph install # Hooks into detected agents $ gryph logs -f # Stream events in real-time $ gryph query --file &quot;*.go&quot; --action file_write --since &quot;1d&quot; </code></pre> <p><strong>Supported Agents</strong></p> <ul> <li>Claude Code</li> <li>Cursor</li> <li>Gemini CLI</li> <li>OpenCode</li> <li>Windsurf</li> </ul> <p><strong>Other Key Features</strong></p> <ul> <li>Comes with an in-built TUI for live logs and stats</li> <li>Live logs tailing</li> <li>Configurable log levels and privacy settings to avoid logging sensitive data</li> <li>In-built security evaluator for policy based guardrails (future)</li> </ul> <p><strong>Project</strong></p> <p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/safedep/gryph\">https://github.com/safedep/gryph</a></p> <p>Would appreciate feedback from anyone using AI coding tools.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/N1ghtCod3r\"> /u/N1ghtCod3r </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://github.com/safedep/gryph\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1qvxgru/gryph_audit_trail_for_ai_coding_agents_built_with/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>",

I ended up with four things: persistence (some internal state that carries over time), variability (the ability to change that state), agency (actions that come from it), and gates like reward and punishment that shape what gets reinforced. What surprised me is that once you have these four, something like a “self” seems to show up without ever being built explicitly. In humans, the self doesn’t look like a basic ingredient. It looks more like a by-product of systems that had to survive by inferring causes, assigning credit, and acting under uncertainty. Over time, that pressure seems to have pushed internal models to include the organism itself as a causal source.</p> <p>I tried using reinforcement learning as a way to check mark this idea. Survival lines up pretty cleanly with reward, and evolution with optimization, but looking at standard RL makes the gaps kinda obvious. Most RL agents don’t need anything like a self-model because they’re never really forced to build one. They get by with local credit assignment and task-specific policies. As long as the environment stays fixed, that’s enough. Nothing really pushes them to treat themselves as a changing cause in the world, which makes RL a useful reference point, but also highlights what it leaves out.</p> <p>If artificial consciousness is possible at all, it probably comes from systems where those four conditions can’t be avoided: long-term persistence, continual change, agency that feeds back into future states, and value signals that actually shape the internal model. In that case, the self wouldn’t be something you design up front. It would just fall out of the dynamics, similar to how it seems to have happened in biological systems.</p> <p>I’m curious whether people think a self really can emerge this way, or if it has to be explicitly represented.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Solid-Carrot-2135\"> /u/Solid-Carrot-2135 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1qvwb9k/some_thoughts_on_consciousness_learning_and_the/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1qvwb9k/some_thoughts_on_consciousness_learning_and_the/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Instead of ReLU the activation function is just <strong>sort</strong>.</p> <p>However I found that I get better results when after sorting I split the feature vector in half and pair every max rank with its corresponding min rank (symmetric pairing) and sum/average them. I called this function/module SortDC, because the sum of top-1 max and top-1 min is a difference of two convex functions = sum of convex and concave = Difference of Convex (DC).</p> <pre><code>class SortDC(nn.Module): &quot;&quot;&quot; Reduces dimension by half (2N -&gt; N). &quot;&quot;&quot; def forward(self, x): sorted_x, _ = torch.sort(x, dim=-1, descending=True) k = x.shape[-1] // 2 top_max = sorted_x[..., :k] top_min = torch.flip(sorted_x[..., -k:], dims=[-1]) return (top_max + top_min) * 0.5 </code></pre> <p>You just need to replace ReLU/SiLU with that module/function and make sure the dimension match, because it reduces the dimension by half.</p> <p>However, it&#39;s not like using sorting as activation function is anything new. Here are some papers that use it in different contexts:</p> <p>- <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05254\">Approximating Lipschitz continuous functions with GroupSort neural networks</a></p> <p>- <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05381\">Sorting out Lipschitz function approximation</a></p> <p>But I haven&#39;t found any research that sorting is also a way to overcome a spectral bias in INRs / MLPs. There is only one paper I&#39;ve found that talks about sorting and INRs, but they sort the data/image, so they are not using sort as activation function: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.07871\">DINER: Disorder-Invariant Implicit Neural Representation</a></p> <p>== EDIT ==</p> <p>Added visualization of the spectrum:</p> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/irpis5g4iihg1.png?width=1506&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9cbbfb4f52f35a33d48834e5411bf06fbcb688d7\">Visualization of the spectrum Target vs. SortDC vs. ReLU</a></p> <p>=== EDIT 2 &amp; 3 ===</p> <p>Added training run with Muon + Adam optimizer with these settings:</p> <pre><code> &#39;lr_adam&#39;: 0.003, &#39;lr_muon_sort&#39;: 0.01, &#39;lr_muon_siren&#39;: 0.0005, # Changed from 0.003 to 0.0005 &#39;lr_muon_relu&#39;: 0.03, </code></pre> <p>This is similar to what they used in this paper - <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14366\">Optimizing Rank for High-Fidelity Implicit Neural Representations</a> - much higher learning rate for ReLU than SIREN and separate Adam optimizer for biases and in/out layers.

ReLU with Muon is competitive.</del></p> <p>=== EDIT 3 ===</p> <p>I did another run with Muon and tuned a bit SIREN learning rate, so now the result is SIREN &gt; SortDC &gt; ReLU, however the gap between ReLU and SortDC is not super huge with Muon.</p> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/8cr10glweohg1.png?width=1908&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a64ac9d3fef0c6af9f02610dc49c448519e6be66\">Muon + Adam INR SortDC vs. SIREN vs. ReLU</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/kiockete\"> /u/kiockete </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1qvs003/d_using_sort_as_an_activation_function_fixes/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1qvs003/d_using_sort_as_an_activation_function_fixes/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>",

I’m not unhappy with Android, but lately I feel bored and kind of &quot;boxed into UI work.&quot; A lot of app work feels repetitive, and many of the hardest parts feel like they come from the Android ecosystem itself (compatibility, lifecycle, build tooling, etc.) rather than the kind of backend/distributed problems I’m more excited by long-term.</p> <p>For the last 1-2 years I’ve been doing backend at work using Node.js and also tinkered with Ktor and Exposed on the side. Backend work feels more exciting to me (design, data, scaling, reliability, tradeoffs). The problem is: many Node jobs in my area are full-stack and I <em>really</em> don’t want to do frontend.</p> <p>So I’m deciding between <strong>Spring Boot (Java)</strong> and <strong>Go</strong> for the backend. To avoid overthinking, I actually built and deployed <strong>two dummy servers</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>Same kind of basic CRUD API</li> <li><strong>PostgreSQL</strong> as DB</li> <li>Deployed both (simple production-ish setup, not just localhost)</li> </ul> <p>After doing that, My current thinking is:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Spring / Spring Boot</strong> <ul> <li>Pros: Java is familiar; easy to start; huge ecosystem; lots of jobs.</li> <li>Concern: it feels like “endless learning of libraries” and the “Spring way” (annotations, auto-configuration, starters, magic). I’m worried I’ll be productive but not actually learn fundamentals deeply, and I’ll spend years just learning frameworks/stack combinations. Sometimes it feels like I’m learning “the Spring way” (annotations, auto-config, starters, magic) more than learning backend fundamentals</li> </ul></li> <li><strong>Go</strong> <ul> <li>Pros: simple, small standard library; feels like it maps to fundamentals (HTTP, SQL, concurrency) and distributed systems thinking more directly; fewer “framework decisions.”</li> <li>Concern: I’m not proficient yet; unsure about backend job availability compared to Spring; worried about limiting my options.</li> </ul></li> </ul> <p>Any advice on positioning myself as a <strong>backend-only engineer</strong> (no frontend) while transitioning? I am genuinely trying to choose a stack I can commit to for the next several years and grow deep expertise in.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SoftwareDesignerDev\"> /u/SoftwareDesignerDev </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1qvlgrn/android_dev_56_yrs_thinking_of_switching_to/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1qvlgrn/android_dev_56_yrs_thinking_of_switching_to/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Configured everything. Then run your app.</p> <p>If you needed another app, you had to buy another expensive ($10k- $50k for enterprise) server.</p> <p>Only banks and big companies could afford this. It was expensive and painful.</p> <p>Then came virtualization. You could take 10 physical servers and split them into 50 or 100 virtual machines. Better, but you still had to buy and maintain all that hardware.</p> <p>Around 2005, Amazon had a brilliant idea. They had data centers worldwide but weren&#39;t using full capacity. So they decided to rent it out.</p> <p>For startups, this changed everything. Launch without buying a single server. Pay only for what you use. Scale when you grow.</p> <p>Netflix was one of the first to jump on this.</p> <p>But this solved only the server problem.</p> <p>But &quot;How do people build applications?&quot; was still broken.</p> <p>In the early days, companies built one big application that did everything. Netflix had user accounts, video player, recommendations, and payments all in one codebase.</p> <p>Simple to build. Easy to deploy. But it didn&#39;t scale well.</p> <p>In 2008, Netflix had a major outage. They realized if they were getting downtime with just US users, how would they scale worldwide?</p> <p>So they broke their monolith into hundreds of smaller services. User accounts, separate. Video player, separate. Recommendations, separate.</p> <p>They called it microservices.</p> <p>Other companies started copying this approach. Even when they didn&#39;t really need it.</p> <p>But microservices created a massive headache. Every service needed different dependencies. Python version 2.7 for one service. Python 3.6 for another. Different libraries. Different configs.</p> <p>Setting up a new developer&#39;s machine took days. Install this database version. That Python version. These specific libraries. Configure environment variables.</p> <p>And then came the most frustrating phrase in software development: &quot;But it works on my machine.&quot;</p> <p>A developer would test their code locally. Everything worked perfectly.</p> <p>They&#39;d deploy to staging. Boom. Application crashed. Why? Different OS version. Missing dependency. Wrong configuration.</p> <p>Teams spent hours debugging environment issues instead of building features.</p> <p>Then Docker came along in 2012-13.</p> <p>Google had been using containers for years with their Borg system. But only top Google engineers could use it, too complex for normal developers.</p> <p>Docker made containers accessible to everyone. Package your app with all dependencies in one container. The exact Python version. The exact libraries. The exact configuration.</p> <p>Run it on your laptop. Works. Run it on staging. Works. Run it in production. Still works.</p> <p>No more &quot;works on my machine&quot; problems. No more spending days setting up environments.</p> <p>By 2014, millions of developers were running Docker containers.</p> <p>But running one container was easy.</p> <p>Running 10,000 containers was a nightmare.</p> <p>Microservices meant managing 50+ services manually. Services kept crashing with no auto-restart. Scaling was difficult. Services couldn&#39;t find each other when IPs changed.</p> <p>People used custom shell scripts. It was error-prone and painful. Everyone struggled with the same problems. Auto-restart, auto-scaling, service discovery, load balancing.</p> <p>AWS launched ECS to help. But managing 100+ microservices at scale was still a pain.</p> <p><strong>This is exactly what Kubernetes solved.</strong></p> <p>Google saw an opportunity. They were already running millions of containers using Borg. In 2014, they rebuilt it as Kubernetes and open-sourced it.</p> <p>But here&#39;s the smart move. They also launched GKE, a managed service that made running Kubernetes so easy that companies started choosing Google Cloud just for it.</p> <p>AWS and Azure panicked. They quickly built EKS and AKS. People jumped ship, moving from running k8s clusters on-prem to managed kubernetes on the cloud.</p> <p>12 years later, Kubernetes runs 80-85% of production infrastructure. Netflix, Uber, OpenAI, Medium, they all run on it.</p> <p>Now advanced Kubernetes skills pay big bucks.</p> <p><strong>Why did Kubernetes win?</strong></p> <p>Kubernetes won because of the perfect timing. It solved the right problems at the right time.</p> <p>Docker has made containers popular. Netflix made microservices popular. Millions of people needed a solution to manage these complex microservices at scale.</p> <p>Kubernetes solved that exact problem.</p> <p>It handles everything. Deploying services, auto-healing when things crash, auto-scaling based on traffic, service discovery, health monitoring, and load balancing.</p> <p>Then AI happened. And Kubernetes became even more critical.</p> <p>AI startups need to run thousands of ML training jobs simultaneously. They need GPU scheduling. They need to scale inference workloads based on demand.</p> <p>Companies like OpenAI, Hugging Face, and Anthropic run their AI infrastructure on Kubernetes. Training models, running inference APIs, orchestrating AI agents, all on K8s.</p> <p>The AI boom made Kubernetes essential. Not just for traditional web apps, but for all AI/ML workloads.</p> <p>Understanding this story is more important than memorizing kubectl commands.</p> <p>Now go learn Kubernetes already.</p> <p>Don&#39;t take people who write &quot;Kubernetes is dead&quot; articles are just doing it for views/clicks.</p> <p>They might have never used k8s.</p> <p>P.S. Please don’t ban me to write a proper post, its not AI generated, i have used AI for some formatting for sure. I hope you enjoy it.</p> <p>This post was originally posted on X.

Instead of just averaging outputs, we:</p> <ol> <li>Benchmark each candidate model first to see what it actually contributes.</li> <li>Remove models that don’t improve the ensemble (e.g., ProtectAI&#39;s Deberta finetune was dropped because it reduced calibration).</li> <li>Weight predictions by each model’s accuracy, letting models specialize in what they’re good at.</li> </ol> <p>With this approach, the ensemble is smaller (~237M parameters vs ~600M for the leading baseline), faster, and more calibrated (lower Expected Calibration Error) while still achieving competitive accuracy.

My personal opinion is not only are they unreliable but it can be a safety issue as well in high-stakes environments like enterprises, healthcare and more. </p> <p>World models are fundamentally different. These AI systems build internal representations of how reality works, allowing them to understand cause and effect rather than just predict tokens. There has been a shift lately and major figures from Nvidia&#39;s CEO Jensen Huang to Demis Hassabis at Google DeepMind are talking more openly about world models. I believe we&#39;re still in the early stages of discovering how transformative this technology will be for reaching AGI.</p> <p>Research and application are accelerating, especially in enterprise contexts. A few examples include: <a href=\"https://skyfall.ai/blog/wow-bridging-ai-safety-gap-in-enterprises-via-world-models\">WoW</a> (an agentic safety benchmark) uses audit logs to give agents a &quot;world model&quot; for tracking the consequences of their actions. Similarly, <a href=\"https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/logical-intelligence-introduces-first-energy-182100439.html\">Kona</a> by Logical Intelligence is developing energy-based reasoning models that move beyond pure language prediction. </p> <p>While more practical applications are still emerging, the direction is clear: true intelligence requires understanding the world, not just language patterns.

Instead of just exact string matching, we use embeddings to catch when users ask the same thing in different ways.</p> <p>How it works: when a request comes in, we generate an embedding and check if anything semantically similar exists in the cache. You can tune the similarity threshold - we default to 0.8 but you can go stricter (0.9+) or looser (0.7) depending on your use case.</p> <p>The part that took some iteration was conversation awareness. Long conversations have topic drift, so we automatically skip caching when conversations exceed a configurable threshold. Prevents false positives where the cache returns something from an earlier, unrelated part of the conversation.</p> <p>Been running this in production and seeing 60-70% cost reduction for apps with repetitive query patterns - customer support, documentation Q&amp;A, common research questions. Cache hit rates usually land around 85-90% once it&#39;s warmed up.</p> <p>We&#39;re using Weaviate for vector storage. TTL is configurable per use case - maybe 5 minutes for dynamic stuff, hours for stable documentation.</p> <p>Anyone else using semantic caching in production?

Uses Rectified Flow Matching to predict continuous audio embeddings in a single forward pass </p> <p>(1 pass vs the ~32+ required by discrete models).</p> <p>The Listen head works as a multimodal encoder. Adding audio embeddings and text tokens to the backbone.</p> <p>Adding input text tokens was a big factor in retaining coherence. Other models rely on pure audio embeddings for the input stream.</p> <p>I optimize the audio embeddings for beneficial modality fusion and trained the model end to end as a last step.</p> <p>As the LLM backbone I used SmolLM 360M.</p> <p>Most of the training happened on a single 4090 and some parts requiring more memory on 2xA6000.</p> <p>One of the tricks I used to maintain coherence is mixing in pure text samples into the dataset.</p> <p>The current latency of the model is ~75ms TTFA on a single 4090 (unoptimized Python).</p> <p>Even at 530M params, the model &quot;recycles&quot; its pretrained text knowledge and adapts it for speech very well.</p> <p>There is no visible LM degradation looking at the loss curves and while testing, it reasons the same as the base backbone.</p> <p>It reached fluent speech with only 5k hours of audio.</p> <p>Link to the full description:</p> <p><a href=\"https://ketsuilabs.io/blog/introducing-michi-ai\">https://ketsuilabs.io/blog/introducing-michi-ai</a></p> <p>Github link:</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/KetsuiLabs/MichiAI\">https://github.com/KetsuiLabs/MichiAI</a></p> <p>I wonder what you guys think!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/kwazar90\"> /u/kwazar90 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1quwjt1/p_michiai_a_530m_fullduplex_speech_llm_with_75ms/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1quwjt1/p_michiai_a_530m_fullduplex_speech_llm_with_75ms/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Upgrade Immediately.\" /> </a> </td><td> <!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>A critical security vulnerability has been disclosed in the <strong>ingress-nginx</strong> controller, one of the most widely used ingress controllers in the Kubernetes ecosystem.</p> <p>If you are running ingress-nginx in a multi-tenant environment or where untrusted users have permissions to create/edit Ingress objects, you need to patch your clusters immediately.</p> <h1>🚨 The Issue</h1> <p>A vulnerability allows an attacker with permissions to create or update Ingress objects to bypass annotation validation. This allows them to inject arbitrary configuration into the generated <code>nginx.conf</code> file.</p> <p>This breaks the isolation boundary and can lead to <strong>privilege escalation</strong>, allowing the attacker to potentially access sensitive information from the ingress controller&#39;s control plane (e.g., service account tokens, secrets).</p> <h1>🛠️ The Fix</h1> <p>The maintainers released patches yesterday. You must upgrade to the following versions to mitigate this vulnerability:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Controller Version:</strong><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/releases/tag/controller-v1.14.3\"><code>v1.14.3</code></a></li> <li><strong>Helm Chart Version:</strong><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/releases/tag/helm-chart-4.14.3\"><code>4.14.3</code></a></li> </ul> <h1>📝 Immediate Actions Recommended</h1> <ol> <li><strong>Audit</strong> your current ingress-nginx version in all clusters (staging and production). </li> </ol> <p>&#8203;</p> <pre><code>kubectl get deployment -n &lt;namespace&gt; &lt;controller-name&gt; -o jsonpath=&#39;{.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image}&#39; </code></pre> <ol> <li><strong>Update</strong> your Helm repositories (<code>helm repo update</code>).</li> <li><strong>Plan and execute</strong> the upgrade ASAP.</li> </ol> <h1>🔗 References</h1> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2026/q1/140\">Vulnerability Announcement (oss-sec)</a></li> </ul> <p>Stay secure out there!</p> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/scljmj5cf9hg1.png?width=2816&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c773af15e055274a5b62524d7315ffb60d73f78\">https://preview.redd.it/scljmj5cf9hg1.png?width=2816&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c773af15e055274a5b62524d7315ffb60d73f78</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/manuel_morejon\"> /u/manuel_morejon </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1quovuf/security_alert_critical_vulnerability_in/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1quovuf/security_alert_critical_vulnerability_in/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>",

In ML, we often encounter similar issues—parameters with symmetries, non-Euclidean spaces, data living on manifolds, generalization effects that feel global rather than local—but we usually address them heuristically rather than structurally.</p> <p>I’m not claiming that abstract math automatically leads to better models. Most ideas don’t survive contact with practice. But when some do, they often enable qualitatively different behavior rather than incremental improvements.</p> <p>I’m now trying to move closer to ML-adjacent geometry: geometric deep learning beyond graphs, Riemannian optimization, symmetry and equivariance, topology-aware learning.</p> <p>I’d be very interested in pointers to work (books, lecture notes, papers, or practical case studies) that sits between <strong>modern geometry/topology and modern ML</strong>, especially answers to questions like:</p> <ul> <li>which geometric ideas have actually influenced model or optimizer design beyond toy settings?</li> <li>where does Riemannian or manifold-aware optimization help in practice, and where is it mostly cosmetic?</li> <li>which topological ideas seem fundamentally incompatible with SGD-style training?</li> </ul> <p>Pointers and critical perspectives are very welcome.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ternausX\"> /u/ternausX </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1quehcc/d_where_is_modern_geometry_actually_useful_in/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1quehcc/d_where_is_modern_geometry_actually_useful_in/\">[comments]</a></span>",

The one who thrives under pressure, who can dive into a production-down incident at 3 AM and, through a combination of deep system knowledge and sheer brilliance, bring the system back to life. They are rewarded for it. They get the bonuses, the promotions, and the reputation as a &quot;go-to&quot; person.</p> <p>And in celebrating them, we are creating a culture that is destined to remain on fire.</p> <p>For every visible firefighter, there is an invisible fire preventer. This is the engineer who spends a month on a thankless, complex refactoring of a legacy service. Their work doesn&#39;t result in a new feature on the roadmap. Their success is silent—it&#39;s the catastrophic outage that doesn&#39;t happen six months from now. Their reward is to be overlooked in the next promotion cycle because their &quot;impact&quot; wasn&#39;t as visible as the hero who saved the day.</p> <p>This is a perverse incentive, and we, as managers, created it.</p> <p>Our performance review systems are fundamentally biased towards visible, reactive work over invisible, proactive work. We are great at measuring things we can easily count: features shipped, tickets closed, incidents resolved. We don&#39;t have a column on our spreadsheet for &quot;catastrophes averted.&quot; As a result, we create a career ladder that implicitly encourages engineers to let things smolder, knowing the reward for putting out the eventual blaze is greater than the reward for ensuring there&#39;s no fire in the first place.</p> <p>It&#39;s time to change what we measure. &quot;Impact&quot; cannot be a synonym for &quot;visible activity.&quot; Real impact is the verifiable elimination of future work and risk.</p> <ul> <li>The engineer who automates a flaky, manual deployment step hasn&#39;t just closed a ticket; they have verifiably improved the Lead Time for Changes for every single developer on the team, forever. That is massive, compounding impact.</li> <li>The engineer who refactors a high-churn, bug-prone module hasn&#39;t just &quot;cleaned up code&quot;; they have measurably reduced the Change Failure Rate for an entire domain of the business. That is a direct reduction in business risk.</li> </ul> <p>We need to start rewarding the architects of fireproof buildings, not just the most skilled firefighters. This requires a conscious, data-driven effort to find and celebrate the invisible work. It means using tools that can quantify the risk of a module before it fails, and then tracking the reduction of that risk as a first-class measure of an engineer&#39;s contribution.</p> <p>So the question to ask yourself in your next performance calibration is a hard one: Are we promoting the people who are best at navigating our broken system, or are we promoting the people who are actually fixing it?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/3sc2002\"> /u/3sc2002 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://blog.3squaredcircles.com\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1qu6t8s/your_career_ladder_is_rewarding_the_wrong_behavior/\">[comments]</a></span>",
