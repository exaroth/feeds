We cannot do what we do without your support.</p></div></div><p>Jarosław Kaczyński, the leader of Poland’s national-conservative opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party, has expressed his support for Poland joining Donald Trump’s Board of Peace, saying that it would help ensure good relations with the United States.</p><p>He also called on the government to pay the $1 billion required for a permanent seat.</p><p>Last week, PiS-aligned President Karol Nawrocki revealed that he had <a href=\"https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/01/19/trump-invites-polands-president-nawrocki-to-join-board-of-peace/\">received an invitation from Trump</a> to join the board. However, as joining an international organisation requires approval by the government and parliament, the president began the process of consultation with the foreign ministry.</p><p>Nawrocki and PiS are closely aligned with Trump, but the government, a more liberal coalition ranging from left to centre-right, has less friendly relations with Washington. Both sides are also wary of joining a body that Russia’s Vladimir Putin and Belarus’s Alexander Lukashenko have been invited to.</p><p>Nawrocki attended Thursday’s launch of the Board of Peace at the World Economic Forum in Davos. He was not among those who formally joined the body, but said afterwards that it was “important and necessary” for Poland to be part of it.</p><p>On Friday, that position was echoed by Kaczyński. “We must be on the best possible terms with the United States, which is all the more reason why we should be there [on the Board of Peace],” said the PiS leader.</p><p>“The government must allocate this billion dollars, because there’s no point in Poland joining as a poor country,” he added. “We are no longer a poor country and should act as a truly full member.”</p><p>Trump has invited dozens of world leaders to join the board, which was established as part of the peace process in Gaza but has a much wider remit. Those wishing to have permanent membership are expected to pay $1 billion.</p><p>Asked if Nawrocki should sit on the board even if Putin is a fellow member, Kaczyński simply replied, “Vladimir Putin won’t be there”, without offering further explanation.</p><p>The government has so far not outlined its position on whether it supports joining the board or not. In response to Kaczyński’s remarks on Friday, foreign minister Radosław Sikorski launched a poll on social media platform X asking his followers what they think.</p><p>Among the 21,000 responses, the most popular of the three options Sikorski gave was “Let PiS pay for it themselves” (48.2%), followed by “No, there are more important goals” (30.5%) and then “Yes, this is in our interest” (21.3%)</p><p>Other leaders of large European countries have rejected the idea of joining the board in its current form, including France’s Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Italy’s Giorgia Meloni, and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz.</p><p>More than 20 countries have so far accepted invitations to join the body. They include Israel, Hungary, Argentina, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Belarus, Pakistan and Mongolia. Russia has said it is still considering the offer.</p><p>Belarus and Russia’s membership of the board would be problematic for Warsaw, given that both countries have in recent years been engaged in a campaign of so-called “hybrid warfare” against Poland.</p><p>Agents working on behalf of Russia have carried out <a href=\"https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/01/16/poland-charges-five-over-plot-to-send-explosive-courier-packages-on-behalf-of-russia/\">sabotage</a> and <a href=\"https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/01/14/poland-suffers-major-cyberattack-on-power-grid-says-russia-likely-responsible/\">cyberattacks</a>, while Belarus has created a <a href=\"https://notesfrompoland.com/2024/06/12/the-renewed-poland-belarus-border-crisis-explained/\">migration and security crisis</a> on Poland’s eastern border by encouraging and assisting tens of thousands of migrants – mainly from the Middle East, Asia and Africa – to try to illegally cross.</p><p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://notesfrompoland.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/support.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"275\" height=\"97\">\nNotes from Poland is run by a <a href=\"https://notesfrompoland.com/about-us/#editor-team\">small editorial team</a> and published by an independent, non-profit foundation that is funded through donations from our readers.

We cannot do what we do without your support.</p></div></div><p>Poland’s biggest annual charity fundraiser has once again broken its record. By the end of Sunday’s colourful, musical grand finale, it had brought in just over 183 million zloty (€43.5 million) in donations, which will go towards children’s healthcare.</p><p>The Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity (WOŚP), which was first held in 1993, sees around 120,000 volunteers in Poland and abroad collecting donations, often wearing colourful clothing or fancy dress. Many also organise fundraising events while celebrities offer items for auction.</p><p>This year’s offerings include a pair of Prime Minister Donald Tusk’s football boots and a meeting in his chancellery (with the highest bid currently at 116,000 zloty), a racquet that tennis star Iga Świątek used when winning Wimbledon last year (120,250 zloty), and a sleepover with actress and pop star Julia Wieniawa (100,000 zloty).</p><p>The final grand total, usually announced in spring, will be even higher once all collections and auctions have been completed. Last year it reached just over 289 million zloty.</p><p>The money collected by WOŚP is used primarily to buy equipment for Poland’s healthcare system. This year’s focus was on supporting the diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases in children.</p><p>Since its launch in 1993, the charity has raised almost 3 billion zloty, which has been used to supply hospitals with around 81,500 pieces of medical equipment.</p><p>Despite this, WOŚP is not popular among some Polish conservatives, who dislike the secular, liberal values of its founder, Jerzy Owsiak, and have accused him and his family of benefiting financially from the event.</p><p>During PiS’s eight years in power from 2015 to 2023, WOŚP often received a hostile reception from state institutions. In 2017, public broadcaster TVP decided to stop screening the finale of the fundraiser, which instead switched to private station TVN.</p><p>However, since PiS was replaced in December 2023 by a new, more liberal coalition led by Tusk, WOŚP has received strong support from the state. A number of state-owned companies have joined the event as sponsors, including energy giant Orlen and insurer PZU.</p><p>Despite being aligned with PiS, former President Andrzej Duda, who was in office from 2015 to 2025, supported WOŚP, including donating items for auction. However, his successor, Karol Nawrocki, another PiS ally who took power last August, has not done so this year.</p><p>His chancellery refused to answer media enquiries about the issue. Last year, when he was running for the presidency, Nawrocki’s spokeswoman was asked about whether he supported WOŚP, to which she responded only by saying that he supports Caritas, the Catholic church’s charitable arm.</p><p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://notesfrompoland.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/support.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"275\" height=\"97\">\nNotes from Poland is run by a <a href=\"https://notesfrompoland.com/about-us/#editor-team\">small editorial team</a> and published by an independent, non-profit foundation that is funded through donations from our readers.

The trio also held talks focused on security, and in particular Russia’s war in Ukraine.</p><p>“One reflection that dominated today is that it’s been 163 years since the January Uprising and one thing remains unchanged: Russia is still a threat to the region,” said Poland’s Karol Nawrocki. “Regardless of whether it is Tsarist Russia, Bolshevik Russia or Vladimir Putin’s Russia.”</p><p>Speaking alongside him, Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky emphasised that the event was a reminder that “a</p><p>Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda, who hosted the summit,</p><p>The January Uprising began on 22 January 1863 in so-called Congress Poland, which was a puppet state of Russia. Its area covered much of modern-day central and eastern Poland, as well as parts of Lithuania.</p><p>The insurrection initially broke out among Poles conscripted into the Russian army, and was joined by tens of thousands more, including Lithuanians and Belarusians. (Exiled Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya also joined today’s ceremonies.)</p><p>The uprising was brutally suppressed by Russia – with thousands of Poles killed and many more deported to Siberia – and was eventually brought to an end in 1864, though Russian reprisals against the local population continued long after.</p><p>Today’s meeting took place under the auspices of the <a href=\"https://notesfrompoland.com/2022/03/14/west-now-realises-enormous-mistake-of-not-listening-to-our-russia-warnings-says-polish-pm/\">Lublin Triangle</a>, a regional alliance established in 2020 between Poland, Lithuania and Ukraine. It is named after the 1569 Treaty of Lublin, which created the <a href=\"https://notesfrompoland.com/2021/01/12/nfp-podcast-a-brief-history-of-poland-part-4-the-golden-age/\">Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth</a>, a state that also contained much of modern-day Ukraine.</p><p>Speaking afterwards, Nawrocki recalled that the countries of their region had been proven right in their longstanding warnings about Russia. That emphasises why “it is important for the voice of central and eastern Europe, and forums like this one, to be heard worldwide”.</p><p>He and Nausėda noted that Zelensky had updated them on the progress of peace negotiations, with Nausėda commenting that, “not for the first time, we see Russia not wanting to commit to peace”.</p><p>Zelensky also said that he was “happy that our partners in Lithuania and Poland support the idea of [Ukraine] joining the European Union”, which is a “priority” for Kyiv.</p><p>However, although Poland’s government <a href=\"https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/03/18/polish-foreign-minister-ask-opposition-to-persuade-hungary-to-stop-blocking-ukraines-eu-accession/\">supports Ukrainian membership</a>, Nawrocki – who is aligned with the right-wing opposition and regularly clashes with the government – <a href=\"https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/06/09/i-am-against-ukraines-eu-entry-says-polish-president-elect-in-first-foreign-interview/\">said last year</a> that he is “against Ukraine’s entry at the moment”.</p><p>After today’s summit, Nausėda made clear that</p><p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://notesfrompoland.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/support.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"275\" height=\"97\">\nNotes from Poland is run by a <a href=\"https://notesfrompoland.com/about-us/#editor-team\">small editorial team</a> and published by an independent, non-profit foundation that is funded through donations from our readers.
