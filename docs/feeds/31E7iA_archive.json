We cannot do what we do without your support.</p></div></div><p>The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has rejected a final appeal by Poland against the €68.5 million in fines it was forced to pay by the European Union for failing to suspend activity at the Turów coal mine during an environmental dispute with the Czech Republic.</p><p>The ruling now brings the long-running case to a close.</p><p>The dispute dates back to 2021, when Prague filed a complaint to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) over Poland’s expansion of operations at Turów, an open-cast mine near the Czech border. It argued that Poland had acted in violation of EU law and its actions would cause environmental damage.</p><p>As an interim measure, the CJEU&nbsp;<a href=\"https://notesfrompoland.com/2021/05/21/eu-court-orders-poland-to-immediately-suspend-mining-at-coal-pit-following-czech-complaint/\">ordered the mine to suspend operations</a> for the duration of the court proceedings. Poland refused to comply, arguing that the continued operation of the mine and the nearby power plant that it supplies, which produced 7% of Poland’s electricity, was crucial for energy security.</p><p>As a result, the CJEU in September 2021&nbsp;<a href=\"https://notesfrompoland.com/2021/09/20/poland-fined-e500000-per-day-for-not-complying-with-eu-order-to-close-coal-mine/\">ordered</a>&nbsp;Poland to begin paying daily fines of €500,000 until it complied. Poland then refused to pay those fines, leading the European Commission to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://notesfrompoland.com/2022/04/07/eu-deducts-e30-million-from-polands-funds-to-cover-unpaid-fines/\">deduct the money</a>, €68.5 million in total, from Poland’s EU funds.</p><p>In 2022, after it had&nbsp;<a href=\"https://notesfrompoland.com/2022/02/03/poland-and-czech-republic-sign-agreement-to-end-coal-mine-dispute/\">reached an agreement</a> with the Czech Republic to end the dispute over the mine, Poland launched a complaint to the CJEU against the European Commission’s actions.</p><p>It argued that the agreement with Prague meant the fines could be cancelled retroactively and that the commission’s decision to deduct the money was therefore unlawful. The fines had been issued before the agreement with Prague, but the commission took the money after the agreement had been reached.</p><p>In 2024, one part of the CJEU, known as the General Court, <a href=\"https://notesfrompoland.com/2024/05/30/eu-court-rejects-polands-complaint-over-unpaid-coal-mine-fines/\">rejected Poland’s complaint</a>. It found that the removal of the case from the court’s register following the settlement with the Czech Republic did not relieve Poland of the obligation to settle the fines already accrued.</p><p>Although the case had originally been brought by Poland’s former national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) government, which ruled until December 2023 and regularly clashed with Brussels, its current more pro-EU government, led by Prime Minister Donald Tusk, still decided to appeal the ruling.</p><p>That appeal was heard by the European Court of Justice, which is the second part of the CJEU. In a ruling issued on Thursday, the ECJ rejected Poland’s appeal.</p><p>“The obligation to pay the daily penalty…is intended to ensure compliance with the interim measures already ordered, to preserve the full effectiveness of the future final decision, and thus to guarantee the effective application of EU law in the general interest,” wrote the court.</p><p>“The actions of the parties to the dispute, including the conclusion of a settlement agreement, cannot have the effect of retroactively varying, annulling or setting aside an order imposing such a periodic penalty payment,” it added.</p><p>At the time of writing, Poland’s government had not yet commented on the ruling. However, Anna Zalewska, a former PiS government minister and now member of the European Parliament, used it as an opportunity to criticise European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.</p><p>“</p><p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://notesfrompoland.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/support.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"275\" height=\"97\">\nNotes from Poland is run by a <a href=\"https://notesfrompoland.com/about-us/#editor-team\">small editorial team</a> and published by an independent, non-profit foundation that is funded through donations from our readers.

Another Polish city, Lublin, was sixth.</p><p>The ranking is compiled using anonymous GPS data from cities around the world, showing the movement (or lack of movement) of vehicles. The firm then calculates a “congestion level” that shows how much slower traffic moves compared to when roads are free.</p><p>Łódź, which is Poland’s fourth largest city with a population of around 650,000, had the world’s fourth-worst average congestion figure of 72.8%, meaning journey times are that much slower than when traffic is free flowing.</p><p>Only Mexico City (75.9%), Bengaluru (74.4%) in India and the Irish capital of Dublin (72.9%) had worse congestion. Łódź was followed by Pune (71.1%), also in India, and then, in sixth place, came Lublin (70.4%), a city of 330,000 people in eastern Poland.</p><p>Among European cities, Łódź and Lublin were the second and third most congested, while Poznań (64.9%), Poland’s fifth-largest city, followed in fourth (though it was 14th in the global ranking).</p><p>Other Polish cities to be ranked among the top 100 globally were Wrocław (27th, 59.2%), Bydgoszcz (28th, 59%), Kraków (31st, 58.7%), Warsaw (77th, 51.3%), Gdańsk (87th, 50.1%) and Szczecin (94th, 49.5%).</p><p>TomTom’s data show that congestion in all of those Polish cities worsened in 2025 compared to 2024. In Łódź, an average commuter loses 135 hours to rush hour traffic a year, while in Lublin the figure is 117 hours.</p><p>Łódź has consistently ranked near the top of TomTom’s Traffic Index in recent years, with local media ascribing some of the blame to constant <a href=\"https://notesfrompoland.com/2023/11/05/polish-city-concretes-around-parked-car-after-owner-fails-to-remove-it/\">major roadworks in the city centre</a>.</p><p>“I know we didn’t do very well in this ranking,” deputy mayor </p><p>“I believe this year will be better [because] the [construction] work is better distributed across Łódź,” he added.

NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte warned that \"there is still a lot of work to be done\" among the parties involved in the row over the control of Greenland. Rutte made the comments in an interview with US broadcaster Fox News on Wednesday. The NATO boss said that he and US President Donald Trump agreed that the Arctic region must be jointly protected, during a meeting held on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos. He added that the issue of whether Greenland would remain with Denmark did not come up in their talks. \"He (Trump) is very much focused on what do we need to do to make sure ⁠that that huge Arctic ​region — where change is taking place at the moment, where the Chinese and the Russians are ‌more and more ‌active — how we can protect it,\" Rutte said. Trump earlier canceled his threats to impose tariffs on several European nations and use them as ‌leverage to take control of the mineral-rich island. He also ruled out the use of military force to seize Greenland. \n\n\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\n\nFollow DW on social media:\n►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\n►TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dwnews\n►Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n►Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n\nFür Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1</article>",

      "content": "<article>Julian Emanuel, Chief Equity &amp; Quantitative Strategist at Evercore ISI gives his investment outlook for 2026. \n\nWall Street traders drove&nbsp;stocks&nbsp;higher after their biggest selloff since October as President&nbsp;Donald Trump&nbsp;said the US doesn’t want to use excessive force to get Greenland.&nbsp;Bond yields&nbsp;fell alongside the&nbsp;dollar.\nFollowing a cross-asset slide dubbed by some as a revival of the&nbsp;“Sell America”&nbsp;trade amid geopolitical risks, more than 400 shares in the&nbsp;S&amp;P 500&nbsp;advanced. The gauge is back in the green for 2026.&nbsp;Small caps&nbsp;beat the US equity benchmark for a 13th straight day while&nbsp;big tech&nbsp;underperformed the broader market. A closely watched gauge of&nbsp;equity volatility&nbsp;tumbled from its highest since November.\nTreasuries&nbsp;bounced after being hit in the previous session. The&nbsp;greenback&nbsp;was poised for its fourth straight day of losses.\nIt wasn’t so much what President Trump said that mattered as what he didn’t say, according to&nbsp;Brian Jacobsen&nbsp;at Annex Wealth Management.&nbsp;\n“He didn’t reiterate his tariff threat against Europe, He didn’t say the government would use force to get Greenland. He didn’t say he’d cap credit card rates, instead asking Congress to do it,” Jacobsen added. “It felt like a dialing down of the substance even if the style was still pure Trump.”\nTrump said he was seeking immediate talks on Greenland, pushing for the US to acquire the Danish territory during an address to the world’s business and political elite in Davos on Wednesday. He cast the US acquisition of Greenland as essential to collective security and downplayed the danger it would pose to NATO.&nbsp;\nThe US president also hailed his policies as ushering in an American economic boom and said his agenda offered an example for Europe to follow.\n--------\nMore on Bloomberg Television and Markets\n \nLike this video?

      "content": "<p><em>In this special&nbsp;<a href=\"https://channel4news.substack.com/t/trumpworld\"></a>&nbsp;newsletter, Channel 4 News charts one year of life with Donald Trump as President of the United States, after returning for his second term.</em></p><p>It is perhaps hard to believe that we have only had&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/news/one-year-under-trump-how-the-us-president-is-changing-the-world\">one year of this latest US presidency</a>; a head-spinning year that has left everyone in no doubt. This time round things are different – Donald Trump has been unleashed.</p><p>They used to say that to understand this president’s leadership, you needed to take him seriously but not literally. Trump-watchers in 2025 and now 2026 have now modified that thought to a new ubiquitous idea, that he must now be taken both seriously and literally.</p><h2>Changing American society</h2><p>And with that in mind, perhaps we shouldn’t be shocked by what has unfolded. After all, Trump laid out all his plans in great detail on day 1 of this presidency. On January 20, 2025, he signed more executive orders than at any time in US history; seizing presidential power as he changed American society with each stroke of the pen.</p><p>The centrepiece was a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UznGbkMcEGw\">crackdown on immigration</a>, declaring in a number of different orders, a “national emergency”, closing the door to almost all asylum seekers (bar a few thousand white South Africans), instigating travel bans,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/news/inside-californias-fight-against-ice-crackdowns\">ramping up ICE raids</a>,&nbsp;and promising to tackle an “invasion” by “illegal aliens”.</p><p>He told us that he wanted to end government diversity programmes, recognise only two genders – male and female, take a chainsaw to federal government and close down the world’s biggest aid agency, USAID. And he delivered every one of those promises.</p><h2>Rewriting the world order</h2><p>It was also on day 1 that the US administration – through an executive order – designated drug cartels as terrorists, setting off the policy that has resulted in dozens of boat strikes, and the audacious operation that saw&nbsp;the <a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/news/us-airstrikes-hit-venezuela-maduro-is-captured-and-charged\">US seize former Venezuelan leader, Nicolas Maduro.</a></p><p>Covering all of this for Channel 4 News has been jaw-dropping at times, as we travelled from the UN General Assembly in New York – where Trump told the world he considered climate change a hoax –&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJkcaiJV0z4\">to Trinidad and Tobago</a>&nbsp;– where we were told about bodies from boat strikes washing up onto the shores, to Utah after the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk – and to Minneapolis, more than once.</p><h2>How Minnesota became a flashpoint</h2><p>Perhaps it was there – in Minnesota’s largest city – that we felt the impact of Trump’s policies and words most viscerally. After he attacked Somalis in the city (all 100,000 because of a fraud case involving a few dozen) –&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/news/trump-facing-criticism-over-xenophobic-tirade-against-somali-immigrants\">we met Saida Hassan, working at her mother’s restaurant</a>.&nbsp;Trump said he wanted Somalis to “go back to where they came from”, and some of his supporters echoed that sentiment in call after call to Hassan’s family business. I watched as she answered the phone to one man, who told this mother that he would come to Minneapolis to kill her and her family.</p><p>Then, after&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3TB2-uh9Pk\">Renee Nicole Good was shot dead by an ICE agent</a>&nbsp;in the same city, we heard from Maimuna Mohamud, another mother-of-three, who was stopped by dozens of immigration officers and taken to a Minnesota prison for two weeks, despite legally residing in the country.</p><p>Hearing from Trump on Monday – in a rambling speech to mark the one year anniversary – it was clear that these scenes are an unfortunate side effect of his agenda; but are the images he wants to define his presidency.</p><p>His attacks on Somali Americans are stomach-churning in their vitriol.</p><p>Minnesota has fewer undocumented immigrants than Florida and Texas, but to Trump it represents a flashpoint through which he can set his administration against Democratic states.</p><p>As Trump told us himself – he views this as a war – against the “enemy within”. And the differing responses to Good’s killing underlined the levels of polarisation in the US. It felt as if Americans were literally watching different videos, no longer able to see the world through each other’s eyes.</p><p>These acts all represent a consolidation of executive power that is unprecedented in the US. Trump’s White House has seized control, marginalising the influence of the other two branches of the constitution – Congress and the judiciary.</p><p>Despite claiming on day 1 – in an executive order – that he would end the weaponisation of the federal government, Trump has run an administration with retribution at its heart.</p><p>His political enemies from James Comey to John Bolton, Lisa Cook and Jerome Powell have faced federal investigations, while revenge was also how he has framed the Minnesota attacks, warning the state that a “reckoning” and “retribution” was coming.</p><p>Perhaps the one reassuring fact for his critics is that so much of this has been done by a stroke of a pen, and not through deeper, longer-lasting legislative change.</p><p>But even so, will the next US leader – having seen what is possible – really want to wind back the clock?</p><p>Or has Trump changed his country, and the White House, for good?</p><h2>Davos showdown: How Trump triggered the worst transatlantic crisis in generations</h2><p>Was Greenland ever just a punchline? Is Donald Trump now reshaping the Western alliance itself, one shock move at a time? He’s finally ruled out taking Greenland by force – but he wants to own it – and won’t take no for an answer. What happens if Europe refuses to bend? And is the damage already done to the transatlantic order as we know it?</p><p>From an unprecedented showdown at Davos to record-breaking executive orders that have rewritten America’s map, Anushka Asthana and Chuck Todd break down a week that has left Washington, London Brussels and now the snowy mountains of Switzerland reeling.</p><p>In our latest <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXjqQf1xYLQ5gtvPoFsUaUJm9MMNOhTHp\">TrumpWord podcast</a>, they examine Trump’s fixation on Greenland, the new ‘Donroe’ Doctrine taking hold inside the White House, and the rising influence of Stephen Miller as the architect of Trump’s most aggressive foreign policy gambits.</p><p><em><strong>Thanks for reading Channel 4 News’ weekly&nbsp;<a href=\"https://channel4news.substack.com/t/trumpworld\">TrumpWorld&nbsp;newsletter</a>, where our experienced correspondents take you inside the chaos, drama and consequences of Donald Trump’s America.</strong></em></p>",

Both have repeatedly ruled out handing it over to the US.</p><p>But Trump insists that Greenland is strategically vital for the US and nothing short of ownership will do.</p><p>“If there is a war, much of the action will take place on that piece of ice,” he said in the speech in Davos.</p><p>“Think of it, those missiles will be flying right over the centre of that piece of ice.”</p><p>Under American control, Greenland would be protected by a “golden dome”, Trump said, perhaps part of his sales pitch to Denmark and Greenlanders.</p><p>Reacting to Trump’s speech, Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said a promise not to use force was not an end to the crisis between Europe and the US.</p><p>“In isolation it’s positive that the president says what he does regarding the military, but that does not make the problem go away,” Rasmussen said.</p><p>“It’s clear from this speech that the president’s ambition is intact.”</p><p>Swedish Deputy Prime Minister Ebba Busch said Trump’s address was “in many ways not surprising”.</p><p>“This once again proves the EU needs to toughen up, we need to hold the line,” Busch told the news agency, Reuters, in Davos.</p><p>The US President’s rhetoric over Greenland escalated last weekend when Trump announced <a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/news/european-leaders-hit-back-at-trump-over-greenland-and-tariffs?_gl=1*1aw8f09*_ga*MTg1NDYwMjk0MS4xNzY4OTk1MjI4*_ga_MP2ME4JRSB*czE3NjkwMjEwNDUkbzUkZzEkdDE3NjkwMjE3NTQkajYwJGwwJGgw\">plans to impose tariffs</a> on countries who had shown most support to Denmark.</p><p>Germany, Sweden, Norway, Finland, the Netherlands and France have sent military personnel to Greenland in a limited deployment, while the UK has contributed one officer.</p><p>European allies said the “reconnaissance” force was part of “a planned Arctic Endurance exercise”.</p><p>France has now called for a Nato operation in Greenland. President Macron’s office said that France was prepared to contribute to such a force.</p><p>Having ruled out military action, it is unclear whether Trump will also drop his threat to impose tariffs of up to 25 % on the eight European countries.</p><h2>What we learned on Tuesday</h2><p>And former Prime Minister of Denmark – and ex-Nato Secretary General – Anders Fogh Rasmussen <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SJCTND3P0w\">told Channel 4 News on Tuesday</a> that Greenland was “not for sale”, adding that his only means of Trump acquiring the island would be by “conquering it, which would of course mean the end of Nato”.</p><p>Rasmussen also warned that Trump was the “biggest threat to world peace”.</p><p>Using force would mean “the future of Nato is at stake and the world order as we know it is at stake, so it is a very serious situation,” Rasmussen said.</p><p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that the EU was planning “a massive European investment surge” in Greenland.</p><p>Where the EU and Nato agree with Trump is in the strategic importance of the polar region where melting ice is opening up new shipping routes.</p><p>“We are aligned. We are working together [with the US],” von der Leyen told MEPs in the European Parliament this morning.</p><p>“We share the same strategic assessment on Arctic security. And this is why the threat of additional tariffs for security reasons is simply wrong. If we are now plunging into a dangerous downward spiral between allies, this would only embolden the very adversaries we are both so committed to keeping out of our strategic landscape.”</p><p>Trump already has access to the Arctic through Alaska. It also has a military base on Greenland through a long-term existing agreement with Denmark.</p><p>With temperatures dropping to minus 20 C, close to two-thirds of the capital Kyiv is currently without power after days of Russian attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure.</p><p>Trump insisted today that he is set on ending the war and would put pressure on both sides.</p><p>A deal is now “reasonably close,” he promised.</p><p>Trump is due to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Thursday.</p><p><em><strong>Thanks for reading the latest edition of our free FourGround newsletter.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://channel4news.substack.com/\">Subscribe</a>&nbsp;to keep up to date with Channel 4 News on Substack.</strong></em></p>",

Almost one million Ukrainian refugees remain in Poland today.</p><p>“</p><p>In March 2022, Poland put in place special measures to support Ukrainian refugees, who were at the time entering Poland in huge numbers. Since then, the legislation has been repeatedly extended.</p><p>However, last year it was the subject of a political dispute between the government and newly elected President Karol Nawrocki, who is aligned with the right-wing opposition.</p><p>In August, Nawrocki <a href=\"https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/08/25/president-vetoes-law-extending-support-for-ukrainian-refugees-in-poland/\">vetoed a government bill</a> extending support on existing terms, arguing that it unjustly “privileged” Ukrainians over other groups. In the end, he and the government <a href=\"https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/09/26/poland-passes-law-extending-ukrainian-refugee-support-but-restricting-access-to-benefits/\">reached a compromise</a> that extended support until March 2026 but made access to certain benefits contingent upon employment.</p><p>The president also made clear that it was the last time he would approve an extension of special support for Ukrainians. “We need to switch to normal conditions, i.e. treating Ukrainian citizens in Poland in the same way as all other foreigners,” said his chief of staff, Zbigniew Bogucki.</p><p>The new measures, which were agreed by the government on Tuesday but must still be approved by parliament and the president, would go into force in March 2026. They would end some forms of special support for Ukrainians immediately, while phasing out others by March 2027.</p><p>Instead, the legislation would introduce “</p><p>One element of the bill would see “a gradual transition of healthcare to principles similar to those applicable to Polish citizens ([through] contributions and insurance)”, <a href=\"https://www.gov.pl/web/mswia/rada-ministrow-przyjela-projekt-ustawy-wygaszajacej-rozwiazania-specustawy-ukrainskiej\">says</a> the interior ministry.</p><p>Ukrainian refugees without healthcare insurance would be treated the same as uninsured Polish citizens. There would be exceptions for children, pregnant women, victims of violence, and wounded soldiers.</p><p>Additionally, special measures put in place to help Ukrainian children adapt to Polish schools – such as Polish language classes, preparatory courses and simplified rules for hiring intercultural assistants – will be removed at the end of the current academic year.</p><p>Meanwhile, the provision of accommodation and food would be restricted to particularly vulnerable groups, such as the elderly or people with disabilities.</p><p>The current right of Ukrainians to establish a business under special rules – i.e. the same conditions applicable to Polish citizens – will also be terminated, notes the  daily.</p><p>Some human rights groups have warned that the proposed new measures go too far, and could leave some vulnerable groups without protection and even at risk of homelessness.</p><p>The Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights (HFPC) argues that an element of the bill giving those wishing to obtain support a 14-day deadline to apply for a Polish identity number contravenes EU law. They also note that, for some Ukrainians, obtaining the necessary documentation may be hard due to the war in their homeland.</p><p>The office of Poland’s Commissioner for Human Rights has raised similar objections, reports&nbsp;.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Lewiatan Confederation, a business lobby representing large employers, <a href=\"https://lewiatan.org/wygaszanie-pomocy-obywatelom-ukrainy-moze-sparalizowac-rynek-pracy/\">criticised</a> the fact that the planned measures will limit the possibility of hiring Ukrainians under a simplified procedure.</p><p>They warn that this could “paralyse the labour” market, noting that Ukrainians constitute around 66% of the million or so foreign workers in Poland.</p><p>Lewiatan also criticised the fact that temporary protection would be removed from foreigners who leave Poland for more than 30 days, noting that the bill does not make any exception for employees posted abroad by Polish companies.</p><p>The bill could still be amended while it undergoes work in parliament, where the government has a majority. Once approved by parliament, Nawrocki would have the choice of signing it into law, vetoing it, or sending it to the constitutional court for review.</p><p>While the initial mass arrival of Ukrainian refugees in Poland in 2022 prompted a mass outpouring of support from Poles, many of whom hosted refugees in their own homes, sentiment has recently been turning against them.</p><p>A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/01/07/opposition-to-accepting-ukrainian-refugees-rises-to-highest-ever-level-in-poland/\">poll published this month</a>&nbsp;by state research agency CBOS showed that the proportion of Poles opposed to accepting Ukrainian refugees has risen to 46%, the highest level ever recorded.</p><p>In September, a United Surveys poll for Wirtualna Polska found that 37% of Poles negatively view the presence of Ukrainians in Poland, up from 29.5% two years earlier.</p><p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://notesfrompoland.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/support.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"275\" height=\"97\">\nNotes from Poland is run by a <a href=\"https://notesfrompoland.com/about-us/#editor-team\">small editorial team</a> and published by an independent, non-profit foundation that is funded through donations from our readers.
