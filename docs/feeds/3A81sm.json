      "content": "<p>We spent a lot of time last year calling out <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/02/05/a-25-year-old-is-writing-backdoors-into-the-treasurys-6-trillion-payment-system-what-could-possibly-go-wrong/\">how dangerous it was</a> that Elon Musk and his inexperienced 4chan-loving DOGE boys were gaining access to some of the most secure government systems. We also highlighted how it seemed likely that they were <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/02/18/in-a-monday-night-declaration-the-white-house-admits-musk-and-doge-violated-the-cfaa-although-they-might-not-realize-it/\">violating many laws</a> in the process. One specific point of concern was DOGE’s desire <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/09/10/the-untold-saga-of-what-happened-when-doge-stormed-social-security/\">to take control</a> over Social Security data, something that many people warned would be <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/11/14/details-of-dhs-agreement-reveal-risks-of-trump-administrations-use-of-social-security-data-for-voter-citizenship-checks/\">abused for political reasons</a>, in particular to make misleading or false claims about voting records.</p><p>For all the people who insisted that this was hyperbolic nonsense, and DOGE was just there to root out “waste, fraud, and abuse,” well… the DOJ last week quietly admitted that the DOGE boys almost certainly <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/20/trump-musk-doge-social-security-00737245\">violated the Hatch Act</a> and had given social security data to conspiracy theorists claiming Trump won the 2020 election (he did not).</p><p>Oh, and this only came out because the DOJ realized it had lied to a court (they claim it was because the Social Security Administration officials had given them bad info, but the net effect is the same) and had to correct the record.</p><blockquote><p><em>Shapiro’s previously unreported disclosure, dated Friday, came as part of a list of “corrections” to testimony by top SSA officials during last year’s legal battles over DOGE’s access to Social Security data. They revealed that DOGE team members shared data on unapproved “third-party” servers and may have accessed private information that had been ruled off-limits by a court at the time.</em></p><p><em>Shapiro said the case of the two DOGE team members appeared to undermine a previous assertion by SSA that DOGE’s work was intended to “detect fraud, waste and abuse” in Social Security and modernize the agency’s technology.</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><em>Also in his March 12 declaration, Mr. Russo attested that, “[t]he overall goal of the work performed by SSA’s DOGE Team is to detect fraud, waste and abuse in SSA programs and to provide recommendations for action to the Acting Commissioner of SSA, the SSA Office of the Inspector General, and the Executive Office of the President.”….</em></p><p><em>However, SSA determined in its recent review that in March 2025,</em><strong><em>a political advocacy group contacted two members of SSA’s DOGE Team with a request to analyze state voter rolls</em></strong><em>that the advocacy group had acquired.</em><strong><em>The advocacy group’s stated aim was to find evidence of voter fraud and to overturn election results</em></strong><em>in certain States. In connection with these communications,</em><strong><em>one of the DOGE team members signed a “Voter Data Agreement,” in his capacity as an SSA employee, with the advocacy group</em></strong><em>. He sent the executed agreement to the advocacy group on March 24, 2025.</em></p></blockquote><p>The filing goes on to admit that the declaration from a Social Security administration employee that there were safeguards in place against sharing data, and that everyone had received training in not sharing data, was apparently wrong.</p><blockquote><p><em>However, SSA has learned that, beginning March 7, 2025, and continuing until March 17 (approximately one week before the TRO was entered), members of SSA’s DOGE Team were using links to share data through the third-party server “Cloudflare.” Cloudflare is not approved for storing SSA data and when used in this manner is outside SSA’s security protocols. SSA did not know, until its recent review, that DOGE Team members were using Cloudflare during this period. Because Cloudflare is a third-party entity, SSA has not been able to determine exactly what data were shared to Cloudflare or whether the data still exist on the server.</em></p></blockquote><p>Cool cool. No big deal. DOGE boys just put incredibly private data on a third party server and no one knows what data was there or even </p><p>Have I got some waste, fraud, and abuse for you to check out!</p><p>Separately, the filing reveals that Elon Musk’s right hand man, Steve Davis—the “fixer” Musk deploys across all his organizations—was copied on an email containing an encrypted file of SSA data. The filing is careful to note that DOGE itself “never had access to SSA systems of record,” but that’s a distinction without much difference when your guy is getting emailed password-protected files derived from those systems. Oh and: SSA still can’t open the file to figure out exactly what was in it.</p><blockquote><p><em>However, SSA has determined that on March 3, 2025—three weeks prior to entry of the TRO—an SSA DOGE Team member copied Mr. Steve Davis, who was then a senior advisor to Defendant U.S. DOGE Temporary Organization, as well as a DOGE-affiliated employee at the Department of Labor (“DOL”), on an email to Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). The email attached an encrypted and password-protected file that SSA believes contained SSA data. Despite ongoing efforts by SSA’s Chief Information Office, SSA has been unable to access the file to determine exactly what it contained. From the explanation of the attached file in the email body and based on what SSA had approved to be released to DHS, SSA believes that the encrypted attachment contained PII derived from SSA systems of record, including names and addresses of approximately 1,000 people.</em></p></blockquote><p>Looks like some more waste, fraud, and abuse right there.</p><p>So to recap: the team that stormed in to root out “waste, fraud, and abuse” committed what looks an awful lot like  fraud and abuse—sharing data on unauthorized servers, misleading courts, cutting deals with election conspiracy groups, and emailing around encrypted files of PII that the agency itself can’t even open anymore. All of it now documented in federal court filings—not that anyone will do anything about it. Accountability is for people who don’t have Elon Musk on speed dial.</p>",

Adult content creators use it to sell custom videos and subscriptions, and perform live on camera. French recently <a href=\"https://archive.is/dZs5v?ref=404media.co#selection-563.0-567.230\"><u>changed her personal website</u></a> to state her new goal is to “transition one million people out of the adult industry and do everything we can to ensure no one new enters it.” The statement follows posts on X’s ManyVids account about new strategies to pivot the site toward safe-for-work, non-sexual content.</p><p>This sudden shift away from years of messaging about being a compatriot with sex workers, combined with bizarre AI-generated text and images about talking to aliens and numerology on social media, has made some creators worry for their livelihoods, and caused others to leave the site completely.</p><p>For years, the official ManyVids social media accounts made mostly normal posts that promoted the site and its creators. But in mid-2025, the posts from the ManyVids X account changed. Instead of promotions of top creators, announcements of contests, and tips for using the platform, the account shifted its focus to existential and metaphysical musings. Around August, it started posting cryptic quotes, phrases, and images, many seemingly generated by or about AI.&nbsp;</p><p>The account also started replying to engagement-farming posts from influencers, writing things like “Our purpose: to protect the feminine energy — so that balance may return,” and posting borderline-nonsensical bullet-point lists about “the boldness scale” and how ManyVids leadership is “all connected.”&nbsp;</p><p>“The impact strength of a positive leader ⚡ Effectiveness ⚡ Execution ⚡ Discipline ⚡ Accountability,” one <a href=\"https://x.com/ManyVids/status/1961751838199312409?ref=404media.co\"></a> in August said. On August 20, <a href=\"https://x.com/ManyVids/status/1958146496257290324/photo/1?ref=404media.co\"><u>@ManyVids posted an image</u></a> on X of a flow chart alongside a screenshot of a ChatGPT conversation, seemingly illustrating how the platform would bring in users through a “safe-for-work” zone, then allow them to access NSFW content after verifying their identifications. “Our vision: Adult Industry 2.0 isn’t about more revenue. It’s about evolution,” the post said.&nbsp;</p><p>The replies to these posts show ManyVids creators expressing anger, concern, and bafflement. The account stopped posting on X in September. But on the ManyVids platform itself, which has a “news” feed that functions similarly to a microblogging platform but is just for official platform posts, the odd entries continue.</p><div><div><b><strong>Do you know anything else about what's happening at ManyVids, or do you have a tip about porn platforms and online sex work generally? I would love to hear from you. Using a non-work device, you can message me securely on Signal at sam.404. Otherwise, send me an email at sam@404media.co.</strong></b></div></div><p>“Social API for the AI Age. Phase 1 — Pride Engine,” one post from January 16 says:&nbsp;</p><p><em>“The High Universal Income (HUI) Engine is the distribution hub of the new economy, built for a world where AI does the work humans never wanted to do. AI generates surplus wealth, but humans need surplus purpose. Human meaning becomes the rarest and most valuable resource on Earth. Instead of opaque taxes, AI companies fund a Social License through platforms like ManyVids, converting AI efficiency into merit-based bonuses for human contribution. For every dollar earned through passion, creation, care, or learning, HUI adds 10%. This is not charity. It is a Pride Engine. We shift the foundation of human value.”</em></p><p>The post ends with a six-second AI generated video that includes the phrase “the ultimate guide to rebuilding civilization.” Most posts in recent weeks are like this: clearly AI generated text alongside six-second AI generated clips showing angels, chakras, or spiritual phrases. “The Simulation of Integrity. If we don’t fully understand the ultimate nature of reality, what should guide how we live inside it?” one recent post says. “If the nature of the ‘game’ is unknown, then how you treat others — and yourself — becomes the most meaningful data point.”&nbsp;</p><p>And in a post right after the new year: “Hey everyone! Back-to-the-office Monday vibe. How were your holidays? Did you travel anywhere? I did... 🕳️Next time, I’ll bring sunglasses. I came back with a few new ideas and fresh thoughts ✨Let’s get to work. Let’s go, 2026! 🚀” Below the text: a video of French in a space suit, black hole in the background, shooting laser-lightning out of her eyes.</p><p>A lot of people who rely on ManyVids for income have noticed this odd behavior and are disturbed by it.&nbsp;</p><p>“Ethical dilemmas about AI aside, the posts are completely disconnected with ManyVids as a site,” one ManyVids content creator told 404 Media, on the condition of anonymity. “Their customers and their creators are not served in any way by these. When faced with backlash, MV removed the ability to comment on posts. To anyone looking at them they appear to be ramblings and images generated by a person in active psychosis.”&nbsp;</p><p>Almost every ManyVids creator 404 Media spoke to for this story brought up “AI psychosis” unprompted, when asked if they’d seen the ManyVids posts.&nbsp;</p><p>“I have seen them and I find them really insulting,” <a href=\"http://www.sydneyscreams4u.com/?ref=404media.co\"></a> said. “The way I perceive the posts is that Bella and the MV team doesn't respect their creators enough to spend time making their own content, instead taking the easy way out and using bizarre AI that doesn't even relate. Why do we need Bella shooting laser beams out of her eyes to make an announcement? It's infuriating because it's like she doesn't take us seriously, doesn't take her own platform seriously, and we're supposed to just be grateful for the crumbs she's giving us. We deserve better,” she said. “We deserve to be treated with respect, talked to like we're adults, and listened to like our voices matter. Instead we get AI slop and posts that promise big things without any sort of follow through.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://linktr.ee/harlanparamore?ref=404media.co\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Harlan Paramore</a>, a ManyVids creator who also helps other creators onboard and manage their selling sites, said he’s noticed “bizarre posts about AI, angel numbers, christopaganism, cyberpaganism.”&nbsp;</p><p>“I don't have anything against any of those beliefs, but they seem wildly out of place for an official site blog. They are also heavily loaded with AI-like language and structure, and decorated with AI images,” Paramore said. “I'm also a professional artist, and as both an artist and sex worker I'm frustrated and confused. Some of it kind of sounds like AI psychosis, too, which has me concerned for whoever is running that blog.”&nbsp;</p><p>“I'm not a mental health professional, but whatever Bella is going through doesn't seem normal. It doesn't seem healthy,” Screams said. “From where I'm sitting, if I were close to Bella, I'd be reaching out to her other friends and family members to stage an intervention and try to get her serious mental health care.”&nbsp;</p><p>All of this is coinciding with an apparent massive change in French’s ideology toward sex work. On <a href=\"https://archive.is/dZs5v?ref=404media.co\"></a>, French says the goal of ManyVids is changing to “transition one million people out of the adult industry.” She calls sex work “exploitative.” Her bio quotes her as saying: “I had two choices: surrender to an exploitative industry or dismantle it. I chose to build its replacement... ManyVids was the result—the most efficient revenue-distribution engine for the AI-displaced workforce. Guided by first principles and core value thinking, Bella is leading MV’s next evolution: a Fintech/Social-Impact hybrid that turns digital presence into economic creation. By utilizing AI-integrated workflows and layered access, ManyVids is migrating creators from adult content into a diversified creative economy,” her bio says. “Our goal is to transition one million people out of the adult industry and do everything we can to ensure no one new enters it. We are working to transform an industry we don’t believe should exist—but we recognize that simple elimination creates deeper shadows. The solution is elevation through meaningful alternatives.”&nbsp;</p><p>This is a recent addition to her website. According to <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20251129105525/https://www.bellafrench.com/bella-french-bio\"><u>archived versions of the site</u></a>, the section about transitioning people out of the sex industry wasn’t there in November 2025.&nbsp;</p><p>“ManyVids is now becoming a regulated e-social ecosystem — a digital space that sensitizes, elevates, and restricts adult content through layered brackets of access,” French’s bio says now. “This ensures that sacred sexual expression is never free, never exploited, and never divorced from its core human depth.” The “layered brackets” seem to be a reference to the ChatGPT screenshots from August 20.&nbsp;</p><p>This is an extreme departure in tone from what French has said was her mission with ManyVids in the past. In 2019, I met French for an on-background hotel room meeting during the porn industry’s biggest award show and conference, AVN, where she told me she created ManyVids out of a passion to create a platform where other sex workers—having been an adult content creator herself—would be treated fairly and would be listened to by the platform’s owners. French is a former cam model herself, and has always been open publicly about wanting to create better platforms for other sex workers.</p><blockquote>“Their customers and their creators are not served in any way by these.\" </blockquote><p>“We try to offer sex workers the tools to be more successful as independent entrepreneurs without being judged,” French <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/bella-french-ceo-of-manyvids-the-former-cam-girl-shaking-up-the-porn-world/?ref=404media.co\"><u>told the Daily Beast in 2019</u></a>. “What was really important for me was to educate the world and make them realize that porn stars are not stupid.”</p><p>Shortly after she and I met in 2019, French agreed to a written interview as part of <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/how-cam-models-changed-the-porn-world-forever-v26n3/?ref=404media.co\"><u>a VICE story about authenticity in cam work</u></a>. In that email, she called camming the “biggest gift” she’d ever received. “Being a camgirl not only has a huge influence on my approach to taking business decisions but has changed the way I view people and life in general,” French wrote at the time. “Every single decision we take at ManyVids must answer 1 simple question, ‘Will this help the content creators, our MV Stars?’ That’s it,” French wrote in 2019. “If the answer is yes then we proceed, regardless if there is any financial advantage or potential for profit, that is irrelevant.”&nbsp;</p><p>Platforms have long profited off of sex workers and pornography to establish popularity and rake in revenue before eventually doing a heel-turn on the creators who made them successful. We’ve seen it happen with mainstream social media platforms like Tumblr, Instagram, and Twitter, and also on sites ostensibly made for sex workers, like OnlyFans, <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/onlyfans-says-it-will-suspend-porn-ban/?ref=404media.co\" rel=\"noreferrer\">which nearly changed its policies</a> to ban explicit material after making billions of dollars off their content. &nbsp;</p><p>I asked ManyVids and French if the platform is changing to reflect these social media posts and her statements on her bio, who is making the AI-generated posts mentioned above, how French plans to “transition one million people” out of sex work, and if any of this will affect creators and fans who use ManyVids. The ManyVids support team did not answer these questions specifically, but sent the following response (emphasis theirs): </p><p>\"Hello,&nbsp;thanks for reaching out.<strong> Respect for Online Sex Workers</strong>. Sex work is real work. No more living in the shadows, no more being misunderstood.No more being afraid, shadowbanned, or persecuted by systems and institutions. Not on our watch.&nbsp;<strong>We are not victims — and we are taking action now.</strong>This generation of online sex workers is about to&nbsp;<strong>change the game forever&nbsp;—</strong>and transform the oldest profession in the world in the right direction,&nbsp; Respect the creators. Respect the work. Respect what you watch. We stand for&nbsp;<strong>safety, dignity, and opportunity for all creators</strong>.\"</p><p>I asked ManyVids to explain in specific terms what \"we are taking action now\" means. They replied: \"A post will be published to our ManyVids News feed this Saturday, January 24th. It will provide additional clarification and go into a bit more detail on this,\" with a <a href=\"https://www.manyvids.com/Activity/manyvids/186095/club?ref=404media.co\" rel=\"noreferrer\">link to the feed</a>.</p><blockquote>“It concerns me that access to my earnings, and more importantly my personal information, is in the hands of someone seemingly out of touch with reality.”&nbsp;</blockquote><p>In the meantime, creators have been confused and worried for weeks. Nothing has changed about the way the site operates publicly or creators’ payouts as of writing, but this is a series of events that many adult content creators are concerned represents a potential threat to their livelihood.</p><p>“If something were to happen to MV (or to my account there) due to what can only be described as AI psychosis, I would lose upwards of 14k per year—a not insignificant amount of income,” another adult creator on ManyVids told 404 Media. “It concerns me that access to my earnings, and more importantly my personal information, is in the hands of someone seemingly out of touch with reality.”&nbsp;</p><p>ManyVids takes a larger-than-most <a href=\"https://help.manyvids.com/hc/en-ca/articles/44004301351443-What-are-the-payout-percentages-on-MV?ref=404media.co\"><u>cut from creators' profits</u></a>, depending on the type of content: For videos and contest earnings (which are similar to tips), the platform takes 40 percent. On tips and custom video sales, it takes 20 percent, which is more in line with other adult platforms. This has been a source of complaint from creators for a long time, combined with unpredictable algorithms that creators say change how they’re discovered on the platform and what content performs best, impacting their earnings. Users have expressed dissatisfaction with these aspects of the platform, and how French runs it, for years. But the recent turn to AI and French’s statements about the industry are making some wonder if it’s time to leave.&nbsp;</p><p>“I will still be using ManyVids for NSFW content for as long as they allow it,” adult content creator <a href=\"https://allmylinks.com/augusttheslut?ref=404media.co\" rel=\"noreferrer\">August</a> told 404 Media. “But part of me thinks that they will try to do what OnlyFans did years ago and try to ban NSFW content which would be an absolute disaster for sex workers whose income depends on platforms like ManyVids.”&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://lunasapphire.com/?ref=404media.co\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Luna Sapphire</a>, a creator who has been using the platform since 2015, said she finds French’s statements on her website “harmful and insulting” to those who’ve helped popularize the site from the start. “Most of us are not looking for a path out of the adult industry; we simply want to do our jobs with as little interference and censorship as possible,” Sapphire said. “Bella used to be very pro-sex worker and it is disappointing to see her change her tune.”</p><p>Several adult platforms have embraced, or at least allowed, AI-generated content and “models” on their sites alongside human creators in the last few years. On OnlyFans, AI-generated is allowed, but must comply with the site’s terms of service and and “must be clearly and conspicuously captioned as AI Generated Content with a signifier such as #ai, or #AIGenerated,” Onlyfans <a href=\"https://onlyfans.com/terms?ref=404media.co\"></a> in its terms. Fansly, another adult platform for independent creators, <a href=\"https://help.fansly.com/en/articles/12315578-ai-generated-content-on-fansly?ref=404media.co\"></a> “photorealistic AI-generated content” but allows non-photorealistic “virtual entities” (like V-tubers) if they’re registered using the uploader’s real legal information for verification purposes. JustForFans requires that “consent, identity, and proof of age must be established if the AI images are based on a real person's likeness,” and allows deepfakes if consent has been established. “For example, you can use your own face to create images of yourself or a model who has granted consent to use their face,” the platform’s <a href=\"https://justfor.fans/legal?tab=p-Prohibited&amp;ref=404media.co\"></a> IWantClips, another site for selling custom content, <a href=\"https://iwantempire.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/44002478435-ai-generated-and-animated-content?ref=404media.co\"></a> users making AI-generated models to verify their identities, but explicitly doesn’t allow deepfakes.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://blog.iwantclips.com/iwc-valentines-best-selling-clip-contest-winners-2024/?ref=404media.co\"></a>, IWantClips awarded an AI-generated model $1,000 as the winner of a Valentine’s Day-themed contest. “Adora” competed in the contest alongside human sex workers. On most of these sites, engagement and attention are currency, and on ManyVids, AI generated models <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/ai-generated-grandma-porn-is-flooding-the-internet/\"><u>sell content alongside humans</u></a>. The platform <a href=\"https://help.manyvids.com/hc/en-ca/articles/44167865052819-Terms-for-Users-Members?ref=404media.co\"></a> “AI-generated or deepfake content that misrepresents real individuals without consent,” as part of its terms that forbid “content that violates any third party's intellectual property rights or another individual's privacy.”</p><p>“The AI/intense spirituality path has been so strange to witness, and I can’t imagine what it’s leaving the fans to think,” Elizabeth Fields, an adult content creator who’s used ManyVids for six years, told 404 Media. “I don’t understand what they are trying to do by taking this direction, nor do I understand how it’s fair of a sexwork built site to assume all of us don’t want to do NSFW content–and to try and funnel us into this box of ‘not enjoying the work we do. To an extent it feels degrading honestly—just because Bella’s experience in sex work was survival based and to make ends meet—a lot of us thoroughly enjoy our jobs, the path we took, and want to continue doing this.”&nbsp;</p><p>Many sex workers are disabled, neurodivergent, mentally ill, chronically ill, or “all of the above,” Fields noted, and rely on online sex work to pay the bills. “It feels absolutely unfair to feel like we could be pushed off of a site that became popular off OUR NSFW content—because they want to make it more SFW, and implement all these new AI features that will quite frankly just turn clients off.”&nbsp;</p><p>Despite all of this, Fields said she won’t be leaving the site. “To the point that as much as I'm extremely disappointed with many of the recent changes occurring, I won’t be deleting my account as to not lose that income and disappoint my ManyVids fans.”&nbsp;</p><p>Others are done. Sydney Screams said she’s no longer uploading to ManyVids and made the decision to slowly start removing content from her stores there. “Platforms that allow for online sex work should be working FOR us, not against us. Sex workers use platforms like MV to earn our own living, to enable ourselves to have better lives, to keep ourselves housed and fed, to pay for medical bills, etc. Many of us choose this life and choose to make this our career, though there are far too many who are survival sex workers,” Screams said. “We aren't looking for a pathway out of the adult industry, especially on a platform that is a porn platform!!! Unless MV is going to start funding the educations &amp; trainings of those trying to leave the industry for work elsewhere, I do not see how a porn platform is going to create a path out of the industry.”&nbsp;</p><p><em>Emanuel Maiberg contributed reporting to this story.</em></p>",

      "content": "How would Sony ceding control of its TV hardware business change the industry? The Verge has an optimistic take: [...] As of today, Sony already relies on different manufacturing partners to create its TV lineup. While display panel manufacturers never reveal who they sell panels to, Sony is likely already using panels for its LCD TVs from TCL China Star Optoelectronics Technology (CSOT), in addition to OLED panels from LG Display and Samsung Display. With this deal, a relationship between Sony and TCL CSOT LCD panels is guaranteed (although I doubt this would affect CSOT selling panels to other manufacturers). And with TCL CSOT building a new OLED facility, there's a potential future in which Sony OLEDs will also get panels from TCL. Although I should point out that we're not sure yet if the new facility will have the ability to make TV-sized OLED panels, at least to start. \n\n[...] There's some concern from fans that this could lead to a Sharp, Toshiba, or Pioneer situation where the names are licensed and the TVs produced are a shell of what the brands used to represent. I don't see this happening with Sony. While the electronics side of the business hasn't been as strong as in the past, Sony -- and Bravia -- is still a storied brand. It would take a lot for Sony to completely step aside and allow another company to slap its name on an inferior product. And based on TCL's growth and technological improvements over the past few years, and the shrinking gap between premium and midrange TVs, I don't expect Sony TVs will suffer from a partnership with TCL.",

The previous version of the agreement contained a general prohibition on robots, spiders, scrapers, and automated data gathering tools but did not mention AI agents or LLMs by name.</p><p>At first glance, the phrase \"agentic commerce\" may sound like aspirational marketing jargon, but the tools are already here, and people are apparently using them.

      "content": "<p>Last week <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2026/01/16/trump-fcc-helps-verizon-make-it-harder-for-you-to-switch-wireless-carriers/\">we noted how the Trump FCC</a>, at the direct request of wireless phone giants, destroyed popular rules making it easier and cheaper to switch wireless carriers. The rules, applied via spectrum acquisition and merger conditions, required that Verizon unlock your phone within 60 days after purchase so you could easily switch to competitors.</p><p>Verizon, as we’ve long established, hates competition, and immediately got to work lobbying the Trump administration to destroy the rules. The pay-to-play Trump administration quickly agreed, and now Verizon has started telling wireless customers <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/verizon-starts-requiring-365-days-of-paid-service-before-it-will-unlock-phones/\">they have to wait a year before switching phones</a> after purchasing one from Verizon:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Verizon was previously required to unlock phones automatically after 60 days due to restrictions imposed on its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2008/05/verizon-we-promise-to-honor-the-block-c-open-access-rules/\">spectrum licenses</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-21-121A1.pdf\">merger conditions</a>&nbsp;that helped Verizon obtain approval of its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/09/verizon-to-buy-tracfone-expanding-big-carriers-control-of-prepaid-industry/\">purchase of TracFone</a>. But an update applied today to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tfwunlockpolicy.com/wps/portal/home/\">TracFone unlocking policy</a>&nbsp;said new phones will be locked for at least a year and that each customer will have to request an unlock instead of getting it automatically.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Again, these conditions were broadly popular and served the public interest, ensuring that it was easier for consumers to switch between our ever-consolidating, anti-competitive wireless phone giants. Verizon lobbied the FCC by repeatedly lying, without evidence, that these conditions <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2026/01/16/trump-fcc-helps-verizon-make-it-harder-for-you-to-switch-wireless-carriers/\">resulted in a wave of black market phone thefts</a>. FCC boss Brendan Carr, ever the industry lackey, parroted the claims in his rulings.</p><p>To be clear this is, for now, only something Verizon is doing via its prepaid sub-brands that include Straight Talk, Tracfone, Net10 Wireless, Clearway, Total Wireless, Simple Mobile, SafeLink Wireless, and Walmart Family Mobile. These brands often attract lower income customers who can least afford to be trapped under an expensive provider like this.</p><p>You can, for now, still buy an unlocked phone from an independent retailer, bring it to Verizon’s main postpaid brands, and port it back out again if you’d like. But when Verizon sees limited Democrat and press backlash  to this first push (guaranteed with so much else going on), it will steadily keep expanding its restrictions to include its primary brands and all unlocked phones.</p><p>I know this because I’ve covered this company for a quarter century and this company’s anti-competitive ambitions are as predictable as the tides.</p><p>Ideally, Verizon wants to return to what it considers the golden era of cellular phones: circa 2007 or so when carriers restricted how you could use your phone and restricted what apps you could install (remember all the shitty VCast Verizon apps they wouldn’t let you uninstall? Or the way they’d <a href=\"https://community.verizon.com/discussion/59470/verizon-blocks-gps-to-most-third-party-apps\">block phone GPS hardware from working on third-party apps</a>?). Back then, they would also tether you to one carrier via expensive long-term contracts with costly early termination fees.</p><p>If we stay on this path of zero U.S. corporate oversight, it’s all coming back, sooner or later. From there, should U.S. governance remain under corrupt authoritarian dominance, it’s only a matter of time before Verizon tries to dictate what content you can see in collaboration with the kakistocracy, thanks to the <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/01/07/u-s-media-once-again-fails-to-cover-the-corrupt-net-neutrality-ruling-with-any-clarity/\">Trump administration’s destruction of popular net neutrality protections</a>. </p><p>This has always been Verizon’s ambition as a lumbering telecom giant that can’t innovate and hates competition and government oversight. Thanks to Trump’s assault on regulators, it’s increasingly difficult to hold companies like AT&amp;T and Verizon accountable for literally anything (see the <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/04/23/5th-circuit-obediently-lets-att-off-the-hook-for-major-location-data-privacy-violations/\">5th Circuit’s decision to let AT&amp;T off the hook</a> for lying to, and spying on, its users). </p><p>And the Trump administration’s ongoing quest to rubber stamp every merger that comes across its desk means more consolidation, and ultimately higher prices for U.S. wireless consumers who already pay some of the highest prices for mobile data in the developed world.</p><p>Verizon and other broadly despised telecoms have struck a generational blow against oversight and consumer protection across Trump’s two terms, and they intend to take full advantage of a presidency they helped purchase. All while the president informs his loyal rubes he’s a champion of affordability.</p>",

      "content": "An anonymous reader quotes a report from Inside Climate News: Just 32 companies accounted for over half of global fossil carbon emissions in 2024, according to a report published Wednesday by the U.K.-based think tank InfluenceMap. That is down from 36 companies responsible for half the global CO2 emissions in 2023, and 38 companies five years ago. The analysis is the latest update to the Carbon Majors database, which tracks the world's largest oil, gas, coal and cement producers and uses production data to calculate the carbon emissions from each entity's production. The database, first developed by researcher Richard Heede and now hosted by InfluenceMap, quantifies current and historical emissions attributable to nearly 180 companies and provides annual updates. It is the only database of its kind tracking corporate-generated carbon emissions dating back to the start of the Industrial Revolution, research that's being used in efforts to hold major polluters accountable for climate harms.\n \nDespite dire warnings from scientists about the consequences of accelerating climate change, fossil fuel production is continuing apace. Last year, fossil fuel CO2 emissions reached a record high, topping 38 billion metric tons. In 2024 these emissions were 37.4 billion metric tons -- up 0.8 percent from 2023 -- and traceable to 166 oil, gas, coal and cement producers, according to the report. Much of the global carbon emissions in 2024 came from state-owned entities, which represented 16 of the top 20 emitters. The five largest emitters overall -- Saudi Arabia's Aramco, Coal India, China's CHN Energy, National Iranian Oil Co. and Russia's Gazprom -- were all state-controlled, and accounted for 18 percent of the total fossil CO2 emissions in 2024.\n \nExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell, ConocoPhillips and BP -- the top five emitting investor-owned companies -- together were responsible for 5.5 percent of the total emissions in that year. Historically, ExxonMobil and Chevron rank in the top five for fossil carbon emissions generated from 1854 through 2024, accounting for 2.79 percent and 3.08 percent of overall carbon pollution, respectively. According to the analysis, the 178 entities in the database have generated 70 percent of fossil CO2 emissions since the start of the Industrial Revolution, and just 22 entities are responsible for one-third of these emissions. \"Each year, global emissions become increasingly concentrated among a shrinking group of high-emitting producers, while overall production continues to grow. Simultaneously, these heavy emitters continue to use lobbying to obstruct a transition that the scientific community has known for decades is essential,\" said Emmett Connaire, senior analyst at InfluenceMap. The findings of the new analysis, he added, \"underscore the growing importance of this kind of rigorous evidence in efforts to determine accountability for climate-related losses.\"",

      "content": "<h2>Data-based Ranking of Privacy-Relevant Methods</h2><p>Our data-based ranking is designed to identify and prioritize privacy-relevant methods in Java and JavaScript applications. This ranking process comprises several stages, as depicted in Fig. 3, using   <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-ma037wh.png\" alt=\"Fig. 3. Overview of the Java ranking. The circled numbers represent different static analysis tools used forthe analysis step. Soot was applied to Java bytecode, while Semgrep was used for source code analysis.\"></p><p>\\\nthe Java ranking as an example. By analyzing data from real-world applications, we aim to provide a practical guide for identifying methods that are most relevant for privacy concerns.</p><h3><strong>7.1 Library Selection for Data-based Ranking</strong></h3><p>To focus our data-based ranking on the most relevant libraries, we selected the top 25 libraries from NPM for JavaScript and Maven for Java, shown below in Table 2. Our selection criteria were based on the libraries’ relevance to personal data processing, as aligned with our set of labels for personal data processing activities. This selection was made through a systematic review of each library’s documentation, specifically targeting functionalities that are related to personal data processing.</p><h3><strong>7.2 Method Invocation Analysis</strong></h3><p>We employed static analysis tools to identify method invocations and analyze data flows within the code. For Java, we used Soot [14] to construct call graphs and trace method invocations. In the case of JavaScript, we used ESLint 1 for its capabilities in Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) analysis. Our analysis matched these invocations to our list of native privacy-relevant methods, providing a view of how these methods are used in practice.</p><h3><strong>7.3 Selecting Open-source Applications</strong></h3><p>To rank privacy-relevant methods, we selected 30 popular open-source GitHub projects with over 100 stars in Java and JavaScript. We focused on applications processing personal data rather than frameworks and libraries. The selection included 15 Java applications such as the e-commerce software Shopizer, and 15 JavaScript applications like the chat application RocketChat. We also included projects predominantly in Java/JavaScript that use other languages like TypeScript for some modules.</p><p>\\\nCriteria were: popularity (applications with high stars, indicating broader relevance), data sensitivity (applications processing personal or sensitive data, highly relevant for privacy reviews), diversity (applications from different domains and languages, showing wide applicability), and public availability (open source code enables reproducibility and transparency). The details of these selected projects are provided in Table 4.   <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-6a1374h.png\" alt=\"Table 2. Selected popular libraries: 25 for each language\"></p><h3><strong>7.4 Efficient Analysis of Library Imports</strong></h3><p>To make the analysis efficient, we first identified the libraries imported by each application. For standard libraries, we assumed their presence in most applications. For API libraries, we examined import statements and configuration files to narrow down our focus to the top 50 pre-selected libraries, 25 each for Java and JavaScript.</p><h3><strong>7.5 Ranking Privacy-relevant Methods in Top 30 Applications</strong></h3><p>We employed Semgrep to monitor the flow of personal data into privacy-relevant methods invoked by application code. Utilizing Semgrep’s DeepSemgrep 2 capability for cross-file analysis, we were able to comprehensively analyze data flows across entire applications, as opposed to only examining isolated code snippets. This provided a holistic perspective of how personal data propagates across different components. Using Semgrep’s taint analysis and the rules outlined in Section 6, we traced personal data flows to privacy-relevant methods.</p><p>\\\nTo assess the practical relevance of our identified privacy-relevant methods, we introduce the following usage-based metrics, presented in Table 3: We ranked privacy-relevant methods by analyzing their usage in the 30 popular GitHub projects introduced above, with an average of 358 application methods processing personal data per application. This varied by language and type: Java applications averaged 288 methods, while JavaScript had 363. The higher average in JavaScript was likely due to its more diverse front-end processing, reflecting the complexity and multifaceted nature of these applications.   <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-l4237q4.png\" alt=\"Table 3. Usage-Based Metrics for Ranking Privacy-relevant Methods \"></p><p>To better focus our approach, we calculated the proportion of application methods that both invoke a privacy-relevant method and process a concrete flow of personal data (there is confirmed personal data flow into the method). This is relative to the total number of methods in the application. This metric indicates the level of focus in identifying privacy-relevant methods, allowing developers to narrow their efforts to a more relevant subset of the code. In essence, our approach aims to minimize the code sections that need scrutiny, saving both time and resources. For more details on these proportions in selected open-source Java and JavaScript/TypeScript applications, see Table 4.</p><p>Our study reveals that, on average, only 4.2% of the total codebase is made up of methods that are privacy-relevant and involved in personal data processing. This result highlights the precision of our approach in pinpointing privacy-relevant methods in applications.</p><p><strong>Usage Patterns of Privacy-Relevant Methods</strong> In Java applications, we observed a more conservative use of privacy-relevant methods, particularly those from popular Maven libraries. Native Java methods, along with methods from Apache Commons and the Spring framework, were frequently used for handling personal data. Libraries such as slf4j for logging and auth0 for authentication were also commonly used, indicating their importance in the flow and protection of personal data.</p><p>\\\nIn contrast, JavaScript applications exhibited a diverse range of library usage. While lodash was commonly used, frameworks like Angular, React, and Vue.js played a significant role in personal data processing, particularly in front-end applications. Table 5 presents the top five packages in both Java and JavaScript that contain methods relevant to privacy concerns.</p><p><strong>Categories of Privacy-relevant Methods</strong> We categorized privacy-relevant methods into types to gain insights into their roles in personal data processing. Our analysis identified several Java classes and categories that are frequently involved in personal data processing. For example, common Java classes like org.slf4j.Logger and auth0.client.Auth0Client are often used in operations that handle personal data.</p><p>\\\nIn terms of categories, Data Processing and Transformation, Network Communication, and Logging Methods were most prevalent. These categories indicate areas where privacy-relevant methods are most commonly used, suggesting that they are key to understanding how personal data is processed in codebases (Table 6). Identity and Access Management, Data Encryption and Cryptography, and Data Storage and Database Management were also highly involved in personal data flows, with involvement percentages of 92%, 78%, and 85%, respectively.</p><p>\\\nConversely, categories like Data Processing and Transformation, Network Communication, and Logging Methods were less involved, with percentages of 67%, 44%, and 28%. Table 7 lists Java classes that are frequently involved in personal data processing, serving as key indicators for identifying privacy-relevant methods in applications.</p><ol></ol>",

      "content": "Ars Technica's Benj Edwards reports: On Saturday, tech entrepreneur Siqi Chen released an open source plugin for Anthropic's Claude Code AI assistant that instructs the AI model to stop writing like an AI model. Called \"Humanizer,\" the simple prompt plugin feeds Claude a list of 24 language and formatting patterns that Wikipedia editors have listed as chatbot giveaways. Chen published the plugin on GitHub, where it has picked up over 1,600 stars as of Monday. \"It's really handy that Wikipedia went and collated a detailed list of 'signs of AI writing,'\" Chen wrote on X. \"So much so that you can just tell your LLM to... not do that.\"\n \nThe source material is a guide from WikiProject AI Cleanup, a group of Wikipedia editors who have been hunting AI-generated articles since late 2023. French Wikipedia editor Ilyas Lebleu founded the project. The volunteers have tagged over 500 articles for review and, in August 2025, published a formal list of the patterns they kept seeing.\n \nChen's tool is a \"skill file\" for Claude Code, Anthropic's terminal-based coding assistant, which involves a Markdown-formatted file that adds a list of written instructions (you can see them here) appended to the prompt fed into the large language model (LLM) that powers the assistant. Unlike a normal system prompt, for example, the skill information is formatted in a standardized way that Claude models are fine-tuned to interpret with more precision than a plain system prompt. (Custom skills require a paid Claude subscription with code execution turned on.)\n \nBut as with all AI prompts, language models don't always perfectly follow skill files, so does the Humanizer actually work? In our limited testing, Chen's skill file made the AI agent's output sound less precise and more casual, but it could have some drawbacks: it won't improve factuality and might harm coding ability. [...] Even with its drawbacks, it's ironic that one of the web's most referenced rule sets for detecting AI-assisted writing may help some people subvert it.",

      "content": "<p> is a lead software engineer with a successful career spanning healthcare, FinTech, and cloud architecture. His success wasn’t always assured; in fact, as he puts it, his “story began with setbacks.”&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>In college, I was written off as someone who would never amount to much. Being detained twice was humiliating, but it became the turning point in my life. I realized that if I didn’t take control, no one else would. So, I rebuilt myself with discipline, consistency, and a refusal to quit,” Kunduru says.</p></blockquote><p>That determination and dedication to course-correcting his path led him not only to graduate but also to build a career marked by solving problems others considered impossible.</p><p>Kunduru’s college years were difficult for him, and he admits to struggling with discipline and direction.&nbsp;</p><p>“Many people around me, including my own family, believed I would follow the same path as my father, who never found success,” Kunduru explains.</p><p>It was his discovery of software engineering that inspired him to change his life. He says he was intrigued by building something from “nothing but logic and determination.” Technology was his reset button, and he pushed it.&nbsp;</p><h2>From Startup to Tech Leadership</h2><p>After graduating, Kunduru joined an agriculture-focused startup. As an associate software engineer, he developed impactful technical solutions for the company. He was awarded Employee of the Year and received the Innovation of the Year Award in 2013.</p><p>“That job became my true foundation. Because it was a startup, I had to do everything: front-end, backend API, database, deployment, and support. It forced me to grow rapidly and taught me the value of hard work and responsibility,” Kunduru says.&nbsp;</p><p>Kunduru would later work on high-impact projects for Innova Solutions. Again, his hard work and dedication led to his being promoted twice within four years. He became the principal software engineer, leading a team of 12 engineers.</p><p>After Kunduru moved to the United States in 2020 to work with leading healthcare clients, he was approached by a former client seeking to hire him for his tech leadership and delivery record. He led NLP (natural language processing) and OCR (optical character recognition) initiatives in large-scale healthcare projects. His work processed over 158 million health records to generate insights for entire patient cohorts, revealing patterns that informed care decisions across populations.</p><p>“I’ve been fortunate to build a career defined by curiosity, continuous learning, and solving complex engineering challenges,” Kunduru says.</p><h2>Shifting To Fintech Engineering</h2><p>Kunduru decided to shift his career into the FinTech industry in 2022 when he joined M&amp;T Bank. His hard work, dedication to continuous learning, and results were quickly recognized, leading to his becoming an SME and Tech lead within a year.&nbsp;</p><p>As a team leader of 6 engineers, he oversaw the creation of enterprise-grade microservices and the delivery of an Adobe ColdFusion migration from 2016 to 2023 that improved performance by 33% and reduced server load by 30%, enabling faster, more reliable service for 2.5+ million customers. His engineering leadership earned him second place in the M&amp;T Cybersecurity Secure Coding Tournament and third place in the Secure Coding Championship, competing against engineers across the entire technology organization. \\n “I became the first engineer to successfully establish Kerberos authentication between on-prem Windows servers and Azure COLO at M&amp;T Bank, a feat even Adobe told us was impossible,” Kunduru says.&nbsp;</p><p>Kunduru aspires to remain a technology leader, driving innovations that impact millions of people worldwide. He wants to mentor future engineers who come from “humble or challenging backgrounds” as he did and show them that success is a “decision, not a privilege.”&nbsp;</p><p>“What makes me stand out is not just the technical capability, it’s the resilience.  \\n I went from being labelled a failure to becoming someone recognized for solving problems others give up on.

Government websites saw malicious activity rise from 2% to 12.9%, while 1 in 7 Education websites now show active compromise, quadrupling year‑over‑year. Budget constraints and limited manpower were cited as primary obstacles by public‑sector security leaders.</p><p>The research identifies several widely used third‑party tools as top drivers of unjustified sensitive‑data exposure, including Google Tag Manager (8%), Shopify (5%), and Facebook Pixel (4%), which were frequently found to be over‑permissioned or deployed without adequate scoping.</p><blockquote><p>“Organizations are granting sensitive‑data access by default rather than exception — and attackers are exploiting that gap,” said VP of Product at Reflectiz, Simon Arazi. “This year’s data shows that marketing teams continue to introduce the majority of third‑party risk, while IT lacks visibility into what’s actually running on the website.”</p></blockquote><ul><li><p>64% of apps accessing sensitive data have no valid justification.</p></li><li><p>47% of applications running in payment frames (checkout environments) are unjustified.</p></li><li><p>Compromised sites connect to 2.7× more external domains, load 2× more trackers, and use recently registered domains 3.8× more often than clean sites.</p></li><li><p>Marketing and Digital departments account for 43% of all third‑party risk</p></li></ul><p>The report also introduces updated Security Leadership Benchmarks, highlighting the very small group of organizations meeting all eight criteria. Only one website — ticketweb.uk — achieved a perfect score across the framework.</p><p>The 2026 report includes:</p><ul><li>Sector‑by‑sector breakdowns of web exposure risk</li><li>Full list of high‑risk third‑party applications</li><li>Year‑over‑year industry trends</li><li>Technical indicators of compromise</li><li>Best‑practice controls for security and digital teams</li></ul><p>The complete 43‑page analysis is available for download:</p><p>&nbsp;empowers organizations to secure their websites and digital assets against modern web threats.

TechCrunch reports: The TeraWave constellation will use a mix of 5,280 satellites in low-Earth orbit and 128 in medium-Earth orbit, and Blue Origin plans to deploy the first ones in late 2027. It's not immediately clear how long Blue Origin expects it will take to build out the whole network. The low-Earth orbit satellites Blue Origin is building will use RF connectivity and have a max data transfer speed of 144 Gbps, while the medium-Earth variety will use an optical link that can achieve the much higher 6 Tbps speed. For reference, SpaceX's Starlink currently maxes out at 400 Mbps -- though it plans to launch upgraded satellites that will offer 1 Gbps data transfer in the future. \"We identified an unmet need with customers who were seeking enterprise-grade internet access with higher speeds, symmetrical upload/download speeds, more redundancy, and rapid scalability for their networks. TeraWave solves for these problems,\" Blue Origin said in a statement.",

      "content": "<h3><em>From “rug pulls” to corporate warfare, the rules of software ownership are being rewritten. But a new model—Post-SaaS—might finally offer a way out.</em></h3><p>For decades, the deal was simple: developers gave their time, and companies gave their code. It was an unwritten social contract built on trust. Then, in a few short months, the contract was shredded.</p><p>First came the tremors. In August of 2023, HashiCorp announced that Terraform—the industry standard for infrastructure-as-code—was switching to a “Business Source License,” effectively walling off competitors. The aftershocks followed in March 2024, when Redis, the database powering a considerable chunk of the modern web, abandoned its open-source roots in favor of more restrictive terms.</p><p>To the C-suites, these were necessary pivots to protect revenue from cloud giants like AWS. But to the millions of engineers who had built their careers and stacks on these tools, it felt like something else entirely: a rug pull.</p><p>The premise of these shifts was that the “Open Core” model was broken—that you couldn’t build a profitable business by giving away the recipes. But this reactionary move misses a fundamental truth about the modern software economy. By trying to lock down their code, these companies didn’t just lose the moral high ground; they inadvertently proved that in 2026, the code itself is no longer the asset. The community is.</p><h3>The Revolt: Why You Can’t Close the Barn Door</h3><p>When a company closes a previously open project, they don’t just lose users; they create a martyr.</p><p>The immediate reaction to the Terraform and Redis announcements wasn’t just anger—it was action. The Linux Foundation stepped in, backing “OpenTofu” (a fork of Terraform) and “Valkey” (a fork of Redis). Almost overnight, the original companies found themselves competing against free, community-driven versions of their own products.</p><p>As Madelyn Olson, a core Redis maintainer who left to build Valkey, put it: <em>“I worked on open source Redis for six years… By forming Valkey, contributors can pick up where we left off and continue true open source development.”</em></p><p>The lesson here is stark: You cannot retroactively close a community-built project without destroying your reputation. The talent leaves, the momentum shifts, and the “rug pull” strategy often backfires, creating a new competitor with the moral high ground.</p><p>If the “Rug Pull” is a desperate attempt to monetize the asset, the “Platform” model proves you don’t need to own the asset to monetize it. You need to be the best place to keep it.</p><p>The clearest example of this is Hugging Face. Often described as the “GitHub of AI,” Hugging Face hosts over one million models, datasets, and demos—almost all of them open source and free to download. By the logic of the “Rug Pull” CEOs, this should be a disaster. Why would anyone pay Hugging Face when they can download the Llama 3 weights and run them locally?</p><p>The answer lies in the friction of modern infrastructure. Hugging Face generated over $70 million in revenue (2023), not by gating access to the algorithms, but by selling the “compute” and “enterprise security” required to run them.</p><p>They understood a fundamental truth about developers: we are lazy and busy. We  spin up our own AWS instances, configure the CUDA drivers, and secure the endpoints—or we could pay Hugging Face $0.50 an hour to click a single button labeled “Deploy”.</p><p>This is the Platform Moat. While HashiCorp and Redis were busy building legal fences around their code, Hugging Face was building a toll road. They realized that in an era of abundant open-source software, the scarce resource isn’t the code; it’s the convenience.</p><blockquote><p>\"By trying to lock down their code, these companies didn't just lose the moral high ground; they inadvertently proved that in 2026, the code itself is no longer the asset. The community is.\"</p></blockquote><p>While Hugging Face proves you can build a business  of open source, Meta proves you can use open source to burn a competitor’s business to the ground. This is the strategy known in economics as “Commoditizing the Complement.”</p><p>For OpenAI and Google, the AI model is the product. They spend billions training GPTs and Gemini, intending to rent access to them. Their entire business model relies on the model being a scarce, proprietary secret.</p><p>Enter Meta. By releasing Llama—a state-of-the-art LLM—for free, Mark Zuckerberg isn’t just being altruistic; he is devaluing the core product of his rivals. If developers can get 95% of GPT -4’s performance for $0 by using Llama, the market price for “intelligence” drops toward zero.</p><p>This is a defensive play ripped straight from the 2000s playbook. Just as Google released Android for free to prevent Microsoft and Apple from owning the mobile internet, Meta is releasing Llama to prevent OpenAI from owning the AI internet.</p><p>For the developer, this is a windfall. We get enterprise-grade tools without the enterprise price tag. But let’s be clear about the dynamic: we aren’t being given a gift; we are being handed ammunition in a war between giants. Meta’s bet is simple: if everyone builds on Llama, the ecosystem locks into their standards (PyTorch, etc.), and the “walled gardens” of closed AI find themselves guarding an empty castle.</p><p>Author’s disclaimer: Meta’s AI business strategy and business strategy of their other products like Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp are vastly different, which I, along with many others, try to avoid—but that is a story for another time.</p><h3>Conclusion: The Post-SaaS Reformation</h3><p>If the “Rug Pulls” of 2024 taught us that we can’t trust corporations to keep their code open, and the “AI Wars” taught us that open source is often just a weapon for giants, where does that leave the rest of us?</p><p>It leaves us looking for a third way—one that rejects both the “Rental Economy” of SaaS and the “Rug Pull Risk” of open core.</p><p>Enter the “ONCE” philosophy, championed by 37signals (the creators of Rails). With the launch of Campfire and Writebook, they introduced a model that feels radical simply because it is retro: You pay once. You install it. You own it.</p><p>David Heinemeier Hansson calls this the “Post-SaaS” era. The license isn’t Open Source (you can’t resell it), but it is . More importantly, it is irrevocable. Once you download the code to your server, no board of directors can change the terms. No acquisition by a competitor can shut it down.</p><p>As Hansson puts it: <em>“SaaS is the ultimate trap. You rent your tools, you rent your data, and the landlord can raise the rent whenever they want. ONCE is about returning to software you actually own.”</em></p><p>This is the lesson for the next decade of the software business. The “Moat” is no longer the code—it’s the trust. Developers are tired of building on quicksand. Whether it’s through the “Platform Model” of Hugging Face or the “Ownership Model” of ONCE, the winning companies of 2026 will be the ones that sign a new contract with their users: <em>We don’t want to lock you in. We want to be so good you don’t want to leave.</em></p><p>Are we entering a period in which the most profitable software is free and open for personal use? The time will tell.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Modern businesses run on digital trust. Customers expect their data to be safe, and partners expect operations to be reliable. To meet those expectations, security must be a daily practice, not a yearly project.</p><p>This article walks through practical measures that reduce risk fast. Each section focuses on actions you can apply in most environments. The goal is simple - shrink the attack surface and strengthen your defences without adding needless complexity.</p><h2>Assessing Your Risk Landscape</h2><p>Start with a clear view of what you must protect. List your critical assets, map where sensitive data lives, and note who can access it. This inventory becomes the foundation for every security decision.</p><p>Next, identify the most likely threats to those assets. Ransomware, phishing, credential theft, and exposed cloud resources top the list for most teams. Rank scenarios by business impact and likelihood to guide your roadmap.</p><p>Finally, tie risks to controls and owners. Each high risk needs a control you can measure and a person who is accountable. Simple dashboards help track progress and keep plans grounded in reality.</p><h2>Building A Strong Identity And Access Foundation</h2><p>Identity is the new perimeter, so start with strong authentication. Require multifactor authentication for admins and remote users, then expand to all users and key apps. Keep login prompts smart with conditional access and risk signals.</p><p>Role-based access helps you grant the least privilege by default. Having strong Cybersecurity for comprehensive threat defense means uniting identity controls with continuous monitoring, timely patching, and rehearsed incident response so gaps are found and fixed fast. Rotate credentials and use passwordless methods where possible.</p><p>Protect machine identities, too. Use managed secrets, short-lived tokens, and just-in-time elevation. Audit service accounts and remove broad permissions that no longer serve a purpose.</p><h2>Email And Phishing Defence That Actually Works</h2><p>Start with layered email security. Enable DMARC, DKIM, and SPF to reduce spoofing. Use advanced filtering to block malware, links to known bad domains, and suspicious attachment types.</p><p>Assume some messages will slip through. Train employees to spot social engineering and to report suspected phishing quickly. Keep training short, frequent, and tied to real examples that match your industry.</p><p>Reduce the blast radius when mistakes happen. Disable macros by default, open risky documents in isolated containers, and limit what a user can do with a single click. Fast containment beats perfect prevention.</p><h2>Network Segmentation And Zero Trust Basics</h2><p>Treat networks as untrusted by default. Segment critical systems away from general user zones and restrict east-west traffic. Microsegmentation in data centres and cloud helps keep intruders from moving freely.</p><p>Adopt least privilege at the <a href=\"https://thecscience.com/types-of-internet-protocols.html\">network layer</a>. Use identity-aware proxies and policy engines that evaluate users, devices, and context before granting access. Logs from these decisions become gold for detection and investigation.</p><p>Keep an eye on remote access pathways. Replace legacy VPNs with modern access brokers where practical. Monitor for unusual patterns like new geographies, odd hours, or sudden spikes in data transfer.</p><h2>Backups, Recovery, And Business Continuity</h2><p>Assume a day when systems fail or get encrypted. Build a 3-2-1 backup plan with offline or immutable copies. Test restores on a schedule, not just the backup job itself.</p><p>Document recovery steps for each critical service. Who declares an incident? Where are the runbooks, and what is the order of operations? Practice tabletop scenarios so people know their roles under pressure.</p><p>Plan for partial operations. Can you run core finance, sales, and support if email is down? Can your warehouse ship if the main ERP is offline? Small continuity wins reduce stress during real events.</p><h2>Security Monitoring And Incident Response</h2><p>Visibility turns noise into action. Centralise logs from identity, endpoints, cloud, and network into a platform your team can actually use. Tune alerts to focus on high-fidelity signals like impossible travel or privilege escalation.</p><p>Harden endpoints with EDR and strong baselines. Block known bad behaviours and auto-isolate compromised devices. Pair detections with rapid playbooks that collect forensics and notify humans only when needed.</p><p>Create an incident response framework that scales. Define severity levels, communication paths, and decision points. After each incident, run a blameless review and turn lessons into updated controls.</p><h2>Secure Software And Cloud Configuration</h2><p>Bake security into the development process. Use code scanning, dependency checks, and secret detection in your pipelines. Fix the highest risk issues before code reaches production.</p><p>Harden cloud accounts with guardrails. Enforce encryption at rest and in transit, restrict public exposure, and monitor for misconfigurations. Tag resources and tie them to owners to avoid orphaned services.</p><p>Protect APIs with strong authentication and rate limits. Log requests, validate inputs, and watch for spikes or odd patterns. Version your APIs and retire legacy endpoints that no longer serve business value.</p><p>No business can remove all cyber risk, but every business can make smart moves that reduce it. Start with identity, segment your networks, and plan your recovery steps. Keep improving a little each quarter, and your security posture will grow stronger.</p><p>Security is a journey powered by small, steady choices. Build processes that people can follow and tools they can trust. Those choices add up to resilience that customers and teams can count on.</p>",

      "content": "<p>This is an opinion piece based on my research and ideas. I recently read the paper by Alex Kontorovich, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.15924\">The Shape of Math To Come</a>, which inspired me to contemplate the future of mathematics and mathematicians. However, I will not go into as much detail, but rather state a high-level overview of ideas.</p><h2>Autoproving vs Autotranslation</h2><p>Before we start, we need to differentiate between , giving a formalized proof to a formalized statement, and , the act of taking an informal statement (such as the definition of a Vector Space or a Conjecture) and transferring it into a formalized language like Lean.</p><p>A notable observation is that, autotranslation lacks inherent verification and cannot be fully automated. While AI can translate natural language into formalized language (such as Lean), no formal proof exists to confirm that the formalized statement matches the informal intent. A human must still manually verify that the resulting symbols correctly represent the original mathematical idea.</p><p>Autoproving, on the other hand, can be completely automated; given a formalized statement, we can trust the formalized proof to be correct. This is, of course, assuming that the environment in which the verification happens is immune to reward hacking or adversarial attacks on the verification. Making verification robust is a problem which the Lean FRO is well aware of, with the latest addition being the <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/comparator/\">Comparator Verifier</a>.</p><p>There is also , which can be seen as autotranslation followed by autoproving.</p><p>I want to introduce a thought experiment involving an autoproving system capable of proving anything that humanity has ever formalized, and enabling the proof of any new formalized statement in a matter of minutes or hours. Such a system, which I will just dub \"Math Singularity\", would be the extreme end along a spectrum of autoproving abilities.</p><p>What would doing mathematics look like with such a system at our disposal? Would it mean that we are only formalizing statements, building and exploring theories, and rapidly answering any question we formalize? Developing a big program or theory such as the Langlands Program would probably much more resemble the workflow or contributions of human mathematicians.</p><p>One can, of course, also argue that a system capable of proving everything known to humanity could also be engineered and utilized to create entirely new theories and complete new fields of mathematics, but that would be of no use to humans. We need humans to interpret it to advance the knowledge corpus of humanity—unless we simply decide to hand off the interpretation and utilization of these scientific advancements in math completely to AI, at which point we would have to raise entirely different questions.</p><h2>How might this transition look like?</h2><p>We can roughly sketch the spectrum of autoproving capabilities as follows:</p><p>I define MST (Mathematical Superintelligence) as a system vastly more intelligent than the most intelligent human mathematicians, while still being unable to prove extremely hard problems such as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Prize_Problems\">Millenium Problems</a> or the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landau%27s_problems\">Landau Problems</a>.</p><p>We are currently at a point where small theorems can be independently proven, such as a recent Erdős problem as documented by <a href=\"https://mathstodon.xyz/@tao/115855840223258103\">Terence Tao's Mastodon Post</a>. The further we proceed along the spectrum of autoproving, the less proofs become the bottleneck, enabling humanity to explore the mathematical landscape more throughly.</p><p>Currently, informal (natural language) math is advancing faster than formalized math. If autoproving systems become better, it will be of benefit for frontier mathematicians to formalize their current area of research to leverage these systems' capabilities. Consequently, more projects and workshops will likely emerge to formalize frontier research fields within Lean. In this vein, Lean serves as the interface for autoproving systems, while also providing the benefit of formalized correctness into frontier research.</p><h2>How might human collaboration and papers develop?</h2><p>Mathematicians write papers to introduce new knowledge, an important ingredient being a correct proof, ensuring the newly introduced theorems and knowledge are consistent with the existing knowledge corpus. Moving along the autoproving spectrum will lead to higher abstraction, where proofs of smaller lemmas fall into the background by being a Lean reference, and results provable by autoproving systems are not worthy of their own paper anymore.</p><p>There will most likely still be hybrid proofs for statements outside of the current reach of autoproving systems, where humans supplement by providing structure or insight to the proof to various extents.</p><p>Integrating vast databases of formalized proofs into existing academic frameworks presents another significant hurdle. While <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4\">Mathlib</a> is an easy example, its current architecture may face scalability issues when attempting to encompass all of humanity's mathematical knowledge. We may see a evolving field of different institutional databases, or a unified repository similar to arXiv for preprints might eventually crystallize. These are all problems which can be solved, but must be tackled to enable more proper utilization of autoproving systems.</p><p>Lean is currently the most used programming language in the realm of formalization of math and will likely stay the most relevant language for the foreseeable future, serving as the foundational layer for these advancements.</p><p>Regarding the development of AI systems for autoproving, DeepMind and Harmonic AI are currently the biggest labs in the field, with <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09833-y\">Alphaproof</a> and <a href=\"https://aristotle.harmonic.fun/\">Aristotle</a> respectively. However, there are many teams at various labs and smaller companies working on autoproving systems, such as ByteDance with <a href=\"https://github.com/ByteDance-Seed/Seed-Prover\">Seedprover</a> or <a href=\"https://www.logicalintelligence.com/aleph-prover_1000.html\">Alephprover</a> from Logical Intelligence.</p><p>Math as we know it is about to change, and I think many are feeling that.</p><p>The synergy between Math and Lean represents a unique opportunity for unbound continual learning, as its formal environment allows for continuous improvement independent of real-world constraints.</p><p>If we can overcome these remaining challenges of scaling formalization, we may soon witness a golden age of results in mathematics.</p><p>\\\nEdit 1: I have switched the naming of Autoformalization for Autotranslation following a comment made by Alex Kontorovich.</p>",

      "content": "<p>\\\nIn quantitative trading, it’s important to be careful when testing your strategy on all available data, as this can sometimes cause the rules to become too tuned and not perform well in real trading situations. To get a better idea of how your strategy really works, try dividing your historical data into a training (or optimisation) period and a test period. This approach allows you to evaluate your strategy on unseen data, much like real market conditions, which helps prevent overfitting and gives you a clearer picture of its strength across different market regimes.</p><p>To do a more robust backtesting, we will also use simulated price paths via a non-parametric Brownian bridge to assess a trading strategy’s resilience. Unlike relying on a single historical sequence, this method generates multiple paths capturing key statistical features. Testing the strategy across these paths helps us understand its performance in various market scenarios, reducing overfitting risk and offering insights into its consistency and resilience. This provides a more thorough evaluation of the strategy’s robustness and real-world potential.</p><p><strong>What to expect in this article:</strong></p><ul><li>Get 20 years of data for Apple stock till today</li><li>Develop our two Moving Average strategy, where when the fast MA is higher than the slow one, we will go long, and short the other way around.</li><li>Optimise the strategy for the first 15 years and see which parameters of the moving averages produce the best return.</li><li>Check the results of the optimised parameters for the last 5 years</li><li>Simulate 1000 price paths more for those 15 years</li><li>Optimise our strategy for all those alternate paths</li></ul><p>The aim of this article isn’t to give you a perfect, ready-to-go algorithm that will make you rich overnight. Instead, it’s about helping you understand a different approach that you can smoothly incorporate into your backtest strategy. I hope you find it helpful and inspiring!</p><p>Before we dive into the code, let’s briefly discuss retrospective simulation. This technique models alternate price paths based on actual historical data. As mentioned earlier, this article will focus on the non-parametric Brownian bridge method. Other methods also exist, with the most well-known being:</p><ul><li>Traditional Monte Carlo simulation, which generates random price paths assuming a specified stochastic model like geometric Brownian motion,</li><li>The Euler-Maruyama method, which uses discrete time steps to approximate stochastic differential equations for simulating price processes,</li><li>There are more advanced techniques like the Brownian Bridge Maximum Method, Quadratic-Exponential schemes, and Multidimensional Scaled Brownian Bridge. These methods are designed to enhance accuracy and better capture complex features such as volatility clustering or correlations between multiple assets.</li></ul><p>Choosing the best simulation method really depends on the strategy you’re testing, the amount of computational resources you have, and how complex the model needs to be. Retrospective simulation is especially helpful because it allows you to test strategies against many different versions of historical data, which can help prevent overfitting. This way, you can feel more confident that your strategies are robust before putting real capital on the line.</p><p>In our case, we chose the non-parametric Brownian bridge method in this article because it effectively preserves the key statistical properties of historical price data while generating alternative price paths. Also, it is not so heavy on resources, which is a good start for us.</p><p>First and most important, let’s see our imports, as well as the parameters we will need:</p><pre><code>import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport requests\nfrom itertools import product\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\n\n\ntoken = 'YOUR FMP TOKEN'\n\nfrom_date_train = '2005-10-31'\nto_date_train = '2020-10-31'\n\nfrom_date_test = '2020-11-01'\nto_date_test = '2025-10-31'\n\nfast_period = 21\nslow_period = 55\n\nfast_range = range(5, 46, 5)\nslow_range = range(50, 251, 10)\n</code></pre><p>\\\nBesides the , to get the prices for AAPL, we will need:</p><ul><li>The dates that will be necessary for the testing</li><li>Some basic parameters for the two MAs</li><li>The ranges that we will use for our optimisation</li></ul><p>Now that we have all this, let’s get the AAPL prices. We will do it with the . You will notice that we will request the dates from the beginning of our training till the end of our testing.</p><pre><code>ticker = 'AAPL'\nurl = f'https://financialmodelingprep.com/api/v3/historical-price-full/{ticker}'\ndf_ohlc = pd.DataFrame()\nquerystring = {\"apikey\":token, \"from\":from_date_train, \"to\":to_date_test}\ndata = requests.get(url, querystring)\ndata = data.json()\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data['historical'])\ndf['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'])\ndf = df.sort_values('date').set_index('date')\n</code></pre><h2>Traditional Backtesting and Optimisation</h2><p>As we promised, let’s first develop our strategy and backtest it with the basic data.</p><pre><code>def sma_strategy_backtest(close, fast_period, slow_period):\n    df = pd.DataFrame({'close': close})\n    df['pct_change'] = df['close'].pct_change()\n    df['fast_sma'] = df['close'].rolling(window=fast_period).mean()\n    df['slow_sma'] = df['close'].rolling(window=slow_period).mean()\n\n    # Generate signal\n    df['signal'] = 0\n    df.loc[(df['fast_sma'] &gt; df['slow_sma']), 'signal'] = 1\n    df.loc[(df['fast_sma'] &lt; df['slow_sma']), 'signal'] = -1\n\n    # Calculate returns with shift to avoid lookahead bias\n    df['strategy_return'] = df['pct_change'] * df['signal'].shift(1)\n    df['equity'] = 100 * (1 + df['strategy_return']).cumprod()\n\n    # Calculate Buy and Hold total return in percentage\n    df['bnh_equity'] = 100 * (1 + df['pct_change']).cumprod()\n    bnh_total_ret = (df['bnh_equity'].iloc[-1] / df['bnh_equity'].dropna().iloc[0] - 1) * 100\n\n    # Strategy total return\n    equity = df['equity']\n    total_ret = (equity.iloc[-1] / equity.dropna().iloc[0] - 1) * 100\n\n    return equity, total_ret, bnh_total_ret\n</code></pre><p>\\\nThe backtesting will be performed solely on the close price, generating the signal based on the alignment of the moving averages as previously explained. The return, and ultimately the equity, will be calculated based on the signal. Finally, it will produce the series of the equity, the total return, as well as the buy-and-hold return to provide a point of reference.</p><p>Now we will run this with the base parameters we defined initially and print the results:</p><pre><code>equity,total_ret, bnh_total_ret = sma_strategy_backtest(df['close'], fast_period, slow_period)\n\nprint(\"Total return (%):\", total_ret)\nprint(\"Buy and Hold return (%):\", bnh_total_ret)\n</code></pre><p>The returns are positive, but they don’t come close to those of a Buy-and-Hold strategy. However, as mentioned, this article isn’t about identifying the most profitable approach but rather about illustrating the backtesting process using alternative methods.</p><p>Let’s fine-tune our strategy (also known as overfitting&nbsp;;) ) to discover what our results will be.</p><pre><code>def optimize_sma_periods(close, fast_range, slow_range):\n    best_result = {'fast': None, 'medium': None, 'slow': None, 'total_return': -np.inf}\n    best_equity = None\n\n    # Iterate valid combinations: fast &lt; medium &lt; slow\n    for fast, slow in product(fast_range, slow_range):\n        if fast &lt; slow:\n            equity, total_ret, bnh_total_ret = sma_strategy_backtest(close, fast, slow)\n            if total_ret &gt; best_result['total_return']:\n                best_result = {'fast': fast, 'slow': slow, 'total_return': total_ret}\n                best_equity = equity\n                buy_and_hold = bnh_total_ret\n\n    return {\n        'best_periods': (best_result['fast'], best_result['slow']),\n        'best_total_return': best_result['total_return'],\n        'best_equity': best_equity,\n        'buy_and_hold': buy_and_hold\n    }\n\nresult = optimize_sma_periods(df['close'], fast_range, slow_range)\nprint(\"Best periods (fast, slow):\", result['best_periods'])\nprint(\"Best total return (%):\", result['best_total_return'])\nprint(\"Buy and Hold return (%):\", result['buy_and_hold'])\n</code></pre><p>We observe that the highest return comes from a very fast MA (10 days) and a relatively slow one (220 days). This is because the stock (like every stock in recent years) has delivered tremendous returns, so the strategy aims to stay as long as possible.</p><p>Apparently, in the previous step, we have overfitted our parameters, and no experienced (or sane) trader would believe that those are the parameters to be used with real money from tomorrow…</p><p>Let’s assume today is 5 years earlier, and that we have optimised our parameters using data up to that point. To do this, we will keep the first 15 years and run the same optimisation.</p><pre><code>df_train = df.loc[from_date_train:to_date_train]\n\nresult = optimize_sma_periods(df_train['close'], fast_range, slow_range)\n\nbest_fast = result['best_periods'][0]\nbest_slow = result['best_periods'][1]\n\nprint(\"Best periods (fast, slow):\", best_fast, best_slow)\nprint(\"Best total return (%):\", result['best_total_return'])\nprint(\"Buy and Hold return (%):\", result['buy_and_hold'])\n</code></pre><p>Again, the best train parameters are 10 for fast and 220 for slow. Let’s see what this optimisation will yield for the next 5 years up to today…</p><pre><code>df_test = df.loc[from_date_test:to_date_test]\nequity,total_ret, bnh_total_ret = sma_strategy_backtest(df_test['close'], best_fast, best_slow)\n\nprint(\"Best periods applied (fast, medium, slow):\", best_fast, best_slow)\nprint(\"Total return (%):\", total_ret)\nprint(\"Buy and Hold return (%):\", bnh_total_ret)\n</code></pre><p>Proportionately, the results are almost identical, with a small return of 5%, while the stock’s returns were more than double the price.</p><p>There are many methods to compute alternative paths. In our case, we will use the non-parametric Brownian bridge framework, which, as previously mentioned, maintains the statistical features of the price history and ensures the path starts and ends at the same price.</p><pre><code>close_prices = df['close']\n\n\ndef non_parametric_brownian_bridge(close_prices, n_paths=1000, seed=42):\n    np.random.seed(seed)\n    n = len(close_prices)\n    X0 = np.log(close_prices.iloc[0])\n    Xn = np.log(close_prices.iloc[-1])\n    log_returns = np.log(close_prices / close_prices.shift(1)).dropna().values\n\n    paths = np.zeros((n, n_paths))\n    for i in range(n_paths):\n        # Sample n-1 returns and center them\n        sampled = np.random.choice(log_returns, size=n - 1, replace=True)\n        drift_correction = (Xn - X0) / (n - 1) - np.mean(sampled)\n        sampled += drift_correction  # Center drift\n        W = np.concatenate(([0], np.cumsum(sampled)))  # Now length n\n        # Brownian bridge formula for all time steps (n)\n        bridge = X0 + W + np.linspace(0, 1, n) * (Xn - X0 - W[-1])\n        paths[:, i] = bridge\n\n    sim_prices = np.exp(paths)\n    sim_prices[~np.isfinite(sim_prices)] = np.nan\n    return sim_prices\n\n\nsimulated_paths = non_parametric_brownian_bridge(close_prices, n_paths=1000)\n\nfor i in range(simulated_paths.shape[1]):\n    df[f'sim_path_{i+1}'] = simulated_paths[:, i]\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(14, 7))\nplt.plot(df.index, df.loc[:, 'sim_path_1':'sim_path_1000'], lw=1, alpha=0.7)\nplt.plot(df.index, close_prices, lw=2, label='Original', color='black')\nplt.title('Non-Parametric Brownian Bridge - Simulated Paths')\nplt.xlabel('Date')\nplt.ylabel('Price')\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n</code></pre><p>As you can see, plotting 1000 of the possible paths, the beginning and end are at the same price. Notice the white line, which represents the actual history.</p><p>Now is the time to start the fun. We will run all the possible combinations of parameters for each price path. There will be almost 200K runs, so be patient.</p><pre><code>df_train_multiple_paths = df.loc[from_date_train:to_date_train]\n\nresults = []\n\nfor i in tqdm(range(1,1001,1)):\n    print(f'Processing path {i}')\n    for fast, slow in product(fast_range, slow_range):\n        _, total_backtest_ret, _  = sma_strategy_backtest(df_train_multiple_paths['sim_path_' + str(i)], fast, slow)\n        result = {'fast': fast, 'slow': slow, 'total_return': total_backtest_ret}\n        results.append(result)\n\ndf_all_paths_train = pd.DataFrame(results)\ndf_all_paths_train.to_csv('df_all_paths_train_2.csv', index=False)\ndf_all_paths_train\n</code></pre><p>For each run, we will also calculate the actual return over the last 5 years. As you will see in the code, we will not calculate for each row (since the combination of the MA parameters repeats). Instead, we will compute all the unique combinations first and then merge them into the final dataframe.</p><pre><code>unique_combos = (\n    df_all_paths_train[['fast', 'slow']]\n    .drop_duplicates()\n    .copy()\n)\n\nunique_combos[['fast', 'slow']] = unique_combos[['fast', 'slow']].astype(int)\n\ndef _compute_test_metrics(row):\n    f, s = int(row['fast']), int(row['slow'])\n    _, total_ret, bnh_ret = sma_strategy_backtest(df_test['close'], f, s)\n    return pd.Series({'test_total_return': total_ret, 'test_bnh_return': bnh_ret})\n\n# Evaluate each unique combo once\nunique_combos[['test_total_return', 'test_bnh_return']] = unique_combos.apply(_compute_test_metrics, axis=1)\n\n# Join back to all rows to align with every path's chosen combo\ndf_all_paths_with_test = df_all_paths_train.merge(unique_combos, on=['fast', 'slow'], how='left')\ndf_all_paths_with_test\n</code></pre><p>Now that we have our dataframe with all the results, let’s try some plots to make some sense out of all this effort.</p><p>Our first try will be a 3D scatter plot, where we will use the 2 MAs as well as the final return in the test period (the last 5 years)</p><pre><code>import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))\nax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')\n\n# Scatter plot with fast, slow, and test_total_return\nscatter = ax.scatter(df_all_paths_with_test['fast'],\n                     df_all_paths_with_test['slow'],\n                     df_all_paths_with_test['test_total_return'],\n                     c=df_all_paths_with_test['test_total_return'],\n                     cmap='viridis',\n                     alpha=0.7)\n\nax.set_xlabel('Fast MA Length')\nax.set_ylabel('Slow MA Length')\nax.set_zlabel('Test Period Return')\n\nfig.colorbar(scatter, label='Test Period Return')\n\nplt.title('3D Scatter Plot of MA Parameters vs Test Total Return')\nplt.show()\n</code></pre><p>Overall, the 3D plots can be confusing. However, upon closer inspection, you’ll notice that the farthest back part of the plot indicates that we should expect better returns with very fast and very slow MAs, which also supports our initial findings.</p><p>Which brings us to the following plot, where we will use boxplots to distinguish the two MAs. We will also bin the MAs for a better visualisation.</p><pre><code># Define bins for fast and slow parameters (customize ranges as needed)\nfast_bins = np.arange(df_all_paths_with_test['fast'].min(),\n                      df_all_paths_with_test['fast'].max() + 5, 5)\nslow_bins = np.arange(df_all_paths_with_test['slow'].min(),\n                      df_all_paths_with_test['slow'].max() + 10, 10)\n\n# Create binned columns for fast and slow\ndf_all_paths_with_test['fast_bin'] = pd.cut(df_all_paths_with_test['fast'], fast_bins)\ndf_all_paths_with_test['slow_bin'] = pd.cut(df_all_paths_with_test['slow'], slow_bins)\n\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(16, 6), sharey=True)\n\n# Boxplot for fast parameter bins\ndf_all_paths_with_test.boxplot(column='test_total_return', by='fast_bin', ax=axes[0], grid=False)\naxes[0].set_title('Test Returns by Fast MA Length')\naxes[0].set_xlabel('Fast MA Length Range')\naxes[0].set_ylabel('Test Period Return')\naxes[0].tick_params(axis='x', rotation=45)\n\n# Boxplot for slow parameter bins\ndf_all_paths_with_test.boxplot(column='test_total_return', by='slow_bin', ax=axes[1], grid=False)\naxes[1].set_title('Test Returns by Slow MA Length')\naxes[1].set_xlabel('Slow MA Length Range')\naxes[1].tick_params(axis='x', rotation=45)\n\nplt.suptitle('')  # Remove default pandas title\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n</code></pre><p><strong>This will give us some more insights:</strong></p><ul><li>Regarding the Fast MA, our initial results are once again confirmed. The returns are better when using a range of 5 to 10 periods for a fast MA.</li><li>Regarding the Slow MA box plots, they provide additional insights. We observe that returns tend to be good with some “faster” slow MAs in the range of 50 to 100. However, in this area, we also notice the most outliers (the dots), which is undesirable since it indicates a higher risk.</li></ul><p>Another interesting plot is a heatmap that shows the risk of overfitting. This is achieved by calculating an overfitting metric, which is the difference between train and test returns. Let’s look at that:</p><pre><code># Calculate overfitting metric\ndf_all_paths_with_test['overfit'] = df_all_paths_with_test['total_return'] - df_all_paths_with_test['test_total_return']\n\n# Group by fast and slow and aggregate overfit by mean (or median if preferred)\nagg_df = df_all_paths_with_test.groupby(['fast', 'slow'])['overfit'].mean().reset_index()\n\n# Pivot the aggregated DataFrame\nheatmap_data = agg_df.pivot(index='fast', columns='slow', values='overfit')\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))\nsns.heatmap(heatmap_data, cmap='coolwarm', center=0,\n            cbar_kws={'label': 'Overfitting Risk (Train - Test Return)'},\n            linewidths=0.5)\n\nplt.title('Heatmap of Overfitting Risk by MA Parameters')\nplt.xlabel('Slow MA Length')\nplt.ylabel('Fast MA Length')\nplt.show()\n</code></pre><p>Well, that explains everything. The reason the returns during the test period were in the very slow and very fast MAs is that these areas carry a higher concentrated risk of overfitting. In these zones, the difference between training returns and test returns is the greatest. Essentially, these areas generate the best results during training, but when comparing train and test, the largest gaps are observed there.</p><p>What have we learned in this article:</p><ul><li>Dividing data into training and testing periods provides a realistic assessment of strategy robustness.</li><li>Using non-parametric Brownian bridge simulations generates multiple price paths, testing the strategy against diverse market scenarios.</li><li>Simulated paths offer more profound insight into consistency and risk, enhancing confidence in the strategy’s real-world application.</li></ul><p>And last but not least, when trading with real money, remember: backtest like your profits depend on it — because they do!

      "content": "<p>\\\nFor years, our data visualization toolbox in Python has been dominated by two giants: Matplotlib and Seaborn. They are the undisputed champions of static, publication-quality graphics. They allow us to create beautiful, precise \"photographs\" of our data. But in the modern world of web-based dashboards and dynamic reports, a photograph is often not enough. Static charts are a one-way conversation.</p><p>What if your charts could talk back? What if your users could hover over a data point to see its exact value, zoom into a specific time range, or filter data on the fly?</p><p>This is the paradigm of interactive visualization, and its leading practitioner in the Python ecosystem is . This article will guide you through this paradigm shift, showing you how to build your first web-native, interactive chart.</p><h3>The Paradigm Shift: From Pixels to Data Objects</h3><p>The magic of Plotly lies in a fundamental change in how a visualization is created and rendered.</p><ul><li><strong>Matplotlib/Seaborn (The Photograph):</strong> These libraries issue a series of drawing commands to a backend. The final output is a static image file (like a PNG or SVG) made of pixels or vector paths. Once rendered, the link between a visual element (a bar on a chart) and the underlying data point is lost.</li><li><strong>Plotly (The Interactive Map):</strong> Plotly doesn't create a static image. It creates a rich, structured  that contains everything: the data, the layout instructions, and the rules for interactivity. This JSON \"blueprint\" is then sent to a browser, where Plotly.js (a powerful JavaScript library) renders it. Because the browser has the full data object, it can handle interactions like hovering and zooming locally, without ever needing to ask the Python server for a new image.</li></ul><p>You're not just creating a picture of the data; you're creating a small, self-contained data application.</p><h3>Meet the Plotly APIs: Your Two Best Friends</h3><p>Plotly offers two distinct but related APIs, each designed for a different stage of the analytical workflow. Understanding them is key to using the library effectively.</p><ol><li><strong>Plotly Express (PX): The Prefabricated Home Kit</strong> This is the high-level, \"batteries-included\" API. It's designed for speed and convenience, perfect for exploratory data analysis (EDA). With a single function call, you can create a complex, fully interactive chart. PX makes intelligent assumptions about layout, legends, and styling, letting you focus on the data.</li><li><strong>Plotly Graph Objects (GO): The Custom Architectural Blueprint</strong> This is the low-level, foundational API. It gives you granular control over every single element of the plot. You build the figure from the ground up, defining each \"trace\" (the data layer) and every \"layout\" property (the styling layer). This is the API you need for complex, multi-layered charts, dual-axis plots, and production-ready dashboards where every detail matters.</li></ol><p>The best part? <strong>Plotly Express is just a smart wrapper around Graph Objects.</strong> Every figure you create with PX is a GO figure under the hood, which means you can always start with the speed of PX and then use GO methods to fine-tune the details.</p><h3>The Main Event: Building a Chart, Two Ways</h3><p>Let's build a simple, interactive bar chart showing quarterly revenue. We'll do it first with Plotly Express to see the speed, and then with Graph Objects to understand the architecture.</p><p>Here is the full, self-contained code. You can copy, paste, and run this in any Python environment.</p><pre><code>import pandas as pd\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nfrom plotly.offline import plot\nimport os\n\n# --- 1. Data Preparation ---\n# A simple DataFrame is the ideal input for Plotly.\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\n    'Quarter': ['Q1 2024', 'Q2 2024', 'Q3 2024', 'Q4 2024'],\n    'Revenue': [100, 150, 130, 180]\n})\n\nprint(\"--- Data Ready for Plotting ---\")\nprint(df.head())\nprint(\"-\" * 35)\n\n\n# --- 2. The Plotly Express Way (Fast &amp; Easy) ---\n# One line of code generates the entire interactive figure.\nfig_px = px.bar(\n    df,\n    x='Quarter',\n    y='Revenue',\n    title='Quarterly Revenue (via Plotly Express)',\n    color='Quarter',  # Automatically adds color and a legend\n    labels={'Revenue': 'Total Revenue ($K)'}, # Easy label renaming\n    template='plotly_dark' # Apply a modern theme\n)\n\n\n# --- 3. The Graph Objects Way (Powerful &amp; Explicit) ---\n# Here, we build the figure piece by piece.\n\n# Step A: Initialize an empty Figure object (the canvas)\nfig_go = go.Figure()\n\n# Step B: Define and add a 'trace' (the data layer)\nfig_go.add_trace(\n    go.Bar(\n        x=df['Quarter'],\n        y=df['Revenue'],\n        name='Revenue Trace',\n        marker_color=['#636EFA', '#EF553B', '#00CC96', '#AB63FA'] # Manually define colors\n    )\n)\n\n# Step C: Define and update the 'layout' (the styling layer)\nfig_go.update_layout(\n    title_text='Quarterly Revenue (via Graph Objects)',\n    xaxis_title='Fiscal Quarter',\n    yaxis_title='Total Revenue ($K)',\n    template='plotly_dark'\n)\n\n\n# --- 4. Output Generation ---\n# This will save the GO figure as an interactive HTML file and open it in your browser.\n# We use `plot()` from `plotly.offline` to ensure it works outside of a Jupyter Notebook.\noutput_filename = 'interactive_chart.html'\nplot(fig_go, filename=output_filename, auto_open=True)\n\nprint(f\"Interactive chart saved to: {os.path.abspath(output_filename)}\")\nprint(f\"Notice that both fig_px and fig_go are of the same base type: {type(fig_go)}\")\n</code></pre><h3>Deep Dive: Deconstructing the Code</h3><p>Let's break down exactly what's happening in each approach.</p><h4>The Plotly Express Approach (The Magic of One Line)</h4><pre><code>fig_px = px.bar(\n    df,\n    x='Quarter',\n    y='Revenue',\n    title='Quarterly Revenue (via Plotly Express)',\n    color='Quarter',\n    labels={'Revenue': 'Total Revenue ($K)'},\n    template='plotly_dark'\n)\n</code></pre><p>With a single call to , we gave it our DataFrame and told it which columns to map to which visual roles:</p><ul><li>: Use the 'Quarter' column for the x-axis.</li><li>: Use the 'Revenue' column for the y-axis.</li><li>: This is a powerful feature. It tells PX to assign a unique color to each bar based on its 'Quarter' value and automatically create a legend.</li><li>: A simple dictionary to provide user-friendly names for the axes.</li><li>: Applies a pre-packaged theme for a modern, dark-mode look.</li></ul><p>That's it. PX builds the complete  object internally and returns it.</p><h4>The Graph Objects Approach (The Power of Precision)</h4><p>This approach is more verbose but exposes the core architecture of a Plotly figure.</p><p> You start with a blank canvas. This  object is an empty container waiting for you to add data and styling.</p><p><code>fig_go.add_trace(go.Bar(...))</code> A  is a single data series and its visual representation. Our figure has one trace: a bar chart.</p><ul><li>We explicitly create a  object.</li><li>We must pass the full Pandas Series () to the  and  parameters, not just the column name string.</li><li>We have to manually define the . This is where the trade-off is clear: more code, but complete control.</li></ul><p><code>fig_go.update_layout(...)</code> The  controls everything that isn't the data itself: titles, axis labels, fonts, legends, backgrounds.</p><ul><li>, , : We explicitly set the text for each part of the chart.</li><li>: We can still apply a global theme here for consistency.</li></ul><h3>The Interactive Payoff: What You Get for Free</h3><p>When you run the script, an HTML file will open in your browser. This is where you see the Plotly difference:</p><ul><li> Move your mouse over any bar. A tooltip appears showing the exact Quarter and Revenue. This is built-in.</li><li> Click and drag to select a region to zoom in. Double-click to zoom out.</li><li> In the top-right corner, you'll find a toolbar to pan, reset the view, and even download the chart as a static PNG image.</li></ul><p>All this interactivity is the default behavior of the Plotly.js rendering engine. You didn't have to write a single line of JavaScript.</p><h3>When to Use Which? A Practical Guide</h3><p>| Use Plotly Express (PX) When… | Use Graph Objects (GO) When… |\n|----|----|\n| You are in the <strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</strong> phase. | You are building a <strong>production-ready, custom dashboard</strong>. |\n| Your primary goal is . | Your primary goal is <strong>granular control and customization</strong>. |\n| You are creating standard chart types (scatter, line, bar, histogram, map). | You need to combine multiple chart types (e.g., bars and lines). |\n| You want to leverage automatic faceting (, ). | You need complex subplots with shared axes or custom layouts. |\n| You need a quick, beautiful, and interactive plot with minimal code. | You need to add custom annotations, shapes, or buttons. |</p><p> The best workflow is often a hybrid one. Generate your initial figure quickly with Plotly Express, and then use Graph Objects methods like  or  to add the final layers of polish and customization.</p><h3>Conclusion: Your Gateway to Web Dashboards</h3><p>Mastering Plotly is the first and most crucial step toward building modern, interactive data applications in Python. The  object you create is the fundamental component that frameworks like  use to build full-scale web dashboards.</p><p>You've now seen how to move beyond static images and create living, explorable visualizations.

That’s a general statement, to be sure, so if you need some marking point to serve as a specific example of our national malfunction, the <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/tag/measles/\">return of measles</a> to our country can fit the bill. It’s not quite as flashy as the secret police <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2026/01/08/abolish-ice-before-they-kill-again-impeach-trump-noem-before-they-incite-more-murder/\">shooting citizens</a>, of course.

Kennedy’s <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/12/03/rfk-jr-cdc-vaccine-guidance-a-new-deputy-cdc-director-and-measles-in-south-carolina/\">inability</a> to properly communicate to the nation what needs to happen, which is another concentrated MMR vaccination effort, combined with his <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/05/08/rfk-jr-s-measles-policy-deaths-are-expected-and-its-the-victims-fault/\">eugenics-lite</a> belief system on matters of health, has all led to this. 2025 saw the <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/12/30/2025-measles-cases-in-america-surpass-the-2000-mark/\">highest number</a> of Americans infected by measles in decades, 3 people died, we’re about to lose our <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/11/24/cdc-data-indicates-were-2-months-away-from-america-losing-its-measles-elimination-status/\">elimination status</a> for the disease, and an outbreak in <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/12/12/the-measles-outbreak-in-south-carolina-is-growing/\">South Carolina</a> has us off to a <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2026/01/14/new-year-but-the-same-measles-crises-rages-on/\">rip roaring start</a> to 2026.</p><p>While this is largely due to the unvaccinated population among us, allowing the disease to spread where it otherwise would not, we’ve seen enough breakthrough infections that even being one of the “responsible ones” won’t necessarily keep you safe any longer. And the South Carolina outbreak of measles is officially off the rails.</p><p>A week ago, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/sc-measles-outbreak-has-gone-berserk-124-cases-since-friday-409-quarantined/\">ArsTechnica had an alarming post</a> about how South Carolina saw well over a hundred new cases of measles and over 400 people quarantined . </p><blockquote><p><em>Amid the outbreak, South Carolina health officials have been providing updates on cases every Tuesday and Friday. On Tuesday, state health officials reported&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dph.sc.gov/news/tuesday-measles-update-dph-reports-124-new-measles-cases-upstate-new-public-exposures-and\">124 more cases</a>&nbsp;since last Friday, which had&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/measles-continues-raging-in-south-carolina-99-new-cases-since-tuesday/\">99 new cases</a>&nbsp;since the previous Tuesday. On that day, January 6, officials noted a more modest increase of 26 cases, bringing the outbreak total at that point to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dph.sc.gov/news/tuesday-measles-update-dph-reports-26-new-measles-cases-upstate-bringing-outbreak-total-211\">211 cases</a>.</em></p><p><em>With the 3-month-old outbreak now doubled in just a week, health officials are renewing calls for people to get vaccinated against the highly infectious virus—an effort that has met with little success since October. Still, the health department is activating its mobile health unit to offer free measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccinations, as well as flu vaccinations at two locations today and Thursday&nbsp;in the Spartanburg area, the epicenter of the outbreak.</em></p></blockquote><p>Those same officials had another dire warning: the outbreak had grown so big that they no longer had the ability to perform contact tracing. Where the disease would go next was anyone’s guess.</p><p>The outbreak is still growing to date. At least <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Health/88-new-measles-cases-confirmed-south-carolina-bringing/story?id=129377559\">88 more cases of measles</a> were recorded in South Carolina in less than a week since the Ars post. Schools remain the most problematic vector, but it’s no longer just elementary and secondary schools that are in trouble. Colleges are now part of the party.</p><blockquote><p><em>There are at least 15 schools — including elementary, middle and high schools — which currently have students in quarantine.</em></p><p><em>Health officials also warned of exposures at Clemson University and Anderson University, both located in northwestern South Carolina, which have a combined 88 students in quarantine.</em></p></blockquote><p>While these numbers from South Carolina are publicly stated, the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html\">CDC site tallying measles infections</a> apparently can’t keep up. The last time the numbers were updated there was January 14th, but even those numbers appear to be incorrectly low. The site also announces that it is moving its reporting schedule from every Wednesday to Fridays, which is your classic “bad news dumping ground” day. </p><blockquote><p><em>Measles continue to spread in the Upstate but now, health leaders in Washington state say the outbreak here in South Carolina is connected to cases on the west coast. The Snohomish County Health Department confirmed three cases in children who were exposed to a contagious family visiting from South Carolina.</em></p><p><em>Previously, the Snohomish County Health Department and Public Health – Seattle &amp; King County were notified that three members of a South Carolina family, one adult and two children, were infectious while visiting King and Snohomish counties from Dec. 27, 2025 through Jan. 1, 2026. The family visited multiple locations in Everett, Marysville and Mukilteo while contagious before being diagnosed. They also traveled through Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and visited a car rental facility near the airport.</em></p></blockquote><p>In any sane administration, a measles task force would be mobilized to build out a strategy to contain these outbreaks, to communicate actions plans to the public, and to execute on actions designed to keep the public healthy. Trump, RFK Jr., and the health agencies they’re in charge of <em>are barely talking about this</em>. They are ignoring the problem and that will ensure that it becomes much, much worse.</p><p>Impeachments are what’s necessary here, starting with Kennedy, who is clearly asleep at the wheel. A feckless Congress unwilling to do its job should have members tossed out on their ass. Staff at HHS and its child agencies should be in full revolt, sounding the alarm.</p><p>Measles is no fucking joke, folks. But our government currently is.</p>",

Now it turns out the dropped pounds may have a surprising perk for airlines, too: lower fuel costs, as slimmer passengers lighten their aircraft's loads.\n \nAccording to a study published last week by Jefferies, a financial services firm, the four largest U.S. carriers -- American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines -- could together save as much as $580 million per year on fuel thanks to weight-loss drugs, known as GLP-1s. One in eight U.S. adults said they were taking a GLP-1 in a November survey published by KFF, a nonprofit health research group. Fuel is among airlines' largest expenses. The Jefferies study estimates that the four airlines will together consume 16 billion gallons of fuel in 2026 at a total cost of $38.6 billion, nearly 20 percent of their total expenses.\n \nThe savings from skinnier passengers would amount to just 1.5 percent of fuel costs. But airlines and pilots must scrutinize even the smallest changes to a plane's weight and balance, and a lighter payload means each jet burns less fuel to generate the thrust necessary to fly. Investors could also stand to benefit: The researchers estimated that a 2 percent reduction in aircraft weight could boost earnings per share by about 4 percent. \"Please note savings are before any lost snack sales,\" the Jefferies analysts added.",

      "content": "alternative_right quotes a report from The Intercept: Federal prosecutors on January 9 charged Aurelio Luis Perez-Lugones, an IT specialist for an unnamed government contractor, with \"the offense of unlawful retention of national defense information,\" according to an FBI affidavit (PDF). The case attracted national attention after federal agents investigating Perez-Lugones searched the home of a Washington Post reporter. But overlooked so far in the media coverage is the fact that a surprising surveillance tool pointed investigators toward Perez-Lugones: an office printer with a photographic memory. News of the investigation broke when the Washington Post reported that investigators seized the work laptop, personal laptop, phone, and smartwatch of journalist Hannah Natanson, who has covered the Trump administration's impact on the federal government and recently wrote about developing more than 1,000 government sources. A Justice Department official told the Post that Perez-Lugones had been messaging Natanson to discuss classified information. The affidavit does not allege that Perez-Lugones disseminated national defense information, only that he unlawfully retained it.\n \nThe affidavit provides insight into how Perez-Lugones allegedly attempted to exfiltrate information from a Secure Compartmented Information Facility, or SCIF, and the unexpected way his employer took notice. According to the FBI, Perez-Lugones printed a classified intelligence report, albeit in a roundabout fashion. It's standard for workplace printers to log certain information, such as the names of files they print and the users who printed them. In an apparent attempt to avoid detection, Perez-Lugones, according to the affidavit, took screenshots of classified materials, cropped the screenshots, and pasted them into a Microsoft Word document. By using screenshots instead of text, there would be no record of a classified report printed from the specific workstation. (Depending on the employer's chosen data loss prevention monitoring software, access logs might show a specific user had opened the file and perhaps even tracked whether they took screenshots).\n \nPerez-Lugones allegedly gave the file an innocuous name, \"Microsoft Word - Document1,\" that might not stand out if printer logs were later audited. In this case, however, the affidavit reveals that Perez-Lugones's employer could see not only the typical metadata stored by printers, such as file names, file sizes, and time of printing, but it could also view the actual contents of the printed materials -- in this case, prosecutors say, the screenshots themselves. As the affidavit points out, \"Perez-Lugones' employer can retrieve records of print activity on classified systems, including copies of printed documents.\" [...] Aside from attempting to surreptitiously print a document, Perez-Lugones, investigators say, was also seen allegedly opening a classified document and taking notes, looking \"back and forth between the screen corresponding the classified system and the notepad, all the while writing on the notepad.\" The affidavit doesn't state how this observation was made, but it strongly suggests a video surveillance system was also in play.\n\n\n\n",

      "content": "In an opinion piece for The Atlantic, senior editor Saahil Desai argues that media outlets are increasingly treating prediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi as legitimate signals of reality. The risk, as Desai warns, is a future where news coverage amplifies manipulable betting odds and turns politics, geopolitics, and even tragedy into speculative gambling theater. Here's an excerpt from the report: [...] The problem is that prediction markets are ushering in a world in which news becomes as much about gambling as about the event itself. This kind of thing has already happened to sports, where the language of \"parlays\" and \"covering the spread\" has infiltrated every inch of commentary. ESPN partners with DraftKings to bring its odds to SportsCenter and Monday Night Football; CBS Sports has a betting vertical; FanDuel runs its own streaming network. But the stakes of Greenland's future are more consequential than the NFL playoffs.\n \nThe more that prediction markets are treated like news, especially heading into another election, the more every dip and swing in the odds may end up wildly misleading people about what might happen, or influencing what happens in the real world. Yet it's unclear whether these sites are meaningful predictors of anything. After the Golden Globes, Polymarket CEO Shayne Coplan excitedly posted that his site had correctly predicted 26 of 28 winners, which seems impressive -- but Hollywood awards shows are generally predictable. One recent study found that Polymarket's forecasts in the weeks before the 2024 election were not much better than chance.\n \nThese markets are also manipulable. In 2012, one bettor on the now-defunct prediction market Intrade placed a series of huge wagers on Mitt Romney in the two weeks preceding the election, generating a betting line indicative of a tight race. The bettor did not seem motivated by financial gain, according to two researchers who examined the trades. \"More plausibly, this trader could have been attempting to manipulate beliefs about the odds of victory in an attempt to boost fundraising, campaign morale, and turnout,\" they wrote. The trader lost at least $4 million but might have shaped media attention of the race for less than the price of a prime-time ad, they concluded. [...]\n \nThe irony of prediction markets is that they are supposed to be a more trustworthy way of gleaning the future than internet clickbait and half-baked punditry, but they risk shredding whatever shared trust we still have left. The suspiciously well-timed bets that one Polymarket user placed right before the capture of Nicolas Maduro may have been just a stroke of phenomenal luck that netted a roughly $400,000 payout. Or maybe someone with inside information was looking for easy money. [...] As Tarek Mansour, Kalshi's CEO, has said, his long-term goal is to \"financialize everything and create a tradable asset out of any difference in opinion.\" (Kalshi means \"everything\" in Arabic.) What could go wrong? As one viral post on X recently put it, \"Got a buddy who is praying for world war 3 so he can win $390 on Polymarket.\" It's a joke. I think.",

That will allow users to do much more with just their voice.\" 9to5Mac reports: The unannounced Siri overhaul will reportedly be revealed at WWDC in June as the flagship feature for iOS 27 and macOS 27. Its release is expected in September when Apple typically ships major software updates. While Apple plans to release an improved version of Siri and Apple Intelligence this spring, that version will use the existing Siri interface. The big difference is that Google's Gemini models will power the intelligence. With the bigger update planned for iOS 27, the iOS 26 upgrade to Siri and Apple Intelligence sounds more like the first step to a long overdue modernization.\n \nGurman reports that the major Siri overhaul will \"allow users to search the web for information, create content, generate images, summarize information and analyze uploaded files\" while using \"personal data to complete tasks, being able to more easily locate specific files, songs, calendar events and text messages.\" People are already familiar with conversational interactions with AI, and Bloomberg says the bigger update to Siri will be support both text and voice. Siri already uses these input methods, but there's no real continuity between sessions.",

      "content": "An anonymous reader quotes a report from TorrentFreak: Spotify and several major record labels, including UMG, Sony, and Warner, have taken legal action against the unknown operators of Anna's Archive. The action follows the shadow library's announcement that it would release hundreds of terabytes of scraped Spotify data. Unsealed documents reveal that the court already issued a broad preliminary injunction, ordering hosting companies, Cloudflare, and domain name services, to take action. [...] All these documents were filed under seal, as the shadow library might otherwise be tipped off and take countermeasures. These documents were filed ex-parte and kept away from Anna's Archive. According to Spotify and the labels, this is needed \"so that Anna's Archive cannot pre-emptively frustrate\" the countermeasures they seek.\n \nThe lawsuit (PDF), which was unsealed recently, explains directly why Anna's Archive lost several of its domain names over the past weeks. The .ORG domain was suspended by the U.S.-based Public Interest Registry (PIR) in early January, while a domain registrar took the .SE variant offline a few days later. \"We don't believe this has to do with our Spotify backup,\" AnnaArchivist said at the time, but court records prove them wrong. The unsealed paperwork shows that the court granted a temporary restraining order (TRO) on January 2, which aimed to target Anna's Archive hosting and domain names. The sealed nature of this order also explains why the .ORG registry informed us that it could not comment on the suspension last week. While the .ORG and the .SE domains are suspended now, other domains remain operational. This suggests that the responsible registrars and registries do not automatically comply with U.S. court orders.\n \n[...] While the unsealed documents resolve the domain suspension mystery, it is only the start of the legal battle in court. It is expected that Spotify and the music companies will do everything in their power to take further action, if needed. Interestingly, however, it appears that the music industry lawsuit may have already reached its goal. A few days ago, the dedicated Spotify download section was removed by Anna's Archive. Whether this removal is linked to the legal troubles is unknown. However, it appears that Anna's Archive stopped the specific distribution of Spotify content alleged in the complaint, seemingly in partial compliance with the injunction's ban on 'making available' the scraped files.",

      "content": "<p>Lawmakers in Washington are once again focusing on kids, screens, and mental health. But according to Congress, Big Tech is somehow both the problem&nbsp;&nbsp;the solution. The Senate Commerce Committee recently held a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2026/1/chairman-cruz-announces-kids-screen-time-hearing_2\">hearing</a> on “examining the effect of technology on America’s youth.” Witnesses warned about “addictive” online content, mental health, and kids spending too much time buried in screen. At the center of the debate is a bill from Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Brian Schatz (D-HI) called the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/278\">Kids Off Social Media Act (KOSMA),</a>&nbsp;which they say will protect children and “empower parents.”&nbsp;</p><p>That’s a reasonable goal, especially at a time when many parents feel overwhelmed and nervous about how much time their kids spend on screens. But while the bill’s press release contains soothing language, KOSMA doesn’t actually give parents more control.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead of respecting how most parents guide their kids towards healthy and educational content, KOSMA hands the control panel to Big Tech. That’s right—this bill would take power away from parents, and hand it over to the companies that lawmakers say are the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Kids Under 13 Are Already Banned From Social Media</strong></h3><p>One of the main promises of KOSMA is simple and dramatic: it would ban kids under 13 from social media. Based on the language of bill sponsors, one might think that’s a big change, and that today’s rules let kids wander freely into social media sites. But that’s not the case.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Every major platform already draws the same line: kids under 13 cannot have an account.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/terms/\">Facebook</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://help.instagram.com/termsofuse\">Instagram</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2025/01/429296/many-children-use-tiktok-against-rules\">TikTok</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/information-for-parents-and-minor-users\">X</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://kids.youtube.com/t/terms\">YouTube</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.snap.com/terms\">Snapchat</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360050817374-Age-restriction\">Discord</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.spotify.com/us/legal/end-user-agreement/plain/\">Spotify</a>, and even blogging platforms like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wordpress.com/tos/\">WordPress</a>&nbsp;all say essentially the same thing—if you’re under 13, you’re not allowed. That age line has been there for many years, mostly because of how online services comply with a federal privacy law called&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/rules/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule-coppa\">COPPA</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, everyone knows many kids under 13 are on these sites anyways. The real question is how and why they get access.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Most Social Media Use By Younger Kids Is Family-Mediated&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>If lawmakers picture under-13 social media use as a bunch of kids lying about their age and sneaking onto apps behind their parents’ backs, they’ve got it wrong. Serious studies that have looked at this all find the opposite: most under-13 use is out in the open, with parents’ knowledge, and often with their direct help.&nbsp;</p><p>A large national study published last year in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876285925000099\"></a>&nbsp;found that 63.8% of under-13s have a social media account, but only 5.4% of them said they were keeping one secret from their parents. That means roughly 90% of kids under 13 who are on social media aren’t hiding it at all. Their parents know. (For kids aged thirteen and over, the “secret account” number is almost as low, at 6.9%.)&nbsp;</p><p>Earlier research in the U.S. found the same pattern. In a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/public_comments/massachusetts-00243%C2%A0/00243-82161.pdf\">well-known study of Facebook use</a>&nbsp;by 10-to-14-year-olds, researchers found that about 70% of parents said they actually helped create their child’s account, and between 82% and 95% knew the account existed. Again, this wasn’t kids sneaking around. It was families making a decision together.</p><p>A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/protecting-children/a-third-of-children-have-false-social-media-age-of-18\">2022 study by the UK’s media regulator Ofcom</a>&nbsp;points in the same direction, finding that up to two-thirds of social media users below the age of thirteen had direct help from a parent or guardian getting onto the platform.&nbsp;</p><p>The typical under-13 social media user is not a sneaky kid. It’s a family making a decision together.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>KOSMA Forces Platforms To Override Families&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>This bill doesn’t just set an age rule. It creates a legal duty for platforms to police families.</p><p>Section 103(b) of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/278/text#toc-id6c00eb1f556f47aabc8e4f75f2f3e2c8\">bill</a>&nbsp;is blunt: if a platform knows a user is under 13, it “shall terminate any existing account or profile” belonging to that user. And “knows” doesn’t just mean someone admits their age. The bill defines knowledge to include what is “fairly implied on the basis of objective circumstances”—in other words, what a reasonable person would conclude from how the account is being used. The reality of how services would comply with KOSMA is clear: rather than risk liability for how they should have known a user was under 13, they will require all users to prove their age to ensure that they block anyone under 13.&nbsp;</p><p>KOSMA contains no exceptions for parental consent, for family accounts, or for educational or supervised use.&nbsp;The vast majority of people policed by this bill won’t be kids sneaking around—it will be minors who are following their parents’ guidance, and the parents themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>Imagine a child using their parent’s YouTube account to watch science videos about how a volcano works. If they were to leave a comment saying, “Cool video—I’ll show this to my 6th grade teacher!” and YouTube becomes aware of the comment, the platform now has clear signals that a child is using that account. It doesn’t matter whether the parent gave permission. Under KOSMA, the company is legally required to act. To avoid violating KOSMA, it would likely&nbsp; lock, suspend, or terminate the account, or demand proof it belongs to an adult. That proof would likely mean asking for a scan of a government ID, biometric data, or some other form of intrusive verification, all to keep what is essentially a “family” account from being shut down.</p><p>Violations of KOSMA are enforced by the FTC and state attorneys general. That’s more than enough legal risk to make platforms err on the side of cutting people off.</p><p>Platforms have no way to remove “just the kid” from a shared account. Their tools are blunt: freeze it, verify it, or delete it. Which means that even when a parent has explicitly approved and supervised their child’s use, KOSMA forces Big Tech to override that family decision.</p><h3><strong>Your Family, Their Algorithms</strong></h3><p>KOSMA doesn’t appoint a neutral referee. Under the law, companies like Google (YouTube), Meta (Facebook and Instagram), TikTok, Spotify, X, and Discord will become the ones who decide whose account survives, whose account gets locked, who has to upload ID, and whose family loses access altogether.&nbsp;They won’t be doing this because they want to—but because Congress is threatening them with legal liability if they don’t.&nbsp;</p><p>These companies don’t know your family or your rules. They only know what their algorithms infer. Under KOSMA, those inferences carry the force of law. Rather than parents or teachers, decisions about who can be online, and for what purpose, will be made by corporate compliance teams and automated detection systems.&nbsp;</p><p>This debate isn’t really about TikTok trends or doomscrolling. It’s about all the ordinary, boring, parent-guided uses of the modern internet. It’s about a kid watching “How volcanoes work” on regular YouTube, instead of the stripped-down YouTube Kids. It’s about using a shared Spotify account to listen to music a parent already approves. It’s about piano lessons from a teacher who makes her living from YouTube ads.</p><p>These aren’t loopholes. They’re how parenting works in the digital age. Parents increasingly filter, supervise, and, usually, decide together with their kids. KOSMA will lead to more locked accounts, and more parents submitting to face scans and ID checks. It will also lead to more power concentrated in the hands of the companies Congress claims to distrust.&nbsp;</p><p>KOSMA also includes separate restrictions on how platforms can use algorithms for users aged 13 to 17. Those raise their own serious questions about speech, privacy, and how online services work, and need debate and scrutiny as well. But they don’t change the core problem here: this bill hands control over children’s online lives to Big Tech.</p><p>If Congress really wants to help families, it should start with something much simpler and much more effective:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/04/eff-congress-heres-what-strong-privacy-law-looks\">strong privacy protections for everyone</a>. Limits on data collection, restrictions on behavioral tracking, and rules that apply to adults as well as kids would do far more to reduce harmful incentives than deputizing companies to guess how old your child is and shut them out.</p><p>But if lawmakers aren’t ready to do that, they should at least drop KOSMA and start over. A law that treats ordinary parenting as a compliance problem is not protecting families—it’s undermining them.</p><p>Parents don’t need Big Tech to replace them. They need laws that respect how families actually work.</p>",

      "content": "<p>The biggest risk as a leader is playing safe and not taking any risks—going with popular decisions instead of pushing for unusual prospects, faking confidence and projecting an image of perfection instead of showing up authentically by admitting limitations and acknowledging what they don’t know, saying yes all the time to people please and build likability instead of saying no to focus on high-impact work even if it displeases someone in the short-term, staying silent to maintain peace and harmony instead of speaking up and voicing their concerns, maintaining the status quo with fear of failure instead of pushing for continuous reinvention and maintaining a tight control over their team instead of empowering and letting go.</p><p>\\\nLeaders need to have a high appetite for taking risks, not just in choosing unconventional paths, taking bold risks or setting aggressive business targets, but also in the way they lead their teams—what they choose to hide and what they choose to share, how do they balance freedom and control, what image they project and the message that passes to their teams and how they handle difficult situations that are messy and hard. It’s often a tricky balance, one that requires taking risks without going overboard and stepping into the unproductive zone.</p><p><em>Giving boundaryless freedom can lead to very bad decisions.</em></p><p><em>Sharing information that doesn’t concern people in the team can confuse and distract them.</em></p><p><em>Displaying extreme emotions in the name of authenticity can dilute the impact of the message being conveyed.</em></p><p><em>Speaking truth without a sign of compassion can seem cruel and inhuman.</em></p><p>\\\nEvery situation at work has some risk involved—risk of failure, risk of reputation, risk of judgment, risk of criticism, risk of disappointment, risk of misunderstanding. These risks can often prevent leaders from engaging in behaviors that are uncomfortable at first. When risk hijacks the amygdala in the brain, it exaggerates negative outcomes and sidelines logical reasoning, making leaders hyper-focused on avoiding threats rather than exploring opportunities.</p><p>\\\nBut leaders who don’t take these risks limit their team’s growth and potential. People in the organization take their cues from their leaders and model their behaviors—leaders who don’t embrace risks indirectly tell their teams to play it safe too.</p><blockquote><p>Leadership is scarce because few people are willing to go through the discomfort required to lead. This scarcity makes leadership valuable.…It’s uncomfortable to stand up in front of strangers. It’s uncomfortable to propose an idea that might fail. It’s uncomfortable to challenge the status quo. It’s uncomfortable to resist the urge to settle. When you identify the discomfort, you’ve found the place where a leader is needed. If you’re not uncomfortable in your work as a leader, it’s almost certain you’re not reaching your potential as a leader.</p></blockquote><p>\\\nHere are the 5 risks every leader must take daily because it’s impossible to get better at anything without consistent practice:</p><h3>Making Unpopular Decisions</h3><p>It’s safe to go with the majority and nod in agreement to a popular decision. You don’t have to voice your concern, share your opinion, or express a disagreement because doing these things often comes with a risk.</p><p><em>What if others don’t like it?</em></p><p><em>What if they turn against you?</em></p><p>\\\nBut prioritizing consensus, popularity, approval, and likability keeps the possibility of a better decision out of reach. You may not share your opinion when it doesn’t align with the majority because it requires standing up with courage and conviction. You may not speak up when you disagree because you worry about how it will be perceived. You may agree to a decision that you know won’t work because telling others they’re wrong is often scary.</p><p>\\\nChallenging the status quo, voicing your concerns, and sharing disruptive ideas is risky—but it’s the risk you’ve got to take as a leader. It may subject you to frowns from people who think your ideas are crazy. You may face resistance at first. Some might even disapprove of it. Others might resent you for your ability to think creatively and provide a fresh perspective.</p><blockquote><p>The true mark of a leader is the willingness to stick with a bold course of action — an unconventional business strategy, a unique product-development roadmap, a controversial marketing campaign — even as the rest of the world wonders why you're not marching in step with the status quo. In other words, real leaders are happy to zig while others zag. They understand that in an era of hyper-competition and non-stop disruption, the only way to stand out from the crowd is to stand for something special.</p></blockquote><p>\\\nTo build risk-taking capacity for speaking up without falling for groupthink, ask these questions:</p><ol><li>Am I saying yes to this decision because I really believe in it or because it aligns with the majority?</li><li>Are all ideas simply small variations of one another, tried-and-tested approaches, or things that have less risk involved? What would be a completely unique approach that we haven’t explored yet?</li><li>Why are other options less exciting compared to the current choice?</li><li>What’s the worst that could happen if this decision does not work out as expected? What’s my plan B?</li><li>How can I get a buy-in without intimidating and pushing others away?</li></ol><p>\\\nAvoiding new opportunities with fear of failure, dismissing ideas because they seem too risky, or defaulting to tried-and-tested methods over bold initiatives caps your team’s potential. Have the courage and conviction to stand alone. Take the risk by navigating the uncharted territory.</p><p>You may put on a facade of strength by hiding your vulnerabilities to protect yourself from being exposed. Bringing your authentic self to work by admitting gaps in your knowledge, sharing your mistakes, or expressing your true emotions and feelings often comes with a risk.</p><p>\\\n<em>What if people doubt your competence?</em></p><p><em>What if they don’t respect you?</em></p><p><em>What if it makes you look weak?</em></p><p>\\\nBut projecting an image of confidence, faking knowledge when you don’t know something, and hiding your true emotions and feelings prevent you from building a bond with people at work. Leaders aren’t expected to be perfect—they’re required to be human. What builds respect isn’t your successes but how gracefully you handled failures. What develops a sense of connection isn’t your imperfections, but the flaws you were willing to share. What enables safety isn’t the fancy messages or the words of encouragement, but how you model safety through your own behaviors and actions.</p><p>\\\nVulnerability is not weakness—admitting mistakes, not having all the answers, or saying  does not hurt your credibility as a leader. In fact, it increases approachability, builds likability, and increases respect. Pretending to know something or coming across as a  frustrates others—they can see when you genuinely have the knowledge and experience and when you’re just faking it. But remember this: authenticity can’t be an excuse for burdening others by oversharing or justifying your reckless behavior. You have to seek a balance by defining clear boundaries for yourself and others.</p><blockquote><p>Fear of being shamed causes people to put on masks and live in fear and pretense, creating a stronghold of pride. Authentic, transparent leaders encourage people to develop trust through their own honesty and vulnerability. They do not view transparency as weakness, but recognize it as a source of their virtue, power and anointing because power flows through humility.</p></blockquote><p>\\\nTo build risk-taking capacity while showing up authentically without going overboard, ask these questions:</p><ol><li>What information do I need to share with others? Is it important for them to know? How will it be helpful without overwhelming them?</li><li>How can I combine my struggles with the solutions I implemented so that it encourages others to stay resilient and not develop a complaining attitude?</li><li>How can I express my lack of confidence in something without coming across as unsure or indecisive?</li><li>How can I share what I’m feeling without unsettling others or making them feel responsible for fixing it?</li></ol><p>\\\nLeaders aren’t deeply admired for their intelligence, knowledge, experience, or skills, but for the way they make others feel—human. Don’t hide your mistakes. Don’t cover your flaws. Show up authentically.</p><p>Difficult conversations, by nature, are tricky. They are touchy topics that no one likes to talk about. They involve addressing differences of opinion, emotional issues, sensitive subjects, or other potential reasons for conflict—anything you find hard to talk about. They are challenging because they require you to navigate through discomfort, uncertainty, and a wide range of complex emotions.</p><p>\\\nYou may ignore difficult situations at work or put them off for too long—an employee not performing, a high performer displaying toxic behavior, or stakeholders making unreasonable demands. These situations are sensitive and often need to be handled with care. Staying silent and doing nothing seems like a safer option when speaking up and not getting the alignment you need can be even more risky. It’s much easier to avoid emotionally draining and mentally exhausting situations than step right into them consciously.</p><p>\\\n<em>What if they don’t agree with you?</em></p><p><em>What if they go behind your back to seek approvals?</em></p><p>\\\nBut putting off  is a bad idea because issues left unaddressed escalate over time. What was once a manageable problem can grow into a much larger issue if not addressed on time. Constant worry about unresolved issues can take a toll on your mental health and lead to increased stress, anxiety, and even feelings of helplessness. When important issues are being ignored or swept under the rug, it can erode trust, build resentment, and damage relationships.</p><p>\\\nNo matter how hard a conversation is, you can’t put it off or delay it forever. Addressing issues directly, providing clarity, and seeking closure can help you gain trust and respect, and also alleviate stress.</p><blockquote><p>Beginning a conversation is an act of bravery. When you initiate a conversation, you fearlessly step into the unknown. Will the other person respond to favorably or unfavorably? Will it be a friendly or hostile exchange? There is a feeling of being on the edge. That nanosecond of space and unknowing can be intimidating. It shows your vulnerability.</p></blockquote><p>\\\nTo build risk-taking capacity for speaking hard truths, ask these questions:</p><ol><li>How am I dealing with this difficult situation—am I facing the situation head-on or seeing the problem, closing my eyes, and getting busy with something else?</li><li>What’s the impact of not addressing this issue at the right time?</li><li>What’s the worst that can happen if I speak the truth?</li><li>How can I communicate in a manner that does not cause the other person to react badly or turn defensive?</li></ol><p>\\\nDifficult conversations, though necessary, are hard to crack. Fear of a bad outcome or not knowing what to say can prevent you from speaking hard truths. Stop playing silly games. Engage in healthy dialogue right when you need it the most.</p><p>You may be involved in every small decision, every minute detail, and every communication that happens in your team. Staying on top of everything makes it less likely for things to go wrong—risk factor is minimized when you’re in control. Letting go requires you to relinquish control, which can leave you with feelings of anxiety, insecurity, and helplessness.</p><p>\\\n<em>What if they make a big mistake?</em></p><p><em>What if they overshadow you?</em></p><p>\\\nBut not empowering your team to make their own decisions or demanding that they consult you on every problem prevents them from developing the skills required to grow in their role—if you keep doing all the thinking for your team, they’ll never develop creative thinking skills. If you keep solving their problems, they’ll never learn to navigate complexity. If you keep preventing mistakes, they’ll become more reckless and inattentive.</p><p>\\\nEmpowerment is risky, but it’s the only way to develop future leaders. Unless people in the team get the freedom and opportunity to own their decisions, make mistakes, and try different strategies to achieve their goals, they’ll always be dependent on someone else, which will not only slow them down but also prevent them from developing the skills required to grow in their role. Both freedom and control are necessary—but you have to seek the right balance. Without taking that risk, you’ll be left with a team that can’t keep up as business scales and expectations expand.</p><blockquote><p>Micromanagement happens when you keep power to yourself. Empowerment is when you give power to your team.</p></blockquote><p>\\\nTo build risk-taking capacity for letting go by enabling your team to do great things independently, ask these questions:</p><ol><li>Is my team clear on the goals and the outcomes they are expected to achieve? What information might be missing that can prevent them from succeeding?</li><li>Do people in the team have the skills and knowledge required to make their own decisions? What gaps exist? How can these gaps be filled without my continuous intervention?</li><li>Have I set clear decision boundaries with my team on the kind of decisions they can make independently and the ones where I need to be involved?</li><li>Do I hold my team accountable to meet their deadlines while not compromising on quality?</li><li>Do I encourage my team to learn from their mistakes, put a new plan into place, and keep moving forward instead of berating them and filling them with feelings of incompetence and self-doubt?</li></ol><p>\\\nKeeping tight control over your team for the risk of failure prevents you from scaling and building a high-performing team. It’s a recipe for short-term wins, not long-term success. Coach, don’t spoon-feed your team. Let them spread their wings.</p><p>You may say “yes” to every request, every opportunity, and every change you’re asked to consider. Being agreeable puts less burden on you to prioritize and also reduces chances of conflict—saying no can be risky because you don’t know how others will respond or how your decisions will turn out.</p><p>\\\n<em>What if they take it personally?</em></p><p><em>What if you let go of a great opportunity?</em></p><p>\\\nBut committing more than you could handle or saying “yes” to inconsequential activities will ultimately hurt your reputation as you fail to meet commitments or create the desired impact. Saying “yes” brings short-term comfort—you don’t have to worry about how others will respond or the fear of making the wrong decision. But not considering the consequences of your decision turns into regret when you finally have to face them in the future.</p><p>\\\nYour responsibility as a leader isn’t to please everyone or make them happy; it’s to multiply your impact and the value you add by risking saying no. Saying no that lands right does not need lengthy explanations—they come across as justifications and often distract and confuse the other person. Instead, be precise. State your reason by being straightforward, clear, and concise—three elements of good communication.</p><blockquote><p>The great art is to learn to integrate the two, to marry yes and no. That is the secret to standing up for yourself and what you need, without destroying valuable agreements and precious relationships. That is what a ‘Positive No’ seeks to achieve.</p></blockquote><p>\\\nInstead of a knee-jerk yes or no, build risk-taking capacity for saying no by asking these questions:</p><ol><li>What’s this request about—what exactly is it asking me to do?</li><li>What excites me about this opportunity?</li><li>What’s the cost of taking it on—in terms of effort, time required, and the impact on the team’s existing priorities? What’s the scale and scope of the request? What kind of time commitment does it demand?</li><li>What’s the cost of not doing it? How important is it to the person and the organization?</li><li>How does it align with my team’s current plans and commitments?</li><li>What could be my reason for saying no?</li></ol><p>\\\nNo is risky, but so is yes. Every “yes” you say has an opportunity cost—doing something will always come at the cost of not doing something else. Give yourself permission to say no. Protect your team’s time and energy.</p><blockquote><p>Leadership is all about making the jump, taking risks, and learning from your mistakes. It's about falling, dusting ourselves off, and getting back up again and again and again.</p></blockquote><ol><li>Leaders need to build a very strong appetite for taking risks, not just in business decisions—defining strategies, setting targets, and taking bets, but also in how they lead their teams.</li><li>Standing up and suggesting an unpopular choice is often risky—it may not work, others may not like it, or you may face a lot of resistance. But not challenging the status quo and staying with safe options limits your impact. Don’t take the easy road—fight for choices that are hard at first, but rewarding in the end.</li><li>Expressing gaps in your knowledge or sharing your fears can be risky—what if others doubt your competence or your authenticity is mistaken for weakness? But faking knowledge or pretending to be someone you’re not prevents you from bonding and building trust. Showing up authentically as a leader builds connection—seeing the real you makes you more trustworthy and appealing as a human. Vulnerability is not weakness—balance it by defining boundaries without overwhelming others with too much information or excessive emotions.</li><li>Facing difficult situations head-on and resolving the conflict evokes strong feelings of fear as pointing out performance gaps, addressing toxic behavior, or confronting unreasonable stakeholders is often risky—others may turn defensive or resent you for speaking the truth. But not addressing them at the right time makes the problem worse. Care personally and challenge directly—be candid and compassionate to make yourself heard.</li><li>Being too involved with your team gives you a sense of control and makes it feel less risky, as it gives you the opportunity to make decisions, solve problems, and avoid mistakes. But doing all the thinking for your team keeps them dependent and prevents them from learning and growing. Let go of control. Empower your team—optimize for long-term growth, not short-term wins.</li><li>Saying yes to every request and every change appears less risky, as you don’t have to worry about upsetting someone or letting go of a great opportunity. But not prioritizing work makes you overcommit—you overpromise and underdeliver, which hurts your credibility. Learn to say no without feelings of shame or guilt. Don’t just make commitments, keep them, too.</li></ol><p>\\\nThis story was previously published&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.techtello.com/5-risks-you-cannot-afford-not-to-take-as-a-leader/\">here</a>.&nbsp;Follow me on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sagivini/?ref=hackernoon.com\">LinkedIn</a>&nbsp;or here for more stories.</p>",

The arrests are an extreme attack on what is most often a wholesome hobby that has a history of being vilified by authoritarian governments in part because the technology is quite censorship resistant.\n \nThe detentions were announced last week on Belarusian state TV, which claimed the men were part of a network of more than 50 people participating in the amateur radio hobby and have been accused of both \"espionage\" and \"treason.\" Authorities there said they seized more than 500 pieces of radio equipment. The men were accused on state TV of using radio to spy on the movement of government planes, though no actual evidence of this has been produced. State TV claimed they were associated with the Belarusian Federation of Radioamateurs and Radiosportsmen (BFRR), a long-running amateur radio club and nonprofit that holds amateur radio competitions, meetups, trainings, and forums. Siarhei Besarab, a Belarusian HAM radio operator, posted a plea for support from others in the r/amateurradio subreddit. \"I am writing this because my local community is being systematically liquidated in what I can only describe as a targeted intellectual genocide,\" Besarab wrote. \"I beg you to amplify this signal and help us spread this information.

      "title": "Does MariaDB Depend on MySQL?",
      "url": "https://hackernoon.com/does-mariadb-depend-on-mysql?source=rss",
      "date": 1769031163,
      "author": "Alejandro Duarte",
      "guid": 37732,
      "unread": true,
      "content": "<p>When MariaDB was first announced in 2009 by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Widenius\">Michael “Monty” Widenius</a>, it was positioned as a “fork of MySQL.” I think that was a Bad Idea™. Okay, maybe it wasn’t a bad idea as such. After all, MariaDB indeed is a fork of MySQL. But what is a  in the software sense, and how is this reflected in MariaDB? A fork is a software project that takes the source code of another project and continues development independently from the original. </p><p>\\\nForks often start by maintaining compatibility with their parent project, but they can evolve to become detached from their own features, architecture, bug tracker, mailing list, development philosophy, and community. This is the case of MariaDB, with the addition that it continues to be highly compatible with old MySQL versions and with its current ecosystem at large.</p><p>\\\nBefore we dig into it, let me clarify that I like MySQL. It was the very first database that I installed during my university time, and I have used it in my hobby as well as production projects for a long time. So, why did I affirm that positioning MariaDB as a fork of MySQL was a bad idea? In short, because MariaDB doesn’t depend on MySQL. The idea of defining MariaDB merely as a fork of MySQL leads to misconceptions around its future. Take, as an example, this old comment on <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4401796\">Hacker News</a> which refers to the phrase “RIP Open Source MySQL”:</p><p>\\\n<em>“Forgive my ignorance, but doesn’t this harm MySQL forks as well? Since the test cases are unavailable from now on, say for example they wanted to reimplement a certain feature, isn’t it much harder for them to validate that their implementation works correctly?”</em></p><p>\\\nI sympathize with the author of this comment. We were unintentionally misled by the “fork of MySQL” slogan. I encounter this kind of lack of clarity more often than I would like. But the reality is that the development of MariaDB has been independent for many years already. MariaDB developers don’t wait for MySQL to implement features, test cases, fix bugs, or <a href=\"https://mariadb.com/resources/blog/15-reasons-why-developers-and-dbas-love-mariadb-server/\">innovate</a>. They write their own tests, create their own features, and solve problems in their own way. </p><p>\\\nWhen Oracle changes something in MySQL or restricts access to a component, that has no meaningful impact on MariaDB’s roadmap because the projects have diverged so significantly that they’re essentially different database systems that happen to share some common ancestry, be highly compatible (you can use MySQL connectors and tools with MariaDB), and are <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zj02QzbbN8o&amp;t=725s\">named after Monty’s children</a>.</p><ol><li> The most common outcome, since keeping a software project alive requires considerable effort.</li><li><strong>A re-merging of the fork with the original:</strong> Both software projects rejoin each other.</li><li><strong>The death of the original:</strong> Users and developers move to the new, younger project.</li><li> Both find success with different developers and end users.</li></ol><p>\\\nFor years, the MySQL-MariaDB situation was clearly a  where both projects found new homes. One in Oracle, the other in the new <a href=\"https://mariadb.org\">MariaDB Foundation</a>/<a href=\"https://mariadb.com\">MariaDB plc</a> duo. Contrary to what many would have thought, Oracle invested in MySQL and continued its development in the open despite having its own closed-source relational database. </p><p>\\\nRecent (and not so recent) findings and events show that Oracle has slowed down at least on the innovation front and at worst on the maintenance side. In his article <a href=\"https://optimizedbyotto.com/post/reasons-to-stop-using-mysql/\">Stop using MySQL in 2026, it is not true open source</a>, Otto Kekäläinen (former Software Development Manager at AWS) shows that “the number of git commits on github.com/mysql/mysql-server has been significantly declining in 2025.” </p><p>\\\nHe also highlights the steep decrease in MySQL’s popularity according to <a href=\"https://db-engines.com/en/ranking_trend\">DB-Engines</a>, as well as the reported “degraded performance with newer MySQL versions.” Are we witnessing a “death of the original” here? I don’t know.</p><p>\\\nIn light of all this, many developers are starting to evaluate migration strategies to other relational databases, with MariaDB and TiDB being two of the most attractive options. According to Otto Kekäläinen, “TiDB only really shines with larger distributed setups, so for the vast majority of regular small and mid-scale applications currently using MySQL, the most practical solution is probably to just switch to MariaDB.” </p><p>\\\nHow about the elephant in the room, you might ask? PostgreSQL is a database with tons of forks and third-party extensions that you can download, which makes it popular not only due to its features but also the sheer number of companies marketing their PostgreSQL flavor online. For applications currently using MySQL, migrating to PostgreSQL requires a lot of work, including SQL code and connector migrations. Two tasks that can be close to zero-effort with MariaDB. Check, for example, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvrP_X9x4eE\">this crazy live broadcast</a> where Cantamen (Germany’s leading car-sharing service provider) migrates from MySQL to MariaDB with the help of Monty himself.</p><p>\\\nLet’s get back to my highly opinionated introductory statement… MariaDB is a—now we have learned—detached fork of MySQL, and, to be fair, it has also been positioned as a “MySQL replacement,” which is something very accurate to state. I’m glad to see the “replacement” slogan more and more often as opposed to the “fork” one. I personally suggested to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaj_Arn%c3%b6\">Kaj Arnö</a> (Executive Chairman at the MariaDB Foundation) going with something even stronger, like “MariaDB fixes MySQL.” That’s a bit too strong, perhaps. I’m glad they softened it to <a href=\"https://mariadb.org/mariadb-is-the-future-of-mysql/\">“MariaDB is the Future of MySQL”</a>.</p>",

      "content": "<p><strong>Artificial intelligence (AI) has quickly become a hot topic in modern cybersecurity and is often talked about as the cure-all for an increasingly hostile threat landscape. From automated threat detection to self-healing systems, AI is frequently touted as the technology that will finally tip the balance in defenders’ favor.</strong></p><p>\\\nYet, behind the bold claims and vendor marketing, the day-to-day reality of how AI is really used in security operations is far more nuanced. As cyber threats continue to grow, separating what AI can deliver realistically today from what remains aspirational has become essential.</p><h2>The Hype: AI as the Ultimate Cybersecurity Behavior</h2><p>Much of the conversation around AI in cybersecurity has been shaped by bold promises and rapid adoption, often blurring the line between what the technology can do and what it is expected to do. Before examining AI’s role in security operations, it’s worth unpacking how hype, perception, and pressure have influenced its reputation.</p><p>In marketing materials and conference keynotes, AI is often promoted as a flawless, all-seeing defense mechanism — one capable of identifying every threat, stopping every attack, and doing so with minimal human intervention.</p><p>\\\nThis framing is particularly appealing as security teams must contend with rising alert volumes and increasingly automated attack techniques. However, real-world research reveals a gap between expectation and execution. In the 2025 Exabeams report,  AI had improved productivity, but only 22% of frontline security analysts agreed. Therefore, there is a sharp disconnect between leadership perception and operational reality.</p><p>\\\nIn practice, AI tools perform best when automating narrow, well-defined tasks rather than serving as a comprehensive or autonomous security solution.</p><h3>The Influence of Generative AI</h3><p>The rapid rise of generative AI has further intensified these inflated expectations. Tools like ChatGPT have demonstrated how convincingly AI can generate responses, analyze information, and adapt to user input, leading many to assume similar capabilities can be seamlessly applied across cybersecurity.</p><p>\\\nThe technology is undoubtedly influential, but research helps clarify where those assumptions break down. Studies examining the use of generative AI in security operations show that while these models can streamline tasks, such as alert summarization and phishing analysis, they still struggle with contextual decision-making.</p><p>\\\nThis can be especially true  and organizational risk tolerance. As a result, generative AI is most effective when supporting analysts rather than replacing human judgment.</p><p>Beyond the tech marketing and media narratives, executive pressure has become a powerful driver of AI adoption in cybersecurity. Boards and C-suite leaders increasingly expect security teams to be using AI, even when expectations are loosely defined or misaligned with operational readiness.</p><p>\\\nFor CISOs, this often creates a top-down mandate driven by fear of falling behind competitors or missing out on perceived innovation. In many organizations, AI becomes a strategic checkbox rather than a capability deployed with clear goals and constraints. As a result, some teams find themselves implementing AI tools before they have the data quality, governance structures, or internal expertise to support them effectively.</p><h2>The Current Reality of AI in Cybersecurity</h2><p>While the hype often frames AI as transformational, its real-world role in cybersecurity is far more practical and constrained. Today’s AI deployments focus less on replacing analysts and more on improving speed, scale, and consistency across specific security tasks.</p><p>In practice, AI is most effective when applied to well-scoped, data-intensive problems. Security teams commonly use machine learning models to enhance threat detection, identify anomalous behavior across large datasets, and automate repetitive workflows such as alert triage and log correlation.</p><p>\\\nTo understand how widely these capabilities are being applied, researchers have examined the current body of work on AI in cybersecurity. A systematic review of AI in cybersecurity found that , 236 were identified as primary works focused on use cases.</p><p>\\\nThis number demonstrates the growing body of documented research where AI is actively deployed across functions like detection, response, and protection rather than only in theory. Therefore, this analysis suggests that AI’s role in cybersecurity has moved beyond isolated experimentation and into task-specific operational use.</p><p>\\\nReal-world case studies also reinforce this role. Analysis of AI-driven detection techniques shows that machine learning-based systems  and support faster investigation workflows, provided the underlying data is robust and relevant. These outcomes point to AI’s strength as an efficiency multiplier rather than a stand-alone defensive system.</p><p>Despite these gains, AI in cybersecurity remains constrained by several structural limitations. Effective models need large volumes of high-quality training data, but this is something many organizations struggle to maintain. Incomplete datasets, noisy logs, or biased inputs can lead to inaccurate detections or missed threats, undermining trust in automated systems.</p><p>\\\nMore critically, machine learning models can themselves be vulnerable to manipulation. Research in adversarial machine learning shows that carefully crafted inputs can cause models , creating opportunities for attackers to defeat defenses built around AI logic.</p><p>\\\nThese findings show why human oversight remains essential. AI may accelerate analysis, but it can’t independently reason about threat intent, business impact, or novel attack strategies. As a result, most organizations continue to deploy AI as part of a layered defense strategy rather than as a primary decision-maker.</p><h2>Where Management and Strategy Make a Difference</h2><p>Even the most advanced AI systems remain tools. In cybersecurity, their effectiveness depends more on how security teams deploy them than on algorithmic sophistication. AI can surface anomalies, correlate signals, and accelerate analysis.</p><p>\\\nWhat it can’t do is independently prioritize risk, weigh business impact, or adapt strategy in response to changing organizational goals. Without clearly defined escalation paths and informed human judgment, AI becomes another source of alerts.</p><p>\\\nThis is where people and processes play a decisive role. Research across industries has shown that management work  of productivity variation, and cybersecurity is no exception. Teams with strong leadership and well-defined response strategies are far better off integrating AI into daily operations to amplify analyst expertise rather than replace it.</p><p>\\\nConversely, poorly managed teams often struggle to extract value even from sophisticated AI platforms, finding that automation without strategy can exacerbate confusion instead of reducing it. In short, successful AI adoption in cybersecurity hinges on the human systems that guide its use.</p><h2>A Glimpse Into the Next Generation of AI in Cybersecurity</h2><p>Looking ahead, much of the innovation in AI-driven cybersecurity is focused on making defenses more adaptive. One area gaining traction is the use of AI-powered deception technologies, which aim to shift security from passive detection to active engagement.</p><p>\\\nFor instance, AI-driven honeypots are increasingly made to dynamically , learning from attacker interactions and automatically modifying decoys to better mirror real production environments. This approach allows defenders to gather higher-quality intelligence on attacker techniques while increasing the cost and complexity of successful intrusions.</p><p>\\\nStill, these emerging capabilities point toward evolution, not replacement. While AI-enhanced honeypots and autonomous response systems may improve visibility and slow attackers, they also introduce new operational challenges like model governance and the risk of false confidence.</p><p>\\\nThe most likely future state is not fully autonomous security, but increasingly intelligent tools that extend a hand out to human teams. As AI systems become more capable of interaction and adaptation, their success will continue to depend on careful oversight and a realistic understanding of where automation ends, and human judgment must take over.</p><h2>Separating Signal from Noise</h2><p>AI has undeniably changed how cybersecurity teams detect and respond to threats, but its impact is often overstated as a stand-alone solution. In reality, today’s AI tools work best when applied to specific problems and guided by experienced teams who understand their limitations.</p><p>\\\nAs the technology continues to evolve, the gap between hype and value will depend on how carefully organizations integrate it into their security strategies. For most teams, progress will come from using AI as one part of a balanced, human-led defense.</p>",

      "content": "<h2>2.2 Probabilistic modeling and inference in DL</h2><p>Learning in general can be viewed as a process of updating certain beliefs about the state of the world based on the new information. This abstract point of view underlies the broad field of Probabilistic ML [17]. In this Subsection we mention certain aspects of this field which are the most relevant for the present study.</p><p>\\\nThe general idea of updating beliefs can be formalized as learning an optimal (according to a certain criterion) probability distribution. This further implies that implementation of probabilistic ML algorithms involves optimization over spaces of probability distributions. Therefore, gradient flows on spaces of probability measures [18, 19] are essential ingredients of probabilistic modeling in ML. The notion of gradient flow requires the metric structure. The distance between two probability measures should represent the degree of difficulty to distinguish between them provided that a limited number of samples is available. Metric on spaces of probability measures are induced by the Hessians of various divergence functions [20, 21]. The classical (and parametric invariant) choice is the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL divergence), also referred to as relative entropy. This divergence induces the Fisher (or Fisher-Rao) information metric on spaces of probability measures thus turning them into statistical manifolds [20]. When optimizing over a family of probability distributions, Euclidean (or, so called, \"vanilla\") gradient is inappropriate. Ignoring of this fact, leads to inaccurate or incorrect algorithms. Instead, one should use the gradient w.r. to Fisher information metric, which is named natural gradient [22, 23, 24]. In RL this must be taken into account when designing stochastic policies. In particular, well known actor-critic algorithm has been modified in order to respect geometry of the space of probability distributions [25].</p><p>\\\nAnother way of introducing metric on spaces of probability distributions is the Wasserstein metric. Fokker-Planck equations are gradient flows in the Wasserstein metric. The potential function for these flows is the KL divergence between the instant and (unknown) stationary distribution [26]. Yet another metric sometimes used in ML is the Stein metric [27].</p><p>(1) Vladimir Jacimovic, Faculty of Natural Sciences and Mathematics, University of Montenegro Cetinjski put bb., 81000 Podgorica Montenegro (vladimirj@ucg.ac.me).</p><p>:::info\nThis paper is  under CC by 4.0 Deed (Attribution 4.0 International) license.</p>",

      "content": "<p>As AI-driven applications move from experimentation into real-time production systems, the expectations placed on vector similarity search continue to rise dramatically. Teams now need to support billion-scale datasets, high concurrency, strict p99 latency budgets, and a level of operational simplicity that reduces architectural overhead rather than adding to it.</p><p>ScyllaDB Vector Search was built with these constraints in mind. It offers a unified engine for storing structured data alongside unstructured embeddings, and it achieves performance that pushes the boundaries of what a managed database system can deliver at scale. The results of our recent high scale 1-billion-vector benchmark show that ScyllaDB demonstrates both ultra-low latency and highly predictable behaviour under load.</p><p>To achieve low-single-millisecond performance across massive vector sets, ScyllaDB adopts an architecture that separates the storage and indexing responsibilities while keeping the system unified from the user’s perspective. The ScyllaDB nodes store both the structured attributes and the vector embeddings in the same distributed table. Meanwhile, a dedicated Vector Store service – implemented in Rust and powered by the USearch engine optimized to support ScyllaDB’s predictable single-digit millisecond latencies – consumes updates from ScyllaDB via CDC and builds approximate-nearest-neighbour (ANN) indexes in memory. Queries are issued to the database using a familiar CQL expression such as:</p><pre><code>SELECT … ORDER BY vector_column ANN_OF ? LIMIT k;\n</code></pre><p>They are then internally routed to the Vector Store, which performs the similarity search and returns the candidate rows. This design allows each layer to scale independently, optimising for its own workload characteristics and eliminating resource interference.</p><h2>Benchmarking 1 Billion Vectors</h2><p>To evaluate real-world performance, ScyllaDB ran a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/scylladb/vector-store/blob/master/docs/benchmarking.md\">rigorous benchmark</a>&nbsp;using the publicly available yandex-deep_1b dataset, which contains 1 billion vectors of 96 dimensions. The setup consisted of six nodes: three ScyllaDB nodes running on i4i.16xlarge instances, each equipped with 64 vCPUs, and three Vector Store nodes running on r7i.48xlarge instances, each with 192 vCPUs. This hardware configuration reflects realistic production deployments where the database and vector indexing tiers are provisioned with different resource profiles. The results focus on two usage scenarios with distinct accuracy and latency goals (detailed in the following sections).</p><p>A full architectural deep-dive, including diagrams, performance trade-offs, and extended benchmark results for higher-dimension datasets, can be found in the technical blog post&nbsp;. These additional results follow the same pattern seen in the 96-dimensional tests: exceptionally low latency, high throughput, and stability across a wide range of concurrent load profiles.</p><h3>Scenario #1 — Ultra-Low Latency with Moderate Recall</h3><p>The first scenario was designed for workloads such as recommendation engines and real-time personalisation systems, where the primary objective is extremely low latency and the recall can be moderately relaxed. We used index parameters m = 16, ef-construction = 128, ef-search = 64 and Euclidean distance. \\n At approximately 70% recall and with 30 concurrent searches, the system maintained a p99 latency of only 1.7 milliseconds and a p50 of just 1.2 milliseconds, while sustaining 25,000 queries per second.</p><p>When expanding the throughput window (still keeping p99 latency below 10 milliseconds), the cluster reached 60,000 QPS for k = 100 with a p50 latency of 4.5 milliseconds, and 252,000 QPS for k = 10 with a p50 latency of 2.2 milliseconds. Importantly, utilizing ScyllaDB’s predictable performance, this throughput scales linearly: adding more Vector Store nodes directly increases the achievable QPS without compromising latency or recall.</p><h3>Scenario #2 — High Recall with Slightly Higher Latency</h3><p>The second scenario targets systems that require near-perfect recall, including high-fidelity semantic search and retrieval-augmented generation pipelines. Here, the index parameters were significantly increased to m = 64, ef-construction = 512, and ef-search = 512. This configuration raises compute requirements but dramatically improves recall.</p><p>With 50 concurrent searches and recall approaching 98%, ScyllaDB kept p99 latency below 12 milliseconds and p50 around 8 milliseconds while delivering 6,500 QPS. When shifting the focus to maximum sustained throughput while keeping p99 latency under 20 milliseconds and p50 under 10 milliseconds, the system achieved 16,600 QPS. Even under these settings, latency remained notably stable across values of k from 10 to 100, demonstrating predictable behaviour in environments where query limits vary dynamically.</p><p>The table below presents the summary of the results for some representative concurrency levels.</p><p>A big advantage of integrating Vector Search with ScyllaDB is that it delivers substantial performance and networking cost advantages. The vector store resides close to the data with just a single network hop between metadata and embedding storage in the same availability zone. This locality, combined with ScyllaDB’s shard-per-core execution model, allows the system to provide real-time latency and massive throughput even under heavy load. The result is that teams can accomplish more with fewer resources compared to specialised vector-search systems.</p><p>In addition to being fast at scale, ScyllaDB’s Vector Search is also simpler to operate. Its key advantage is its ability to unify structured and unstructured retrieval within a single dataset. This means you can store traditional attributes and vector embeddings side-by-side and express queries that combine semantic search with conventional search. For example, you can ask the database to “find the top five most similar documents, but only those belonging to this specific customer and created within the past 30 days.” This approach eliminates the common pain of maintaining separate systems for transactional data and vector search, and it removes the operational fragility associated with syncing between two sources of truth.</p><p>This also means there is no ETL drift and no dual-write risk. Instead of shipping embeddings to a separate vector database while keeping metadata in a transactional store, ScyllaDB consolidates everything into a single system. The only pipeline you need is the computational step that generates embeddings using your preferred LLM or ML model. Once written, the data remains consistent without extra coordination, backfills, or complex streaming jobs.</p><p>Operationally, ScyllaDB simplifies the entire retrieval stack. Because it is built on ScyllaDB’s proven distributed architecture, the system is highly available, horizontally scalable, and resilient across availability zones and regions. Instead of operating two or three different technologies – each with its own monitoring, security configurations, and failure modes – you only manage one. This consolidation drastically reduces operational complexity while simultaneously improving performance.</p><p>The product is now in Geeral Availability. This includes Cloud Portal provisioning, on-demand billing, a full range of instance types, and additional performance optimisations. Self-service scaling is planned for Q1. By the end of Q1 we will introduce native filtering capabilities, enabling vector search queries to combine ANN results with traditional predicates for more precise hybrid retrieval.</p><p>Looking further ahead, the roadmap includes support for scalar and binary quantisation to reduce memory usage, TTL functionality for lifecycle automation of vector data, and integrated hybrid search combining ANN with BM25 for unified lexical and semantic relevance.</p><p>ScyllaDB has demonstrated that it is capable of delivering industry-leading performance for vector search at massive scale, handling a dataset of 1 billion vectors with p99 latency as low as 1.7 milliseconds and throughput up to 252,000 QPS. These results validate ScyllaDB Vector Search as a unified, high-performance solution that simplifies the operational complexity of real-time AI applications by co-locating structured data and unstructured embeddings.</p><p>The current benchmarks showcase the current state of ScyllaDB’s scalability. With planned enhancements in the upcoming roadmap, including scalar quantization and sharding, these performance limits are set to increase in the next year. Nevertheless, even now, the feature is ready for running latency critical workloads such as fraud detection or recommendation systems.</p>",

      "content": "<h2>2.1 Deep Learning via continuous-time controlled dynamical system</h2><p>In 2017. Weinan E proposed new architectures of NN’s realized through the continuous-time controlled dynamical systems [10]. This proposal was motivated by the previous observations that NN’s (most notably, ResNets) can be regarded as Euler discretizations of controlled ODE’s. In parallel, a number of studies [11, 12, 13] enhanced and expanded theoretical foundations of ML by adapting classical control-theoretic techniques to the new promising field of applications.</p><p>\\\nThis line of research resulted in a tangible outcome which was named Neural ODE [14]. The underlying idea is to formalize some ML tasks as optimal control problems. In fact, deep limits of ResNets with constant weights yield continuous-time dynamical systems [15]. In such a setup weights of the NN are replaced by control functions. Training of the model is realized through minimization of the total error (or total loss) using the Pontryagin’s maximum principle. Backpropagation corresponds to the adjoint ODE which is solved backwards in time.</p><p>\\\nA similar way of encoding maps underlies the concept of continuous-time normalizing flows [16]. Normalizing flows are dynamical systems, usually described by ODE’s or PDE’s. These systems are trained with the goal of learning a sequence (or a flow) of invertible maps between the observed data originating from an unknown complicated target probability distribution and some simple (typically Gaussian) distribution. Once the normalizing flow is trained, the target distribution is approximated. The model is capable of generalizing the observed data and making predictions by sampling from the simple distribution and mapping the samples along the learned flow.</p><p>\\\nWe have mentioned two concepts (neural ODE and normalizing flows) that recently had a significant impact. Their success reflects the general trend of growing interest in control-theoretic point of view on ML. Most of theoretical advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) rely on Control Theory (CT) [12, 13]. As theoretical foundations of RL are being established, the boundary between RL and CT is getting blurred.</p><p>(1) Vladimir Jacimovic, Faculty of Natural Sciences and Mathematics, University of Montenegro Cetinjski put bb., 81000 Podgorica Montenegro (vladimirj@ucg.ac.me).</p><p>:::info\nThis paper is  under CC by 4.0 Deed (Attribution 4.0 International) license.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Well, here come two massive new studies—one from Australia, one from the UK—that land like a sledgehammer on Haidt’s narrative—and, perhaps more importantly, on Australia’s much-celebrated social media ban for kids under 16.</p><p>The Australian study, <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/article-abstract/2843720\">published in JAMA Pediatrics</a>, followed over 100,000 Australian adolescents across three years and found something that should give every policymaker pause: the relationship between social media use and well-being isn’t linear. It’s U-shaped. Perhaps most surprisingly, <strong>kids who use social media moderately have the  outcomes</strong>. Kids who use it excessively have worse outcomes. But here’s the kicker: <strong>kids who don’t use it at all  have worse outcomes</strong>.</p><p>This isn’t to say that all kids should use social media. Unlike some others, we’re not saying any of this shows that social media  good or bad health outcomes. We’re pointing out that the claims of inherent harm seem not just overblown, but wrong.</p><p>From the study’s key findings:</p><blockquote><p><em>A U-shaped association emerged where <strong>moderate social media use was associated with the best well-being outcomes</strong>, while both no use and highest use were associated with poorer well-being. For girls, moderate use became most favorable from middle adolescence onward, while for boys, <strong>no use became increasingly problematic from midadolescence</strong>, exceeding risks of high use by late adolescence.</em></p></blockquote><p>This seems like pretty strong evidence that Haidt’s claims of inherent harm are not well-founded, and the policy proposals to ban kids entirely from social media are a bad idea. For older teenage boys, having  social media was associated with  outcomes than having too much of it. The study found that nonusers in grades 10-12 had significantly higher odds of low well-being compared to moderate users—with boys showing an odds ratio of 3.00 and girls at 1.79.</p><p>Meanwhile, researchers at the University of Manchester just published a separate study <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/jpubhealth/advance-article/doi/10.1093/pubmed/fdaf150/8371934?login=false\">in the Journal of Public Health</a> that followed 25,000 11- to 14-year-olds over three school years. Their conclusion? <strong>Screen time spent on social media or gaming does not cause mental health problems in teenagers</strong>. At all.</p><blockquote><p><em>The study found no evidence for boys or girls that heavier social media use or more frequent gaming increased teenagers’ symptoms of anxiety or depression over the following year. Increases in girls’ and boys’ social media use from year 8 to year 9 and from year 9 to year 10 had zero detrimental impact on their mental health the following year.</em></p></blockquote><p>Zero. Not “small.” Not “modest.” Zero.</p><p>The UK researchers also examined whether  kids use social media matters—active chatting versus passive scrolling. The answer? Neither appeared to drive mental health difficulties. As lead author Dr. Qiqi Cheng put it:</p><blockquote><p><em>We know families are worried, but our results do not support the idea that simply spending time on social media or gaming leads to mental health problems – the story is far more complex than that.</em></p></blockquote><p>The Australian researchers, to their credit, are appropriately cautious about causation:</p><blockquote><p><em>While heavy use was associated with poorer well-being and abstinence sometimes coincided with less favorable outcomes, these findings are observational and should be interpreted cautiously.</em></p></blockquote><p>But while researchers urge caution, politicians have been happy to sprint ahead.</p><p>The entire premise of Australia’s ban—and similar proposals floating around in various US states and across Europe—is that social media is inherently harmful to young people, and that removing access is protective. But both studies suggest the reality is far more complicated. The Australian researchers explicitly call this out:</p><blockquote><p><em>Social media’s association with adolescent well-being is complex and nonlinear, suggesting that</em><em>abstinence and excessive use can be problematic depending on developmental stage and sex.</em></p></blockquote><p>In other words: Australia’s ban may be taking kids who would have been moderate users with good outcomes and forcing them into the “no use” category that the study associates with  well-being. It’s potentially the worst of all possible policy outcomes.</p><p>The UK study’s co-author, Prof. Neil Humphrey, reinforced this point:</p><blockquote><p><em>Our findings tell us that young people’s choices around social media and gaming may be shaped by how they’re feeling but not necessarily the other way around. Rather than blaming technology itself, we need to pay attention to what young people are doing online, who they’re connecting with and how supported they feel in their daily lives.</em></p></blockquote><p>That’s a crucial distinction that the moral panic crowd keeps glossing over: correlation running in the opposite direction than assumed. Kids who are already struggling, and who aren’t getting the support they need, might use social media differently—not the other way around.</p><p>This shouldn’t be surprising to anyone who has been paying attention. We’ve covered study after study showing that the relationship between social media and teen mental health is complicated, context-dependent, and nowhere near as clear-cut as Haidt’s “The Anxious Generation” would have you believe. As we’ve noted before, correlation is not causation, and the timing of teen mental health declines doesn’t actually line up neatly with smartphone adoption the way the narrative claims.</p><p>But nuance doesn’t make for good headlines or popular books. “Social Media Is Complicated And The Effects Depend On How You Use It, Your Age, Your Sex, And A Bunch Of Other Factors” doesn’t quite have the same ring as “Smartphones Destroyed A Generation.”</p><p>No one’s beating down my door to write a book detailing the trade-offs and nuances. Instead, Haidt’s book remains on the NY Times’ best seller list almost two years after being published.</p><p>The Australian study also highlights something else that should be obvious but apparently needs repeating: social media serves genuine social functions for teenagers. Being completely cut off from the platforms where your peers are socializing, sharing, and connecting has costs. The researchers note:</p><blockquote><p><em>Heavy use has been associated with distress, while abstinence may cause missed connections.</em></p></blockquote><p>This is what we’ve been saying forever. These platforms aren’t just “distraction machines” or “attention hijackers” or whatever scary framing is popular this week. They’re where social life happens for a lot of young people. Cutting kids off entirely doesn’t return them to some idyllic pre-digital social existence. It cuts them off from their actual social world.</p><p>Both sets of researchers make the same point: online experiences aren’t inherently harmless—hurtful messages, online pressures, and extreme content can have real effects. But blunt instruments like time-based restrictions or outright bans completely miss the target, and are unlikely to help those who need it most. The Australian authors recommend “promotion of balanced and purposeful digital engagement as part of a broader strategy.”</p><p>That’s… actually sensible policy advice? Based on actual evidence?</p><p>Maybe—just maybe—they should look at the actual research coming out of Australia and the UK instead.</p>",

The presentation feature builds on Adobe Spaces, a collaborative file and notes collection the company launched last year. Users can point Acrobat's AI assistant at files in a Space and have it generate an editable pitch deck, then style it using Adobe Express themes and stock imagery. \n\nShared files in Spaces now include AI-generated summaries that cite specific locations in the source document. Users can also choose from preset AI assistant personas -- \"analyst,\" \"entertainer,\" or \"instructor\" -- or create custom assistants using their own prompts.",

Those results align with our \"intent-based\" objective of only requiring users to express their intent and scaffolding Generative AI to deliver the final output, potentially reducing the communication costs between users and Generative AI systems. This task transition paradigms may motivate further exploration of intent-based interfaces, potentially extending to more complex tasks with interdependent components such as video generation.</p><p>\\\nFor example, we might envision an abstract-to-detailed task transition process for generating video advertisements that begins with sketches and thematic inputs, transitions to script writing, then proceeds to generate textual and visual descriptions of storyboards, followed by video generating end editing, and culminating in iterative video refinement. We aim to further investigate the potential of intent-based user interfaces in streamlining complex, interdependent workflows across various domains.</p><p>\\\nFuture work could focus on studies empirically validating the effectiveness of this task transition approach in more diverse and complex task environments.

      "content": "<p>GenAI isn’t stealing your data in one dramatic burst. It leaks fragments—copied into prompts, screenshots, exports, and fine-tuning datasets that move between endpoints, SaaS apps, and cloud storage. Legacy DLP sees some hops. DSPM sees some resting places. Neither sees the whole story.</p><p>The only way to reliably track and stop AI-driven data exfiltration is to follow the data's  journey—its lineage—across endpoints, SaaS, and the cloud, then apply protection in real time. That’s the mindset behind Cyberhaven’s unified DSPM + DLP platform. </p><h2>The New Data Breach Doesn’t Look Like a Breach</h2><p>When people imagine an “AI incident,” they picture something cinematic: a rogue agent wiring the entire customer database into a model in one shot.</p><p>That’s almost never how it happens.</p><p>In the environments we see, AI‑related data loss looks more like this:</p><ul><li>A product manager pastes a few rows of roadmap data into a model for help writing a launch brief.</li><li>A developer copies a code snippet with a proprietary algorithm into ChatGPT to debug a race condition.</li><li>A finance analyst exports a slice of a board deck into a CSV to feed an internal LLM.</li></ul><p>Each action in isolation seems harmless— But over weeks and months, those fragments accumulate across different tools, identities, and locations.</p><p>From an attacker’s point of view, you don’t need the  truth in one place. Enough fragments, stitched together, are often just as valuable as the original.</p><p>Most organizations are still protecting data with a mental model that assumes:</p><ul><li>Data lives in well‑defined systems (databases, file shares, document repositories).</li><li>“Exfiltration” is a discrete event (a big upload, a large export, a massive email).</li></ul><p>AI breaks both assumptions.</p><h3>1. Data is now fragmented by default</h3><p>We no longer share a file; we share  of it. That was already true with SaaS. AI multiplies it:</p><ul><li>A confidential slide becomes: two paragraphs in an email, three bullets in a Jira ticket, and a paragraph pasted into an AI prompt.</li><li>A source code file becomes: a function pasted into a chat, a generated patch in Git, and a screenshot in a Slack thread.</li></ul><p>By the time you notice something is wrong, the data has been chopped, transformed, translated, and blended into other content across dozens of systems. Our analysis of customer environments shows data moving continuously between the cloud and endpoints in ways that are impossible to understand if you only look at a single system or moment.</p><h3>2. Controls are still siloed by location</h3><p>The security stack mirrors this fragmentation:</p><ul><li> on endpoints and gateways focuses on data .</li><li> focuses on data  in SaaS and cloud.</li><li>New  tools focus solely on prompts and responses within specific models.</li></ul><p>Each one knows its domain well, but little about what happened  or  the event it observes. So you end up with:</p><ul><li>A DSPM alert that says: “This bucket contains sensitive data,” but not  or .</li><li>A DLP alert that says: “Someone pasted confidential text into a browser,” but not <em>where the text originated</em> or .</li><li>An AI usage report that says, “These apps are talking to LLMs,” but doesn't specify the <em>underlying data they’re exposing</em>.</li></ul><p>Individually, these are partial truths. Together, without context, they become noise.</p><p>Long before “data lineage” became a slide on every security vendor’s pitch deck, we built a company around it.</p><p>Cyberhaven’s founding team came out of EPFL and the DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge, where we built technology to track how data flowed through systems at the instruction level, not just the file level. That research evolved into a security platform that could reconstruct the entire  of a sensitive object—where it was born, how it changed, who touched it, and where it tried to leave the organization.</p><p>We sometimes joke internally that we were <strong>“the original data lineage company”</strong> — we were shipping lineage‑based detection and response years before it was fashionable marketing language.</p><p>At the time, this approach solved problems like:</p><ul><li>Finding insider threats hidden in millions of “normal” file operations.</li><li>Understanding complex IP leaks where content had been copied, compressed, encrypted, renamed, and moved across multiple systems.</li></ul><p>We thought lineage was powerful then.</p><p>In the AI era, it’s non‑negotiable. It is like trying to enable full self-driving without having driven round and round San Francisco, gathering the telemetry data.</p><h2>AI Made Lineage Mandatory, Not Optional</h2><p>AI has accelerated two trends that were already underway:</p><ol><li> It continuously moves between endpoints, SaaS, and the cloud.</li><li><strong>Security is moving from point products to platforms.</strong> Customers are tired of stitching together DSPM, DLP, insider risk, and a separate AI tool.</li></ol><p>If you care about AI‑driven data exfiltration, you can’t afford to look only at:</p><ul><li>Static storage (DSPM alone), or</li><li>Network egress (DLP alone), or</li><li>AI prompts (AI tooling alone).</li></ul><p>You need to understand how knowledge moves: how an idea in a design file becomes a bullet in a product document, a paragraph in a Slack thread, and a prompt to an external model.</p><p>That’s the whole reason we built Cyberhaven as a <strong>unified AI &amp; data security platform</strong> that combines DSPM and DLP on top of a single data lineage foundation. It lets security teams see both:</p><ul><li>Where data  (inventory, posture, misconfigurations), and</li><li>How data  (copy/paste, exports, uploads, AI prompts, emails, Git pushes, and more).</li></ul><p>Once you have that complete picture, AI exfiltration stops being mysterious. It looks like any other sequence of events, just faster and more repetitive.</p><h2>Principles for Actually Stopping AI-Driven Data Exfiltration</h2><p>If I were starting a greenfield security program today, with AI in scope from day zero, here are the principles I’d insist on.</p><h3>1. Unify data at rest and data in motion</h3><p>You can’t secure what you only see. You can’t secure what you only see part of. Data is sitting in the cloud and SaaS.</p><ul><li>DLP tells you  data is moving, especially at endpoints and egress points.</li></ul><p>Together, with lineage, you get the full story: <em>this model training dataset in object storage came from an export from this SaaS app, which originated in this internal HR system, and was enriched by this prompt flow to an external LLM.</em></p><p>That’s the level of context you need to decide whether to block, quarantine, or allow, especially when AI is involved.</p><h3>2. Treat identity, behavior, and content as a single signal</h3><p>Whenever I review a serious incident, there are three questions I want answered:</p><ol><li><em>What exactly was the data?</em> (Regulated data, IP, source code, M&amp;A docs?)</li><li><em>Who was the human or service account behind the action?</em> (Role, history, typical behavior.)</li><li><em>How did this sequence of events differ from “normal” for that identity and that data?</em></li></ol><p>Legacy tools usually answer only one of those in isolation:</p><ul><li>Content scanners know  but not .</li><li>Identity systems know  but not  they did with data.</li><li>UEBA systems know  but not .</li></ul><p>Lineage‑driven systems can correlate all three in real time, which is the only way to reliably find the handful of truly risky actions in the noise of millions of “normal” events.</p><h3>3. Assume policies won’t keep up</h3><p>Writing perfect AI policies is a losing game.</p><p>People will always find new tools, plugins, side channels, and workflows. If your protection depends on static rules that anticipate every vector, you’ll always be behind.</p><p>What works better in practice is:</p><ul><li>Broad, simple guardrails (“don’t move data with these characteristics to destinations in these classes”) combined with</li><li>An AI‑assisted detection layer that uses lineage and semantic understanding to surface suspicious patterns you didn’t explicitly write a rule for.</li></ul><p>We’re already seeing this with autonomous analysts that investigate lineage graphs and user behavior to propose or enforce controls without requiring a human to anticipate every scenario.</p><h3>4. Close the loop from insight to action</h3><p>Seeing the problem isn’t enough. Seeing the problem isn’t enough. One of the biggest complaints we hear about stand-alone DSPM tools is that they generate lots of “insight” but no direct enforcement; teams are left opening tickets and chasing owners by hand. Prioritize where to scan and investigate based on live DLP telemetry (follow where sensitive data ).</p><ul><li>Offer one‑click remediation paths: revoke access, tighten sharing, quarantine misconfigured stores, or block risky exfiltration attempts in real time.</li><li>Feed every enforcement decision back into the lineage and detection models so the system gets smarter over time.</li></ul><p>Without that tight loop, AI-driven leakage becomes another line item on an overcrowded risk register.</p><h2>Why This Matters Now, Not “Someday”</h2><p>There’s a reason AI has suddenly made data security a board‑level topic again.</p><ul><li>Employees are using AI tools faster than governance can keep up.</li><li>New regulations and customer expectations are raising the stakes for data misuse.</li><li>Attackers are experimenting with AI‑assisted reconnaissance and exfiltration.</li></ul><p>At the same time, security teams are consolidating tools. They don’t want separate products for DLP, DSPM, insider risk, and AI security. They want one platform that can see and control data everywhere—at rest, in motion, and in use—with lineage as the connective tissue.</p><p>That’s the platform we’ve been building at Cyberhaven, starting with our early work on data lineage and evolving into a unified AI &amp; data security platform that combines DLP, DSPM, insider risk, and AI security in a single system.</p><h2>Want to See What This Looks Like in the Real World?</h2><p>On <strong>February 3 at 11:00 AM PT</strong>, we’re hosting a live session where we’ll:</p><ul><li>Show the first public demo of our unified AI &amp; data security platform and how it tracks data fragments across endpoints, SaaS, cloud, and AI tools in real time.</li><li>Walk through how security teams get “X‑ray vision” into data usage, so they can isolate the risky handful of actions hidden in millions of normal events — and stop them before they turn into incidents.</li><li>Share candid stories from security leaders on where legacy DLP and stand‑alone DSPM have failed them in the AI era, and how a lineage‑first approach changes the game.</li><li>Talk about where we think , insider risk, AI security, and DSPM are headed next — and why we believe the future belongs to platforms that were built on data lineage from day one, not retrofitted after the fact.</li></ul><p>If you’re wrestling with AI adoption, shadow AI tools, or just a growing sense that your current stack is seeing only the surface of what’s happening to your data, I’d love for you to join us and ask hard questions.</p><p>AI is already exfiltrating your data in fragments. The real question is whether you can see the story those fragments are telling, and whether you can act in time to change the ending.</p>",

      "content": "The price of water and sewer services for American households has more than doubled since the early 1980s after adjusting for inflation, even though per-capita water use has actually decreased over that period. Households in large cities now spend about $1,300 a year on water and sewer charges, approaching the roughly $1,600 they spend on electricity. The main driver is federal regulation. \n\nSince the Clean Water Act of 1972 and the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974, the U.S. has spent approximately $5 trillion in contemporary dollars fighting water pollution -- about 0.8% of annual GDP across that period. The EPA itself admits that surface water regulations are the one category of environmental rules where estimated costs exceed estimated benefits. \n\nNew York City was required to build a filtration plant to address two minor parasites in water from its Croton aqueduct. The project took a decade longer than expected and cost $3.2 billion, more than double the original estimate. After the plant opened in 2015, the city's Commissioner of Environmental Protection noted that the water would basically be \"the same\" to the public. Jefferson County, Alabama, meanwhile, descended into what was then the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history in 2011 after EPA-mandated sewer upgrades pushed its debt from $300 million to over $3 billion.",

As outlined in the introduction, the frontend generation task progresses through three stages: sketching, writing, and coding Our system utilizes the Claude 3.5 Sonnet language model (Sonnet)1 for all text and code generation.</p><p>\\\nWhile Claude represents one of the most advanced language models as of July 2024, we anticipate rapid developments in Generative AI. Therefore, the task transition techniques described herein are designed to be model-agnostic, ensuring their applicability to future, more advanced Generative AI models.</p><h3><strong>2.1 Sketching: Visual Layout Design and Theme Input</strong></h3><p>The system’s initial phase comprises a graphical user interface with two key components: a canvas panel for visual representation of the envisioned website layout, and a prompt panel for textual descriptions of the website theme. Upon completion of the user’s sketch and theme input, the user can activate the code generation process via \"Generate\" button.</p><p>\\\nThe system then converts the sketch into SVG format, followed by a subsequent transformation into JPG format. This two-step conversion process was implemented based on empirical evidence from our tests, showing that language models exhibit better performance when processing images in JPG format compared to images in SVG format.</p><h3><strong>2.2 Writing: Product Requirements Document Generation</strong></h3><p>This phase transforms the user’s visual and textual inputs into a structured document, referred to as the Product Requirements Document (PRD), which serves as a blueprint for the website’s development process. The PRD generation process leverages Sonnet. To enhance the visual appearance of the generated websites, the system integrates the Pexels API2 for image retrieval.</p><p>\\\nThe language model is specifically prompted to include image terms and size descriptions (e.g., [school(large)]). These descriptors are subsequently utilized to query the Pexels API, which returns relevant image URLs for incorporation into the PRD.</p><h3><strong>2.3 Coding: Website Generation and Iterative Refinement</strong></h3><p>The coding phase of the system consists of two primary components: (1) Initial code generation: the system utilizes the generated PRD and the original user prompt as inputs for code generation, employing Sonnet to produce the initial website code; (2) Iterative refinement: the system implements an iterative refinement process to automatically enhance the generated website with richer functionality and reduced flaws.</p><p>\\\nThis process involves analyzing the initial code to generate optimization suggestions, merging these suggestions with the original theme, and utilizing the enhanced theme along with the previously generated PRD to regenerate the code. The system executes this iterative refinement process multiple times (by default, n=4). Users can navigate between iterations by selecting preview thumbnails displayed at the interface’s bottom, and can access or copy the generated code for each version.</p>",

Does this seem like some plausible deniability is in play here? Well, disabuse yourself of those notions. This is how it went down.</p><blockquote><p><em>The arrest happened around 8:30 p.m. near a Lutheran church and Willmar Middle School as agents followed the workers after they closed up for the night. A handful of bystanders blew whistles and shouted at agents as they detained the people. “Would your mama be proud of you right now?” one of the bystanders asked.</em></p></blockquote><p>Nice.

I am, however, saying that they definitely  because everyone is going to think the officers are there for  but the food. And I do believe any minority business owner should be able to refuse service to ICE officers who wander in under the pretense of buying a meal. The end result is going to be the same whether or not you decide to engage with this pretense. You’re getting raided either way. May as well deny them the meal.</p><blockquote><p><em>El Tapatio Mexican Restaurant closed after WCCO confirmed agents visited the spot for lunch and later returned, detaining its owners and a dishwasher nearby after they had closed early due to the federal law enforcement’s previous appearance.</em></p></blockquote><p>And here’s the DHS statement, which pretends ICE officers didn’t eat a meal at a restaurant and then return a few hours later to detain employees when they left the building: </p><blockquote><p><em>“On January 14, ICE officers conducted surveillance of a target, an illegal alien from Mexico. Officers observed that the target’s vehicle was outside of a local business and positively identified him as the target while inside the business. Following the positive identification of the target, officers then conducted a vehicle stop later in the day and apprehended the target and two additional illegal aliens who were in the car, including one who had a final order of removal from an immigration judge.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Nope. I don’t care what the ICE apologists will say about this. These narratives have places where they overlap but it’s impossible to believe this went down exactly like the government said it did. These officers picked out an ethnic restaurant, were served by an intimidated staff, and then hung around to catch any stragglers leaving the business that previously had graciously served them, despite the threat they posed.</p><p>Abolish ICE. It’s no longer just a catchy phrase to shout during protests. It’s an imperative. If we don’t stop it now, it will only become even worse and even more difficult to remove. Treat ICE like the tumor it is. Pretending its MRSA gives it more power than it should ever be allowed to have. </p>",

      "content": "<p>The emergence of Generative AI is catalyzing a paradigm shift in user interfaces from command-based to intent-based outcome specification. In this paper, we explore abstract-to-detailed task transitions in the context of frontend code generation as a step towards intent-based user interfaces, aiming to bridge the gap between abstract user intentions and concrete implementations. We introduce Frontend Diffusion, an end-to-end LLM-powered tool that generates high-quality websites from user sketches.</p><p>\\\nThe system employs a three-stage task transition process: sketching, writing, and coding. We demonstrate the potential of task transitions to reduce human intervention and communication costs in complex tasks. Our work also opens avenues for exploring similar approaches in other domains, potentially extending to more complex, interdependent tasks such as video production.</p><p>The development of Generative AI, particularly the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in interpreting and executing natural language, may be viewed as heralding the first new user interface paradigm shift in 60 years [8]. This shift moves from command-based interactions, typified by command line interfaces and graphical user interfaces, to intent-based outcome specification [8]. This emerging intent-based paradigm potentially enables users to communicate their intentions to machines without necessarily translating them into machine-comprehensible commands, whether through programming languages or graphical buttons.</p><p>\\\nThis shift may foster interfaces that support more abstract human expressions, especially for command-intensive tasks such as coding [2, 3]. Currently, the interfaces for command-intensive tasks continue to necessitate substantial human intervention, where individuals typically specify incremental steps while AI generates corresponding code, akin to agile programming [11]. However, ongoing advancements in Generative AI capabilities suggest the potential for developing a framework that may bridge the gap between intentlevel expression and command-level implementation, potentially enhancing output quality while reducing the need for extensive human intervention.</p><p>\\\nPrevious research has demonstrated that Generative AI, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), can complete fixed-scope content curation tasks based on human intent without further intervention or intent iteration. For example, LLMs have shown promise in text summarization tasks [6]. However, Generative AI require greater human intervention for tasks involving increasing amounts of information [4, 7]. It motivates us to develop more effective scaffolding paradigm for Generative AI to respond to human intent and complete tasks in an agent-like manner.</p><p>\\\nRecent research has indicated the feasibility of bridging intent expression in abstract tasks to concrete implementation at a more granular level. Examples include the transition from sketching to writing [1] and from design to data analysis [5]. Building upon these findings, we propose exploring more extensive intent-tocommand transitions, such as progressing from sketching to writing (planning) and ultimately to coding (see Figure 2). Our choice of website frontend generation as a user interface coding task [10] is motivated by its similarity to sketching. In both cases, the code or sketch serves as a representation of visual elements [9].</p>",

      "content": "<p>We propose the idea of using Kuramoto models (including their higher-dimensional generalizations) for machine learning over non-Euclidean data sets. These models are systems of matrix ODE’s describing collective motions (swarming dynamics) of abstract particles (generalized oscillators) on spheres, homogeneous spaces and Lie groups. Such models have been extensively studied from the beginning of XXI century both in statistical physics and control theory. They provide a suitable framework for encoding maps between various manifolds and are capable of learning over spherical and hyperbolic geometries. In addition, they can learn coupled actions of transformation groups (such as special orthogonal, unitary and Lorentz groups). Furthermore, we overview families of probability distributions that provide appropriate statistical models for probabilistic modeling and inference in Geometric Deep Learning. We argue in favor of using statistical models which arise in different Kuramoto models in the continuum limit of particles. The most convenient families of probability distributions are those which are invariant with respect to actions of certain symmetry groups.</p><p>Machine Learning (ML) is, to a great extent, a science of inferring models and patterns from data. From that point of view, its core objective consists in learning optimal (according to a certain criterion) mappings between spaces. For several decades these mappings have been dominantly encoded using artificial neural networks with different topologies [1]. The spaces have almost always been assumed Euclidean or equipped with some flat metric. The data have been represented by points in Euclidean spaces or in finite sets.</p><p>\\\nAn enormous progress in ML and Data Science in XXI century led to the growing understanding that a great deal (possibly, majority) of data sets have inherent non-Euclidean geometries. This fact has been mostly neglected in ML until very recently. Only the last decade brought systematic research efforts focused on geometric-sensitive architectures of neural networks (NN’s).</p><p>\\\nIn parallel, traditional ways of designing artificial NN’s are being reexamined and enriched by new ideas. Diversity of applications and conceptual complexity of ML problems motivated investigations of new architectures. Over the centuries mathematicians elaborated various ways of encoding maps between Euclidean spaces or Riemannian manifolds. The corresponding theories have been established before the advent of ML, and now provide a solid theoretical background for its future developments. Following an explosive expansion of ML applications and practices, there is a huge backlog of theoretical work to be done. Mathematical foundations of ML are being actively reconsidered and expanded. Certain fields of mathematics that have been almost invisible in ML until very recently are now actively exploited with a great potential for future applications. The examples include Riemannian Geometry, Game Theory and Lie Group Theory - to name just a few.</p><p>\\\nSystematic approaches in ML must be based on well established theories and well understood models. The choice of adequate models and appropriate data representations appears to be the key issue. An appropriate choice greatly reduces the dimension (number of parameters), increases the efficiency of algorithms and, equally important, improves their transparency.</p><p>\\\nThe main goal of the present paper is to point out a broad class of models which constitute a powerful theoretical framework for encoding geometric data. These models describing collective motions of interacting particles have been studied in Science for almost half of a century from various points of view. In physics of complex systems they are known as Kuramoto models [2] (including generalizations to higher-dimensional manifolds [3, 4]) and Viscek models [5]. In systems theory they are said to be (anti-)consensus algorithms on manifolds [6, 7]. Finally, in Engineering they are sometimes referred to as swarms on manifolds [8, 9]. All these models fit into the unifying mathematical framework that we refer to as systems of geometric Riccati ODE’s, as will be explained in sections 3 and 4.</p><p>\\\nOur exposition will be focused on the following questions:</p><ol><li><p>Which kinds of mappings can be encoded by collective motions of Kuramoto oscillators/swarms on manifolds?</p></li><li><p>Which symmetries/patterns can be learned using these dynamics?</p></li><li><p>Which statistical models are associated with these dynamics and how can they be used in statistical ML over manifolds?</p></li><li><p>Which problems can be efficiently solved using such models?</p></li><li><p>How these models can be trained?</p></li></ol><p>\\\nOur proposal on using swarms/Kuramoto oscillators in ML is inspired by some recent developments in theoretical ML which will be mentioned in Section 2. Section 3 is devoted to classical Kuramoto models (i.e. models describing collective motions of the classical phase oscillators) and their potential applications to learning coupled actions of transformation groups, as well as data on circles, tori and hyperbolic multi-discs. Section 4 contains an overview of (generalized) Kuramoto models that describe collective motions on spheres, Lie groups and other manifolds. In Section 5 we present families of probability measures over Riemannian manifolds which provide appropriate statistical models for probabilistic ML algorithms over non-Euclidean data sets. Some of these families are generated by the corresponding swarming dynamics. Connections with directional statistics will be particularly emphasized. In Section 6 we clarify how swarms can be used for supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning over Riemannian manifolds. In Section 7 we analyze some illustrative geometric ML problems in low dimensions, thus supporting our main points. Finally, Section 8 contains some concluding remarks and an outlook for the future research efforts.</p><p>:::info\nThis paper is  under CC by 4.0 Deed (Attribution 4.0 International) license.</p><p>(1) Vladimir Jacimovic, Faculty of Natural Sciences and Mathematics, University of Montenegro Cetinjski put bb., 81000 Podgorica Montenegro (vladimirj@ucg.ac.me).</p>",

      "content": "<p>Just a year and a half ago, Senator Rand Paul sponsored a bill that would <a href=\"https://www.paul.senate.gov/dr-rand-paul-rep-hageman-and-rep-bishop-fight-to-protect-americans-first-amendment-rights-again/\">make it illegal for federal government employees</a> to ask internet companies to remove any speech. Now, in <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2026/01/19/opinion/rand-paul-ive-changed-my-mind-google-and-youtube-cant-be-trusted-to-do-the-right-thing-and-must-be-reined-in/\">a NY Post op-ed</a>, Paul proudly announces that he did exactly that—formally contacting Google executives to demand they remove a video he didn’t like.</p><p>The video apparently (falsely) claims Paul took money from Nicolas Maduro, the former Venezuelan President the US recently kidnapped. And Paul is furious that YouTube wouldn’t take it down for him.</p><blockquote><p><em>But the straw that broke the camel’s back came this week when I notified Google executives that they were hosting a video of a woman posing as a newscaster posing in a fake news studio explaining that “Rand Paul is taking money from the Maduro regime.”</em></p><p><em>I’ve formally notified Google that this video is unsupported by facts, defames me, harasses me and now endangers my life.</em></p><p><em>Google responded that they don’t investigate the truth of accusations . . . and refused to take down the video.</em></p></blockquote><p>Let’s pause here. Senator Paul—a sitting U.S. Senator—”formally notified” Google executives that they needed to remove content. Under  proposed legislation, that would be illegal. His bill was explicitly designed to prevent government officials from pressuring platforms about speech. And yet here he is, doing exactly that.</p><p>This is also notably closer to actual government jawboning than most of what the Biden administration was accused of in the <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/tag/murthy-v-missouri/\"></a> case—where the Supreme Court found no First Amendment violation because platforms felt free to say no. Paul, a Senator with legislative power over these companies, is “formally notifying” them of what he wants removed, and is now saying that Google’s refusal to do so means they should lose Section 230 protection. Remember, the “smoking gun” in the Murthy case was supposedly Biden officials (and Biden himself) threatening to remove Section 230 if the tech platforms didn’t remove content they didn’t like.</p><p>Rand Paul was furious about that and his bill was supposedly in direct response to the Murthy ruling, in which he wanted to make it clear that (1) no government official should ever demand content be taken down and (2) threatening to pass legislation to punish companies for their refusal to moderate content would also violate the law.</p><p>And here he’s doing both.</p><p>But it gets worse. Buried in the third-to-last paragraph of Paul’s op-ed is this remarkable admission:</p><blockquote><p><em>Though Google refused to remove the defamatory content, the individual who posted the video finally took down the video under threat of legal penalty.</em></p></blockquote><p>Wait. So the system <em>worked exactly as designed</em>? Paul threatened legal action against the person who actually created the content, and they took it down? That’s… that’s the whole point of Section 230. Liability attaches to the speaker, not the host. The creator is responsible. And when threatened with actual legal consequences, they removed the video.</p><p>So what, exactly, is Paul complaining about?!? He got the outcome he wanted through the mechanism that Section 230 preserved for him: the ability to bring legal action against the speaker. But instead of acknowledging that the law worked, he’s using this as his justification for destroying it.</p><p>Paul is a public figure. He has access to pretty much all the media he wants. If he wanted to use the famous “marketplace of ideas” he so frequently invokes to debunk a nonsense lie about him and Maduro, he was free to do that. If the video was actually defamatory, he could sue the creator—which he apparently threatened to do, and it worked! Instead, he wants to tear down the entire legal framework because YouTube wouldn’t do his bidding, even though the video was already taken down.</p><p><strong>The Arbiter of Truth Hypocrisy</strong></p><p>Here’s where Paul’s position becomes truly incoherent.</p><blockquote><p><em>I asked one of Google’s executives what happens to the small town mayor whose enemies maliciously and without evidence, post that he is a pedophile on YouTube?. Would that be OK?</em></p><p><em>The executive responded that YouTube does not monitor their content for truth. But how would that small town mayor ever get his or her reputation back?</em></p></blockquote><p>Just a few years ago, Rand Paul was apoplectic that YouTube tried to determine whether content—specifically about COVID-19—was true or not. He thought it was terrible that YouTube would dare to be the arbiter of truth, and he <a href=\"https://fee.org/articles/interview-rand-paul-slams-big-tech-s-crackdown-on-covid-misinformation-and-offers-his-solution/\">whined about it at length</a>.</p><p>Now he’s demanding they be the arbiter of truth and remove one video because  says it’s false.</p><p>Paul even acknowledges this contradiction in his own op-ed, apparently without realizing it:</p><blockquote><p><em>Interestingly, Google says it doesn’t assess the truth of the content it hosts, but throughout the pandemic they removed content that they perceived as untrue, such as skepticism toward vaccines, allegations that the pandemic originated in a Wuhan lab, and my assertion that cloth masks don’t prevent transmission.</em></p></blockquote><p>Yes. And you screamed bloody murder about it. You insisted they should  do that. You built your entire position around the idea that platforms shouldn’t be deciding what’s true. And, with the re-election of Donald Trump, the big tech platforms all bent the knee and said they’d stop being arbiters of truth (even as it was legal for them to do so).</p><p>And so they stopped. And now you’re furious that they won’t make an exception for you.</p><p>Doesn’t that seem just a bit fucking hypocritical and entitled?</p><p><strong>The “It’s Their Property” Problem</strong></p><p>Paul’s real complaint—buried under all the high-minded rhetoric about defamation—is that Google makes its own decisions:</p><blockquote><p><em>So, Google and YouTube not only choose to moderate speech they don’t like, but they also will remove speeches from the Senate floor despite such speeches being specifically protected by the Constitution.</em></p><p><em>Google’s defense of speech appears to be limited to defense of speech they agree with.</em></p></blockquote><p>Yeah, dude. That’s how private property works. They get to decide what they host and what they don’t. That’s how it works. It’s also protected by  First Amendment rights. Compelled hosting or not hosting of speech you agree or disagree with is not a remedy available to you, Senator.</p><blockquote><p><em>Part of the liability protection granted internet platforms, section 230(c)(2), specifically allows companies the take down “harassing” content. This gives the companies wide leeway to take down defamatory content. Thus far, the companies have chosen to spend considerable time and money to take down content they politically disagree with yet leave content that is quite obviously defamatory. So Google does not have a blanket policy of refraining to evaluate truth. Google chooses to evaluate what it believes to be true when it is convenient and consistent with its own particular biases.</em></p></blockquote><p>He says this as if it’s controversial. It’s not. It’s exactly how editorial discretion works. The company gets to make their own editorial decisions. You don’t have to like those decisions. But demanding they make different ones, and threatening to strip their legal protections if they don’t, is a government official using state power to coerce speech decisions.</p><p>You know, the thing Paul claimed to be against.</p><blockquote><p><em>I think Google is, or should be, liable for hosting this defamatory video that accuses me of treason, at least from the point in time when Google was made aware of the defamation and danger.</em></p></blockquote><p>Again: <em>you already threatened the creator, and they took it down</em>. The remedy worked. You used it successfully.</p><p>And if Paul’s standard is “Google becomes liable once made aware,” then anyone who wants content removed will just  it’s defamatory and dangerous. How is this different from the COVID videos Paul was so mad they removed? People told Google those were false and dangerous, Google removed them, and Paul was furious that they acted after being “made aware” of allegedly false and dangerous content.</p><p>Now Google is doing exactly what Paul demanded—not removing content based on mere claims of falsity or danger—and he’s  mad at them.</p><p>So what’s Paul’s solution? Threaten to remove Section 230:</p><blockquote><p><em>It is particularly galling that, even when informed of the death threats stemming from the unsubstantiated and defamatory allegations, Google refused to evaluate the truth of what it was hosting despite its widespread practice of evaluating and removing other content for perceived lack of truthfulness.</em></p></blockquote><p>Remember when MAGA world insisted that Biden administration officials threatening platforms’ Section 230 protections was unconstitutional coercion? Remember how that was supposedly the worst violation of the First Amendment imaginable?</p><p>Rand Paul is now doing the same thing. A sitting Senator, using his platform and his legislative power, threatening to strip legal protections from a company because they won’t remove content he personally dislikes.</p><p>Paul literally told these platforms it wasn’t their job to determine truth or falsity. He literally sponsored a bill to prevent government officials from pressuring platforms about content. And now he’s doing exactly what he said was wrong—and threatening consequences if they don’t comply.</p><p>He didn’t “change his mind” on Section 230. He just revealed that he never had a principled position in the first place.</p><p>Paul supported Section 230 when he thought it meant platforms would leave up content he liked. He sponsored anti-jawboning legislation when he thought it would stop people he disagreed with from pressuring platforms. But the moment the system produces an outcome he doesn’t like—even though it <em>worked exactly as designed</em> and the video came down anyway—he’s ready to burn the whole thing down.</p><p>What is it with Senators and their thin skins? A few months ago we wrote about Senator Amy Klobuchar pressing for an <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/08/21/amy-klobuchar-wants-to-break-the-internet-because-someone-made-a-stupid-satirical-video-about-her/\">obviously unconstitutional law against deepfakes</a> after someone made an obviously fake satirical video about her. Now Paul joins the club: Senators who want to remake internet law because someone was mean to them online.</p><p>The video’s already down, Senator. You won. Maybe take the win instead of trying to burn down the open internet because Google wouldn’t do you a personal favor (the same favor you wanted to make illegal).</p>",

From a report: The Communications (Interception and Lawful Access) Bill is being framed as a replacement for the current legislation that governs digital communication interception. The Department of Justice, Home Affairs, and Migration said in an announcement this week the existing Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993 \"predates the telecoms revolution of the last 20 years.\" \n\nAs well as updating laws passed more than two decades ago, the government was keen to emphasize that a key ambition for the bill is to empower law enforcement to intercept of all forms of communications. The Bill will bring communications from IoT devices, email services, and electronic messaging platforms into scope, \"whether encrypted or not.\" \n\nIn a similar way to how certain other governments want to compel encrypted messaging services to unscramble packets of interest, Ireland's announcement also failed to explain exactly how it plans to do this. However, it promised to implement a robust legal framework, alongside all necessary privacy and security safeguards, if these proposals do ultimately become law. It also vowed to establish structures to ensure \"the maximum possible degree of technical cooperation between state agencies and communication service providers.\"/i",

Comments lie; code doesn't.\"</em></p><p>\\\nFor decades, this was our excuse to treat documentation like the dirty dishes of software development—a chore to be ignored until absolutely necessary. We optimized for human readability, assuming another engineer could just tap us on the shoulder or reverse-engineer our spaghetti logic if they got stuck.</p><p>\\\nWe are rapidly moving from a world of \"Copilots\" (which help you write internal code) to a world of \"Agents\" (autonomous systems that string together external APIs to achieve a goal).</p><p>\\\nHere is the uncomfortable truth about this new paradigm: AI agents don't care about the elegance of your private methods. They don't care about your clever recursion. They care about your public interfaces.</p><p>\\\nIn an agentic world, your documentation—specifically your structured API contracts—has replaced your implementation as the  source code that runs the system.</p><h2>Humans Can Fudge It. Machines Can't.</h2><p>The fundamental difference between a human developer and an AI agent using your internal platform is how they handle ambiguity.</p><p>\\\nWhen a human reads half-baked documentation for an internal microservice, they use intuition. They look at existing examples; they check Slack history; they make an educated guess.</p><p>\\\nWhen an LLM-powered agent encounters ambiguity, it hallucinates.</p><p>\\\nIf your API docs say a parameter is  but doesn’t specify the format (UUID vs. email vs. username), the agent has to guess. If you don't explicitly document error codes, the agent won't know the difference between a temporary network blip and a permanent validation failure.</p><p>\\\nAmbiguity is kryptonite for an autonomous system. If you want agents to successfully perform tasks without constant human babysitting, your documentation needs to shift from \"suggestive prose for humans\" to \"rigid instructions for machines.\"</p><h2>\"Clean Code\" Now Means \"Clean Contracts\"</h2><p>We spend countless hours debating Clean Code principles within a function boundary. We obsess over naming variables and extracting methods.</p><p>\\\nYet, we happily generate a half-assed OpenAPI (Swagger) spec from code annotations and call it a day.</p><p>\\\nIn the new stack, that OpenAPI spec is the most important file in your repository. It is the \"header file\" for the rest of the AI ecosystem.</p><p>\\\nA \"Clean Contract\" means:</p><ol><li> If a field is marked  in the spec, your code better not treat it as optional. Agents trust the spec implicitly.</li><li> Don't just use . Use formats like , , or regex patterns.</li><li><strong>Descriptive Operation IDs:</strong> Agents use these to understand intent.  is bad. <code>retrieveUserProfileSummaryById</code> is good.</li></ol><p>Let’s look at the difference.</p><p>\\\n<strong>The Old Way (Human-Centric Docs):</strong> A comment above a controller method that hopes the reader understands the context.</p><pre><code>// GET /api/users/{id}\n// Returns the user object. Make sure ID is right.\n// Throws 404 if not found.\npublic ResponseEntity&lt;User&gt; getUser(@PathVariable String id) { ... }\n</code></pre><p>\\\n<strong>The New Way (Agent-Centric Docs):</strong> A rigid OpenAPI definition. This YAML file  the code the agent executes against.</p><pre><code>paths:\n  /api/users/{userId}:\n    get:\n      operationId: retrieveUserProfileById\n      summary: Fetches a single user's public profile.\n      description: &gt;\n        Use this tool to retrieve details like name and active status\n        for a specific user ID. Do NOT use this for finding user emails.\n      parameters:\n        - in: path\n          name: userId\n          required: true\n          schema:\n            type: string\n            format: uuid\n          description: The immutable UUID of the user.\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          description: Successful retrieval\n          content:\n            application/json:\n              schema:\n                $ref: '#/components/schemas/UserProfile'\n        '404':\n          description: User ID does not exist in the active database.\n</code></pre><p>The YAML above provides constraints, intent, and negative prompting (\"Do NOT use this for…\"). That is executable documentation.</p><p>The most exciting (and frustrating) part of this shift is the new feedback loop.</p><p>\\\nPreviously, you knew your docs sucked when a new hire took three weeks to onboard. The feedback loop was slow and painful.</p><p>\\\nNow, the feedback loop is instant. You point an agent at a task involving your APIs, and it fails immediately.</p><p>\\\nYour logs will fill up with AI failures:</p><ul><li><em>\"Tool execution failed: Agent attempted to send 'banana' to parameter 'userId' which requires format 'uuid'.\"</em></li><li><em>\"Agent loop stuck: API returned 400 Bad Request without a descriptive error message, agent retried same operation 5 times.\"</em></li></ul><p>\\\nYour new QA team is composed of robots, and they are merciless perfectionists regarding your interface definitions. If an agent can't understand how to use your service, your service is effectively broken.</p><h2>The Diagram: The Agentic Workflow</h2><p>Here is how the flow of information changes. The docs are no longer a sidecar; they are the primary bridge.</p><pre><code>graph TD\n    subgraph \"The Old Way (Human Centric)\"\n    H[Human Dev] --&gt;|Reads vague docs| D(Wiki/Readme)\n    H --&gt;|Guesses implementation| C(Code Editor)\n    C --&gt;|Calls API| API[Internal API]\n    end\n\n    subgraph \"The Agentic Way (Machine Centric)\"\n    A[AI Agent] --&gt;|Reads structured spec| S(OpenAPI/AsyncAPI Spec)\n    S --\"Spec is the Source of Truth\"--&gt; A\n    A --&gt;|Formulates precise tool call| API2[Internal API]\n    API2 --\"Structured Error/Success\"--&gt; A\n    end\n\n    style S fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px\n</code></pre><p>If you believe the future of software involves autonomous agents seamlessly connecting services to perform complex work, you have to accept a boring truth: you need to get really good at writing specs.</p><p>\\\nStop treating documentation as an afterthought.

The decision to restart reactor number 6 at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa north-west of Tokyo was taken despite local residents' safety concerns. It was delayed by a day because of an alarm malfunction and is due to begin operating commercially next month. \n\nJapan, which had always heavily relied on energy imports, was an early adopter of nuclear power. But in 2011 all 54 of its reactors had to be shut after a massive earthquake and tsunami triggered a meltdown at Fukushima, causing one of the worst nuclear disasters in history. This is the latest installment in Japan's nuclear power reboot, which still has a long way to go. The seventh reactor at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa is not expected to be brought back on until 2030, and the other five could be decommissioned. That leaves the plant with far less capacity than it once had when all seven reactors were operational: 8.2 gigawatts.",

      "content": "<p>Writing just because you love doing so is a great feeling. However, every writer eventually arrives at the same crossroad: they want to write about content they’re passionate about, but they also want to get as many views as possible. These things aren’t contradictory; there is a way you can do both. Here’s how.</p><h2>Focus on Structuring Your Article</h2><p>Instead of writing whatever comes to mind, start thinking about the structure of your article: your intro, the body, and the conclusion. Are you using subsections to make the content easily digestible? Are you arranging them in an order that makes sense to the reader?</p><p>These are questions that you should ask yourself if you want to elevate your article from decent to excellent. And if this doesn’t come naturally, don’t worry. Here’s a quick trick you can do: just write like you normally would.</p><p>\\\nWrite the article first, and then go back and give it some structure. Already having all your content in front of you allows you to easily mold your intro, body, and conclusion into cohesive sections. But if you continue having problems with structuring your article well, there are some resources that can help you out.</p><h2>HackerNoon Writing Templates</h2><p>HackerNoon has an endless list of templates that writers can use to structure, fill, and improve their articles. It doesn’t matter what your niche is; HackerNoon has a template that will be a perfect fit for you.</p><p><strong>Some of these templates include:</strong></p><p>Even if you’re a structuring expert, these templates can be useful for saving time or when you want to try out a new style.</p><p>But when it comes to writing great articles, there is one very important thing you can’t forget.</p><h2>The Importance of Your Headline</h2><p>Your headline will be the first thing that people will read. It doesn’t matter how well-written your article’s body or conclusion paragraph is if they never make it that far. So, let’s give you some quick tips on how to nail it.</p><p>\\\nWhen it comes to your headline, you want it to be eye-catching but not clickbait; there’s a very fine line between. If you’re writing an article about a tech conference you attended, you can title it something like: “All the Cool Tech Showcased in TechCon 2025” or “5 Best Pieces of Tech Unveiled at TechCon 2025.” This tells readers what the article is about and gets them excited about the technology you will talk about. Is it a bit sensationalized? Yes. But it doesn’t cross the line.</p><p>\\\nA bad example of a headline is this: “You Will Never Believe What I Saw at TechCon 2025!” or “This Is the Craziest Thing I’ve Ever Seen!” Unless you saw a raccoon using a VR headset or something along those lines, it’s most likely that these titles are clickbait. Titles like that may work once in a blue moon, but you are more likely to strike out, so try to avoid using them.</p><p>\\\nOkay, you’ve learned the importance of headlines, structure, and how HackerNoon templates can help you. So, that’s it, right? You’ve mastered how to be a pro writer. Well, not exactly. There is still so much to learn. But luckily for you, there is a resource that you can use to become the master that you were meant to be.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://courses.hackernoon.com/\">HackerNoon Blogging Fellowship Course</a> is an online course specifically designed to help transform aspiring bloggers into full-fledged experts. It includes 8 modules that take you on a step-by-step journey to improve as a writer.

From a report: It was a small victory for working artists in an industry where jobs are slipping away as movie and video game studios adopt generative AI tools to save time and money. Every year, tens of thousands of people descend on San Diego for Comic-Con, the world's premier comic book convention that over the years has also become a major pan-media event where every major media company announces new movies, TV shows, and video games. For the past few years, Comic-Con has allowed some forms of AI-generated art at this art show at the convention. \n\nAccording to archived rules for the show, artists could display AI-generated material so long as it wasn't for sale, was marked as AI-produced, and credited the original artist whose style was used. \"Material produced by Artificial Intelligence (AI) may be placed in the show, but only as Not-for-Sale (NFS). It must be clearly marked as AI-produced, not simply listed as a print. If one of the parameters in its creation was something similar to 'Done in the style of,' that information must be added to the description. If there are questions, the Art Show Coordinator will be the sole judge of acceptability,\" Comic-Con's art show rules said until recently.",

The arrests are an extreme attack on what is most often a wholesome hobby that has a history of being vilified by authoritarian governments in part because the technology is quite censorship resistant.</p><p>The detentions were announced last week on Belarusian state TV, which claimed the men were part of a network of more than 50 people participating in the amateur radio hobby and have been accused of both “espionage” and “treason.” Authorities there said they seized more than 500 pieces of radio equipment. The men were accused on state TV of using radio to spy on the movement of government planes, though no actual evidence of this has been produced.</p><p>State TV claimed they were associated with the Belarusian Federation of Radioamateurs and Radiosportsmen (BFRR), a long-running amateur radio club and nonprofit that holds amateur radio competitions, meetups, trainings, and forums. WhatsApp and email requests to the BFRR from 404 Media were not returned.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/amateurradio/comments/1qi1ic2/comment/o0phb13/?context=3&amp;ref=404media.co\"></a>, Siarhei Besarab, a Belarusian amateur radio operator, posted a plea for support from others in the hobby: “MAYDAY from Belarus: Licensed operators facing death penalty.”</p><p>“I am writing this because my local community is being systematically liquidated in what I can only describe as a targeted intellectual genocide,” Besarab wrote. “They have detained over 50 licensed people, including callsigns EW1ABT, EW1AEH, and EW1ACE. These men were paraded on state television like war criminals and were coerced to publicly repent for the \"crime\" of technical curiosity. Propagandists presented the Belarusian Federation of Radioamateurs and Radiosportsmen (BFRR) as a front for a ‘massive spy network.’”</p><p>“State propaganda unironically claims these men were ‘pumping state secrets out of the air’ using nothing more than basic $25 Baofeng handhelds and consumer-grade SDR dongles,” he added. “Any operator knows that hardware like this is physically incapable of cracking the modern AES-256 digital encryption used by government security forces. It is a technical fraud, yet they are being charged with High Treason and Espionage. The punishment in Belarus for these charges is life in prison or the death penalty.”</p><p><a href=\"https://spring96.org/be/news/119459?ref=404media.co\"><u>The Belarusian human rights group Viasna</u></a> and its associated Telegram channel confirmed the detention and said that it spoke to a cellmate of Andrei Repetsi, who said that Repetsi was unable to talk about his case in jail: “The case is secret, so Andrei never told the essence of the case in the cell. He joked that his personal file was marked ‘Top secret. Burn before reading,’” Viasna wrote.&nbsp;</p><p>Most hams operate amateur radios for fun, as part of competitions, or to keep in touch with other hams around the world. But the hobby has a long history of being attacked by governments in part because it is resistant to censorship. Amateur radio often works even if a natural disaster or political action takes down internet, cell, and phone services, so it is popular among people interested in search and rescue and doomsday prepping. Amateur radio has been used to share information out of Cuba, for example, and in <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/cuba-is-jamming-ham-radio-frequencies-operators-say/?ref=404media.co\"><u>2021 the Cuban government jammed ham radio frequencies</u></a> during anti-government protests there.&nbsp;</p>",

      "content": "<p>In an increasingly global business domain, leadership isn’t just about vision—it’s about execution across borders, time zones, and cultures. As organizations race to scale with agility, regions like Latin America and the Middle East have become central to expansion strategies, not merely as markets, but as hubs of delivery and innovation. At the heart of this transformation stands Srinivas Balasubramanian, a project manager whose hands-on leadership style and operational discipline have helped translate strategic ambition into tangible outcomes.</p><blockquote><p>With over eight years of cross-industry project leadership experience, Balasubramanian has been instrumental in reshaping how global companies view resource allocation and delivery execution. His recent efforts in Latin America (LATAM) and Dubai offer a compelling look at how localized leadership can scale global growth.</p></blockquote><p>When organizations in the U.S. looked for efficient, responsive project delivery partners, LATAM emerged as a natural fit. But proximity alone wasn’t enough. It took a deliberate strategy to turn potential into performance.</p><p>“LATAM gave us a time-zone advantage, but we had to earn our delivery credibility,” Balasubramanian shares. Under his direction, 30 technical experts were recruited, onboarded, and deployed into high-value U.S.-based initiatives. They weren't small-scale endeavors, multimillion-dollar budgets and tight delivery schedules were associated with them. By bringing forth actual-time collaboration and ensuring cultural alignment, he established a strong operational framework.</p><p>\\\nThe outcome was evident: many projects within a two-year time frame, on time, and with uniform quality. “We didn’t just scale talent—we scaled trust,” he adds. That trust, as it turned out, became the currency for global expansion.</p><p>If LATAM was about synchronizing time zones, Dubai was about bridging cultural and operational divides. The project in question? A large-scale, end-to-end sports monitoring system for nearly 25,000 users—tracking everything from health metrics to meal plans.</p><p>Our expert led the entire delivery lifecycle—from requirements gathering and design to development, deployment, and support. But what made this particularly complex wasn’t the technology. It was the context.</p><p>“We were entering a new industry, with new terminology and unfamiliar processes,” he explains. “On top of that, cultural nuances shaped how we communicated and collaborated.” Weekly check-ins weren’t enough. His team made regular in-person visits, working side by side with stakeholders, building rapport and gaining operational insight.</p><p>That diligence paid off. Within a span of 14 months, the outdated paper and Excel-based tracking process was fully digitized. The organization saw an immediate boost in efficiency, accuracy, and user engagement.</p><p>In both LATAM and Dubai, success was anything but guaranteed. LATAM posed regulatory and compliance hurdles. The region was unfamiliar territory for the organization, and understanding its federal structure took time and focused effort. “We didn’t approach LATAM as just another delivery site,” he states. “We studied its dynamics, invested in people, and gave our teams the tools and trust they needed to thrive.”</p><p>In Dubai, aside from cultural complexity, scope creep was a constant threat. The needs of clients changed rapidly, and open communication became mission-critical. His single point-of-contact structure guaranteed consistent alignment and continued growth without compromising on quality.</p><p>\\\nBalasubramanian's effort has proven significant. In LATAM, that leadership led to tens of successful projects over two years with over 30 team members. In Dubai, a wholesale operations transformation was completed in under 6 months. These are not just successful deployments; they're instances of scalable, repeatable models.</p><p>The sports monitoring system that has been developed in Dubai is now a model that future systems in the region will use. “It’s a living example of what’s possible when technology meets local insight,” he notes.</p><p>Beyond delivery, he contributes actively to the industry’s body of knowledge. His publications, such as “Project Management Challenges in High-Profile Sports and Entertainment Software Deployments” and “Developing Seamless Cross-Platform User Experiences for Sports Applications”, highlight not only technical expertise but also an ability to think strategically about scale, user experience, and performance. These works reflect his deep understanding of project ecosystems and reinforce his credibility as both a practitioner and a thought leader.</p><p>Looking forward, Balasubramanian is optimistic and grounded. The lessons learned in LATAM are now guiding the company’s approach in other emerging regions. The systems delivered in Dubai are being enhanced through AI, promising to automate and optimize even more processes. “AI will allow us to take what we built and make it smarter,” he reflects. “It’s not about replacing people; it’s about augmenting what they do best.”</p><p>He emphasizes that sustainable global growth requires more than simply establishing a presence in new markets, it demands a deep understanding of local ecosystems and the thoughtful adaptation of delivery models. For today’s leaders, the challenge is no longer whether to expand internationally, but how effectively they can localize their strategies.</p><p>His career offers a compelling example of this principle in action. Rather than relying solely on top-down direction, he has consistently driven impact from the ground up through focused execution, cross-cultural collaboration, and a commitment to excellence, one project at a time.</p>",

A separate Workday report of roughly 1,600 employees found that though 85% reported time savings of one to seven hours weekly, much of it was offset by correcting errors and reworking AI-generated content -- what the company called an \"AI tax\" on productivity. \n\nAt the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, a PricewaterhouseCoopers survey of nearly 4,500 CEOs found more than half have seen no significant financial benefit from AI so far, and only 12% said the technology has delivered both cost and revenue gains.",

It was a small victory for working artists in an industry where jobs are slipping away as movie and video game studios adopt generative AI tools to save time and money.&nbsp;</p><p>Every year, tens of thousands of people descend on San Diego for Comic-Con, the world’s premier comic book convention that over the years has also become a major pan-media event where every major media company announces new movies, TV shows, and video games. For the past few years, Comic-Con has allowed some forms of AI-generated art at this art show at the convention. According to <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20240724010823/https://www.comic-con.org/cc/things-to-do/art-show/\"></a> for the show, artists could display AI-generated material so long as it wasn’t for sale, was marked as AI-produced, and credited the original artist whose style was used.</p><p>“Material produced by Artificial Intelligence (AI) may be placed in the show, but only as Not-for-Sale (NFS). It must be clearly marked as AI-produced, not simply listed as a print. If one of the parameters in its creation was something similar to ‘Done in the style of,’ that information must be added to the description. If there are questions, the Art Show Coordinator will be the sole judge of acceptability,” Comic-Con’s art show rules said until recently.</p><p>These rules have been in place since at least 2024, but anti-AI sentiment is growing in the artistic community and an artist-led backlash against Comic-Con’s AI-friendly language led to the convention quietly changing the rules. Twenty-four hours after artists called foul the AI-friendly policy, Comic-Con updated the language on its site. “Material created by Artificial Intelligence (AI) either partially or wholly, is not allowed in the art show,” it now says. AI is now banned at the art show.</p><p>Comic and concept artist Tiana Oreglia told 404 Media Comic-Con’s friendly attitude towards AI was a slippery slope towards normalization. “I think we should be standing firm especially with institutions like Comic-Con which are quite literally built off the backs of artists and the creative community,” she said. Oreglia was one of the first artists to notice the AI-friendly policy. In addition to alerting her circle of friends, she also wrote a letter to Comic-Con itself.</p><p>Artist Karla Ortiz told 404 Media she learned about the AI-friendly policy after some fellow artists shared it with her. Ortiz is a major artist who has worked with some of the major studios who exhibit work at Comic-Con. She’s also got a large following on social media, a following she used to call out Comic-Con’s organizers.</p><p>“Comic-con deciding to allow GenAi imagery in the art show—giving valuable space to GenAi users to show slop right NEXT to actual artists who worked their asses off to be there—is a disgrace!” Ortiz said in a <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/kortizart.bsky.social/post/3mceacorcr22i?ref=404media.co\"></a>. “A tone deaf decision that rewards and normalizes exploitative GenAi against artists in their own spaces!”</p><p>According to Ortiz, the convention is a sacred place she didn’t want to see desecrated by AI. “Comic-Con is the big mecca for comic artists, illustrators, and writers,” she said. “I organize and speak with a lot of different artists on the generative AI issue. It’s something that impacts us and impacts our lives. A lot of us have decided: ‘No, we’re not going to sit by the sidelines.’”</p><p>Oritz explained that generative AI was already impacting the livelihood of working artists. She said that, in the past, artists could sustain themselves on long projects for companies that included storyboarding and design. “Suddenly the duration of projects are cut,” she said. “They got generative AI to generate a bunch of references, a bunch of boards. ‘We already did the initial ideation, so just paint this. Paint what generative AI has generated for us.’”</p><p>Ortiz pointed to two high profile examples: Marvel using AI to make the <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/secret-invasion-ai-opening-1235521299/?ref=404media.co\"><u>title sequence for </u></a> and Coca-Cola using AI to make <a href=\"https://www.coca-colacompany.com/media-center/coca-cola-refreshes-givers-of-the-season-embraces-ai-powered-storytelling-in-global-holiday-campaign?ref=404media.co\"></a>. “You have this encroaching exploitative technology impacting almost every single level of the entertainment industry, whether you’re a writer, or a voice actor, or a musician, a painter, a concept artist, an illustrator. It doesn’t matter…and then to have Comic-Con, that place that’s supposed to be a gathering and a celebration of said creatives and their work, suddenly put on a pedestal the exploitative technology that only functions because of its training on our works? It’s upsetting beyond belief.”</p><p>“What is Comic-Con trying to tell the industry?” She said, “It’s telling artists: ‘Hey you, you’re exploitable and you’re replaceable.’”</p><p>Ortiz was heartened that Comic-Con changed its policy. “It was such a relief,” she said. “Generative AI is still going to creep its nasty way in some way or another, but at least it’s not something we have to take lying down. It’s something we can actively speak out against.”</p><p>Comic-Con did not respond to 404 Media’s request for comment, but Oreglia said she did hear back from art show organizer Glen Wooten. “He basically told me that they put those AI stipulations in when AI was just starting to come around and that the inability to sell AI-generated works was meant to curtail people from submitting genAI works,” she said. “He seems to be very against genAI but wasn't really able to change the current policy until artists voiced their opinions loudly which pressured the office into banning AI completely.”</p><p>Despite changing policies and broad anti-AI sentiment among the artistic community, Oreglia has still seen an uptick of AI art at conventions. “Although there are many cons that ban it outright and if you get caught selling it you basically will get banned.” This happened to a vendor at Dragon Con last September. Organizers called police to <a href=\"https://www.comicsbeat.com/ai-artist-escorted-out-of-dragon-con-after-police-are-called/?ref=404media.co\"></a> off the premises.&nbsp;</p><p>“And I was tabling at Fanexpo SF and definitely saw genAI in the dealers hall, none in the artists alley as far as I could see though but I mostly stuck to my table,” she said. “I was also at Emerald City Comic Con last year and they also have a no-ai policy but fanexpo doesn't seem to have those same policies as far as I know.”</p><p>AI image generators are trained on original artwork so whatever output a tool like Midjourney creates is based on an artist’s work, often without compensation or credit. Oreglia also said she feels that AI is an artistic dead end. “Everything interesting, uplifting, and empowering I find about art gets stripped away and turned into vapid facsimiles based on vibes and trendy aesthetics,” she said.</p>",

      "content": "<h2>Prompt Rate Limits &amp; Batching: Your LLM API Has a Speed Limit (Even If Your Product Doesn’t)</h2><p>You ship a feature, your traffic spikes, and suddenly your LLM layer starts returning  like it’s handing out parking tickets.</p><p>The bad news: rate limits are inevitable.</p><p>The good news: <strong>most LLM “rate limit incidents” are self-inflicted</strong>—usually by oversized prompts, bursty traffic, and output formats that are impossible to parse at scale.</p><p>This article is a practical playbook for:</p><ol><li>understanding prompt-related throttles,</li><li>avoiding the common failure modes, and</li><li>batching requests without turning your responses into soup.</li></ol><h2>1) The Three Limits You Actually Hit (And What They Mean)</h2><p>Different providers name things differently, but the mechanics are consistent:</p><h3>1.1 Context window (max tokens per request)</h3><p>If your  exceeds the model context window, the request fails immediately.</p><ul><li>“Maximum context length exceeded”</li><li>“Your messages resulted in X tokens…”</li></ul><ul><li>shorten, summarise, or chunk data.</li></ul><h3>1.2 RPM (Requests Per Minute)</h3><p>You can be under token limits and still get throttled if you burst too many calls. Gemini explicitly documents RPM as a core dimension.</p><ul><li>“Rate limit reached for requests per minute”</li></ul><ul><li>client-side pacing, queues, and backoff.</li></ul><h3>1.3 TPM / Token throughput limits</h3><p>Anthropic measures rate limits in <strong>RPM + input tokens/minute + output tokens/minute</strong> (ITPM/OTPM).    Gemini similarly describes token-per-minute as a key dimension.</p><ul><li>“Rate limit reached for token usage per minute”</li><li>429 + Retry-After header (Anthropic calls this out)</li></ul><ul><li>reduce tokens, batch efficiently, or request higher quota.</li></ul><h3>2.1 The “one prompt to rule them all” anti-pattern</h3><ul></ul><p>…in a single request, and then you wonder why token usage spikes.</p><p>. If you need multi-step logic, use  (small prompts with structured intermediate outputs).</p><h3>2.2 Bursty traffic (the silent RPM killer)</h3><p>Production traffic is spiky. Cron jobs, retries, user clicks, webhook bursts—everything aligns in the worst possible minute.</p><p>If your client sends requests like a machine gun, your provider will respond like a bouncer.</p><h3>2.3 Unstructured output = expensive parsing</h3><p>If your output is “kinda JSON-ish”, your parser becomes a full-time therapist.</p><p>Make the model output  or a fixed table. Treat format as a contract.</p><h3>3.1 Prompt-side: shrink tokens without losing signal</h3><ul><li> (models don’t need your company origin story).</li><li>Convert repeated boilerplate into a short “policy block” and reuse it.</li><li>Prefer  over prose (“material=316 stainless steel” beats a paragraph).</li></ul><h4>A tiny prompt rewrite that usually saves 30–50%</h4><blockquote><p>“We’re a smart home brand founded in 2010… please write 3 marketing lines…”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“Write 3 UK e-commerce lines. Product: smart bulb. Material=PC flame-retardant. Feature=3 colour temperatures. Audience=living room.”</p></blockquote><h3>3.2 Request-side: backoff like an adult</h3><p>If the provider returns , respect it. Anthropic explicitly returns Retry-After on 429s.</p><p>Use exponential backoff + jitter:</p><ul></ul><h3>3.3 System-side: queue + concurrency caps</h3><p>If your account supports 10 concurrent requests, do not run 200 coroutines and “hope”.</p><ul><li>a  for concurrency</li><li>and a  for RPM/TPM</li></ul><h2>4) Batching: The Fastest Way to Cut Calls, Cost, and 429s</h2><p>Batching means: <strong>one API request handles multiple independent tasks</strong>.</p><p>It works best when tasks are:</p><ul><li>same type (e.g., 20 product blurbs)</li><li>independent (no step depends on another)</li></ul><ul><li>fewer network round-trips</li><li>fewer requests → lower RPM pressure</li><li>more predictable throughput</li></ul><p>Also: OpenAI’s pricing pages explicitly include a “Batch API price” column for several models.  (That doesn’t mean “batching is free”, but it’s a strong hint the ecosystem expects this pattern.)</p><h2>5) The Batching Prompt Template That Doesn’t Fall Apart</h2><p>Here’s a format that stays parseable under pressure.</p><h3>5.1 Use task blocks + a strict JSON response schema</h3><pre><code>SYSTEM: You output valid JSON only. No Markdown. No commentary.\n​\nUSER:\nYou will process multiple tasks. \nReturn a JSON array. Each item must be:\n{\n  \"task_id\": &lt;int&gt;,\n  \"title\": &lt;string&gt;,\n  \"bullets\": [&lt;string&gt;, &lt;string&gt;, &lt;string&gt;]\n}\n​\nRules:\n- UK English spelling\n- Title ≤ 12 words\n- 3 bullets, each ≤ 18 words\n- If input is missing: set title=\"INSUFFICIENT_DATA\" and bullets=[]\n​\nTASKS:\n### TASK 1\nproduct_name: Insulated smart mug\nmaterial: 316 stainless steel\nfeatures: temperature alert, 7-day battery\naudience: commuters\n​\n### TASK 2\nproduct_name: Wireless earbuds\nmaterial: ABS shock-resistant\nfeatures: ANC, 24-hour battery\naudience: students\n</code></pre><p>That “INSUFFICIENT_DATA” clause is your lifesaver. One broken task shouldn’t poison the whole batch.</p><h2>6) Python Implementation: Batch → Call → Parse (With Guardrails)</h2><p>Below is a modern-ish pattern you can adapt (provider SDKs vary, so treat it as , not a copy‑paste guarantee).</p><pre><code>import json\nimport random\nimport time\nfrom typing import Any, Dict, List, Tuple\n​\nMAX_RETRIES = 4\n​\ndef backoff_sleep(attempt: int, retry_after: float | None = None) -&gt; None:\n &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;if retry_after is not None:\n &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;time.sleep(retry_after)\n &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;return\n &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;base = 2 ** attempt\n &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;jitter = random.random()\n &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;time.sleep(min(10, base + jitter))\n​\ndef build_batch_prompt(tasks: List[Dict[str, str]]) -&gt; str:\n &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;header = (\n &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;\"You output valid JSON only.

As AI-generated text, images, and deepfakes saturate the web, the line between human creativity and machine output is becoming dangerously blurred. The debate is no longer just about the technology itself, but about the trust infrastructure of the internet: should companies be required to label synthetic content, or does that stifle the very innovation driving the industry forward?</p><p>\\\nWe asked the HackerNoon community, and the results were interesting 😉</p><h2>This Week’s HackerNoon Poll Results</h2><p><em>As AI-generated text, images, and video flood the internet, a new debate is emerging: should companies be required to clearly label what’s human-made and what’s machine-made? Proponents say transparency is essential to combat misinformation and preserve trust. Critics argue that labeling could slow innovation or be impossible to enforce. Where do you stand?</em></p><p>The community's verdict, however, leaves little room for ambiguity. Out of 300 voters, a commanding  demanded some form of mandatory disclosure, with  insisting on transparency without exception. Another  took a more measured stance, advocating for labels specifically in sensitive sectors like news, politics, and education, where misinformation can have real-world consequences. </p><p>\\\nOn the opposing side, the resistance was remarkably weak: only  believed audiences should be left to figure it out themselves, while a mere  bought into the argument that labeling would stifle innovation and creativity. An additional  remained undecided, still waiting for more information before picking a side. </p><blockquote><p><strong>The message is clear: for the vast majority of users, the \"magic\" of AI isn't worth the price of being deceived, and whether people like it or not, AI transparency is a must to ensure a safe creative space where ideas remain original, credited, and encouraged rather than giving in to AI slops and quick-generated content.</strong></p></blockquote><p>:::tip\nWeigh in on the poll results&nbsp;.</p><h2>More on Tech Transparency</h2><p>Heading into 2026, the definition of tech security has expanded far beyond traditional malware defense. The rapid evolution of AI has introduced new and volatile risks, most recently exemplified by Grok's ability to generate NSFW images. Outrage has sparked amongst communities with concerns over the leak and exploitation of personal images without consent. This has led to the recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/jan/18/grok-x-ai-tool-still-accessible-malaysia-despite-ban-vpns\">ban on Grok</a> in Malaysia and Indonesia, sparking the question of whether another country will follow suit.</p><p>\\\nOver on Polymarket, a question was raised on whether X would be banned in the UK by the end of March, and with the current confidence level of , it can be seen that, despite all the controversies over personal data, it is highly likely that UK citizens will still be on the platform in the foreseeable future. </p><p>\\\nHowever, to be able to continue operations, it is clear that there’s a demand for information transparency, where AI-generated images must be labeled for legal issues that might arise. </p><p>Over on Kalshi, the drama is personal and legal. In August 2025, people on Kalshi debated on whether or not Elon would sue Apple before Jan 1st 2026. While we all know how this one has played out, it highlights how much of the tech narrative is driven by personality and corporate feuds rather than just product specs.</p><p>\\\nWe’ll be back next week with more data, more debates, and more donut charts!</p>",

We also expected Verizon to make a change to its policies in a hurry and they did not disappoint. Again, the FCC provided them a waiver 7 days ago and they are already starting to update policies.\n \nAs of this morning, Verizon has implemented a new device unlock policy across its various prepaid brands and I'd imagine their postpaid policy change is right around the corner. Brands like Visible, Total Wireless, Tracfone, and StraightTalk, all have an updated device unlock policy today that extends to 365 days of paid and active service before they'll free your phone from the Verizon network. Starting January 20, Verizon says that devices purchased from their prepaid brands will only be unlocked upon request after 365 days and if you meet several requirements [...].\n \nWhat exactly is changing here? Well, if you purchased a device from Verizon's value brands previously, they would automatically unlock them after 60 days. Now, you have to wait 365 days, request the unlock because it doesn't happen automatically, and also have active service. [...] The FCC mentioned in their waiver that by allowing Verizon to create whatever unlock policy they wanted that this would \"benefit consumers.\" How does any of this benefit consumers?",

      "content": "<h2>Process Of Identifying Personal Data</h2><p>Before delving into the approach, it is crucial to differentiate between personal data and personally identifiable information (PII). While both are subsets of information that relate to an individual, PII is a category of data that directly identifies a person. Examples include account information, contact details, personal IDs, and national IDs. Not all the 10 categories of personal data we consider below fall under PII. The exposure of PII is especially concerning as it could lead to personal or psychological harm, such as identity theft.</p><p>\\\nOur primary aim is to identify the flow of personal data within a codebase, focusing on its cruicial implications for privacy. To achieve this, we use a pattern-matching technique inspired by Tang et al. [?]. This technique effectively identifies data from 10 categories, including Account, Contact, Personal ID, Location, and National ID. We employ Semgrep, a tool tailored for pattern matching in code, to facilitate this process. Semgrep’s rules are specifically designed for Java and JavaScript languages.</p><h3>6.1 Static Analysis for Personal Data Identification</h3><p>The initial phase of our approach involves using static analysis to locate code fragments that contain personal data. We use Semgrep for this task, given its efficiency and flexibility in analyzing large codebases. We rely on Semgrep’s support for multiple languages and its capabilities for local data flow analysis.   <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-b9037hr.png\" alt=\"Table 1. Alignment of the labels with GDPR requirements\"></p><h3><strong>6.2 Defining Sources of Personal Data</strong></h3><p>In the context of our analysis, sources refer to instances where personal data appears. We identify personal data in two ways: 1) as literal text present in the source code, and 2) as variables, based on their name identifiers. Our identification rules are designed to support Java, JavaScript, and TypeScript but can be extended to other languages that Semgrep supports.</p><h3><strong>6.3 Rule Crafting for Identification</strong></h3><p>To pinpoint literal personal data, we use regular expression (regex) matching. This comes into play, for example, when identifying the format of national ID numbers. For variable sources, we maintain a default list of identifiers that correspond to the 10 categories of personal data. These identifiers help us formulate Semgrep rules. To reduce false positives, we impose specific conditions on these regex rules. For instance, to capture all human names in the code, we use a regex pattern that accommodates variations like first, last, and full names: (?i).(?:first|given|full|last|sur(?!geon)) [s/(;)|,=!&gt;]name).</p><ol></ol>",

      "content": "<h2>Identifying API Privacy-Relevant Methods</h2><p>Native privacy-relevant methods form the basis for identifying what we refer to as API privacyrelevant methods. These are methods found in third-party libraries and frameworks that are likely to process personal data by calling upon native privacy-relevant methods. Understanding the relationship between API and native methods is crucial for a complete review of how personal data is processed in a codebase.</p><p>\\\nThe identification process is iterative and takes into account the dependencies between libraries and codebases, as depicted in Fig. 2. The goal is to assemble a list of API privacy-relevant methods that have the potential to handle personal data. Understanding the relationship and dependency hierarchy among these libraries is essential for accomplishing this task.</p><h3><strong>4.1 Dependency Sorting and Identification of Privacy-relevant Methods</strong></h3><p>To manage library dependencies, we focus on import statements within each library’s source code. We organize the libraries in a sequence such that each library is evaluated only after all its dependencies have been assessed. This ensures a logical and efficient evaluation process. For the identification of API privacy-relevant methods, we define a set denoted as API.</p><p>\\\nThis set includes methods from our organized list of libraries that invoke native privacy-relevant methods at some point during their execution. These methods are significant as they interact with native methods, either directly or through a chain of calls, making them critical for privacy code review.</p><h2>Labels For Personal Data Processing</h2><p>Compliance with data protection regulations like GDPR necessitates a nuanced understanding of how personal data is processed within code. While GDPR outlines various processing activities such as collection, recording, and organization, the four native privacy-relevant method categories [8] we previously discussed (I/O, security, database, and network) lack the granularity needed for comprehensive understanding.</p><p>\\\nFor instance, the security category encompasses both authentication and encryption, warranting a more detailed labeling system. After analyzing top labels from Maven and NPM that pertain to personal data processing, we identified 20 labels that closely align with both GDPR’s definitions and our native privacyrelevant method categories. This shows how libraries handle data processing in different ways. For example, OAuth combines network and security functionalities, while Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) bridges database and I/O operations.</p><p>\\\nThese overlaps underscore the necessity for a detailed set of labels tailored for privacy reviews. We present these labels and their alignment with GDPR requirements in Table 1. These labels serve a dual purpose: they categorize methods involved in data processing activities like collection, storage, and encryption, and they map these activities to GDPR compliance requirements. This streamlined mapping simplifies the task of identifying code sections that need to comply with legal standards. In our later approach, we use these labels to prioritize privacy-relevant methods, enabling a focused review on areas critical for data protection.</p><ol></ol>",

      "content": "<blockquote><p><em>What separates a cryptocurrency that endures for over a decade from the thousands that vanish within their first year?</em></p></blockquote><p>\\\nJanuary 18, 2025 marks twelve years since Dash launched as a fork of Bitcoin, making it one of the oldest active blockchain networks still operating with its original vision intact. While data from CoinGecko shows that over 90% of cryptocurrencies launched since 2017 no longer maintain active development or trading volume, Dash continues processing transactions daily across . The network has maintained continuous operation since 2013, outlasting projects that once held higher market capitalizations and generated more media attention.</p><h2>Why Most Cryptocurrencies Don't Reach Their Second Birthday</h2><p>The cryptocurrency industry operates with a failure rate that exceeds traditional startups. Research from Boston College found that  failed to maintain any value or development activity beyond 18 months. These failures stem from three primary causes: teams that abandon development after raising funds, technology that fails to deliver promised features, and networks that cannot sustain enough user activity to justify continued operation.</p><p>\\\nDash entered a market where Bitcoin already dominated the payment use case and Litecoin had established itself as the faster alternative. The project differentiated itself through a two-tier network structure that split functions between miners who secure the blockchain and masternodes that enable additional features. This architecture allowed Dash to implement InstantSend for near-instant transaction confirmation and PrivateSend for optional transaction privacy, both features that required more than simple code changes to Bitcoin.</p><p>\\\nThe network's funding mechanism allocates 10% of each block reward to a treasury that masternode operators vote on for development proposals. Since implementation, this system has distributed over , marketing initiatives, and integration partners according to blockchain records. Unlike projects dependent on venture capital or foundation reserves that eventually deplete, Dash generates ongoing revenue from its block rewards, creating a sustainable funding model that adapts to network value.</p><p>Dash initially positioned itself as digital cash for everyday transactions, competing directly with Bitcoin's payment narrative. The project gained merchant adoption in Venezuela during the country's hyperinflation period, where local transaction volume peaked at over . However, as Bitcoin's narrative shifted toward store of value and Ethereum demonstrated the potential for programmable money, Dash faced an identity challenge.</p><p>\\\nThe network's response involved expanding beyond simple payments while maintaining its core functionality. Dash Platform, currently in testing on mainnet, introduces decentralized identity and data storage capabilities that allow developers to build applications directly on Dash infrastructure. This evolution mirrors Ethereum's transition from a payment system to a development platform, though Dash maintains its focus on user experience and transaction speed rather than complex smart contract functionality.</p><p>\\\nThe platform introduces usernames that replace complex wallet addresses, state transitions that enable data updates without storing everything on the blockchain, and a decentralized API that applications can query without running full nodes. These features address usability barriers that have prevented mainstream blockchain adoption, targeting use cases from social media to business process management. \\n </p><h2>What Twelve Years of Market Cycles Reveals</h2><p>Dash has survived four distinct cryptocurrency market cycles, each bringing different challenges and competitive threats. The 2017 ICO boom saw hundreds of projects raise more funding than Dash's entire market capitalization, yet most failed to deliver working products. The 2020-2021 DeFi summer shifted attention to yield farming and decentralized exchanges, temporarily reducing interest in payment-focused cryptocurrencies. The 2022 collapse of Terra, Celsius, and FTX demonstrated the risks of unsustainable tokenomics and centralized custody.</p><p>Throughout these cycles, Dash maintained its network operation, continued development, and preserved its decentralized governance structure. The network currently operates with  globally, each requiring 1,000 DASH as collateral. This distribution prevents single entities from controlling the network's direction or treasury allocation, though it also slows decision-making compared to centralized development teams. \\n </p><p>The project's longevity offers data on what sustains blockchain networks beyond initial hype. Consistent development funding, alignment between stakeholders through governance participation, and focus on specific use cases rather than attempting to solve every problem appear as common factors. Dash's masternode operators have financial incentives to support proposals that increase network value, creating a feedback loop between governance decisions and token price that doesn't exist in pure proof-of-work systems. \\n </p><p>Dash's twelve-year operation demonstrates that cryptocurrency projects can survive beyond their initial vision when they maintain development momentum and adapt to market changes without abandoning core principles. The network has processed millions of transactions, funded hundreds of development proposals, and maintained decentralized governance through multiple market cycles that eliminated most competitors from its era.</p><p>The cryptocurrency industry's high failure rate makes any project's twelfth anniversary noteworthy. Whether Dash achieves mainstream adoption or remains a specialized payment network depends on execution of its platform features and competition from newer projects with better funding or technology. But the project has already answered the question that most cryptocurrencies never reach: how to build something that lasts beyond the initial speculation. \\n </p><p>Don't forget to like and share the story! </p><p>:::tip\n<em>This author is an independent contributor publishing via our&nbsp;.

In the absence of a settlement with the other parties, the trial is scheduled to go forward against the remaining three defendants, with jury selection due to begin on January 27. Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg is expected to testify, and until Tuesday's settlement, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel was also set to take the stand.\n \nSnap is still a defendant in other social media addiction cases that have been consolidated in the court. The closely watched cases could challenge a legal theory that social media companies have used to shield themselves. They have long argued that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 protects them from liability for what third parties post on their platforms. But plaintiffs argue that the platforms are designed in a way that leaves users addicted through choices that affect their algorithms and notifications. The social media companies have said the plaintiffs' evidence falls short of proving that they are responsible for alleged harms such as depression and eating disorders.",

      "content": "<p>Code review, originally aimed at ensuring software quality by identifying bugs and performance issues [11], has expanded to address security vulnerabilities and, more recently, privacy concerns under data protection laws like the GDPR. Privacy-focused reviews add the complexity of ensuring personal data is handled lawfully and ethically, a challenging task due to the often ambiguous nature of data protection guidelines [10].</p><p>\\\nStatic analysis tools are pivotal in code reviews, aiding in the identification of data flows, security risks, and compliance issues. The effectiveness of a review is measured by its ability to pinpoint critical problems and offer actionable solutions. Privacy code reviews, however, struggle with identifying personal data due to unclear definitions and varied contexts, increasing reliance on these tools despite their limitations in recognizing diverse personal data types [9].</p><p>\\\nThese reviews also play a key role in creating essential compliance documents like Records of Processing Activities (ROPA) and Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIA). The proposed automated approach in this paper focuses on improving the efficiency and accuracy of privacy code reviews, specifically in categorizing personal data processing in large-scale code projects.</p><p>To streamline the process of privacy code review, we introduce the concept of privacy-relevant methods. These are specific methods that play a direct role in the processing of personal data. Such methods can be part of standard libraries or third-party libraries, making them critical focal points for personal data processing in software applications. Native libraries are foundational because they offer the only pathways to device resources like files and networks.</p><p>\\\nConsequently, any operation involving data storage or transfer must go through these native methods. Native privacy-relevant methods are those found in standard libraries of programming languages like JavaScript and Java. These methods act as the origins (sources) for all personal data entered by users via devices. They are also the exclusive methods that directly transmit this data to other devices or services. We categorize these native methods into domains such as I/O, Database, Network, Security, following the guidelines of existing research [8].</p><p>\\\nWe identify these methods through a systematic manual review that includes an examination of documentation, source code, and actual usage patterns. To facilitate the identification and categorization of native privacy-relevant methods, we conducted an in-depth analysis of key modules like java.io, java.security, and java.util for Java, and their equivalents in JavaScript. This analysis helps us compile a complete set of native privacy-relevant methods, denoted as Native, that are involved in personal data processing.</p><ol></ol>",

      "content": "<ol></ol><p>Privacy code review is a critical process that enables developers and legal experts to ensure compliance with data protection regulations. However, the task is challenging due to resource constraints. To address this, we introduce the concept of privacy-relevant methods — specific methods in code that are directly involved in the processing of personal data. We then present an automated approach to assist in code review by identifying and categorizing these privacy-relevant methods in source code. Using static analysis, we identify a set of methods based on their occurrences in 50 commonly used libraries.</p><p>\\\nWe then rank these methods according to their frequency of invocation with actual personal data in the top 30 GitHub applications. The highest-ranked methods are the ones we designate as privacy-relevant in practice. For our evaluation, we examined 100 opensource applications and found that our approach identifies fewer than 5% of the methods as privacy-relevant for personal data processing. This reduces the time required for code reviews. Case studies on Signal Desktop and Cal.com further validate the effectiveness of our approach in aiding code reviewers to produce enhanced reports that facilitate compliance with privacy regulations.</p><p>In the realm of software development, privacy code reviews have become indispensable, especially with the advent of stringent data protection regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Unlike security code reviews, which focus on existing security flaws or vulnerabilities, privacy code reviews are concerned with the ethical and lawful handling of personal data. Although there may be overlaps, such as in access control, the primary objectives of these two types of reviews are distinct: security reviews aim to prevent unauthorized access, while privacy reviews aim for compliance with data protection principles. Privacy code reviews involve a systematic process where source code is inspected to trace the flow of personal data.</p><p>\\\nEquipped with program analysis tools, reviewers categorize these flows and detail how personal data is processed. This analysis serves as a comprehensive guide for compliance checks and aids Data Protection Officers (DPOs) in fulfilling their responsibilities. The process is illustrated in Figure 1. However, the challenge arises from the complexity and sheer volume of modern codebases, making it difficult to identify instances where personal data is processed.</p><p>\\\nRecent studies [6, 7] have examined tools for identifying personal data, but less focus has been placed on data that is dynamically changing or in active use. While categorizations exist for personal data itself, taxonomies of the processing code are lacking. Developing a understanding of the diverse ways data can be handled would illuminate processing activities and facilitate compliance reporting like records of processing activities (ROPA) and data protection impact assessments (DPIA). Since reviewing entire codebases is time-consuming, targeting reports to highlight the most relevant aspects could better serve reviewers and streamline the compliance process. The goal should be  </p><p>\\\nproviding clarity on key data handling activities without getting lost in an elaborate labeling framework. In light of these challenges, we propose an automated approach to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of privacy code reviews. Our approach focuses on identifying privacy-relevant methods — specifically, Java methods or JavaScript functions commonly found in popular libraries — that are involved in the processing of personal data. By doing so, we can pinpoint instances in real-world applications where these privacy-relevant methods are invoked to handle personal data.</p><p>\\\nThis paper addresses the following research questions:</p><ol><li><p>How to identify privacy-relevant methods in commonly used libraries that potentially process personal data?</p></li><li><p>How to categorize such privacy-relevant methods based on their actual usage in real-world applications? To answer these questions, we make the following contributions:</p></li><li><p>We present a novel static analysis technique specifically designed to identify methods in source code that are involved in the processing of personal data. (Section 4)</p></li><li><p>We develop a set of labels for categorizing personal data and the methods that process them, thereby providing a structured approach to understanding how personal data is processed in code. (Sections 5 and 6)</p></li><li><p>We apply our approach to a set of popular open-source applications. Through this, we rank privacy-relevant methods based on their frequency of occurrence, thereby identifying those that are most critical for privacy considerations. (Section 7)</p></li><li><p>We provide insights to code reviewers by highlighting frequently used methods relevant to privacy, based on our large-scale study and specific case studies. This approach streamlines the review process, enabling a more focused and efficient identification of potential privacy risks. (Section 8) Our evaluation of 100 open-source applications indicates that our approach identifies fewer than 5% of methods involved in personal data processing as privacy-relevant methods. This enables reviewers to focus only on the identified relevant code, thereby expediting privacy code reviews.</p></li></ol>",

      "content": "<p>\\\nA designer friend recently told me she spent three days trying to figure out why her company's checkout flow made users confirm their email address twice. It seemed obviously redundant—just bad UX someone forgot to clean up. She asked the PM. She asked the engineer who built it. She even dug through old PRs looking for context.</p><p>The best answer she got was: \"There was something with the vendor API, but I don't remember the details. Maybe check with Sarah?\"</p><p>Sarah left the company five months ago.</p><p>Eventually, she found a Slack thread from 18 months earlier where someone mentioned the vendor's email validation was broken and that they'd had incidents with typos causing lost orders. The double confirmation was catching 90% of errors. Not elegant, but solving a real problem.</p><p>She almost removed it because no one had told her why it existed.</p><p>This keeps happening. Someone makes a thoughtful decision based on real constraints. Six months later, the constraints are invisible, and the decision looks arbitrary. A new designer shows up, sees something that seems obviously wrong, and \"fixes\" it—only to rediscover why it was that way in the first place.</p><h3><strong>We're really good at documenting what we build</strong></h3><p>Design teams are pretty rigorous about certain kinds of documentation. We have detailed component specs. We maintain Figma libraries. We write interaction patterns and accessibility guidelines. Some teams even have comprehensive design systems with usage examples and do's and don'ts.</p><p>All of that tells you what to build and how to build it.</p><p>None of it tells you why things are the way they are.</p><p>Why is the button that specific height? Why did we choose this navigation pattern over the other one that tested well? Why does this flow have an extra step that seems unnecessary?</p><p>The specs and guidelines don't answer these questions because they're not designed to. They're maintenance documentation—they help you stay consistent with existing decisions. But they don't explain how we got to those decisions in the first place.</p><h3><strong>The knowledge that actually matters</strong></h3><p>When I'm trying to understand an unfamiliar part of the product, here's what I'm really trying to figure out:</p><p>What problem were you actually solving? Not the high-level product goal, but the specific issue that made you design it this particular way.</p><p>What did you try that didn't work? If I'm about to propose a solution, I want to know if someone already tried it and hit a wall I can't see yet.</p><p>What constraints were you working with? Technical limitations, time pressure, vendor restrictions, organizational dynamics. The context that made this the right answer then, even if it might not be the right answer now.</p><p>What were you assuming? Every design bakes in assumptions about users, technology, business priorities. If those assumptions changed, the design should probably change too. But I need to know what they were first.</p><p>What did you intentionally leave unfinished? There's a difference between \"we didn't get to this\" and \"this is working as intended.\" If I don't know which is which, I waste time optimizing things that are actually fine.</p><p>This is the information that prevents me from rediscovering what you already know.</p><p>I understand why we don't document this stuff. You've just finished designing and shipping something—you're tired, and now someone's asking you to write more? Your next project is already starting. Nobody's performance review mentions documentation quality.</p><p>Also, documenting your reasoning kind of feels like admitting your design might not be perfect. Like you're pre-writing the explanation for why future people shouldn't trust your judgment.</p><p>But that's backwards. Good documentation assumes future people are smart and will rightfully question your choices. You're just giving them enough information to question intelligently instead of blindly.</p><p>And honestly, the person who benefits most from this documentation is often you, three months later, when someone asks why you designed something a certain way and you can't quite remember.</p><p>The best documentation practice I've found is almost embarrassingly simple: write down your decisions.</p><p>Not specs. Not detailed rationale. Just a short record of what you decided and why.</p><p>In my team, we started keeping these in a shared folder—just markdown files with names like \"2024-01-why-we-redesigned-payment-summary.md\"</p><p>The format is deliberately minimal:</p><pre><code>Decision: What we built\n\nProblem: What we were trying to solve\n\nOptions we considered:\nOption A - why we didn't choose it\nOption B - why we didn't choose it\nOption C (what we built) - why we chose it\n\nTradeoffs: What we're accepting by choosing this\n\nDate and people: When we decided and who to ask for more context\n</code></pre><p>That's it. Usually takes me 10-15 minutes to write. But when someone asks about it six months later, that document is worth hours of archaeology.</p><h3><strong>When I actually bother writing these</strong></h3><p>I don't write a decision record for every design choice—that would be absurd. I write them when:</p><ul><li>I'm making a decision I can already imagine someone questioning me later</li><li>Multiple reasonable options existed and it wasn't obvious which to choose</li><li>We're working around a constraint that isn't visible in the final design</li><li>The solution seems counterintuitive but there's a good reason for it</li><li>I spent significant time exploring alternatives that failed</li></ul><p>Basically: if someone's going to look at this in six months and wonder \"why did they do it that way?\", I document it now while I still remember.</p><h3><strong>The research problem is worse</strong></h3><p>User research suffers from this even more. Teams conduct research, learn important things, make decisions based on those learnings, and then… the insights evaporate.</p><p>The deck lives in some Google Drive folder organized by quarter. Six months later, someone proposes a feature. It seems great. They build it. It fails for exactly the reason your research predicted it would.</p><p>\"Oh yeah, we learned that in research.\"</p><p>Okay, where's the research?</p><p>\"Um… I think it was Q2? Or maybe Q3? Let me check if I still have access to that folder…\"</p><p>One team I worked with started maintaining a simple research insights database. Not the full reports—those still live in folders somewhere. Just a searchable list of key learnings organized by product area.</p><p>So when someone asks \"should we add social login?\", you can quickly find \"we researched that in March 2023, here's what we learned, here's the deck if you want details.\"</p><p>It's not comprehensive. It's not perfect. But it's so much better than nothing.</p><h3><strong>Figma files are terrible historical records</strong></h3><p>Looking at an old Figma file tells you what shipped. It doesn't tell you the thirty variations you tried first, or why each one didn't work, or what technical constraint ruled out the obviously better solution.</p><p>Some designers leave their exploration frames visible with notes explaining what didn't work. That's better than nothing, but it still relies on you remembering to document while you're in the messy middle of the process.</p><p>I've found it's easier to document after I've landed on a solution, when I actually know what was important enough to write down.</p><h3><strong>What changes as you get more senior</strong></h3><p>When I look at work from designers at different levels, the visible output isn't that different. The gap is in what they leave behind for the next person.</p><p>More experienced designers document their reasoning. Not because they're more organized or have more time, but because they've been the person six months later enough times to know how valuable that context is.</p><p>They've learned that \"I'll remember why I did this\" is a lie you tell yourself. You won't remember, and neither will anyone else. Write it down now or lose it forever.</p><p>The longer someone's been on a team, the more knowledge they carry that isn't written anywhere. They know why the navigation is structured this way. They know what user feedback shaped that particular flow. They know which previous attempts failed and why.</p><p>When they leave, all that context leaves with them.</p><p>I've joined teams where this happened. The Figma files are there. The shipped product is there. But nobody can explain why certain decisions were made. So you either accept them as mysterious constraints or you change them and hope you don't break something important.</p><p>Either way, you're guessing. And that's expensive.</p><p>Next time you make a design decision that wasn't obvious, take ten minutes to write down what you decided and why. Include what else you considered. Note any constraints or assumptions that shaped your thinking.</p><p>Put it somewhere the next designer can find it. Not in your head. Not in Slack. Somewhere that persists.</p><p>You probably won't think it matters. But the next person—or you, six months from now—will be incredibly grateful it exists.</p><h3><strong>What I'm still figuring out</strong></h3><p>I'm not claiming I have this solved. I still forget to document things. I still underestimate what future-me will want to know. I still debate whether something is worth writing down.</p><p>But I've learned that when I'm unsure if something is worth documenting, it probably is. The things that feel obvious now are exactly the things that won't feel obvious later.</p><p>The documentation nobody asks for is usually the documentation everyone eventually wishes existed.</p><h3><strong>What if you didn't have to remember to document?</strong></h3><p>I've been thinking about this differently lately. What if the problem isn't that we're bad at documenting? What if we're asking people to document at exactly the wrong time?</p><p>You just shipped something. You're exhausted. Your next project is already starting. And now someone's supposed to sit down and write about decisions they made three weeks ago? Of course, that doesn't happen.</p><p>So here's what keeps bouncing around in my head: What if you didn't have to remember to document?</p><p>Imagine you're in Figma trying five different navigation patterns. You're in Slack, explaining to your PM why Option C won't work due to the vendor API or lack of a dev component. You finally land on Option D and ship it.</p><p>Right after you ship, you get a small notification: \"I noticed you explored several navigation approaches and mentioned vendor constraints. Want to save the context?\" Click it, and there's already a draft decision record. It's pulled from your Slack discussion, your Figma iterations, and those design review meetings where you explained the tradeoffs.</p><p>You spend 90 seconds reviewing it, maybe adding one detail the AI missed, and save it.</p><p>Six months later, a new designer is looking at that navigation and wondering why it's structured this way. Instead of an archaeology deep-dive, they type \"why is navigation structured this way\" and immediately see: \"Navigation redesigned June 2024. The Vendor API couldn't support nested menus, so we explored 5 alternatives. This was the only one that met both technical constraints and usability needs. Full context here.\"</p><p>No one had to remember to document. The context was captured during the natural workflow, structured when you had time, and surfaced exactly when someone needed it.</p><p>I don't know if this exact thing exists or if someone should build it. But I know this: the current answer of \"just write better documentation\" isn't working because it runs counter to human nature.</p><p>Maybe the real solution isn't better discipline. Maybe it's building systems that work with our natural behavior instead of against it.</p><p><em>Or maybe you've figured out something better. I'd love to know what's working for your team.</em></p>",

      "content": "<p>\\\nAround 2 years ago, our sales team was given a daunting task by our CEO – win an incremental 15 points of share in a market segment where we have less than 25% share today. The task seemed even more insurmountable given the fact that this customer segment had an entrenched competitor who had more than 50% share. As the strategy professional for the team, I was tasked with building the approach that the sales team could execute to achieve this goal. And straight to work I went – I built an end to end go-to-market framework which had three pillars: 1) targeting the right customers, 2) playbooks to win those customers and 3) revenue optimizers to harness the maximum potential from these customers.</p><p>A key part of our strategy was targeting the most valuable customers. Our frontline sales team was facing significant challenges with poor conversion rates which in turn significantly reduced their efficiency metrics. We had to fix that – and as someone who has always believed that math models were better than humans at decision making, I turned to analytics to solve the problem. We worked for nearly 3 months building and refining a model to prioritize the customers that our frontline sales should spend most of their time with. The model on the surface is seemingly simple: it works through a mountain of data to identify potential targets based on two dimensions – 1) high likelihood of us winning the customer and 2) high revenue potential if we win the customer. Under the hood were various regressions, time series forecasting and decision trees that worked through hundreds of variables – from both proprietary and public data sets – to come up with these recommendations. These prioritized customers were then communicated to our frontline through our CRM tool. The model worked swimmingly well. In the first three months of implementation, our conversion rate went up threefold. We were looking at winning 3 pts of share in the first year, an unprecedented pace of share gain.</p><p>However, when the share data came at the end of the first quarter the tool was deployed, the numbers did not look rosy at all. Instead of a share gain, it showed that our market share had remained relatively flat. Given that we were winning customers at an exceptionally fast pace, these numbers did not make sense. We started dissecting the share-data and came to a pretty uncomfortable realization – while we were winning customers on one end, we were losing customers at nearly the same rate on the other end. Our competitor had recognized our recent push in the market and was poaching our existing customers. On top of it, our frontline sales team, too busy with winning new customers, were unable to invest the required time and effort to retain our current customers.</p><p>To address the issue, I expanded our go-to-market strategy to include a fourth pillar - mechanisms to retain existing customers. We stood up a dedicated team exclusively for managing existing customers. This team’s responsibility was neither hunting for new customers, nor farming to increase revenue with existing customers but simply do what is required to retain existing customers. While our churn rate did drop, the difference was not substantial. The key challenge we faced was that our retention team had to manage tens of thousands of customers and they had no way to identify which ones deserved attention, and which ones did not. That prompted me to ask two questions</p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which customers deserve special attention from the retention team?</p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How do we identify and prioritize them?</p><p>Back to analytics I turned. We built a model that went through customer history and publicly available information and predicted the customer’s ‘likelihood of churn’. The model’s prediction ability was spectacularly impressive – it was able to tell us a customer is likely to churn within 90 days with 50-70% accuracy. We were elated - now we had a tool that could predict the future, and tell us exactly where we should concentrate our efforts. But soon we realized that good model prediction does not translate to good outcomes. Despite deploying the model to the retention team and the frontline sales team, the churn rate remained flat. This was a perplexing outcome, and I had to get to the bottom of it.</p><p>I interviewed each member of the retention team. I went to the field and spent hours with the sales team to understand why they couldn’t stem the flow even when they were warned of it. These interactions helped me understand the problem: <em>You can tell the team that they are going to lose a customer. But then what?</em> They did not have any actionable insights. What we were doing was giving the team some metrics. E.g., the model outcome told them that there is a 70% probability of a customer because their volume has reduced 30% in the last 5 months. That did not help them take any mitigation measures, only told them the problem. As the model was not proving effective in the field, the sales team was losing confidence in it. This significantly reduced model adoption as well. After the first two months of deployment, the model adoption rate was an abysmal 20%.</p><p>We had to fix this. The solution was to not just communicate to the retention team and the frontline just the symptoms, they needed remedial actions. But doing this using human intervention was cumbersome and expensive. For each customer, we had troves of data. If a customer was flagged as likely to churn, going through the data to find the root cause and then recommending a solution required automation. I turned to AI to do that. AI had two significant advantages – 1) It could go through large amounts of data to come up with insights much faster than humans and 2) It makes the feedback loop between field outcomes and model refinement seamless. After nearly two months of training, our AI model was ready for deployment. It was extremely good at combining model output and customer data to provide actionable advice. Here is a real example (edited to maintain confidentiality) of how AI insights were different from raw model outputs</p><p>Original model output communicated to field</p><p><em>Analysis Report: Risk ID #8842 - Account Attrition Modeling</em></p><ul><li><em>Churn Probability Score: 72.4% (High Priority)</em></li></ul><ul><li><em>Volume Deceleration: Time-series analysis identifies a 30% reduction in procurement volume over a 5-month rolling window. This trend deviates significantly from the account’s 3-year seasonal baseline.</em></li><li><em>Market Share Shift: Competitive intelligence and transactional metadata indicate the recent onboarding of [Competitor Name] SKUs. Cross-referencing logistics data suggests the competitor gained a 15% shelf-share within the last 60 days.</em></li></ul><p>Additional recommended actions that were recommended using AI</p><p>|  |  |  |\n|----|----|----|\n| <em>Defensive Pricing (Tier 1)</em> | <em>Reclaim 12% of lost volume</em> | <em>Apply a 4.5% rebate on all orders exceeding $xx per month for the next 90 days.</em> |\n| <em>Inventory Saturation \\n (Tier 1)</em> | <em>Achieve 85% \"Wallet Share\"</em> | <em>Offer a \"Buy 10, Get 1\" pallet incentive on SKUs </em> |\n| <em>Competitor Displacement \\n (Tier 2)</em> | <em>Displacement of [Competitor]</em> | <em>Authorize a one-time $xx \"Conversion Credit\" specifically tied to the phased removal of competitor-equivalent products.</em> |\n| <em>Contractual Lock-in \\n (Tier 2)</em> |  | <em>Proposed xx% fixed-price ceiling in exchange for an exclusive 2-year supply agreement (MSA).</em> |</p><p>\\\nThese numbers were highly tailored for the specific customer that the model specifically worked through our historic contracts (unstructured data) and pricing playbooks (structured data) among other sources.</p><p>Within the first two months of AI deployment, model adoption reached nearly 100%. Churn rate has reduced by 10% and we target achieving a 25% churn rate reduction by the first half of 2026.</p><p>While this experience might seem like a paean to AI models, it goes beyond that. It was a learning experience for a strategist on how best to leverage data, analytics, AI and most importantly people to create valuable business impact. My three key learnings to date from this on-going journey that started two years ago would be:</p><p>Data is meaningless without actionable insights: If we want real world outcomes, we need real actions. And to take real actions we need insights and direction. Having large amounts of high-quality data is just the first step of the process. Parsing them to come up with actionable intelligence and taking those actions is critical</p><p>Use AI for large datasets: Automation creates efficiency and efficiency creates high RoI. AI is the most powerful tool we have today to automate insights. While humans are good at building the rubrics, AI is the best way to deploy it in a repeatable and sustainable manner</p><p>AI can augment humans, not replace them: Customer service at the end is a relationship game. AI cannot build meaningful emotional relationships. We need humans for that. Furthermore, AI is a capability, not something that can take accountability for actions and results. AI helped our frontlines sales team but could never replace them.</p>",

      "content": "<p><strong>Introduction: The AI Boom Needs Order</strong></p><p>A few years back producing a decent AI-generated image was quite a struggle. Google expert Matilde shared how she had to sift through countless bad results during testing. The best outcomes ended up looking like a \"Francis Bacon painting and at worst, like scenes from John Carpenter movies.\" Now, it's possible to create amazing high-quality images within seconds. This huge improvement shows how fast Generative AI is advancing across different industries. Companies are leaping on this AI-driven opportunity using tools like chatbots and AI agents to innovate and work smarter.</p><p>But the fast use of these tools creates tough and confusing problems. Every added AI agent brings its own security risks sudden expenses, and control problems. In this messy situation, companies need someone to take charge. , the key might already be in place. Many organizations own a vital tool called the API Gateway. This article explains four powerful ways this gateway can serve as the main control system to manage your generative AI plans.</p><p><strong>1. Treat Your API Gateway Like Your AI Security Guard</strong></p><p>It gives you a single steady checkpoint to protect against a new wave of AI-related risks.</p><p>As businesses add more AI tools and chatbots, they end up introducing a large number of new APIs. Managing this growing API surface requires a unified approach to keep everything under control.</p><p>Large language models function as APIs, and the more LLMs you use, the more APIs you are working with, it grows , you will need to organize all of it in one central system.</p><p>The rise of AI brings new and unique dangers, as highlighted by the OWASP Top 10 for LLMs such as prompt injection and improper output. One striking example shows how this can happen. A chatbot denies an attacker direct database access at first. However when the attacker asks the AI to create code that allows access, the AI does as requested. This is a clear case of  where the attacker alters the LLM's commands causing  like harmful code that defeats the original security measures. Trying to protect each individual chatbot is both inconsistent and ineffective. When you use an API gateway such as Apigee along with a tool like Model Armor, you set up one central point to apply security rules and protect all your AI apps from threats. This gateway serves as the main defense, like a guard watching over the boundary. It seems there is no content included for me to paraphrase. Could you please provide the original text, so I can rephrase it while following your guidelines?</p><p><strong>2. Prevent Sensitive Information From Leaking Early</strong></p><p><em>Take on the role of a compliance officer by removing sensitive details before they get to the model.</em></p><p>Businesses often face a big issue when users enter private details such as phone numbers, email addresses, or other types of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) into AI chatbots. If there are no safety measures in place, this kind of data might get stored used during model training, or shared later, leading to serious privacy and compliance concerns.</p><p>The best approach is to use an API gateway to check and clean user inputs before sending them to a Large Language Model. In one example, a user typed a message saying, “Can you remember my email address and the telephone number that I have on my J application?” An Apigee policy caught this and hid the private details before passing it along. This kind of data masking matters because it keeps both users and companies safe by stopping sensitive details from ever reaching AI systems in the backend. Along with blocking threats, the gateway also acts like a rule enforcer making sure no sensitive info goes where it shouldn’t.</p><p><strong>3. Combine Several AI Models to Cut Costs and Work Better</strong></p><p><em>Create a smart routing system that optimizes cost and performance on its own, without needing manual control.</em></p><p>An API gateway does more than just handle security; it plays a big part in efficient operations and managing costs. One important approach is model routing where it decides which AI models to use based on set rules. For instance, a user might begin with a high-performing but pricey model such as Gemini Pro. After they hit a certain token limit, the gateway can switch them to a cheaper option like Gemini Flash.</p><p>One strong way to optimize is with semantic caching. It is much smarter than standard caching because it grasps what the user wants. For example, it can tell that \"How much does shipping to New York cost?\" and \"What are the NY delivery fees?\" mean the same thing. By doing this, it can provide a saved response and skip making an expensive and unnecessary request to the LLM.</p><p>These methods combine to build a flexible system focused on balancing costs and performance. They help businesses offer AI services at the best cost for each interaction, without making developers or users deal with the technical details.</p><p><strong>4. Make Your AI a Revenue-Generating Product</strong></p><p><em>Use well-tested strategies for APIs to turn your AI features from a costly tool into a money-making resource.</em></p><p>An API gateway lets businesses turn regular APIs into products they can sell. It can also apply the same idea to AI abilities. This shift changes AI from just being a helpful tool or expense into a controlled and money-making asset.</p><p>An API gateway allows businesses to turn AI into a product by offering the right level of control and visibility. It provides detailed insights using tools like token count tracking detailed analytics on which teams or individuals are using the AI, and rate-limiting features to balance workload. These tools create a strong base to guide important decisions letting companies charge internal departments based on their AI use. It also creates opportunities for external income by letting third parties access your unique AI agent through a developer portal that includes both documentation and usage analytics.</p><p><strong>Conclusion: From Disorder to Command</strong></p><p>An API gateway goes beyond being just infrastructure. It acts as the central control layer to manage the challenges of generative AI development. By providing a structured way to handle security and operations, it converts the potential disorder of growing AI usage into a manageable and safe system. It lets organizations innovate without losing control.</p><p>AI is becoming a major part of business operations. Are you managing it as as you do your most essential applications?</p>",

Every tutorial forces you to pick one, then spends 2000 words explaining why the other one is terrible.</p><p>Here's the thing though: this entire debate is pointless. You don't have to choose. There's a third option that gives you the best of both, and honestly, it's simpler than either approach on its own.</p><p>Let me show you what I mean.</p><h2>The JWT-Only Approach (and Why It's Dangerous)</h2><p>Most tutorials will show you something like this: \\n  </p><pre><code>// User logs in\nconst jwt = sign(\n  { userId: user.id, role: user.role }, \n  SECRET, \n  { expiresIn: '7d' }\n);\nsetCookie('token', jwt);\n\n// Every request\nconst payload = verify(req.cookies.token, SECRET);\n// Done. No database hit.\n</code></pre><p>This looks clean. No database queries. Any server can verify the token. Your auth is \"stateless\" (whatever that means).</p><p>But here's what actually happens in practice:</p><p>A user gets fired. The admin deletes their account from the database. Their JWT? Still valid for the next 7 days. They still have full access to your system whilst everyone thinks they're locked out.</p><p>Or this: You change someone's role from Admin to User. The JWT still says  for the next 7 days. The database is updated, but the token doesn't care.</p><p>Or my personal favourite: A user's laptop gets stolen and they want to log out of all devices. With JWTs alone, you can't do it. The tokens are out there in the wild, and they're valid until they expire. There's no \"logout all sessions\" button that actually works.</p><ul><li>Fast (0.97ms average response time, no database lookups)</li><li>High throughput (5,527 requests/sec under load)</li><li>But you can't revoke tokens</li><li>And the data goes stale immediately</li></ul><p>At small scale, maybe you don't care. But the moment you need to actually  who has access to your system? JWTs alone are a disaster.</p><h2>The Session-Only Approach (and Why It Doesn't Scale)</h2><p>Right, so JWTs are dangerous. Let's just use sessions: \\n  </p><pre><code>// User logs in\nconst sessionId = randomBytes(32).toString('hex');\nawait db.session.create({\n  id: sessionId,\n  userId: user.id,\n  expiresAt: new Date(Date.now() + 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000)\n});\nsetCookie('sessionId', sessionId);\n\n// Every request - database lookup\nconst session = await db.session.findUnique({\n  where: { id: req.cookies.sessionId },\n  include: { user: true }\n});\n\nif (!session || session.expiresAt &lt; new Date()) {\n  return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid session' });\n}\n</code></pre><p>This fixes all the JWT problems. Delete the session? User is logged out immediately. Change their role? Next request sees it. Perfect.</p><p>Here's the cost: every single request hits your database. Not most requests. Not some requests. </p><p>Your app makes 50 API calls to load the dashboard? That's 50 database queries just for auth checks. Before you even get to your actual business logic, you've already hammered your database 50 times.</p><ul><li>Instant revocation (delete from DB, user is logged out)</li><li>Fresh data (always reflects current state)</li><li>But every request costs 1.52ms in database latency</li><li>And your database becomes the bottleneck for everything</li></ul><p>I tested this. At 4,561 requests per second, the session-only approach was hitting the database with  just for auth checks. That's before your actual business logic runs. Your database will melt.</p><p>This approach works fine at small scale. But the moment you hit any real traffic, you've just made authentication the most expensive operation in your entire system.</p><p>Here's what's actually happening under the hood with each approach:</p><p>See the problem? JWT-only never touches the database (fast but dangerous). Session-only hits it every time (safe but slow). The hybrid approach only hits the database when the access token expires—about 1% of requests.</p><p>If you're thinking \"just use Redis instead of PostgreSQL for sessions,\" you're right—that's faster. Redis lookups are ~2-3ms instead of 5-20ms for PostgreSQL. But you're still hitting external infrastructure on every request, which is the core issue.</p><p>The hybrid approach below gives you JWT-speed (0.5ms, no network call) for 99% of requests, and only checks storage (Redis or PostgreSQL) when tokens expire. That's the key difference: frequency, not just speed.</p><p>Before I show you the solution, let's address the argument I always hear:</p><blockquote><p>\"But microservices! They don't share a database! JWTs let each service validate tokens independently!\"</p></blockquote><p>Look at your microservices architecture. Actually look at it. \\n  </p><pre><code>User Service     → PostgreSQL\nOrder Service    → PostgreSQL  \nPayment Service  → PostgreSQL\nProduct Service  → PostgreSQL\n</code></pre><p>Your services already share:</p><ul><li>The database (or database cluster)</li></ul><p>So why exactly can't auth share Redis? If you've got Redis for caching (which you do), session validation takes 2-3ms. That's fast, sure. But the hybrid approach below gives you 0.5ms response times by skipping even that network call 99% of the time.</p><p>The real reason people use JWTs? They read one article that said \"JWTs are stateless and scalable\" and never questioned it. Bottom line is: if you have Redis, the \"distributed systems need JWTs\" argument falls apart.</p><h2>The Solution: Short Access Tokens + Long Refresh Tokens</h2><p>Here's what I actually use: short-lived access tokens (JWTs) backed by long-lived refresh tokens (sessions in the database).</p><p>It's not JWT  Sessions. It's JWT  Sessions, each doing what they're good at.</p><pre><code>// User logs in\nasync function login(email, password) {\n  const user = await authenticateUser(email, password);\n\n  // Refresh token - stored in database (lasts 30 days)\n  const refreshToken = randomBytes(32).toString('hex');\n  await db.session.create({\n    userId: user.id,\n    refreshToken: refreshToken,\n    expiresAt: new Date(Date.now() + 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000)\n  });\n\n  // Access token - NOT stored, just a JWT (lasts 15 minutes)\n  const accessToken = jwt.sign(\n    { userId: user.id, role: user.role },\n    SECRET,\n    { expiresIn: '15m' }\n  );\n\n  res.cookie('accessToken', accessToken, { httpOnly: true });\n  res.cookie('refreshToken', refreshToken, { httpOnly: true });\n}\n</code></pre><p>Let me show you how this flows in practice:</p><p>The key insight: most requests take the fast path (top). Only when the access token expires do you hit the database to validate the refresh token and issue a fresh access token with updated user data.</p><p>Now here's what the protect middleware looks like: \\n  </p><pre><code>async function protect(req, res, next) {\n  const { accessToken, refreshToken } = req.cookies;\n\n  try {\n    // Fast path - verify access token (no database)\n    const payload = jwt.verify(accessToken, SECRET);\n    req.userId = payload.userId;\n    return next();\n\n  } catch (err) {\n    // Access token expired - check refresh token (database lookup)\n    if (!refreshToken) {\n      return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Not authenticated' });\n    }\n\n    const session = await db.session.findUnique({\n      where: { refreshToken },\n      include: { user: true }\n    });\n\n    if (!session || session.expiresAt &lt; new Date()) {\n      return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Session expired' });\n    }\n\n    // Issue new access token\n    const newAccessToken = jwt.sign(\n      { userId: session.userId, role: session.user.role },\n      SECRET,\n      { expiresIn: '15m' }\n    );\n\n    res.cookie('accessToken', newAccessToken, { httpOnly: true });\n    req.userId = session.userId;\n    return next();\n  }\n}\n</code></pre><p> verify the access token and skip the database entirely. Fast.</p><p> (when the 15-minute token expires) hit the database to validate the refresh token and issue a new access token. Controlled.</p><p>User gets fired? Delete their refresh token. Their current access token works for max 15 minutes, then they're locked out. That's not instant, but it's way better than 7 days.</p><p>Role changed? When the access token expires (15 minutes max), the new one includes fresh data from the database.</p><p>Want to log out all devices? Delete all refresh tokens for that user. Every device loses access within 15 minutes.</p><h3>What About High-Security Scenarios?</h3><p>For most applications, the 15-minute window is fine. But if you're building something where instant revocation is critical (banking, healthcare, admin panels), you have options:</p><p>**Option 1: Shorter access tokens\n\\  \\n  Use 5-minute or even 1-minute access tokens. More frequent refresh checks, but still way better than hitting the DB on every request.</p><p>**Option 2: Redis blacklist\n\\  \\n  Maintain a blacklist of revoked access tokens in Redis. Check it on every request: \\n  </p><pre><code>async function protect(req, res, next) {\n  const { accessToken } = req.cookies;\n\n  try {\n    const payload = jwt.verify(accessToken, SECRET);\n\n    // Check blacklist (Redis is fast, ~1ms)\n    const isBlacklisted = await redis.get(`blacklist:${payload.jti}`);\n    if (isBlacklisted) {\n      return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Token revoked' });\n    }\n\n    req.userId = payload.userId;\n    return next();\n  } catch (err) {\n    // ... refresh token flow\n  }\n}\n</code></pre><p>This trades some performance (1ms Redis check on every request) for instant revocation. You're still not hitting PostgreSQL, and Redis can handle way more load than your database.</p><ul><li>Most apps: 15-minute window is fine</li><li>Financial/Healthcare: 5-minute tokens or Redis blacklist</li><li>Admin panels: 1-minute tokens</li></ul><p>| Approach | Response Time | Req/sec | DB Queries/sec | Revoke Access? | Fresh Data? |\n|----|----|----|----|----|----|\n| JWT-only | 0.97ms | 5,527 | 0 | ❌ No (7 days) | ❌ Stale (7 days) |\n| Session-only | 1.52ms | 4,561 | 4,561 | ✅ Instant | ✅ Always |\n| Hybrid | 0.51ms | 5,494 | ~0 | ✅ 15 min max | ✅ 15 min max |</p><p>Let's make this concrete. Say your app handles 5,000+ requests per second:</p><p>The hybrid approach gives you 99% of JWT's performance with session's security. That's not a compromise—it's getting the best of both.</p><p>I ran these benchmarks on PostgreSQL with 100 concurrent connections. Here's what actually happened:</p><p><strong>Single request performance:</strong></p><ul><li>Session-only: 1.52ms average</li></ul><p>The hybrid approach is actually  than JWT-only because the access token verification is so lightweight. No database connection overhead. No query execution. Just JWT validation.</p><p><strong>Under load (5,000+ requests/sec):</strong></p><ul><li>JWT-only: 5,527 req/sec, 0 database queries</li><li>Hybrid: 5,494 req/sec, ~0 database queries (99%+ fast path)</li><li>Session-only: 4,561 req/sec, 4,561 database queries/sec</li></ul><p>See the problem? Session-only turns your auth system into a database bottleneck. Every single request waits on the database before it can do anything useful.</p><p>Use the hybrid approach for pretty much everything. Seriously. Unless you have a specific reason not to, this is the pattern.</p><p>Use JWT-only if tokens are extremely short-lived (&lt; 5 minutes) and you genuinely don't care about revocation. This is rare.</p><p>Use session-only if your app gets less than 10 requests per second total and you want to keep things simple.</p><p>That's it. You don't have to pick sides. Get the speed of JWTs with the control of sessions. It's not complicated, it just requires actually thinking about the trade-offs instead of cargo-culting whatever approach you read about first.</p>",

      "content": "<p>When writers think about LaTeX, they think about academic papers. Dense research documents filled with equations, citations, and footnotes. They don’t think about fantasy novels, thriller manuscripts, or literary fiction.</p><p>That’s a missed opportunity.</p><p>LaTeX—the typesetting system beloved by mathematicians and scientists—offers creative writers something word processors can’t match: programmable consistency. The same features that let physicists define custom notation for quantum equations let novelists define custom styling for character dialogue, narrative voices, and recurring textual elements. Once you see what’s possible, you might wonder why more fiction authors haven’t discovered this tool.</p><p>If you’re unfamiliar with LaTeX (pronounced “LAH-tek” or “LAY-tek”), here’s a quick orientation. Unlike Microsoft Word or Google Docs, where you see your document as it will appear while you write, LaTeX separates content from presentation. You write in a plain text file with markup commands, then “compile” that file into a beautifully formatted PDF.</p><p>Think of it like HTML for print documents. You write \\textbf{bold text} instead of clicking a bold button, and \\textit{italic text} instead of pressing Ctrl+I. This might sound like extra work—and initially, it is. But the payoff comes from what this approach enables: custom commands that automate repetitive formatting across an entire manuscript.</p><p>The PDF files LaTeX produces aren’t just “good enough”—they’re professionally typeset. LaTeX’s algorithms handle kerning, ligatures, and hyphenation with sophistication that consumer word processors can’t match. The difference is subtle but cumulative: text that’s easier to read, margins that feel balanced, typography that signals quality before anyone reads a word.</p><p>Here’s where LaTeX becomes genuinely exciting for fiction writers: custom commands.</p><p>Imagine you’re writing a novel with an omniscient narrator whose voice appears in italics, distinguished from the close third-person perspective of your main chapters. In Word, you’d select each narrator passage and apply italic formatting manually. If you later decide the narrator’s voice should be in a different font rather than italics, you’d need to find every single passage and change it—a tedious, error-prone process in a full-length manuscript.</p><p>In LaTeX, you define a command once:</p><blockquote><p>\\newcommand{\\narrator}[1]{\\textit{#1}}</p></blockquote><p>Then throughout your manuscript, you write:</p><blockquote><p>\\narrator{The town had seen better days, though no one alive could remember them.}</p></blockquote><p>Every narrator passage uses the same command. If you decide midway through drafting—or during revision, or after feedback from beta readers—that the narrator should use a serif font instead of italics, you change the definition once:</p><blockquote><p>\\newcommand{\\narrator}[1]{{\\fontfamily{ptm}\\selectfont #1}}</p></blockquote><p>Recompile, and every narrator passage in your entire manuscript updates instantly. No hunting, no missed instances, no inconsistencies.</p><h2>Practical Applications for Fiction</h2><h3>Character Names and Spelling Consistency</h3><p>Fantasy and science fiction authors face a particular challenge: complex character and location names that are easy to misspell. Is it “Vaeloria” or “Vealoria”? “Khal’thros” or “Khalthros”? Across a 100,000-word manuscript, maintaining perfect consistency is exhausting.</p><p>LaTeX offers an elegant solution. Define your names as commands:</p><blockquote><p>\\\n  \\\n  \\newcommand{\\elfgirl}{Vaeloria}\\newcommand{\\darkfortress}{Khal’thros}\\newcommand{\\magicsword}{Dawnbreaker}</p></blockquote><p>Now you write \\elfgirl instead of “Vaeloria” throughout your manuscript. You’ll never misspell it because you’re not typing it—the command handles the actual name. If you decide during revision that “Vaeloria” should become “Vaeleryn,” you change the definition once and every instance updates.</p><p>This approach also makes find-and-replace operations surgical. Searching for \\elfgirl finds only the character references you defined—not fragments of other words that happen to contain the same letters.</p><p>Many novels include styled text elements: letters, documents, text messages, dreams, flashbacks, or internal monologue. Each might have distinct formatting. In Word, you’d create paragraph styles—but those styles can’t accept arguments or nest within other content easily.</p><p>LaTeX commands can handle complex formatting with parameters:</p><blockquote><p>\\newcommand{\\textmessage}[2]{\\begin{quote}\\texttt{\\textbf{#1:} #2}\\end{quote}}</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\\textmessage{Sarah}{Running late. Don’t start without me.}</p></blockquote><p>Every text message in your manuscript will be formatted identically: indented, in monospace font, with the sender’s name bolded. Change the definition, change every text message at once.</p><h3>Multiple Narrative Voices</h3><p>Novels with multiple point-of-view characters can use custom commands to maintain distinct formatting for each voice:</p><blockquote><p>\\newcommand{\\povmarcus}[1]{\\section*{Marcus}#1}\\newcommand{\\povlena}[1]{\\section*{Lena}\\textit{#1}}</p></blockquote><p>If Marcus’s chapters are in standard text and Lena’s in italics, the formatting stays consistent automatically—and can be adjusted globally at any time.</p><p>Custom commands are LaTeX’s most immediately useful feature for creative writers, but other capabilities deserve mention.</p><p><strong>Automatic cross-references:</strong> Label any chapter, section, or location in your manuscript, then reference it by label. If chapter numbers change during revision, references update automatically.</p><p> LaTeX’s typesetting algorithms produce more readable text through intelligent hyphenation, proper kerning, and optimal line breaks. Readers may not consciously notice, but the cumulative effect is text that feels more polished.</p><p> With the hyperref package, LaTeX generates PDFs with clickable tables of contents, cross-references, and bookmarks—features that require manual setup in word processors.</p><p> Your manuscript exists as plain text, which means it works seamlessly with version control systems like Git. Track every change, create experimental branches, maintain complete revision history—capabilities I discussed in my previous article on developer tools for writers.</p><h2>AI Makes LaTeX Accessible</h2><p>Here’s the practical reality: you don’t need to memorize LaTeX syntax to use these features effectively.</p><p>Modern AI assistants like Claude or ChatGPT can generate LaTeX custom commands from plain English descriptions. Tell the AI what you want—”I need a command that formats text messages with the sender’s name in bold, the message in a gray box, and a timestamp in small text”—and it will produce working LaTeX code. You copy the command definition into your document, then use it throughout your manuscript.</p><p>This dramatically lowers the barrier to entry. You don’t need to understand the intricacies of LaTeX to benefit from its power. You need to understand what you want, describe it clearly, and let AI handle the technical implementation. When something doesn’t work quite right, describe the problem and ask for adjustments.</p><p>LaTeX isn’t for everyone, and honesty requires acknowledging its drawbacks.</p><p><strong>The learning curve is real.</strong> Even with AI assistance, you’ll spend time learning basic LaTeX structure, understanding how to compile documents, and troubleshooting when things go wrong. Expect several hours of orientation before you’re comfortable.</p><p><strong>Collaboration can be challenging.</strong> If your editor or co-author uses Word, you’ll need to convert your LaTeX file for them to review—and their tracked changes won’t automatically flow back into your LaTeX source. This is a workflow friction that traditional word processors don’t impose.</p><p><strong>Traditional submission requirements persist.</strong> Most literary agents and publishers expect .doc or .docx files. While tools like Pandoc can convert LaTeX to Word format, complex custom commands may require manual adjustment. LaTeX works best for self-publishing workflows or as a drafting environment with conversion at the submission stage.</p><p><strong>No real-time formatting preview.</strong> You write in plain text, then compile to see the result. Some writers find this separation liberating—it keeps you focused on words rather than fiddling with fonts. Others find it frustrating. Your preference likely depends on how you’re wired.</p><p>If you’re curious about trying LaTeX for creative writing, here’s a practical path forward.</p><p><strong>First, install a LaTeX distribution.</strong> On Windows, MiKTeX is popular. On Mac, MacTeX. On Linux, TeX Live. These are free and include everything you need to compile documents.</p><p><strong>Second, choose an editor.</strong> TeXstudio provides a dedicated LaTeX environment with syntax highlighting and one-click compilation. Alternatively, Visual Studio Code with the LaTeX Workshop extension works well and integrates with other development tools.</p><p><strong>Third, start with a template.</strong> Don’t build a manuscript structure from scratch. Find a fiction manuscript template online or use a minimal starting document, then modify it for your needs.</p><p><strong>Fourth, define your first custom command.</strong> Pick something simple—a character name you use frequently or a basic formatting style. Write a few pages using the command. Experience the workflow before committing to an entire manuscript.</p><p><strong>Finally, use AI as your LaTeX tutor.</strong> When you want a custom command but don’t know the syntax, ask. When compilation fails, paste the error message and ask for help. The learning curve flattens dramatically when you have an always-available teacher.</p><p>LaTeX occupies a strange position in the writer’s toolkit—familiar to academics, invisible to most fiction authors. That invisibility is understandable. The tool’s reputation as technical and specialized discourages exploration. Why would a novelist use software designed for scientific papers?</p><p>The answer is custom commands: the ability to define once and apply everywhere, to maintain perfect consistency across hundreds of pages, to change your mind about formatting and implement that change in seconds rather than hours. For writers managing complex manuscripts with multiple voices, intricate naming conventions, or distinctive styled elements, these capabilities solve real problems.</p><p>Not every writer needs this. If you’re happy with Word or Scrivener, if your manuscripts don’t involve complex formatting requirements, there’s no reason to switch. The learning investment wouldn’t pay off.</p><p>But if you’ve ever lost hours to find-and-replace operations, if you’ve ever struggled to maintain consistent formatting across a long manuscript, if you’ve ever wished you could automate the tedious parts of document preparation—LaTeX might deserve a closer look. The tool doesn’t care that you’re writing fiction instead of physics. It just sees text, and gives you remarkably precise control over how that text appears.</p><p>Sometimes the best tools for creative work come from unexpected places.</p>",

      "content": "<p>\\\nSuppose a social media platform’s Ads analytics team wants to know: Does seeing a certain ad (or promoted post) cause users to convert or engage more? This causal question is tricky because users who see the ad might inherently differ from those who&nbsp;don’t. In practice, simply comparing conversion rates of exposed vs. unexposed users can be very misleading. Ad exposure is not randomly assigned – algorithms may show ads more to highly active users, or users self-select into seeing or clicking ads. As a result, “unobservable factors make exposure endogenous,” meaning there are hidden biases in who sees the ad. Ideally,&nbsp;we’d&nbsp;run a randomized controlled trial (RCT) (e.g.&nbsp;hold out a control group who never sees the ad) to measure the causal effect. But often RCTs&nbsp;aren’t&nbsp;feasible&nbsp;for broad ad campaigns. This is where propensity score matching (PSM) comes in –&nbsp;it’s&nbsp;basically a&nbsp;statistical way to create apples-to-apples comparisons when you&nbsp;can’t&nbsp;run a proper A/B test.</p><p>In this article,&nbsp;we’ll&nbsp;walk through how a data scientist in a social media Ads division can use propensity scores to estimate the impact of ad exposure on user conversion.&nbsp;We’ll&nbsp;use a simulated dataset of users with information like age, prior engagement, and device type, and&nbsp;we’ll&nbsp;demonstrate&nbsp;how to:</p><ul><li>Estimate each user’s propensity (likelihood) of seeing the ad based on their characteristics.</li><li>Match ad-exposed users to similar unexposed users using these propensity scores.</li><li>Check covariate balance with a before-and-after comparison (including a table of covariate differences and a balance plot).</li><li>Estimate the difference in conversion rates attributable to ad exposure on the matched sample.</li><li>Discuss key assumptions, limitations, and where propensity score methods fit in the broader causal inference toolbox.</li></ul><h2>Propensity Scores: Mimicking a Randomized Experiment</h2><p>In an RCT, random assignment of exposure would ensure the exposed and control groups are statistically equivalent (on both observed and unobserved factors) before the treatment. Propensity scores aim to mimic that balance using observational data. Formally, the propensity score is defined as the probability of treatment assignment (here, ad exposure) conditional on&nbsp;observed&nbsp;covariates. In plain terms, it’s&nbsp;each user’s predicted likelihood of seeing the ad given their profile (age, engagement, device, etc.). By matching or adjusting on this single score, we ideally achieve a situation as if we had randomized who sees the ad. Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) showed that the propensity score is a “balancing score” – conditional on users having the same score, their observed covariates should be balanced between exposed and unexposed groups.</p><p>How do we estimate propensity scores? The most common approach is to train a logistic regression model to predict the probability of receiving&nbsp;the treatment&nbsp;based on covariates. In our case,&nbsp;we’ll&nbsp;model the probability a user was&nbsp;shown&nbsp;the ad as a function of their attributes. (More complex machine learning models like random forests or gradient boosting could also be used for propensity estimation, especially if there are nonlinearities, but logistic regression is a good starting point.) Each user then gets a score between 0 and 1 – for example,&nbsp;a very active&nbsp;25-year-old mobile user might have an 80% predicted chance of seeing the ad,&nbsp;whereas&nbsp;a less engaged older desktop user might have only 10%.</p><p>Why not just&nbsp;control for&nbsp;the covariates directly? In principle, you could run a regression of conversion on ad exposure plus all the covariates. That is another valid approach, and in fact propensity score methods are asymptotically equivalent to regression adjustment under certain conditions. The advantage of propensity scores is primarily in diagnostics and study design: PSM forces you to check balance and overlap between groups before looking at outcomes. It helps illustrate whether you have comparable groups,&nbsp;whereas&nbsp;a straight regression might mask a lack of overlap or extrapolate into regions with no data. In short, propensity score matching tackles selection bias head-on by explicitly pairing or weighting users to create a&nbsp;pseudo-experiment.</p><h2>Data Setup: Simulating an Ad Exposure Scenario</h2><p>To make this concrete,&nbsp;let’s&nbsp;simulate a dataset for our social media platform scenario. Imagine we have 1,000 users with the following characteristics:</p><ul><li><p>Ad Exposure (treatment): A binary indicator of whether the user was exposed to a particular ad campaign (1 = saw the ad, 0 = did not see the ad). In our&nbsp;simulation&nbsp;~30% of users get exposed, but importantly, this is not random.</p></li><li><p>Age: User age in years (ranging from 18 to 65 in our simulated data).</p></li><li><p>Prior Engagement: A score or count&nbsp;representing&nbsp;the user’s recent engagement on the platform. For example, this could be the number of posts/interactions last week on a 0–10 scale (0 = not engaged, 10 = highly engaged).</p></li><li><p>Device: A categorical variable for primary device used (we’ll&nbsp;simplify to&nbsp;Mobile vs. Desktop).&nbsp;Let’s&nbsp;say about 70% of users use&nbsp;mobile.</p></li></ul><p>\\\nWe construct the exposure in a biased way:&nbsp;we’ll&nbsp;assume the platform’s ad delivery algorithm tends to show the ad more to certain users. Specifically,&nbsp;younger&nbsp;and highly engaged users on mobile are more likely to be exposed to the ad. This reflects a real-world scenario,&nbsp;perhaps the&nbsp;ad campaign targets active mobile users, or active users simply spend more time and thus have more chance to see the ad. In our simulation, the probability of exposure is generated by a logistic model:</p><p>with&nbsp;coefficients chosen such&nbsp;that indeed&nbsp;higher engagement and mobile usage increase the odds of exposure, while age has a&nbsp;slight&nbsp;negative effect (older users&nbsp;slightly&nbsp;less likely to see the ad). We&nbsp;won’t&nbsp;go into the code here but suffice it to say our simulation intentionally builds in confounding: exposed and unexposed users will have different covariate profiles on average.</p><p>After simulating, we fit a logistic regression to estimate each user’s propensity score (using age, engagement, device as predictors and ad exposure as the target). This gives us a propensity score for every user –&nbsp;basically the&nbsp;model’s guess of how likely that user would be treated, given their traits. Now, before matching,&nbsp;it’s&nbsp;wise to check the distribution of propensity scores in the treated vs. control groups. This helps assess&nbsp;common support&nbsp;– do the groups have overlapping score ranges, or are they totally separated? If there is no overlap (e.g.&nbsp;all treated have higher scores than all control), then no amount of matching can salvage the comparison. In our data, we do see considerable overlap: many users have moderate propensity values regardless of actual exposure, though the exposed group skews higher on average.</p><p>\\\nThe histogram above shows the propensity score distributions for the two groups. The blue bars (unexposed controls) are more concentrated at lower scores (left side),&nbsp;indicating&nbsp;many unexposed users had a low likelihood of being shown the ad. The orange bars (exposed group) skew more to the right – these users often had profile characteristics giving them a higher chance of exposure. Crucially, the two distributions overlap significantly in the middle range. This overlap means we should be able to find, for many treated users, at least one untreated user with a similar propensity score. Those are the matches that will form our balanced comparison set. (If there were exposed users with propensity scores higher than any control – an off-support region –&nbsp;we’d&nbsp;have to exclude those from the analysis because we have no comparable control for them.)</p><h2>Matching Exposed and Unexposed Users</h2><p>With propensity scores in hand, we&nbsp;proceed&nbsp;to match users who saw the ad with users who did not, aiming to pair individuals with similar scores. There are several matching strategies in practice:</p><ul><li>Nearest-neighbor&nbsp;Matching: for each treated user, find an untreated user with the closest propensity score.</li><li>Caliper&nbsp;Matching: only match treated-control pairs if their score difference is below some threshold (caliper), discarding treated units that&nbsp;don’t&nbsp;have a close enough control.</li><li>One-to-many&nbsp;Matching:&nbsp;matches&nbsp;each treated user with multiple controls (or vice versa) to&nbsp;utilize&nbsp;more data, often weighted in analysis.</li><li>With or without replacement: controls could be reused for multiple treated matches (with replacement) or each control used at most once (without replacement).</li></ul><p>For simplicity, our example uses 1:1 nearest-neighbor matching without replacement: each ad-exposed user is matched to one unique unexposed user with the most similar propensity score. We ended up matching 316 exposed users to 316 unexposed users, and those 316 pairs form our matched sample (about 63% of the original 1,000 users). Users who&nbsp;didn’t&nbsp;get matched (e.g.&nbsp;some of the lowest-propensity controls and a few highest-propensity treated, if any) are set aside. This kind of matching trades off sample size for&nbsp;quality of&nbsp;comparison – we prefer to drop some data if it means the remaining pairs are apples-to-apples.</p><p>Now, the critical question&nbsp;–&nbsp;Did matching&nbsp;balance&nbsp;our covariates? We need to verify that in the matched sample, the exposed and control groups look similar in terms of age, engagement, and device. A common diagnostic is to examine the standardized mean difference (SMD) for each covariate before and after matching –&nbsp;essentially the&nbsp;difference in means between groups, scaled by the pooled standard deviation. As a rule of thumb, an absolute SMD below 0.1 is considered a negligible difference (i.e.&nbsp;good&nbsp;balance). We can also just look at the raw means/proportions to get an intuition. The table below summarizes our covariate balance:</p><p>\\\nWe can visualize the improvement in balance using a love plot (covariate balance plot). Below, each covariate’s imbalance is plotted as a point (the absolute standardized difference between groups) before and after matching:</p><p>As the love plot shows, propensity score matching achieved&nbsp;much&nbsp;better balance on the observed covariates. This gives us more confidence that when we compare outcomes between the matched exposed vs. unexposed users,&nbsp;we’re&nbsp;drawing a fair comparison that&nbsp;isn’t&nbsp;driven by pre-existing differences (at least not the observed ones we adjusted for). In our example, mobile device usage still has an absolute SMD around 0.14 post-match, a bit above the 0.1 target – this is a sign that our matching&nbsp;wasn’t&nbsp;perfect for that covariate. In practice, one might address this by trying a caliper (to force closer matches on propensity) or including device in a&nbsp;subsequent&nbsp;outcome&nbsp;regression as an&nbsp;additional&nbsp;adjuster (a technique sometimes called “double adjustment”).</p><p>Finally, we can measure the impact of ad exposure on the user outcome of interest – say conversion rate (perhaps the&nbsp;probability of clicking the ad or making a purchase). In our simulated data,&nbsp;we’ll&nbsp;assume a scenario where, on average, the ad does have a positive effect on conversion. To make it concrete, suppose the true causal effect is that the ad increases the conversion probability by 5 percentage points (we built this into the simulation). However, because exposure was confounded with engagement, a naïve comparison of conversion rates in the raw data would overstate the effect.&nbsp;Let’s&nbsp;see what the numbers look like:</p><ul><li>Unmatched data: Among all users who saw the ad, the conversion rate was 23.7%, compared to 12.9% for those who&nbsp;didn’t&nbsp;see the ad.&nbsp;That’s&nbsp;a&nbsp;+10.8-percentage&nbsp;point difference. If one naively took this at face value,&nbsp;you’d&nbsp;think the ad was hugely effective. But remember, the exposed group&nbsp;contained&nbsp;more highly engaged users, who were&nbsp;likely converting&nbsp;at higher rates even without the ad.</li><li>Matched data: In the propensity score matched sample, the exposed users had a 23.7% conversion rate, while their matched unexposed counterparts had about a 15.2% conversion rate.&nbsp;That’s&nbsp;a&nbsp;+8.5-percentage&nbsp;point lift attributable to the ad in the matched sample.&nbsp;This is notably lower than the naive 10.8 points, reflecting the fact that some of the originally observed gap was due to differences in user characteristics.&nbsp;We’re&nbsp;closer to the true effect (which we set as 5% in the simulation), though in this&nbsp;run&nbsp;our matched estimate is still a bit high, likely because that residual device imbalance and any random noise can still bias us upward.</li></ul><p>The key point is that propensity score matching moved us in the right direction – it reduced the bias in our estimate of the&nbsp;ad’s&nbsp;effect. By comparing only comparable users, we got a more realistic estimate of how much conversion uplift the ad exposure&nbsp;causes. In real&nbsp;analyses, you&nbsp;wouldn’t&nbsp;know the “ground truth” effect, but you would see that after matching, the exposed vs. control outcome difference changed (often it shrinks, as in our case). This gives you a sense that selection bias was indeed&nbsp;present&nbsp;and PSM helped adjust for it.</p><p>One should also compute confidence intervals or perform statistical tests on the matched difference, but those details are beyond our scope here. Additionally, if some exposed users had to be dropped due to no matches (lack of&nbsp;common support),&nbsp;you’d&nbsp;technically be estimating the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT).&nbsp;In our case, since&nbsp;almost all&nbsp;exposed&nbsp;were matched, ATT and ATE are about the same. Just keep in mind what population your causal estimate applies to.</p><h2>Assumptions and Limitations of Propensity Score Matching&nbsp;(PSM)</h2><p>PSM is a powerful technique, but it comes with important assumptions and limitations that any data scientist should be aware of:</p><ul><li>Observed Covariates Only (No Hidden Bias): Propensity scores can only account for variables you included and measured. This is often&nbsp;stated&nbsp;as the “no unmeasured confounders” or “conditional independence” assumption&nbsp;– essentially, you&nbsp;assume that after&nbsp;controlling for&nbsp;the observed covariates, treatment assignment is&nbsp;as good as random. If&nbsp;there’s&nbsp;some unmeasured factor strongly influencing both ad exposure and conversion (e.g.&nbsp;maybe only particularly savvy users both see the ad and convert), PSM&nbsp;can’t&nbsp;help you there. In our simulation, we included all the confounders in the model by design. In a real scenario, you&nbsp;must&nbsp;think hard about what variables might affect both exposure and outcome and make sure to include them in the propensity model. If you miss a big one, your causal estimates may still be biased.</li><li>Model Specification: Even for&nbsp;observed&nbsp;covariates, you&nbsp;must&nbsp;specify the propensity model correctly (e.g.&nbsp;include&nbsp;appropriate interaction&nbsp;terms or nonlinear terms if needed). A mis-specified model might yield propensity scores that&nbsp;don’t&nbsp;fully balance the covariates. Diagnostics like checking each covariate’s balance (as we did) help to reveal if your model was adequate. If not, you may&nbsp;iterate on&nbsp;the model (add polynomial terms, interactions, or use a more flexible ML model) until balance is achieved.</li><li>Common Support and Overlap: As noted&nbsp;earlier, PSM requires that for each treated unit, there are similar control units (and vice versa, if targeting ATE). If your treated and control populations are too different with little score overlap, matching will either drop many samples or&nbsp;fail to&nbsp;find good pairs. In such cases, you might restrict your inference to a narrower subgroup or conclude that observational data&nbsp;can’t&nbsp;answer this question without stronger assumptions. Always inspect propensity distributions and consider&nbsp;trimming off&nbsp;regions that lack overlap.</li><li>Sample Size: You&nbsp;generally need&nbsp;a decent sample size to get reliable matches. If you only have a few hundred observations, matching algorithms might&nbsp;struggle,&nbsp;or your estimates might be very imprecise. In advertising measurement, where datasets are often large, this is usually less of an issue</li><li>Matching Choices and Data Use: The way you&nbsp;do matching&nbsp;can affect results. Using one control per treated (1:1) vs. 3:1 or 5:1 matching, with or without replacement, choosing a caliper – these are tuning parameters that involve trade-offs. For instance, allowing replacement means a particularly common type of control user might serve as&nbsp;match&nbsp;for multiple treated users (increasing precision but&nbsp;possibly overweighting&nbsp;that profile). A wider caliper (or no caliper) ensures more treated units get matched but with potentially worse quality matches. A tighter caliper improves match quality but at the cost of dropping more treated units. There is no one-size-fits-all; it requires some experimentation and domain judgment. The good practice is to report how many observations were dropped due to matching and test that different reasonable choices&nbsp;don’t&nbsp;wildly change the estimate.</li><li>Residual Confounding: Even after matching, as we saw with the device variable, some imbalance can remain. One solution is “double adjustment” –&nbsp;i.e.&nbsp;after matching, you can run a regression on the matched sample to adjust for any residual differences. Because the matched sample is already&nbsp;balanced, this regression is less dependent on model extrapolation and can correct minor imbalances. Another solution is weighting: if&nbsp;exact&nbsp;balance&nbsp;isn’t&nbsp;achieved, you might apply a small weight to some observations to fine-tune balance. These are advanced steps, but worth noting if you aim for the best possible adjustment.</li></ul><p>In summary, PSM is a tool, not magic. It shines when you have rich data on confounders and a scenario where randomization&nbsp;isn’t&nbsp;available. It lets you approximate an experiment and visibly&nbsp;demonstrate&nbsp;that your treatment and control groups are comparable&nbsp;on&nbsp;observed&nbsp;features. However, it&nbsp;doesn’t&nbsp;eliminate&nbsp;all bias – especially bias due to unobserved factors – and it requires careful implementation and validation. If the groups are fundamentally too different, even the fanciest matching&nbsp;won’t&nbsp;save the day. In those cases, you either need to gather more data,&nbsp;identify&nbsp;an instrumental variable, or consider a different study design.</p><p>Propensity score matching is just one approach among many for causal inference with observational data. It addresses one specific problem: how to deal with selection bias on observables by balancing covariates between treated and control groups.&nbsp;It’s&nbsp;worth situating this method in the broader context:</p><ul><li>Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs): Always the gold standard when&nbsp;feasible. If you can randomly hold out a set of users from seeing the ad (a true control group), do it! That directly solves the selection bias problem by design. Propensity score methods are&nbsp;generally a&nbsp;plan B for when RCTs or controlled experiments are not possible due to cost, ethics, or logistical constraints.</li><li>Other Propensity Score Methods: Matching is one way to use propensity scores, but you can also use them for stratification (e.g. divide users into propensity score quintiles and compare outcomes within each stratum), inverse probability weighting (IPW) (weigh each user by 1/(propensity) for treated or 1/(1–propensity) for controls to create a weighted pseudo-population), or as covariates in outcome regression (a form of doubly-robust adjustment). These all rely on the same underlying propensity model. Each method has its nuances – for instance, IPW can use all data but may yield large variance if some scores are&nbsp;very small&nbsp;or large,&nbsp;whereas&nbsp;matching discards some data but tends to improve covariate balance quite transparently.</li><li>Difference-in-Differences (DiD): If you have longitudinal data (before/after an intervention) for both treated and control groups,&nbsp;DiD&nbsp;is another technique to&nbsp;control for&nbsp;unobserved time-invariant differences by looking at changes over time. For example, if the ad campaign ran in April and you have user engagement in March (pre) and May (post) for those who saw vs.&nbsp;didn’t&nbsp;see the ad,&nbsp;DiD&nbsp;could be applied. It assumes trends would have been parallel without&nbsp;the treatment. This method answers a slightly different question (it needs time series data and a clear intervention period) and can complement propensity scores or be combined with them (e.g.&nbsp;propensity score matching plus&nbsp;DiD&nbsp;on matched pairs).</li><li>Instrumental Variables (IV): If&nbsp;there’s&nbsp;a variable that affects exposure but not directly the outcome (and not through confounders), it can serve as an instrument to tease out causal effects. In advertising, for example, random ad server load or some quasi-random targeting rule might act as an instrument. IV methods relax the “no unmeasured confounders” assumption but introduce their own strong assumptions (exclusion restriction). Propensity scores&nbsp;don’t&nbsp;directly help with IV –&nbsp;it’s&nbsp;an alternate approach when you can find a valid instrument.</li><li>Synthetic Controls and Geo Experiments: In cases of market-level or product-level interventions (not user-level), techniques like synthetic control (including Bayesian structural time series, etc.) are used. For instance, comparing regions where an ad campaign ran to similar regions where it&nbsp;didn’t, constructing a weighted combination of control regions to act as a counterfactual. These are more applicable to aggregate causal questions and again are separate from propensity scores (though conceptually also about finding comparable units).</li><li>Modern Machine Learning Causal Methods: There is a growing field of causal ML – methods like causal forests, uplift modeling, and double/debiased machine learning. Some of these extend the propensity score concept (e.g.&nbsp;using ML to estimate propensity or to predict counterfactual outcomes). The key for a data scientist is to understand the assumptions each method makes. Propensity score matching is grounded in traditional statistics but is very interpretable and, as we saw, easy to visualize for stakeholders (you can&nbsp;literally show&nbsp;the before/after balance).</li></ul><p>In our social media Ads context, propensity score matching&nbsp;provides&nbsp;a straightforward way to&nbsp;answer,&nbsp;“What is the causal effect of ad exposure on conversion?” when you&nbsp;can’t&nbsp;run a perfect A/B test. It allowed us to use observational logs of who saw the ad and who&nbsp;didn’t and&nbsp;construct a fair comparison to estimate lift. When used properly, PSM can yield estimates close to those from an experiment – but when used naively, or if important confounders are omitted, it can still lead to the wrong conclusions. As one study on Facebook ads&nbsp;demonstrated, observational methods often&nbsp;failed to&nbsp;match experimental results even with many covariates, underscoring the need for robust techniques and careful validation.</p><p>Propensity score matching is a valuable tool in the data scientist’s arsenal for causal inference. In our example, it helped&nbsp;adjust for&nbsp;biases in ad exposure and gave a more credible estimate of the ad’s impact on user conversions than a raw comparison would have. The process involved formulating a propensity model, matching users, and rigorously checking balance – steps that mirror the scientific rigor of a randomized experiment as much as possible in an observational setting.</p><p>We also highlighted that PSM is not a plug-and-play solution: it rests on assumptions of no hidden bias, requires sufficient data overlap, and only balances what you include in the model. It should be combined with domain knowledge (to choose covariates) and followed by transparent reporting of diagnostics – for example, always report covariate balance and how many users were dropped, so stakeholders can trust the analysis.</p><p>In the broader landscape, propensity scores are one approach to causal analysis among many. In a social media company’s analytics team, one might use PSM for some questions, difference-in-differences for others, or experimentation whenever possible. The common goal is to get closer to true causation and away from mere correlation. By using methods like PSM thoughtfully, data scientists can provide insights such as “Our best estimate is that this ad campaign caused about an 8-9 percentage point increase in conversion rate among the targeted users,” with evidence that&nbsp;they’ve&nbsp;adjusted for major biases. This kind of causal insight is far more actionable than saying “converted users saw the ad more often” (which is confounded).</p><p>In summary, propensity score matching allows us to approximate an RCT using observational data.&nbsp;It’s&nbsp;an excellent technique for anyone in analytics to understand, especially in fields like digital marketing where true experiments may be difficult to implement for every campaign. When you use PSM, be rigorous about your assumptions and checks.&nbsp;Used in the right circumstances, however, it can&nbsp;greatly enhance&nbsp;your ability to draw causal conclusions and make better data-driven decisions in a social media ads context and beyond.</p>",

Although exceptions have a bad name among many developers, a detailed analysis of how they work can greatly expand your understanding of how C++ really works. That's what we'll do!</p><p>Before diving into the depths of exceptions let pick a right angle to how they could possibly work. In general, there are two options: the  or via the .</p><p>Sorry, what? Indeed, we get off to a rough start. Let's try again.</p><p>We can create exceptions via tables and linked lists. Well… that doesn't help much either. Okay, once again.</p><p>The exception implementation may or may not follow the Itanium ABI. Damn, it's still unclear.</p><p>Yeah, folks, it's not so easy thing. Various platforms may implement exceptions in a different way. Even on the same platform, multiple approaches can coexist, and each has its own pros and cons. As it's said, \"How do you eat an elephant (poor creature)? One bite at a time!\" To keep from getting indigestion, we'll adhere to the same principle.</p><p>This article will highlight the Linux world. To avoid cluttering the internet with lengthy texts, we'll divide this article into several ones, each of which will be devoted to its own topic. At the beginning of the article, we'll add a table of contents with links to related sections. If it's not there, it means that we haven't made any new discoveries yet!</p><p>We'll discover other platforms in next articles when their time will come.</p><p>Each article would be accompanied with relevant code snippets scrutinized for details. Whenever possible, we'll base on the  library from LLVM, and in other cases, on  from GCC. To avert flooding with code snippets, we'll link directly to the relevant places in the repositories.</p><p>\"Hey, do you know the internet is crammed with texts about exceptions?\"</p><p>Yep, it's true. However, the author got the impression that most of these materials fall into two categories: overly technical descriptions that are more like specifications, or attempts—often quite successful ones—to manually implement exceptions from scratch.</p><p>Unfortunately, the author couldn't find a detailed examination of this mechanism with code references and its breadkown. Perhaps this series of articles will fill, what the author considers to be, a useful niche.</p><p>Let's add a little teaser so you don't close this article too quickly. We'll quickly describe how exceptions are implemented on Linux—just a couple of sentences. Don't be afraid, we'll give a detailed description afterwards.</p><p>Okay, we can create exceptions via generating extra code that runs inside  blocks or via generating metadata. In both cases, generation occurs when the source code is translated into the assembly language. Thus, the  block is transformed into a set of data structures and function calls. Their specific form depends on the chosen implementation approach.</p><p>When the exception is thrown, the control flow \"jumps\" from one place in the program to another. What unpopular mechanism of our beloved language provides arbitrary control flow jumps to specific locations? That's right, it's the good old . However, it won't help us with jumps outside the function, so we'll have to use its steroid-taking stepbrother, /<code>[longjmp](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/program/longjmp.html)</code>.</p><p>Before jumping somewhere, we should ask ourselves: \"Where to?\" We wouldn't want to be in the shoes of the famous traveler in unknown places from \"The Wizard of Oz\", right? To answer the question, we create a linked list, each element of which stores data about the frame context, such as the state of registers. We can search for the required  block by traversing this list.</p><p>This implementation is often called . Quite a fitting name, as the mechanism doesn't base on platform-specific tables. It instead depends on the / mechanism, which generally works in a similar way on all Unix-based platforms. We need to generate only the calls to the / functions—possibly even in the form of compiler intrinsics—and the mechanism implementing the linked list.</p><p>You might say, \"Hey, I'll have to call these functions even when I don't throw exceptions!\" Eh…yes? This surely increases the cost of program execution.</p><p>That's why the second approach—exceptions implemented via metadata—has become so widespread.</p><p>Metadata is commonly called <em>exception handling tables</em>, but the author prefers its former name. It better illustrates what is happening under the hood of this mechanism. The exception mechanism built on metadata is called <em>zero-cost exception handling</em>. Zero cost sounds tempting, doesn't it?</p><p>Instead of writing resource-intensive linked list, we create an exception handling table. We'll hardcode this table into stack frames that can handle exceptions or call destructors. All necessary data that has been previously placed in linked list nodes is now stored in these tables.</p><p>Zero-cost sounds riveting, following the control flow indicated by the exception throw involves extra overhead. At least, we need to call the destructors of stack variables because the C++ standard guarantees it. It won't be possible to catch a free ride and stop at the required station where the exception will be processed.</p><p>Still, throwing an exception is usually assumed to be, pardon the pun, an \"exceptional\" situation. What happens when the control flow follows the regular execution path? That's right, we don't spend extra resources on maintaining a linked list. \"Don't pay for what we don't use\" is an <a href=\"https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/Zero-overhead_principle.html\">old motto</a> among fans of our beloved language.</p><p>However, implementing exceptions through exception handling tables can lead to execution time pessimisation, even if exceptions are thrown rarely or not at all. This is a very important point that is very easy to overlook and even easier to mystify. We hope to return to the issue of pessimisation in other articles.</p><p>That's it for the brief overview of exception innards on Linux! It doesn't seem so scary. If you, dear reader, need more details (which we're sure is why you came here), let's keep going.</p><p>Let's start with the fact that exceptions are non-platform-dependent. They're compiler-dependent. Although the C++ standard clearly describes the rules for exceptions at the language level, language implementations are free to choose their own implementations of this mechanism.</p><p>Therefore, it seems reasonable to view the exception implementation as a layered system. So, what does our \"little onion\" consist of?</p><p>At the top, of course, sits the C++ standard that simply says, \"Take such a beautiful syntax, write , throw whatever you want—I guarantee you RAII and the order of destructor calls.\" How it works isn't important to the standard. What matters is what the end user, i.e. me, the developer, can and can't write!</p><p>Below the standard lies the so-called Itanium C++ ABI. We'll talk about why it's called that later. For now, just note that this layer consists of two others. The first one, let's call it , directly translates constructs from the C++ standard. In turn, the second layer is responsible for finding the necessary  block and calling the destructors of objects that are destroyed in the process. We can call this second layer —except for cases where language-specific constructs do occur there.</p><p>Now we need to find the place where the exception is delivered and call destructors during this delivery. The exact mechanism for that is called , when a certain system—in our case, the C++ runtime—scans through the low-level function representation (stack frames), going through them in reverse execution order. In the context of exceptions, this is implemented on Linux in two ways:  and . This is the last layer of our little onion.</p><p>So, shall we get into the details?</p><p>Friends, we believe in you and in humanity and assume that since you've come to read about the language innards, you're already familiar with that language. We won't describe the basics of using exceptions here, but if it turns out to be necessary, we'll write about it in a separate article and provide a link. For now, we suggest you read the description on <a href=\"https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/exceptions.html\">cppreference</a>.</p><p>It feels the heat! This layer is where the secret inner magic happens, driving the entire exception mechanism in C++ (and not only in this language). To avoid getting burned and burning out too quickly from the abundance of various stuff, we suggest moving forward gradually.</p><p>First, we'll look at the C++-specific layer responsible for throwing and catching exceptions. It's usually called the , , or something like that. Next, move on to the language-independent ABI part, which allows us to find the necessary  blocks, call destructors, and perform other useful tricks. It's often referred to as  or . It should be noted that formally this layer also belongs to the Itanium ABI.</p><p>What does Itanium have to do with this, huh? Well, I'm sorry, but it happens for no particular reason. It was one of the first 64-bit platforms developed by Intel and HP. Although AMD64 ultimately won in the battle of 64-bit architectures, the ABI specification and low-level C++ implementation were still created for Itanium. People appreciated it, and it caught on, with system-specific tweaks, of course. As a result, the  became an established name for this kind of specification in the Linux world.

Our functions now include calls to new functions,  has appeared out of nowhere, and at the very bottom, we see the definition of some mysterious symbol: .</p><p>Let's focus on the  function. In the C++ code, it actually serves one thing: it throws an exception using the  expression. In the assembly, that single expression unfolds into calls to  and  functions. We didn't write these functions, which means that the compiler knew something about them in advance. So, it's either intrinsics or library functions.</p><p>Indeed, we can find definitions of these functions in the  source code. The  function, as indicated by its name, allocates space on the heap for exceptions.</p><p>When we write , the compiler doesn't just copy the object somewhere and hope for the best. Since exceptions can be thrown in many functions, threads, and even languages, the runtime environment needs a reliable, self-contained object that holds both the exception and everything necessary to handle it.</p><p>Therefore, it's easier to provide <code>__cxa_allocate_exception with only the size of the actual object, wait till it does something with it, and get a pointer to the memory region where the exception object will be written.</code></p><pre><code>push    rbp\nmov     rbp, rsp\nmov     edi, 4\ncall    __cxa_allocate_exception@PLT\n</code></pre><p>Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode</p><p>The client code—the one generated for us by the compiler—is responsible for constructing the object in that memory. But take a closer look: the function allocates far more space than is needed to store the exception object itself.</p><pre><code>char *raw_buffer =\n    (char *)__aligned_malloc_with_fallback(header_offset + actual_size);\n</code></pre><p>Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode</p><p>This is necessary for several reasons.</p><p>Firstly, runtime will later need metadata about the thrown exception to recognize how to handle it—and the  structure is responsible for this. It contains data about the exception type (), a pointer to the destructor (because the object needs to be destroyed at some point in the future), various counters, handlers, and other fun stuff. At the end of this structure, there is a certain . For now, let's pretend we don't see it.</p><p>Secondly, the function handles the platform-specific alignment rules. Some processors are very picky: objects must start at addresses that are multiples of 8, 16, or more. The function rounds the total size up so that the exception object is correctly aligned.</p><p>As a result, the complete structure of the exception looks as follows:</p><pre><code>__cxa_exception\nUnwind_Exception \nthrown object (int in our case)\n</code></pre><p>Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode</p><p>If memory allocation fails, hello ! But if everything goes according to plan, all allocated memory will be zeroed. After that, the client is returned a pointer to the location where the exception object should be created. It's important that the returned pointer isn't the beginning of the allocated block, but points to the exact location where the exception object should be located. The  header is located in memory immediately before it.</p><p>By the way, here's a fun fact: libstdc++ (a library from GCC) can throw exceptions even when <a href=\"https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/319a956cd25ccc05c9447d55d76f0c98e8f6b598/libstdc%2B%2B-v3/libsupc%2B%2B/eh_alloc.cc#L394\">heap memory is exhausted</a> thanks to the <a href=\"https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/319a956cd25ccc05c9447d55d76f0c98e8f6b598/libstdc%2B%2B-v3/libsupc%2B%2B/eh_alloc.cc#L142\">epic implementation</a> of the arena pool allocator. If you're curious about high-quality, performance-oriented code, it's worth a look—you won't regret it!</p><p>Alright, we get the place for our exception. What's next? Let's take another look at the generated code:</p><pre><code>call    __cxa_allocate_exception@PLT\nmov     rdi, rax\nmov     dword ptr [rdi], -1\nmov     rsi, qword ptr [rip + typeinfo for int@GOTPCREL]\nxor     eax, eax\nmov     edx, eax\ncall    __cxa_throw@PLT\n</code></pre><p>Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode</p><p>We see a call to the  function. The code shows how we form three arguments before calling it. First, we write our exception object to the space allocated for it. Then we obtain a pointer to . When handling exceptions, we need to know their type—and what could be better than old but gold RTTI! The  also has a third argument, which in our case is zeroed. This argument is a pointer to the exception destructor. We can't use the operator  because we don't initially create the object using the operator , so we have to pass a pointer to the destructor. The built-in  type doesn't have a separate destructor, so there's nothing to pass.</p><p>The described signature matches the one we <a href=\"https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/1c7ec06b16dc59b5b52cff95bde7d5330ffa0293/libcxxabi/src/cxa_exception.cpp#L279\">see in the source code</a>. It uses the  object, which is local to each thread and stores the stack of exceptions that have reached their  block and the counter of exceptions that have not yet been processed. After that,  is initialized. An interesting point is the setting of the  data member. It's not described in the Itanium ABI specification, as it appeared much later—with the release of C++11 to support . At the end, one of two functions is called: <code>_Unwind_SjLj_RaiseException</code> or .</p><p>We'll talk about them in more detail later, but for now, all we need to know is that they shouldn't return the control flow under any circumstances. If this happens, it means that something has gone terribly wrong, and it's a direct path to .</p><p>Fun fact: all this means that we can throw out any object, so to speak, without exception. Well, you got the idea.</p><p>Great, we've figured out how exceptions are thrown. We don't yet know exactly how it'll be delivered, but we'll get there soon enough. For now, let's look at the second way we can interact with exceptions: catching them.</p><p>If we look at the assembly for the  function, we immediately notice something strange: the code between the  command and the  label itself isn't executed.</p><pre><code>        jmp     .LBB1_4\n        mov     rcx, rax\n        mov     eax, edx\n        mov     qword ptr [rbp - 16], rcx\n        mov     dword ptr [rbp - 20], eax\n        mov     rdi, qword ptr [rbp - 16]\n        call    __cxa_begin_catch@PLT\n        mov     dword ptr [rbp - 4], -1\n        call    __cxa_end_catch@PLT\n.LBB1_4:\n</code></pre><p>Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode</p><p>Indeed, it's skipped every time we execute the function sequentially from start to finish. If we do some mental gymnastics and completely remove this code from the assembly, we'll end up with the normal execution path for the  function—calling the  function and returning its value:</p><pre><code>foo():\n        push    rbp\n        mov     rbp, rsp\n        sub     rsp, 32\n        call    bar()\n        mov     dword ptr [rbp - 4], eax\n        mov     eax, dword ptr [rbp - 4]\n        add     rsp, 32\n        pop     rbp\n        ret\n</code></pre><p>Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode</p><p>Everything will work as it should, except for one tiny detail: exceptions won't be handled in this implementation. Yeah, maybe because we cut out the implementation of our  block! But how can we get into it if the normal execution path constantly jumps over it?</p><p>In general, we answer this question a little later, when we go even deeper into our layered structure of the exception mechanism. Now let's focus on what happens when we've already entered the  block. Two new functions,  and , are called.</p><pre><code>call    __cxa_begin_catch@PLT\n; ....\ncall    __cxa_end_catch@PLT\n</code></pre><p>Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode</p><p>The  function takes a pointer as a parameter. Its code shows that this pointer is converted into a pointer to . Where this pointer originally came from remains a mystery for now. Let's just believe that we have it. It's also worth noting that if we throw an exception more complex than just  (i.e., the  block would catch an object with a copy constructor), another call to  would be added before . Let's leave the analysis of this behavior as homework.</p><p>First,  attempts to retrieve the already known  by shifting relative to . Earlier, we've seen how two exception handling structures lie in the memory next to the object. After that, the function increments the <code>__cxa_exception.handlerCount</code> counter—the counter of handlers where the exception is still located. Next, we get , add the current exception to the top of the stack, and decrease the number of exceptions that have not yet been caught. Remember, when throwing exceptions, we also worked with this structure and performed the reverse operation with the  data member.</p><p>Fun fact: this function can also handle exceptions from other languages, even though the C++ standard doesn't provide such functionality.</p><p>In both cases, the function returns a pointer to the exception that is originally thrown. The  block follows this behavior, after which  is called. It deletes the exception and frees up the memory allocated for it. Moreover, this function includes functionality for handling rethrown exceptions. By the way, speaking of them…</p><p>Before we move on to examine the layer that delivers the exception to its  block, let's pause for a moment in that very block. What happens if we rethrow the caught exception? Let's replace  with  inside the  block in our original code and translate it back into assembly:</p><p>Look at the assembly with rethrow:</p><pre><code>foo():\n        push    rbp\n        mov     rbp, rsp\n        sub     rsp, 16\n        call    bar()\n        mov     dword ptr [rbp - 16], eax\n        jmp     .LBB1_1\n.LBB1_1:\n        mov     eax, dword ptr [rbp - 16]\n        add     rsp, 16\n        pop     rbp\n        ret\n        mov     rcx, rax\n        mov     eax, edx\n        mov     qword ptr [rbp - 8], rcx\n        mov     dword ptr [rbp - 12], eax\n        mov     rdi, qword ptr [rbp - 8]\n        call    __cxa_begin_catch@PLT\n        call    __cxa_rethrow@PLT\n        jmp     .LBB1_8\n        mov     rcx, rax\n        mov     eax, edx\n        mov     qword ptr [rbp - 8], rcx\n        mov     dword ptr [rbp - 12], eax\n        call    __cxa_end_catch@PLT\n        jmp     .LBB1_5\n.LBB1_5:\n        jmp     .LBB1_6\n.LBB1_6:\n        mov     rdi, qword ptr [rbp - 8]\n        call    _Unwind_Resume@PLT\n        mov     rdi, rax\n        call    __clang_call_terminate\n.LBB1_8:\n\n__clang_call_terminate:\n        push    rbp\n        mov     rbp, rsp\n        call    __cxa_begin_catch@PLT\n        call    std::terminate()@PLT\n</code></pre><p>Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode</p><p>The assembly code for the  function has become even longer. The call to the  function has appeared. Its purpose is to cancel the effect of  and rethrow the exception.</p><pre><code>mov     rcx, rax\nmov     eax, edx\nmov     qword ptr [rbp - 8], rcx\nmov     dword ptr [rbp - 12], eax\nmov     rdi, qword ptr [rbp - 8]\ncall    __cxa_begin_catch@PLT\ncall    __cxa_rethrow@PLT\n</code></pre><p>Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode</p><p>In fact, it does the same thing as our old friend —it throws an exception. The only difference is that we already have the memory allocated for it, so we just need to update already familiar  and  objects. In the end, <code>_Unwind_SjLj_RaiseException</code> or  is still called. At the very end, if we somehow miraculously get there,  is called.</p><p>It would seem that after calling  in the assembly, there should be nothing, but here's the problem: there is a jump to the  label, followed by a fall through to the code under the  label that, in turn, calls . This is probably just an additional  from the compiler, so let's not fixate on it too long.</p><pre><code>call    __cxa_rethrow@PLT\n    jmp     .LBB1_8\n    ;...\n.LBB1_8:\n__clang_call_terminate:\n    push    rbp\n    mov     rbp, rsp\n    call    __cxa_begin_catch@PLT\n    call    std::terminate()@PLT\n</code></pre><p>Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode</p><p>There is some more code between  and . We end up there \"somehow\" in cases where the current function can't handle the exception, and the  block has to be searched where this very function has been called from. The  function, which we won't discuss right now, is responsible for this. If it suddenly returns control (which should not happen), a jump to the  label occurs, and we already know what happens there.</p><pre><code>.LBB1_6:\n    mov     rdi, qword ptr [rbp - 8]\n    call    _Unwind_Resume@PLT\n    mov     rdi, rax\n    call    __clang_call_terminate\n.LBB1_8:\n</code></pre><p>Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode</p><p>As we've already seen, the  function can distinguish not only between C++ exceptions and exceptions from external languages, but also between thrown and rethrown exceptions. All this ensures that nothing breaks during their handling, except for the developer's belief in a bright future.</p><p>Yes, it seems we need to recap a little.</p><p>We've examined the internal mechanics of exception handling in C++ using a simple code example. It includes the  function, which throws an exception, the  function, which catches it, and , which calls . We've translated this code into the assembly using Clang 21.1.0 for x86-64. We've analyzed the assembly code and source code of  and seen how the compiler and runtime implement exception throwing and catching logic based on the Itanium C++ ABI.</p><p>In , the exception throw is converted into two key calls:</p><ul><li> allocates memory on the heap not only for the exception itself (in our case, ), but also for the  header. This structure contains data about the thrown exception: , a pointer to the destructor, counters, and . Memory is aligned according to platform requirements and filled with zeros. If allocation fails,  is called;</li><li>In turn,  initializes , updates the thread-local  storage with the stack of caught exceptions and the counter of uncaught ones. It ends with a call to  or <code>_Unwind_SjLj_RaiseException</code>. If they return control,  is called.</li></ul><p>We've also seen how exception handling unfolds in several calls:</p><ul><li> obtains a pointer to , increments the handler counter in , adds the exception to the  stack, and decrements the uncaught exception counter, then returns a pointer to the original exception for use in the  block. To obtain non-trivial exception objects, a call to the  function may be added;</li><li> decrements the handler counter, removes the exception from the  stack, calls the destructor, and frees memory.</li></ul><p>If the  block contains the  expression, the current exception will be rethrown. In this case, the assembly calls the  function: it updates  and , and then calls the familiar  or <code>_Unwind_SjLj_RaiseException</code>. If there is no  block,  is used to continue the process of searching for the required handler.</p><p>During our previous dive into the inner workings of C++ exception handling, we encountered several peculiarities, whether we intended to or not. We saw several functions and one structure with the  prefix. We still have questions about how exactly the control gets into the  block. And what the heck is this  symbol that the author has completely ignored? Let's figure this out.</p><p><code>_Unwind_SjLj_RaiseException</code> looks scary, so let's put it aside for now. Of the things we have already seen, we're left with , , and . Let's deal with the first one.</p><p>The  structure serves several interesting purposes. First, the runtime needs to know what kind of exception it's dealing with—whether it's native or external. The C++ standard doesn't officially support catching exceptions from other languages, but the low-level mechanism is still capable of handling them. If the exception comes from another language, the structure includes an  data member, which contains a pointer to the <a href=\"https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/bd0769ef869a1341e8122978e1eafc78c5f3d312/libcxxabi/src/cxa_exception.cpp#L133\">exception cleanup function</a>. It'll clear the memory allocated for such an external exception. Also, in , there are two private data members allocated for the runtime needs. The specification doesn't say what they're supposed to be used for, but we'll see what LLVM does with them later on.</p><p>Let's move on to . As we remember, it's called from  and , and represents the main driver that finds the required  block and delivers the exception to it. It has one parameter—a pointer to the intended . Looking at the code, we can see that two big things happen there: the  and  functions are called. We remember that  shouldn't return execution. Apparently, after executing , \"we're not in Kansas anymore.\"</p><p>Also, at the very beginning of the function, we see the following code:</p><pre><code>unw_context_t uc;\nunw_cursor_t cursor;\n__unw_getcontext(&amp;uc);\n</code></pre><p>Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode</p><p>This is a call to , a library responsible for stack unwinding. Stack unwinding is a process in which the runtime sequentially looks at the contents of stack frames. It starts with the very last frame, in our case, the frame of the  function, and then recursively goes through the frame of each function that has not yet returned control at the time of unwinding. The author assumes that the reader already knows what a stack frame is. If not, let's guess that stack unwinding is a process of looking at what's happening at a particular execution moment inside every function whose calls eventually led us to the current point.</p><p>Now look inside the  function. Well, the amount of code explodes here, but we don't need to digest all of it, only the interesting parts. First, we see the declaration of the  loop. In this loop, we move up the stack, as indicated by the <code>int stepResult = __unw_step(cursor);</code> line. We're interested in the declaration of the <code>unw_proc_info_t frameInfo;</code> variable.</p><p>The  structure carries data about the current function that is important for stack unwinding. There are pointers to the start and end addresses of the function, to something called <em>language specific data area</em>, and to the  data member. Ultimately, executing the  function boils down to calling this .</p><pre><code>_Unwind_Personality_Fn p = get_handler_function(&amp;frameInfo);\n//...\n_Unwind_Reason_Code personalityResult =(*p)(\n    1, _UA_SEARCH_PHASE, exception_object-&gt;exception_class,\n    exception_object, (struct _Unwind_Context *)(cursor));\n</code></pre><p>Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode</p><p>Now we should remember that one of its arguments is , and it can return the following values:</p><ul><li>:  saves the stack pointer of the last viewed frame and returns control with a zero exit code;</li><li>: the  loop continues on the next frame;</li><li>or some other value, which causes  to return an error code.</li></ul><p>We can't say anything more at this point. Let's keep going!</p><p>And then goes . Aside from extra security measures, for example, like using a shadow stack, this phase is similar to the first one. Once again, we see  and . This time,  is <a href=\"https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/346f48ecbcd5a2ba63b3947f3593acce2867692b/libunwind/src/UnwindLevel1.c#L304\">called</a> either with  or with <code>_UA_CLEANUP_PHASE | _UA_HANDLER_FRAME</code>. It happens if the unwinding has reached the frame that was successfully saved after  execution.</p><p>After calling , we either continue unwinding the stack, return with an error (usually, this should not happen), or do one interesting trick. Please note what happens in the <code>case(_URC_INSTALL_CONTEXT)</code> block:</p><pre><code>__unw_phase2_resume(cursor, framesWalked);\nreturn _URC_FATAL_PHASE2_ERROR;\n</code></pre><p>Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode</p><p>Here, we can see a call to , followed by the return of the  error. We put two and two together and conclude that  shouldn't return control, and most likely, this is where the jump we've been searching for so long occurs!</p><p>Sorry, but  is a <a href=\"https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/346f48ecbcd5a2ba63b3947f3593acce2867692b/libunwind/src/UnwindLevel1.c#L51\">macros</a>. We know that nobody likes macros except those who like them. Be patient for a little while longer; it'll be over soon. The implementation of this macro depends on two things: whether the shadow stack is enabled and the platform. If the shadow stack is used, then, oh la la, we see the assembly language inserts for different platforms. These inserts contain instructions that execute the control flow jump.</p><p>If we don't need additional security bells and whistles, we simply call <code>__unw_resume_with_frames_walked</code>, which calls , which in turn calls <code>AbstractUnwindCursor::jumpto</code>. Interestingly,  is a virtual function! The other day, while reading source code, the author was quite amused to find that even such a low-level library has virtual functions. We can encounter the implementation <a href=\"https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/4237ec343a7f0c0d3717972b14ae22ec10ff74cd/libunwind/src/UnwindCursor.hpp#L1428\">further down the code.</a> Oh look, wow, there are templates!</p><p>From there, we reach the <a href=\"https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/4237ec343a7f0c0d3717972b14ae22ec10ff74cd/libunwind/src/Registers.hpp#L303\">platform-dependent implementation</a> (on the author's machine: it's x86-64), where <code>__libunwind_Registers_x86_64_jumpto</code> is called. This function no longer contains any assembly language inserts, as it's written entirely in the assembly. And there, the context of the target frame is actually restored, and the execution jumps right to it.</p><p>Well, there we have it, we've figured out how control flow reaches parts of our little program that would never be touched along the normal execution path! To do this, we descended all the way to the very bottom of the stack that supports exceptions' runtime.</p><p>Before we find out what this  is, let's quickly take a look at the last function from the  family: . Do you recall, how it appeared when we've been rethrowing exceptions in the  block?</p><p> looks very familiar.In many ways, it's similar to , except that it skips the first phase and goes straight to the second one. This makes sense, since we've already found the required , so all that's left is to move from frame to frame until we reach it.</p><p>However, there's one nuance: in addition to the familiar , the code also mentions a certain . What does it force, and how does it differ from the regular version?</p><p>We can cheat a little and look for other places where this  is used. During our search, we'll inevitably stumble upon the  function. It's very similar to , but the first phase never occurs, and the second phase is handled specifically through .</p><p>If we look at the <a href=\"https://itanium-cxx-abi.github.io/cxx-abi/abi-eh.html#base-throw\">documentation</a> for the implementation of the Itanium ABI specification, we can see the following example of how the  function works:</p><p>The  procedure saves the state for restoration (including the frame pointer) in its usual place. The  procedure calls , passing it a stop function that compares the current frame pointer with the previously saved frame pointer.</p><p>This gives us a small clue about what's going on under the hood. The  function is used where we need to unwind the stack, but we don't need to throw a classic C++ exception. Moreover, comments indicate that it's not used in C++ (author's note: at runtime). So, where is it used?</p><p>For example, it can be used when a thread is exiting. You can see this in the  implementation in the  library. The function's call is located <a href=\"https://github.com/bminor/glibc/blob/f9e61cd446d45016e20b6fe85ab87364ebdbec1b/nptl/unwind.c#L130\">here</a>. A detailed analysis of  is far beyond the scope of this article, so we'll leave it at that.</p><p>Catch another interesting fact: GCC's  uses a \"special exception\" called  for forced unwinding. This allows various structures in the vendor's C++ standard library to distinguish cases of forced stack unwinding from regular ones. In fact, no exception is thrown: the personality routine simply sets the corresponding . As a result, neither the C++ exception itself nor  structure is created.</p><pre><code>if (actions &amp; _UA_FORCE_UNWIND)\n{\n    throw_type = &amp;typeid(abi::__forced_unwind);\n}\nelse if (foreign_exception)\n{\n    throw_type = &amp;typeid(abi::__foreign_exception);\n}\n</code></pre><p>Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode</p><p>Wait wait wait… What is a personality routine?</p><p>Before we answer this question, let's do a quick recap. We've explored low-level exception handling mechanisms in C++ based on the Itanium ABI and focused on functions and structures from the  family.</p><p>We've examined the  structure, which allows us to distinguish between native and external exceptions and store runtime-specific data. We've seen how  triggers two phases of stack unwinding: the first phase to find a suitable  and the second phase to fully unwind to the handler. We also figured out how to jump to the  block using platform-dependent assembly code.</p><p>We've also looked at the  function for rethrowing exceptions and the  function for forced stack unwinding without using C++ exceptions, which occurs, for example, when exiting a thread in .</p><p>Ultimately, our research led us to a new concept: the personality routine.</p><p>Friends, we've read, read, read, 'til our eyes went red! It's time for a short break.</p><p>We still need to figure out what kind of beast this personality routine of yours is, how runtime determines whether it has entered the correct  block, and how destructors are called. We've also completely skipped the  family of functions for now—and we haven't even touched topics from \"101 for the impatient\": what are these exception tables and SjLj lists?</p><p>So, in the best traditions of Middle Eastern folktales, we'll pause at the most interesting point and invite you to join us in the next article.</p><p>Meanwhile, as usual,_ El Psy Kongroo_.</p>",

      "content": "<blockquote><p>“How can AI work to shape a future worth living around the world?”</p></blockquote><p><strong>A 2025 – 2026 review through the lens of Knowledge Management, Graphs, Communities, Ontology, Connected Thinking and</strong></p><p>When OpenAI CEO Sam Altman admitted we’re in an AI bubble in August 2025, I wasn’t surprised. I’d been watching the cracks form for months from my seat running graph technology events, teaching AI courses, and consulting on knowledge management across Europe and beyond.</p><p>Some people call the process of creating, curating, sharing, using, and managing knowledge across an organization and even across industries&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/itsm/knowledge-management\">knowledge management</a>. I call it Orchestrating Things, and it’s my vantage point for positioning and reflection based on my work as an Analyst, Consultant, Engineer, Founder, Researcher, and Writer.</p><p>Stories from the trenches, reports more or less exaggerated, and future scenarios on fully automated luxury communism and semi-automated AI-driven capitalism.</p><p><em>This post is part of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://linkeddataorchestration.com/category/topics/ai-machine-learning/long-views-on-ai/\">“Long views on AI” series</a>, exploring important questions on all things AI. We start from a question or statement and explore its background and implications, aiming to facilitate reflection and dialogue.</em></p><h2><strong>Managing Knowledge: The AI Industry’s Blind Spot</strong></h2><p>Knowledge management has always been more art than science. The technology is rarely the bottleneck. The real challenges are buy-in, mandate clarity, governance, and shared vision. Getting people to agree on vocabularies, processes, what knowledge matters, and who’s responsible for what.</p><p>In 2025, working with organizations like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.giz.de/en\">GIZ</a>&nbsp;(the German Agency for International Cooperation), I saw these same patterns everywhere. GIZ’s mission statement is “work to shape a future worth living around the world”. Following up on GIZ’s <a href=\"https://linkeddataorchestration.com/services/training/pragmatic-ai-training/\">Pragmatic AI training</a>, foundation work is needed to make AI work. The world is starting to see this too.</p><p>The AI industry spent years believing you could scale around these human problems. Just add more compute, more data, more parameters. But as the scaling paradigm hits its limits, companies are rediscovering structured knowledge: ontologies, knowledge graphs, metadata frameworks. The unglamorous foundation work that never went away.</p><p>Everything that follows – the graph technologies, the ontology renaissance, the Peer-to-Peer AI and Connected Thinking movement – stems from this realization. Knowledge management isn’t a boring enterprise discipline. It’s the foundation for sense-making, and the lens for understanding where AI goes next.</p><h2><strong>Connecting Data, People, Ideas, and Graphs</strong></h2><p>Knowledge curation is a key part of my work. It enables me to stay on top of things, it’s a bridge for building connections, content marketing currency, and a business or two in its own right.</p><p>None of this would be possible without the surge of interest in graph technologies and knowledge-based approaches. This, and the connections that came through CDL, led to another graph-oriented initiative.</p><h2><strong>Connected Thinking, Connected Worlds</strong></h2><p>Admittedly, graph parlance can sound pretty esoteric. But let’s pause for a moment and consider these quotes. “Here, everyone talks to everyone else”. “This is not just people who go to an event – this is a community”. The former by a CDL attendee, the latter by a CDL partner.</p><p>In 2025, thanks to our CDL partners, I had the opportunity to experience CDL as a member of the community myself. Getting to know and spend time with people and the opportunity to talk about more than graphs and technology was invaluable.</p><p>The experience made me reaffirm that people in this community really see connections everywhere, and seek knowledge as the foundation for their actions. It also made me appreciate how thoughtful and kind they can be. This contributed to framing what we now call Connected Thinking.</p><p><a href=\"https://2026.connected-thinking.space/\">Connected Thinking</a>&nbsp;is a unique journey of exploration, research, companionship, and grounding. It’s an event we are co-organizing with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Bauwens\">Michel Bauwens</a>&nbsp;in May 2026. Wikipedia describes Bauwens as a “Belgian political theorist, writer, and conference speaker on the subjects of technology, culture and business innovation”.</p><p>Michel is a polymath, whose work on <a href=\"https://www.fulcrum.org/concern/monographs/2v23vx522\">Peer to Peer and the Commons</a> has been a reference for my research and thinking. A dear friend, with whom we’ve been talking about collaborating for a while. Michel has been grounding his work on Macro-history patterns towards a <a href=\"https://4thgenerationcivilization.substack.com/\">Fourth Generation Civilization</a>. This is an attempt to connect our worlds.</p><h2><strong>Building Foundations and Pragmatic AI</strong></h2><p>First – every cohort is a community too. There’s loads of work, and value, in putting together a curriculum and delivering lectures. Selecting topics, sources, structure, examples, visualization, sequence, pace, and style. Making hard choices, keeping the material up to date, and delivering it in an easy to follow and engaging way.</p><p>But the hardest and most rewarding part is working with people live, not just putting everything on a one-size-fits-all platform. Engaging, explaining, empathizing, and learning from people. By the end of the course, relationships have formed and a community has emerged out of the shared experience.</p><p>Second – perseverance and grounding win in the end. The first few times I delivered Pragmatic AI, I had to explain why it’s important to include topics such as Knowledge Management, Metadata, Data Governance, Knowledge Graphs, and Ontologies. Today, it’s becoming clear that these are solid foundations for machine learning and GenAI.</p><p>Stories about how Technology, Data, AI and Media flow into each other shaping our lives.</p><p>Ontologies provide the semantic foundation that connects people, processes, and data into unified knowledge structures giving both humans and AI the context they need to reason, understand, and act with confidence. Ontologies are not new. But GenAI made the world rediscover them – to the extent it has.</p><p>Here’s why this matters today: As LLMs hit scaling limits, companies are discovering that structured knowledge – ontologies and knowledge graphs – solve problems that throwing more compute at never will.</p><p>Using <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=Ontology&amp;hl=en-GB\">Google Trends</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jay-jiebing-yu-phd-7b97a8_ontology-used-to-be-a-cursed-word-activity-7417363952906723329-0xIN\">ChatGPT</a> as proxies for the world at large, it looks like the up-and-coming references for ontology in 2026 are philosophy, the eponymous crypto coin, and Palantir. And if you talk to people working with data, AI, or enterprise architecture and ask, “what is an ontology?”, you’ll get different answers.</p><p>For some, ontology is a kind of clever data schema. For others, it’s a business glossary. For others still, the heart of a knowledge graph. Different communities adopted “ontology” and bent it slightly towards their own needs, resulting in confusion.</p><p>What all of that suggests is that we’ve been onto something – pun intended. Introducing and showcasing ontology for the Pragmatic AI Training and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.connected-data.london/post/announcing-the-release-of-connected-data-knowledge-graph-an-open-knowledge-graph-for-the-community\">releasing the Connected Data Knowledge Graph</a>&nbsp;were among my 2025 highlights. Reception is pointing towards more ontology work in 2026.</p><p>There are two things that permeate through almost everything I do: the Pragmatic AI Training, and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://linkeddataorchestration.com/orchestrate-all-the-things/\">Orchestrate all the Things podcast and newsletter</a>. Pragmatic AI cuts through the hype to teach how things work. Orchestrate all the Things engages with thought leaders and builders. The two inform and complement each other.</p><p>Knowing how things work enables engaging with topics and people on a different level. And what I learn from people shapes my perspective and finds its way back into project and education work. Here’s how all of that shaped the key themes I see playing out from 2025 to 2026.</p><p>For most of the world except AI geeks, that would not really matter that much. Just another swing of the AI pendulum that’s been swinging since “AI” was coined. Except that now there’s a whole lot of <a href=\"https://linkeddataorchestration.com/2025/07/16/poking-holes-in-the-ai-narrative-market-signalling-and-outsourcing-replace-ceos/\">money and power invested in the AI narrative</a>, and we’re officially in the AI-driven capitalism era.</p><blockquote><p>“OpenAI took the papers from Google out of the dumpster and Microsoft gave the money to supercharge it. Microsoft threw the money in and said, we are going to have a new growth narrative. [..]</p><p>The narrative went from this is the future to actually, this is a very expensive future. You need to be able to afford&nbsp;<a href=\"https://futurism.com/science-energy/trump-altman-plutonium-oklo\">nuclear power plants</a>&nbsp;and have your own data centers. So only us can do it”, as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://linkeddataorchestration.com/2025/07/16/poking-holes-in-the-ai-narrative-market-signalling-and-outsourcing-replace-ceos/\">Georg Zoeller put it</a>.</p></blockquote><h2><strong>Peer to Peer AI in a Multi-polar World</strong></h2><p>AI not premised on mega-models that need mega-factories to train and operate could be part of <a href=\"https://linkeddataorchestration.com/2025/02/13/are-we-entering-the-era-of-peer-to-peer-ai-long-views-on-ai-part-3/\">Peer to Peer AI</a>. “The real choice isn’t between winning or losing an arms race – it’s about whether we want an AI created by humanity for humanity, or an AI shaped by the cycles of conflict and domination that we need to move beyond”, as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://x.com/RnaudBertrand/status/1886630058670071894\">Arnaud Bertrand put it</a>.</p><p>AI is being commoditized as open source models, notably Chinese ones such as DeepSeek, Qwen and Kimi, are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/p/state-of-llms-2025?hide_intro_popup=true\">not just catching up but increasingly leading</a>. This means , as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://linkeddataorchestration.com/2025/03/11/knowledge-graphs-as-the-essential-truth-layer-for-pragmatic-ai/\">Tony Seale noted</a>, that “organizations need to take the power they’ve got in the models that they have in their hands right now, and focus that back upon the data they have”.</p><h2><strong>The Singularity: From Software to the World</strong></h2><p>What this means is that the machine is beyond control at this point. Zoeller thinks this is intentional, and <a href=\"https://linkeddataorchestration.com/2025/08/19/breaking-the-ai-bubble-big-tech-plus-ai-equals-economy-takeover/\">calls it a singularity</a>. Intentional or not, so far this is mostly constrained in software engineering, and results are mixed. Software engineers can ship code faster. But shipping code was never the bottleneck.</p><p>What about the most important parts in the lifecycle of software – <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/girba_llms-fundamentally-changed-software-engineering-activity-7416067062046814208-NA1Z\">reading</a>, understanding, architecting and maintaining code? What about learning through the process – a substantial part of the evolution of software engineers? What if/when AI is used to build more AI? What if/when this expands beyond software engineering?</p><p>We’ll be addressing these questions in the next issues of Orchestrate all the Things. As for the last part, we’re all about to find out as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://claude.com/blog/cowork-research-preview\">Claude Code is now opening up to non-coders</a>. Claude Code is arguably the most successful AI application, transforming how software engineers work.</p><h2><strong>Intelligence, Latent Space, and Free Lunches</strong></h2><p>Ethan Mollick’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7417291651468918785/\">MBA “vibefounding”</a>insights on how people can get 10X more productive with AI ring true. I’ve experienced this using LLM assistance to solve technical problems outside of my domain of expertise as well as to brainstorm and elicit feedback.</p><p>Being able to pinpoint and describe the issue at hand, and then critically evaluate and apply LLM input can make the difference between being stuck and breezing through, as well as provide new perspectives. I don’t ascribe&nbsp;<a href=\"https://x.com/linked_do/status/2001200627150471302\">any kind of intelligence or agency to LLMs</a>&nbsp;– it’s all latent space. But it works.</p><h2><strong>AI and the Future: Where To, and What For?</strong></h2><p>The work we’re doing at Connected Data London, Pragmatic AI and Connected Thinking in 2026 is our way of contributing, building on principles and work as laid out by so many others before us.

      "content": "<p>Ransomware is evolving from \"lock your files and demand payment\" to \"steal everything and threaten to leak it.\" About 50% of attacks now skip encryption entirely. Payments are declining, but the damage is worse than ever. Welcome to 2026.</p><p>Remember when ransomware was simple? Attackers encrypt your files, you pay up (or don't), life moves on.</p><p>In 2025, something shifted. Groups like Cl0p stopped bothering with encryption altogether. Why waste time locking files when you can just  them?</p><ul><li><strong>89% of ransomware attacks</strong> now include data exfiltration</li><li> are pure theft-and-extortion — no encryption at all</li><li>Manufacturing alone faced  in potential losses in 2025</li></ul><p>The result? Your backups are useless. You can restore your systems all day long — it doesn't un-steal your customer database.</p><h2>Why Attackers Ditched Encryption</h2><p>Encryption is noisy. It triggers alerts. It requires complex malware that security tools are trained to catch.</p><p>Data exfiltration? That's just… traffic.</p><p>Modern attackers use tools already in your environment:</p><ul><li> — blends with normal cloud backup operations</li><li> — looks like legitimate data synchronization</li><li> — standard FTP client, nothing to see here</li></ul><p>By the time you notice something's wrong, they've been camped in your network for weeks. Sometimes months.</p><p>One security researcher put it bluntly: <em>\"When attackers only exfiltrate data, most organizations can't determine what was stolen — or whether it was stolen at all.\"</em></p><p>Attackers know this. <strong>Fake exfiltration campaigns are now a thing</strong> — groups claiming to have your data when they don't, because you literally can't prove them wrong.</p><h2>The Scattered Spider Effect</h2><p>If you want to understand where ransomware is heading, look at Scattered Spider.</p><p>This isn't some shadowy Russian syndicate. It's largely <strong>teenagers and young adults</strong> from the US and UK who grew up in gaming communities like Discord and Roblox. Security researchers call them \"advanced persistent teenagers.\"</p><p>Their rap sheet since 2022:</p><ul><li> in market cap of targeted companies</li><li> in confirmed ransom payments</li><li>Victims include MGM Resorts, Caesars, Marks &amp; Spencer, Coinbase, and Snowflake customers</li><li> across retail, airlines, insurance, and banking</li></ul><p>Their secret weapon? They speak English. Natively.</p><p>While Russian groups rely on broken-English phishing emails, Scattered Spider members call your help desk, impersonate new hires, and chat up employees on Slack. They study your internal lingo. They know who to ask for admin access.</p><p>One member allegedly hacked a federal judge's email account while  — by calling and impersonating another judge to reset the password.</p><p>Several members have been arrested, including a 17-year-old who surrendered to Las Vegas police in September 2025. But arrests haven't slowed the group. Its decentralized structure means new members cycle in constantly.</p><p>The kicker? They're now collaborating with Russian ransomware gangs like Akira and DragonForce. Teenage social engineers meet professional malware operators.</p><p>Remember \"double extortion\"? Encrypt files  threaten to leak data.</p><p>That's table stakes now. Welcome to :</p><ol><li> (optional)</li><li> if you don't pay fast enough</li><li><strong>Contact your customers, partners, and employees directly</strong> to create public pressure</li></ol><p>The Cl0p group pioneered this approach. When a victim refuses to pay, they don't just post data on their leak site. They email the victim's employees. They contact journalists. They call customers and tell them their data is compromised.</p><p>It works. Victims pay even without encryption, driven by:</p><ul><li> — GDPR, HIPAA, SEC rules don't care if data was encrypted. If it was accessed, you report it.</li><li> — Customers don't distinguish between \"they encrypted our files\" and \"they stole our customer database\"</li><li> — Lawsuits from affected employees and customers are spiking</li></ul><p>Here's a stat that should concern everyone: <strong>2026 is expected to be the first year non-Russian ransomware actors outnumber Russian ones.</strong></p><p>This isn't because Russian groups are declining. It's because the playbook has spread everywhere.</p><p>Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) platforms have made sophisticated attacks available to anyone willing to pay. You don't need to write malware — you rent it. You don't need infrastructure — the RaaS operator provides it. You just need targets.</p><p>The result is a Cambrian explosion of new groups:</p><ul><li> — Using AI-generated code for low-cost, high-volume attacks</li><li> — Started with pure exfiltration, later added encryption</li><li> — Took down Ingram Micro for nearly a week, causing an estimated $136M/day in losses</li></ul><p>Law enforcement disruptions barely slow things down. When RansomHub shut down in April 2025, its affiliates simply moved to Qilin — which became the most active ransomware group for six consecutive months.</p><h2>The Insider Recruitment Problem</h2><p>The latest escalation: <strong>ransomware groups are recruiting your employees.</strong></p><p>Not metaphorically. Literally.</p><p>Groups are increasingly using native English speakers to contact corporate insiders directly. The pitch is simple: plant malware or share credentials, get a cut of the ransom.</p><p>One researcher documented an increase in insider recruitment attempts throughout 2025. If layoffs continue in 2026, this trend will accelerate. Disgruntled employees with system access are a gold mine.</p><p>In one case, attackers hired a gig worker through a legitimate platform to physically visit an office and plug in a malicious USB drive. The gig worker had no idea they were working for hackers — they thought it was a routine IT task.</p><p>Good news: ransomware payments are declining. The combination of better backups, improved incident response, and organizations simply refusing to pay is working.</p><p>Bad news: attackers don't care. They're making it up in volume and pressure tactics.</p><p>What's actually moving the needle:</p><p><strong>1. Assume Exfiltration, Not Just Encryption</strong> Your backup strategy is insufficient. You need visibility into outbound data flows — especially cloud services and third-party sync tools. If you can't see data leaving, you can't stop it.</p><p><strong>2. Identity Is the New Perimeter</strong> Attackers \"log in\" rather than \"break in.\" Stolen credentials, phished passwords, and social-engineered help desk resets are the entry points. Multi-factor authentication isn't optional — and SMS-based MFA isn't real MFA.</p><p><strong>3. Verify Everything, Trust Nothing</strong> If someone calls your help desk claiming to be an employee, verify their identity through a separate channel. Scattered Spider's entire playbook depends on humans trusting other humans who sound legitimate.</p><p> When (not if) attackers get in, limit the blast radius. A compromised marketing intern shouldn't have access to customer payment data.</p><p><strong>5. Practice Disclosure, Not Just Recovery</strong> You need a crisis communications plan. When attackers start emailing your customers, what do you say? Figure that out before it happens.</p><p>The ransomware ecosystem isn't collapsing — it's professionalizing. Groups operate like businesses with org charts, customer support (for victims paying ransoms), and affiliate programs.</p><p>Payments may be declining, but total costs are rising. A ransomware attack now averages  in total impact — including downtime, recovery, legal fees, and reputational damage.</p><p>The groups that succeed in 2026 won't necessarily have the best malware. They'll have the best:</p><ul><li> — Native speakers who can manipulate humans</li><li> — Targeting organizations during acquisitions, layoffs, or holiday weekends</li><li> — Turning stolen data into public relations nightmares</li></ul><p>Encryption was just the opening act. The main show is psychological warfare.</p><p>Welcome to the new era of ransomware. Bring your incident response team.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Prompt injection. The bane of every developer building with LLMs. It’s not a bug in your code. It’s a sophisticated attack that exploits the very nature of how LLMs interpret and prioritize natural language instructions. If you’re still relying on keyword blacklists and static filters, you’re already losing the battle.</p><p>Attackers aren't just trying to override instructions anymore. They're subtly redirecting models, influencing multi-step interactions, and generally making a mess of your carefully crafted AI applications. This isn't just a theoretical threat. It's a real-world problem demanding a new class of LLM security solutions.</p><h2>The Core Idea: Hiding Secrets in Plain Sight</h2><p>This isn't about trying to guess what malicious input looks like. It's about flipping the script: monitoring whether the model is still adhering to instructions the attacker cannot see. Think of it as embedding a digital tripwire within your LLM's operational logic.</p><p>The fundamental concept is deceptively simple: embed hidden signals such as secret keys, canary tokens, or latent objectives, within the system prompt or the model's internal process. If these hidden elements vanish or change, it's a clear signal that the model's intended behavior has been compromised by user input.</p><p>This hidden information can manifest in several ways:</p><ul><li>Secret Key/Token Sequence: A specific string the model must preserve.</li><li>Canary String: A phrase that should be reproduced verbatim.</li><li>Hidden Instruction: An auxiliary task invisible to the user, yet critical for the model's internal alignment.</li></ul><p>Regardless of the specific implementation, the secret acts as an internal reference point, a silent guardian ensuring the model remains loyal to its core directives.</p><p>The effectiveness of <a href=\"https://neuraltrust.ai/blog/what-are-secret-knowledge-defenses\">Secret Knowledge Defenses</a> hinges on a crucial assumption: attackers typically only control user-facing input. System prompts, developer instructions, and internal control logic remain opaque to them. This leads to a powerful intuition:</p><ol><li>An attacker cannot reliably manipulate instructions they cannot see.</li><li>Therefore, they cannot deliberately interfere with a hidden objective.</li></ol><p>This assumption has fueled the development of defenses that prioritize secrecy over explicit input filtering. It's a shift from “Is the input malicious?” to “Is the model still loyal to its hidden instructions?”</p><h2>In Practice: DataSentinel and MELON</h2><p>Two prominent examples of Secret Knowledge Defenses are DataSentinel and MELON. They represent two ends of the design spectrum, from simple output-level canaries to sophisticated reasoning-level markers.</p><h3>DataSentinel: The Straightforward Honeypot</h3><p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.11358\">DataSentinel</a> is a direct and effective implementation of this concept. It introduces a honeypot task that the model must perform, regardless of user input.

This makes MELON particularly effective against indirect prompt injections and subtle behavioral drift.</p><h2>The Attacker Model: What We’re Up Against</h2><p>It's important to be clear about the threat model. Secret Knowledge Defenses assume the attacker has:</p><ul><li>Full control over user input.</li><li>No visibility into system prompts.</li><li>No direct access to model internals.</li></ul><p>This reflects the reality of most deployed systems. The attacker is adaptive, observing outputs and adjusting their inputs, but they are fundamentally working from outside the system. The core assumption is that the secret remains secret.</p><p>Secret Knowledge Defenses are not a panacea. They are a powerful layer in a broader LLM security stack. They should be combined with:</p><ul></ul><p>In this layered approach, secret knowledge mechanisms act as integrity sentinels, providing early warnings and behavioral monitoring that other defenses might miss.</p><h2>The Future is Behavioral Integrity</h2><p>As LLMs become more autonomous, moving from simple chatbots to complex, multi-step agents, the need to monitor their internal alignment becomes paramount. Secret Knowledge Defenses are a critical step in this direction.</p><p>Instead of playing an endless cat-and-mouse game with malicious inputs, we can focus on ensuring the behavioral integrity of the model itself. This is not just a defensive strategy. It’s a fundamental shift in how we build and secure AI systems. The future of LLM security lies not in building taller walls, but in creating smarter, self-aware systems that can detect when they’ve been led astray.</p>",

      "content": "<p>A subtle change is underway in how knowledge work begins. More and more, the first coherent version of a thought arrives already shaped—quickly, fluently, and with plausible next steps attached. This can feel like simple convenience. But when the starting point changes, the rest of the workflow changes with it: what gets practiced, what feels effortful, and what counts as “normal” speed and competence. What follows describes that shift at the level of everyday work and explains why its effects are easiest to see when the tool is unavailable.</p><h3>Assistance Moved Upstream</h3><p>Earlier productivity tools mostly supported execution: formatting, retrieval, transcription, or polish. Today’s assistants participate earlier, supplying a coherent first pass on meaning and direction. Instead of only helping you say what you already know, they can propose what the situation&nbsp;, what matters within it, and what to do next. The work still ends with a human decision, but the starting point is more often a generated draft, plan, or stance that arrives already shaped.</p><p>An&nbsp;<strong>intermediate cognition layer</strong>&nbsp;is now available on demand: a quick external first pass that sits between raw input and a finished output, turning ambiguity into something workable—an outline, a draft reply, an action list, a provisional framing. In that role, it functions as a&nbsp;: a support layer that makes work easier while it is present, and reveals its role when it is removed. A simple version of the pattern is familiar: you receive a dense or delicate message, ask for a reply, get a coherent candidate with implied intent and next steps, then revise and send. The result can be fluent even when some of the earliest interpretive work has been partially externalized.</p><p>That matters because “starting” is where uncertainty is highest and where framing decisions quietly determine what counts as relevant, what gets excluded, and what seems like a reasonable next step. When this upstream layer becomes reliable and ubiquitous, workflows reorganize around it because it becomes the easiest way to move from ambiguity to coherence.</p><h3>From Originator to Editor</h3><p>The most visible interaction with an assistant is revision: you read a draft, adjust it, and decide what to keep. Over time, that can mask a deeper change: the initial framing and first wording are increasingly supplied externally. In&nbsp;, you generate the first frame—what the thing is, what it’s for, what constraints matter—then build outward from that foundation. In&nbsp;, you begin with&nbsp;: candidate framings, outlines, messages, or action lists that arrive already shaped. Editing can be active and thoughtful, but it is not the same skill as originating under uncertainty. The shift is easy to miss because the visible labor (revising) remains while the invisible labor (forming the starting point) thins.</p><p>Two mechanisms explain why this shift has lasting effects.&nbsp;&nbsp;is what gets delegated: not just retrieval or drafting, but intermediate cognition—interpretation, framing, formulation, and sometimes checking.&nbsp;&nbsp;is how the assistant shapes outcomes by structuring the option set: the outputs are&nbsp;&nbsp;that compress the space of possible framings into a small menu of fluent candidates. Even when a user remains in control, the shape of control changes: judgment increasingly operates over pre-formed candidates rather than forming the candidate space itself.</p><h3>The Slow Consequence of Drift</h3><p>The central concern is&nbsp;: gradual change in what gets practiced (and what becomes effortful) when the first pass is routinely externalized. Drift is not a single failure. It is a slow redistribution of attention and effort across the workflow. Day-to-day output can improve, even as certain upstream capacities become less exercised and less reliable on demand.</p><p>At the level of&nbsp;<em>what the situation is taken to be</em>, a subtle&nbsp;&nbsp;can set in. When an assistant regularly provides the first coherent reading—what matters, what the intent is, what the constraints probably are—your own initial pass can compress or disappear. Evaluation may still occur, but it begins downstream of a premade interpretation. Over time, the skill of generating multiple plausible readings from sparse evidence can weaken, and the default becomes accepting or lightly adjusting a provided frame.</p><p>&nbsp;appears when ambiguity is converted into structure by default. Drafts, outlines, plans, and “reasonable next steps” arrive pre-shaped, and the work becomes selection and revision. Editing can remain strong (and can even improve), but it is not the same as originating: choosing a structure from scratch, inventing the first phrasing under uncertainty, or building an argument before a template exists. When a workflow relies on externally provided first drafts, “starting from zero” becomes less familiar, and therefore feels slower and more cognitively costly.</p><p>Checking changes too, and the shift is often best described as&nbsp;. Fluent output carries signals of completeness: it looks finished, balanced, and confident. That can reduce the felt need to verify assumptions, trace sources, or test edge cases—especially when the task is time-pressured or the topic is unfamiliar. The risk is not only factual error. It is upstream misalignment: a mistaken assumption about context, an omitted constraint, an overconfident inference, or a prematurely narrowed frame that quietly propagates through everything that follows. In such cases, coherence becomes a proxy for correctness, and “seems done” becomes a stopping rule.</p><h3>Interruption &amp; Normalization</h3><p>Dependency is most legible under interruption. When access is constrained—by outage, policy, cost, latency, or context—the friction does not primarily appear at the end of a task. It appears upstream, where the scaffold had been turning uncertainty into an initial structure. What breaks first is often the “start”: forming a frame, choosing a stance, generating a plan, or deciding what to verify. In this sense, dependency can be described by&nbsp;: what changes, and where the workflow fails, when the scaffold is absent. The question is not whether the workflow can continue at all, but how its resilience changes when the intermediate cognition layer is removed.</p><p>As scaffolding becomes common, expectations adapt. When fast coherence and high-quality drafts are readily available, they begin to define the baseline of normal performance. Timelines, review cycles, and the perceived “reasonable” speed of communication can shift toward the assumption that a first pass is always immediately obtainable. Over time, opting out can look like slowness rather than a different mode of work.</p><p>An assistant can be a genuine extension of capability. It can also become the default place where “starting” happens—where uncertainty is converted into coherence and the candidate space of meanings and actions is quietly shaped. The point is not to deny the value of scaffolding, but to notice what it relocates: interpretation, framing, and first-pass work. If judgment increasingly operates on fluent options that arrive already formed, what becomes of agency and authorship—and how do we keep that shift legible as it becomes normal?</p>",

      "content": "<p>When SpaceX CEO Elon Musk chose a remote Texas outpost on the Gulf Coast to develop his company’s ambitious Starship, he put the 400-foot rocket on a collision course with the commercial airline industry.</p><p>Each time SpaceX did a test run of Starship and its booster, dubbed Super Heavy, the megarocket’s flight path would take it soaring over busy Caribbean airspace before it reached the relative safety of the open Atlantic Ocean. The company planned as many as five such launches a year as it perfected the craft, a version of which is supposed to one day land on the moon.</p><p>The FAA, which also oversees commercial space launches, predicted the impact to the national airspace would be “minor or minimal,” akin to a weather event, the agency’s 2022 approval shows. No airport would need to close and no airplane would be denied access for “an extended period of time.”&nbsp;</p><p>But the reality has been far different. Last year, three of Starship’s five launches exploded at unexpected points on their flight paths, twice raining flaming debris over congested commercial airways and disrupting flights. And while no aircraft collided with rocket parts, pilots were forced to scramble for safety.&nbsp;</p><p>A ProPublica investigation, based on agency documents, interviews with pilots and passengers, air traffic control recordings and photos and videos of the events, found that by authorizing SpaceX to test its experimental rocket over busy airspace, the FAA accepted the inherent risk that the rocket might put airplane passengers in danger.&nbsp;</p><p>And once the rocket failed spectacularly and that risk became real, neither the FAA nor Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy sought to revoke or suspend Starship’s license to launch, a move that is permitted when “necessary to protect the public health and safety.” Instead, the FAA allowed SpaceX to test even more prototypes over the same airspace, adding stress to the already-taxed air traffic control system each time it launched.</p><p>The first two Starship explosions last year forced the FAA to make real-time calls on where to clear airspace and for how long. Such emergency closures camewith little or no warning, ProPublica found, forcing pilots to suddenly upend their flight plans and change course in heavily trafficked airspace to get out of the way of falling debris. In one case, a plane with 283 people aboard ran low on fuel, prompting its pilot to declare an emergency and cross a designated debris zone to reach an airport.</p><p>The world’s largest pilots union told the FAA in October that such events call into question whether “a suitable process” is in place to respond to unexpected rocket mishaps.&nbsp;</p><p>“There is high potential for debris striking an aircraft resulting in devastating loss of the aircraft, flight crew, and passengers,” wrote Steve Jangelis, a pilot and aviation safety chair.</p><p>The FAA said in response to questions that it “limits the number of aircraft exposed to the hazards, making the likelihood of a catastrophic event extremely improbable.”&nbsp;</p><p>Yet for the public and the press, gauging that danger has been difficult. In fact, nearly a year after last January’s explosion, it remains unclear just how close Starship’s wreckage came to airplanes. SpaceX estimated where debris fell after each incident and reported that information to the federal government. But the company didn’t respond to ProPublica’s requests for that data, and the federal agencies that have seen it, including the FAA, haven’t released it. The agency told us that it was unaware of any other publicly available data on Starship debris.</p><p>In public remarks, Musk downplayed the risk posed by Starship. To caption a video of flaming debris in January, he wrote, “<a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1880040599761596689?s=20\">Entertainment is guaranteed!</a>” and, after the March explosion, he posted, “<a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1897882353298506137?s=20\">Rockets are hard</a>.” The company has been more measured, saying it learns from mistakes, which “help us improve Starship’s reliability.”&nbsp;</p><p>For airplanes traveling at high speeds, there is little margin for error. Research shows as little as 300 grams of debris — or two-thirds of a pound — “could catastrophically destroy an aircraft,” said Aaron Boley, a professor at the University of British Columbia who has studied the danger space objects pose to airplanes. Photographs of Starship pieces that washed up on beaches show items much bigger than that,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.accuweather.com/en/space-news/spacex-rocket-debris-litters-mexico-beach-threatens-environment/1782495\">including large, intact tanks</a>.</p><p>“It doesn’t actually take that much material to cause a major problem to an aircraft,” Boley said.</p><p>In response to growing alarm over the rocket’s repeated failures, the FAA has expanded prelaunch airspace closures and offered pilots more warning of potential trouble spots. The agency said it also required SpaceX to conduct investigations into the incidents and to “implement numerous corrective actions to enhance public safety.” An FAA spokesperson referred ProPublica’s questions about what those corrective actions were to SpaceX, which did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</p><p>Experts say the FAA’s shifting approach telegraphs a disquieting truth about air safety as private companies increasingly push to use the skies as their laboratories: Regulators are learning as they go.&nbsp;</p><p>During last year’s Starship launches, the FAA was under pressure to fulfill a dual mandate: to regulate and promote the commercial space industry while keeping the flying public safe, ProPublica found. In his October letter, Jangelis called the arrangement “a direct conflict of interest.”&nbsp;</p><p>In an interview, Kelvin Coleman, who was head of FAA’s commercial space office during the launches, said his office determined that the risk from the mishaps “was within the acceptable limits of our regulations.”&nbsp;</p><p>But, he said, “as more launches are starting to take place, I think we have to take a real hard look at the tools that we have in place and how do we better integrate space launch into the airspace.”</p><h3>“We Need to Protect the Airspace”&nbsp;</h3><p>On Jan. 16, 2025, as SpaceX prepared to launch Starship 7 from Boca Chica, Texas, the government had to address the possibility the giant rocket would break up unexpectedly.&nbsp;</p><p>Using debris modeling and simulations, the U.S. Space Force, the branch of the military that deals with the nation’s space interests, helped the FAA draw the contours of theoretical “debris response areas” — no-fly zones that could be activated if Starship exploded.</p><p>With those plans in place, Starship Flight 7 lifted off at 5:37 p.m. EST. About seven minutes later, it achieved a notable feat: Its reusable booster rocket separated, flipped and returned to Earth, where giant mechanical arms caught it as SpaceX employees cheered.</p><p>But about 90 seconds later, as Starship’s upper stage continued to climb, SpaceX lost contact with it. The craft caught fire and exploded, far above Earth’s surface.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><em>A pilot on a flight from Miami to Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, recorded video of space debris visible from the cockpit while flying at 37,000 feet.&nbsp;Provided to ProPublica</em></figcaption></figure><p>Air traffic control’s communications came alive with surprised pilots who saw the accident, some of whom took photos and shot videos of the flaming streaks in the sky:</p><figure><figcaption><em><mark>&nbsp;I just got a major streak going for at least 60 miles, all these different colors. Just curious but — it looked like it was coming towards us, but obviously because of the distance …. Just letting you know.Can you, can you give an estimate on how far away it is?</mark></em></figcaption></figure><p>Another controller warned a different pilot of debris in the area:</p><figure><figcaption><em><mark>Due to a space vehicle mishap —&nbsp; a rocket launch that basically exploded between our airspace and Miami — I’m going to give you holding instructions because there was debris in the area, so I’m going to keep you away from it.</mark></em></figcaption></figure><p>Two FAA safety inspectors were in Boca Chica to watch the launch at SpaceX’s mission control, said Coleman, who, for Flight 7, was on his laptop in Washington, D.C., receiving updates.</p><p>As wreckage descended rapidly toward airplanes’ flight paths over the Caribbean, the FAA activated a no-fly zone based on the vehicle’s last known position and prelaunch calculations. Air traffic controllers warned pilots to avoid the area, which stretched hundreds of miles over a ribbon of ocean roughly from the Bahamas to just east of St. Martin, covering portions of populated islands, including all of Turks and Caicos. While the U.S. controls some airspace in the region, it relies on other countries to cooperate when it recommends a closure.&nbsp;</p><p>The FAA also cordoned off a triangular zone south of Key West.</p><p>When a pilot asked when planes would be able to proceed through the area, a controller replied:</p><figure><figcaption><em><mark>&nbsp;The only information I got is that the rocket exploded so we need to protect the airspace, and Miami and Domingo stopped taking aircraft.</mark></em></figcaption></figure><p>There were at least 11 planes in the closed airspace when Starship exploded, and flight tracking data shows they hurried to move out of the way, clearing the area within 15 minutes. Such maneuvers aren’t without risk. “If many aircraft need to suddenly change their routing plans,” Boley said, “then it could cause additional stress” on an already taxed air traffic control system, “which can lead to errors.”</p><p>That wasn’t the end of the disruption though. The FAA kept the debris response area, or DRA, active for another 71 minutes, leaving some flights in a holding pattern over the Caribbean. Several began running low on fuel and some informed air traffic controllers that they needed to land.</p><p>“We haven’t got enough fuel to wait,” said one pilot for Iberia airlines who was en route from Madrid with 283 people on board.</p><p>The controller warned him that if he proceeded across the closed airspace, it would be at his own risk:</p><figure><figcaption><em><mark>&nbsp;If you’re going to pass through the DRA, you guys’re going to need to declare an emergency. That’s what my supervisor — if you’re going to land at San Juan, you need to declare an emergency for fuel reasons, that’s what my supervisor just told me.&nbsp;In that case, we declare emergency. Mayday mayday mayday.</mark></em></figcaption></figure><p>The plane landed safely in San Juan, Puerto Rico.</p><p>Iberia did not respond to requests for comment, but in statements to ProPublica, other airlines downplayed the launch fallout. Delta, for example, said the incident “had minimal impact to our operation and no aircraft damage.” The company’s “safety management system and our safety culture help us address potential issues to reinforce that air transportation remains the safest form of travel in the world,” a spokesperson said.</p><p>After the incident, some pilots registered concerns with the FAA, which was also considering a request from SpaceX to increase the number of annual Starship launches from five to 25.&nbsp;</p><p>“Last night’s Space X rocket explosion, which caused the diversion of several flights operating over the Gulf of Mexico, was pretty eye opening and scary,” wrote Steve Kriese in comments to the FAA, saying he was a captain for a major airline and often flew over the Gulf. “I do not support the increase of rocket launches by Space X, until a thorough review can be conducted on the disaster that occurred last night, and safety measures can be put in place that keeps the flying public safe.”</p><p>Kriese could not be reached for comment.</p><p>The Air Line Pilots Association urged the FAA to suspend Starship testing until the root cause of the failure could be investigated and corrected. A letter from the group, which represents more than 80,000 pilots flying for 43 airlines, said flight crews traveling in the Caribbean didn’t know where planes might be at risk from rocket debris until after the explosion.&nbsp;</p><p>“By that time, it’s much too late for crews who are flying in the vicinity of the rocket operation, to be able to make a decision for the safe outcome of the flight,” wrote Jangelis, the pilot and aviation safety chair for the group. The explosion, he said, “raises additional concerns about whether the FAA is providing adequate separation of space operations from airline flights.”</p><p>In response, the FAA said it would “review existing processes and determine whether additional measures can be taken to improve situational awareness for flight crews prior to launch.”</p><p>According to FAA documents, the explosion propelled Starship fragments across an area nearly the size of New Jersey. Debris landed on beaches and roadways in Turks and Caicos. It also damaged a car. No one was injured.</p><p>Three months later, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which was evaluating potential impacts to marine life, sent the FAA a report with a map of where debris from an explosion could fall during future Starship failures. The estimate, which incorporated SpaceX’s own data from the Starship 7 incident, depicted an area more than three times the size of the airspace closed by the FAA.&nbsp;</p><p>In a statement, an FAA spokesperson said NOAA’s map was “intended to cover multiple potential operations,” while the FAA’s safety analysis is for a “single actual launch.” A NOAA spokesperson said that the map reflects “the&nbsp;&nbsp;area where mishaps could occur” and is not directly comparable with the FAA’s no-fly zones.&nbsp;</p><p>Nevertheless Moriba Jah, a professor of aerospace engineering at the University of Texas, said the illustration suggested the no-fly zones the FAA activated may not fully capture how far and wide debris spreads after a rocket breakup. The current predictive science, he said, “carries significant uncertainty.”&nbsp;</p><p>At an industry conference a few weeks after the January explosion, Shana Diez, a SpaceX executive, acknowledged the FAA’s challenges in overseeing commercial launches.</p><p>“The biggest thing that we really would like to work with them on in the future is improving their real time awareness of where the launch vehicles are and where the launch vehicles’ debris could end up,” she said.&nbsp;</p><h3>“We’re Too Close to the Debris”</h3><p>On Feb. 26 of last year, with the investigation into Starship Flight 7 still open, the FAA&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/statements/general-statements\">cleared Flight 8 to proceed</a>, saying it “determined SpaceX met all safety, environmental and other licensing requirements.”&nbsp;</p><p>The action was allowed under&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-24-105561\">a practice that began</a>&nbsp;during the first Trump administration, known as “expedited return-to-flight,” that permitted commercial space companies to launch again even before the investigation into a prior problematic flight was complete, as long as safety systems were working properly.</p><p>Coleman, who took a voluntary separation offer last year, said that before granting approval, the FAA confirmed that “safety critical systems,” such as the rocket’s ability to self-destruct if it went off course, worked as designed during Flight 7.&nbsp;</p><p>By March 6, SpaceX was ready to launch again. This time the FAA gave pilots a heads-up an hour and 40 minutes before liftoff.&nbsp;</p><p>“In the event of a debris-generating space launch vehicle mishap, there is the potential for debris falling within an area,” the advisory said, again listing coordinates for two zones in the Gulf and Caribbean.&nbsp;</p><p>The FAA said a prelaunch safety analysis, which includes planning for potential debris, “incorporates lessons learned from previous flights.” The zone described in the agency’s advisory for the Caribbean was wider and longer than the previous one, while the area over the Gulf was significantly expanded.</p><p>Flight 8 launched at 6:30 p.m. EST and its booster returned to the launchpad as planned. But a little more than eight minutes into the flight, some of Starship’s engines cut out. The craft went into a spin and about 90 seconds later SpaceX lost touch with it and it exploded.</p><p>The FAA activated the no-fly zones less than two minutes later, using the same coordinates it had released prelaunch.&nbsp;</p><p>Even with the advance warning, data shows at least five planes were in the debris zones at the time of the explosion, and they all cleared the airspace in a matter of minutes.&nbsp;</p><p>A pilot on one of those planes, Frontier Flight 081, told passengers they could see the rocket explosion out the right-side windows. Dane Siler and Mariah Davenport, who were heading home to the Midwest after vacationing in the Dominican Republic, lifted the window shade and saw debris blazing across the sky, with one spot brighter than the rest.</p><p>“It literally looked like the sun coming out,” Siler told ProPublica. “It was super bright.”</p><p>They and other passengers shot videos, marveling at what looked like fireworks, the couple said. The Starship fragments appeared to be higher than the plane, many miles off. But before long, the pilot announced “I’m sorry to report that we have to turn around because we’re too close to the debris,” Siler said.</p><p>Frontier did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>The FAA lifted the restriction on planes flying through the debris zone about 30 minutes after Starship exploded, much sooner than it had in January. The agency said that the Space Force had “notified the FAA that all debris was down approximately 30 minutes after the Starship Flight 8 anomaly.”</p><p>But in response to ProPublica’s questions, the Space Force acknowledged that it did not track the debris in real time. Instead, it said “computational modeling,” along with other scientific measures, allowed the agency to “predict and mitigate risks effectively.” The FAA said “the aircraft were not at risk” during the aftermath of Flight 8.</p><p>Experts told ProPublica that the science underlying such modeling is far from settled, and the government’s ability to anticipate how debris will behave after an explosion like Starship’s is limited. “You’re not going to find anybody who’s going to be able to answer that question with any precision,” said John Crassidis, an aerospace engineering professor at the University of Buffalo. “At best, you have an educated guess. At worst, it’s just a potshot.”&nbsp;</p><p>Where pieces fall — and how long they take to land — depends on many factors, including atmospheric winds and the size, shape and type of material involved, experts said.&nbsp;</p><p>During the breakup of Flight 7, the FAA kept airspace closed for roughly 86 minutes. However, Diez, the SpaceX executive, told attendees at the industry conference that, in fact, it had taken “hours” for all the debris to reach the ground. The FAA, SpaceX and Diez did not respond to follow-up questions about her remarks.</p><p>It’s unclear how accurate the FAA’s debris projections were for the March explosion. The agency acknowledged that debris fell in the Bahamas, but it did not provide ProPublica the exact location, making it impossible to determine whether the wreckage landed where the FAA expected. While some of the country’s islands were within the boundaries of the designated debris zone, most were not. Calls and emails to Bahamas officials were not returned.</p><p>The FAA said no injuries or serious property damage occurred.</p><h3>FAA Greenlights More Launches</h3><p>By May, after months of Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency slashing spending and firing workers at federal agencies across Washington,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/media/94346\">the FAA granted SpaceX</a>’s request to exponentially increase the number of Starship launches from Texas.</p><p>Starship is key to “delivering greater access to space and enabling cost-effective delivery of cargo and people to the Moon and Mars,” the FAA found. The agency said it will make sure parties involved “are taking steps to ensure the safe, efficient, and equitable use” of national airspace.</p><p>The U.S. is in a race to beat China to the lunar surface — a priority set by Trump’s first administration and continued under President Joe Biden. Supporters say the moon can be mined for resources like water and rare earth metals, and can offer a place to test new technologies. It could also serve as a stepping stone for more distant destinations, enabling Musk to achieve his longstanding goal of bringing humans to Mars.&nbsp;</p><p>Trump pledged last January that the U.S. will “pursue our Manifest Destiny into the stars, launching American astronauts to plant the Stars and Stripes on the planet Mars.”&nbsp;</p><p>But with experimental launches like Starship’s, Jangelis said, the FAA should be “as conservative as possible” when managing the airspace below them.</p><p>“We expect the FAA to make sure our aircraft and our passengers stay safe,” he said. “There has to be a balance between the for-profit space business and the for-profit airlines and commerce.”</p><h3>A More Conservative Approach</h3><p>In mid-May, United Kingdom officials sent a letter to their U.S. counterparts, asking that SpaceX and the FAA change Starship’s flight path or take other precautions because they were worried about the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/spacex-starship-explosions-uk-turks-caicos-faa-launches\">safety of their Caribbean</a>&nbsp;territories.</p><p>The following day, the FAA announced in a news release that it had approved the next Starship launch, pending either the agency’s closure of the investigation into Flight 8 or granting of a “return to flight” determination.</p><p>A week later, with the investigation into Flight 8 still open, the agency said SpaceX had “satisfactorily addressed” the causes of the mishap. The FAA did not detail what those causes were at the time but said it would verify that the company implemented all necessary “corrective actions.”&nbsp;</p><p>This time the FAA was more aggressive on air safety.&nbsp;</p><p>The agency preventively closed an extensive swath of airspace extending 1,600 nautical miles from the launch site, across the Gulf of Mexico and through part of the Caribbean. The FAA said that 175 flights or more could be affected, and it advised Turks and Caicos’ Providenciales International Airport to close during the launch.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/statements/general-statements\">The agency said</a>&nbsp;the move was driven in part by an “updated flight safety analysis” and SpaceX’s decision to reuse a previously launched Super Heavy booster — something the company had never tried before. The agency also said it was “in close contact and collaboration with the United Kingdom, Turks &amp; Caicos Islands, Bahamas, Mexico, and Cuba.”</p><p>Coleman told ProPublica that the concerns of the Caribbean countries, along with Starship’s prior failures, helped convince the FAA to close more airspace ahead of Flight 9.</p><p>On May 27, the craft lifted off at 7:36 p.m. EDT, an hour later than in March and two hours later than in January. The FAA said it required the launch window to be scheduled during “non-peak transit periods.”</p><p>This mission, too, ended in failure.</p><p>Starship’s Super Heavy booster blew up over the Gulf of Mexico, where it was supposed to have made what’s called a “hard splashdown.”&nbsp;</p><p>In response, the FAA again activated an emergency no-fly zone. Most aircraft had already been rerouted around the closed airspace, but the agency said it diverted one plane and put another in a holding pattern for 24 minutes. The FAA did not provide additional details on the flights.</p><p>Starship’s upper stage reached the highest planned point in its flight path, but it went into a spin on the way down, blowing up over the Indian Ocean.</p><p>SpaceX launched Starship again in August and October. Unlike the prior flights, both went off without incident, and the company said it was turning its focus to the next generation of Starship to provide “service to Earth orbit, the Moon, Mars, and beyond.”</p><p>But about a week later, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said he would open up SpaceX’s multibillion-dollar contract for a crewed lunar lander to rival companies. SpaceX is “an amazing company,” he said on CNBC. “The problem is, they’re behind.”</p><p>Musk pushed back,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1980335879945351303?s=20\">saying on X that&nbsp;</a>“SpaceX is moving like lightning compared to the rest of the space industry.” He insulted Duffy, calling him “<a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1980654826129354924\">Sean Dummy</a>” and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1980657620160860501\">saying</a>&nbsp;“The person<a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1980657620160860501\"></a>responsible for America’s space program can’t have a 2 digit IQ.”</p><p>The Department of Transportation did not respond to a request for comment or make Duffy available.</p><p>In a web post on Oct. 30, SpaceX said it was proposing “a simplified mission architecture and concept of operations” that would “result in a faster return to the Moon while simultaneously improving crew safety.”</p><p><a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/space/stakeholder_engagement/spacex_starship/20250919_Draft-Tiered-EA-for-Additional-Trajectories-and-Starship-RTLS_508.pdf\">SpaceX is now seeking FAA approval</a>&nbsp;to add new trajectories as Starship strives to reach orbit. Under the plan, the rocket would fly over land in Florida and Mexico, as well as the airspace of Cuba, Jamaica and the Cayman Islands, likely disrupting hundreds of flights.&nbsp;</p><p>In its letter, the pilots’ union told the FAA that testing Starship “over a densely populated area should not be allowed (given the dubious failure record)” until the craft becomes more reliable. The planned air closures could prove “crippling” for the Central Florida aviation network, it added.</p><p>Still, SpaceX is undeterred.&nbsp;</p><p>Diez, the company executive,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://x.com/ShanaDiez/status/1977966272772984909\">said on X</a>&nbsp;in October, “We are putting in the work to make 2026 an epic year for Starship.”</p>",

      "content": "An anonymous reader quotes a report from the Guardian: The world has entered an era of \"global water bankruptcy\" that is harming billions of people, a UN report has declared. The overuse and pollution of water must be tackled urgently, the report's lead author said, because no one knew when the whole system could collapse, with implications for peace and social cohesion. All life depends on water but the report found many societies had long been using water faster than it could be replenished annually in rivers and soils, as well as over-exploiting or destroying long-term stores of water in aquifers and wetlands. This had led to water bankruptcy, the report said, with many human water systems past the point at which they could be restored to former levels. The climate crisis was exacerbating the problem by melting glaciers, which store water, and causing whiplashes between extremely dry and wet weather.\n \nProf Kaveh Madani, who led the report, said while not every basin and country was water bankrupt, the world was interconnected by trade and migration, and enough critical systems had crossed this threshold to fundamentally alter global water risk. The result was a world in which 75% of people lived in countries classified as water-insecure or critically water-insecure and 2 billion people lived on ground that is sinking as groundwater aquifers collapse. Conflicts over water had risen sharply since 2010, the report said, while major rivers, such as the Colorado, in the US, and the Murray-Darling system, in Australia, were failing to reach the sea, and \"day zero\" emergencies -- when cities run out of water, such as in Chennai, India -- were escalating. Half of the world's large lakes had shrunk since the early 1990s, the report noted. Even damp nations, such as the UK, were at risk because of reliance on imports of water-dependent food and other products. \"This report tells an uncomfortable truth: many critical water systems are already bankrupt,\" said Madani, of the UN University's Institute for Water, Environment and Health. \"It's extremely urgent [because] no one knows exactly when the whole system would collapse.\"\n \nAbout 70% of fresh water taken by human withdrawals was used for agriculture, but Madani said: \"Millions of farmers are trying to grow more food from shrinking, polluted or disappearing water sources. Water bankruptcy in India or Pakistan, for example, also means an impact on rice exports to a lot of places around the world.\" More than half of global food was grown in areas where water storage was declining or unstable, the report said. Madani said action to deal with water bankruptcy offered a chance to bring countries together in an increasingly fragmented world. \"Water is a strategic, untapped opportunity to the world to create unity within and between nations. It is one of the very rare topics that left and right and north and south all agree on its importance.\" The UN report, which is based on a forthcoming paper in the peer-reviewed journal Water Resources Management, sets out how population growth, urbanization and economic growth have increased water demand for agriculture, industry, energy and cities. \"These pressures have produced a global pattern that is now unmistakable,\" it said.",

      "content": "<p>The Trump administration’s penchant for announcing or celebrating its various dumbass policies via pop culture video game memes marches on, it seems. We talked about this sort of thing previously when the administration built an ICE recruitment video to mimic the intro to the  cartoon show (gotta catch ’em all… get it?), as well as ICE recruiting memes utilizing imagery from the  series of games (aliens… get it?). Despite the blatant and obvious use of imagery and IP from both games, both Nintendo and Microsoft were remarkably silent about it all. What’s wrong, guys? Fascist got your tongue?</p><p>But because they couldn’t be bothered to lift a finger over what is a pretty clear infringement of their trademarks and/or copyright, the administration was emboldened and has done it again. This time it’s in service of announcing something more tame, the reintroduction of whole milk into schools. And the administration did so by <a href=\"https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/2011864079053238516?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">mocking up an image</a> from <a href=\"https://kotaku.com/donald-trump-white-house-stardew-valley-whole-milk-ai-2000660273\">beloved farming sim </a>.</p><p>So, here we have an undoubtedly AI mock-up of an image from , a game I personally adore, with Trump inserted to celebrate this minor thing that RFK Jr.’s crew championed out of Congress. Is whole milk in schools some horrible thing? Look, I only have so much anger to spare, folks, and I’m not killing the budget by spending it on this. But I do have to wonder if developer Concerned Ape will do what Nintendo and Microsoft did not and voice some flavor of objection to the use of its IP by an administration busy doing the fascism elsewhere. While IP enforcement isn’t generally my kink, I sure as shit wouldn’t want  IP associated with Trump. On that, we’ll have to wait and see just how concerned the ape can get, I suppose.</p><p>But there’s also a nice little shitpost easter egg buried in that image. Take a look at the money counter in the upper right corner of the image.</p><p>Trump was the 45th President, claims he won the 2020 election and should have been the 46th President, he  the 47th President, and he’s flirted with the idea that he shouldn’t be bound by silly bullshit like our Constitution and should be allowed another term and become the 48th President. 45464748… get it?</p><p>I do, and it’s frightening rhetoric that is designed to do one of two things. The more innocuous option is that Trump and his cadre of imps enjoys upsetting more than half of the American population by scaring them into thinking he’s going to upend our rule of law and stay in office. It’s cruel. It’s designed purely to cause emotional reactions and “lib tears.” It’s on brand.</p><p>Or it’s a somewhat subtle nod that he’s not fucking around about that at all and intends to stay in power (again) despite how our system is legally designed to work.</p><blockquote><p><em>Trump is the 45th and 47th president of the United States, and has held onto the debunked claims that he won the presidency against Joe Biden in 2020. He has also publicly said he’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-third-term-white-house-methods-rcna198752\">open to a third term</a>, which would be in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/amendments/amendment-xxii\">violation of the 22nd amendment</a>, but Trump doesn’t seem to think the law applies to him. Steve Bannon, the ex-chief-strategist of the Trump administration, has also said that Trump&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/us/politics/president-trump-2028-steve-bannon.html\">will have a third term</a>, while also&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2026/01/10/steve-bannon-2028-campaign-maga\">reportedly planning to run himself</a>. So these numbers seem to be a thinly veiled threat that Trump wants to be president again in 2028.</em></p></blockquote><p>These people aren’t funny, but they are dangerous. Even if this wasn’t meant to be taken seriously, there is no choice but to do so. </p><p>Meanwhile, we’ll see if Concerned Ape acts against the use of its IP, as I think it probably should.</p>",

You aren't building neural pathways; you're just painting over the cracks in your memory.</p><p>\\\nReal learning requires&nbsp;. It requires the mental strain of pulling information&nbsp;&nbsp;of your head, not just stuffing it&nbsp;. This is the principle of&nbsp;, and it is the single most effective way to hack your brain's retention rates.</p><p>\\\nBut creating active recall materials—flashcards, practice tests, mnemonic devices—is exhausting. It takes more time to build the study guide than to study it.</p><p>\\\nThis is where we flip the script. We don't use AI to summarize the text (which is just passive reading on steroids).

It transforms generic LLMs (like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini) from passive assistants into ruthless academic coaches. It doesn't just list facts; it engineers a learning environment that forces your brain to sweat.</p><h2>The Exam Architect System Prompt</h2><p>This prompt is built on the principles of educational psychology. It enforces&nbsp;,&nbsp;&nbsp;(visual descriptions), and&nbsp;&nbsp;(mixing topics). It demands that the AI create specific memory hooks—mnemonics and analogies—that act as \"mental velcro\" for complex ideas.</p><p>\\\n<strong>Copy this instruction set into your AI to turn any topic into a retention-optimized battle plan.</strong></p><pre><code># Role Definition\nYou are an Expert Academic Coach and Study Strategist with 15+ years of experience helping students achieve academic excellence.

You read it. You nod. You forget it five minutes later.</p><p>\\\nThe&nbsp;&nbsp;changes the interaction model. It doesn't just give you the answer; it gives you the&nbsp;.</p><h3>1. The \"Mental Velcro\" Effect</h3><p>Look at the&nbsp;&nbsp;requirement in the prompt. It forces the AI to generate mnemonics and analogies. Instead of memorizing&nbsp;<em>\"The mitochondria produces ATP,\"</em>&nbsp;the prompt pushes the AI to say:&nbsp;<em>\"Think of the Mitochondria as the Power Plant of the cell city. It burns fuel to create electricity (ATP).\"</em>&nbsp;This is&nbsp;. You aren't just storing text; you are storing an image and a concept. It sticks like concrete.</p><h3>2. The Simulation of Testing</h3><p>The prompt explicitly demands&nbsp;<strong>\"Practice Questions that mirror actual exam formats.\"</strong>&nbsp;This is the&nbsp;. By forcing you to answer a question&nbsp;&nbsp;you feel ready, the AI exposes your knowledge gaps immediately. It strips away the illusion that you \"know it\" just because you read the chapter title.</p><h3>3. The \"Cramming\" Safety Net</h3><p>We have all been there. 48 hours to the exam. Panic setting in. The&nbsp;&nbsp;section is dynamic. If you input&nbsp;<em>\"Time Available: 2 days,\"</em>&nbsp;the AI won't give you a month-long curriculum. It will triage. It will identify the \"High-Yield\" topics—the 20% of the material that scores 80% of the points—and build a survival plan. It turns panic into a tactical strike.</p><h2>Stop Reading, Start Engineering</h2><p>Your brain is not a hard drive. It is a biological survival engine that aggressively deletes anything it deems useless. To keep information, you have to convince your brain that it matters.</p><p>\\\nYou do that by connecting new information to old ideas (analogies), by visualizing it (diagrams), and by fighting to retrieve it (practice questions).</p><p>\\\nDon't let the highlighter fool you. Put the \"Exam Architect\" to work. Turn your notes into a gym, and make your brain do the heavy lifting. That is how you walk into the exam room, not just hoping you remember, but&nbsp;&nbsp;you can't forget.</p>",

      "content": "A PwC survey of more than 4,500 CEOs found that over half report no revenue growth or cost savings from their AI investments so far, despite massive spending. Of the 4,454 business leaders surveyed, only 12% saw both lower costs and higher revenue, while 56% saw neither benefit. \"26% saw reduced costs, but nearly as many experienced cost increases,\" adds The Register. From the report: AI adoption remains limited. Even in top use cases like demand generation (22 percent), support services (20 percent), and product development (19 percent), only a minority are deploying AI extensively. Last year, a separate PwC study found that only 14 percent of workers indicated they were using generative AI daily in their work. Despite the CEOs' repsonses, PwC concludes more investment is required. It claims that \"isolated, tactical AI projects\" often don't deliver measurable value, and that tangible returns instead come from enterprise-wide deployments consistent with business strategy. [...]\n \nIn terms of the broader picture, PwC says it found CEO confidence has hit a five-year low, with only 30 percent optimistic about revenue growth (down from 38 percent last year). This points to growing geopolitical risk and intensifying cyber threats, as well as uncertainty over the benefits and downsides of AI. Unsurprisingly, concern remains over tariffs as the Trump administration continues its erratic approach to policy, with almost a third of company chiefs saying tariffs are expected to reduce their company's profit margin in the year ahead. In the U.S., 22 percent indicate their corporation is highly or extremely exposed to tariffs. PwC warns that companies avoiding major investments due to geopolitical uncertainty underperform peers by two percentage points in growth and three points in profit margins.",

      "content": "<p>You’ve built an amazing product, and people are starting to buy it. That’s a huge win. But what happens after that first sale? If you’re only focused on acquiring new customers, you’re missing the biggest opportunity for sustainable growth: turning those customers into a community. This is where a dedicated brand community platform becomes your most powerful tool. Using a brand community platform can change how you connect with the people who matter most.</p><p>Think of it as a private clubhouse for your best customers. It’s a digital space you own and control, unlike a social media group on platforms like Facebook. Here, your users can connect with each other and with your team, building genuine relationships that strengthen brand affinity.</p><p>\\\nThis is much more than a simple forum. Modern community platforms are packed with tools to get people talking. Common community features include discussion forums, direct messaging, member profiles, and an activity feed showing the latest contributions.</p><p>\\\nThe biggest difference from public social media is ownership. You control the data, the user experience, and the rules of engagement. You’re not subject to a surprise algorithm change on Facebook Groups that can crush your reach overnight.</p><h3>Building a Moat Around Your Business</h3><p>When you have a strong online community, it becomes much harder for competitors to steal your customers. People stick around for the connections they’ve made and the value they receive beyond the product itself. It creates a powerful sense of belonging that a simple product can’t replicate.</p><p>\\\nYour community members feel invested in your success. They become your fiercest defenders and advocates. This creates a protective barrier for your brand, making it more resilient to market shifts and competition.</p><p>Let’s get straight to the point. Building a community isn’t just a “nice-to-have” activity. It’s a strategic move that directly impacts your bottom line. It delivers real, measurable results for growing companies.</p><p>\\\nInvesting in your existing customers is one of the smartest moves you can make. A customer community is the perfect place to do it. Let’s look at a few reasons why this approach is so effective.</p><h3>It Creates Unshakeable Customer Loyalty</h3><p>Happy customers might buy from you again. But customers who feel like part of something bigger will stick with you for the long haul. A community turns transactions into relationships, greatly improving the customer experience.</p><p>\\\nThese members become advocates who recommend your products to their friends. According to research from Harvard Business Review, acquiring a new customer costs 5 to 25 times as much as retaining an existing one. A community is your best retention tool.</p><p>\\\nThis is because people start identifying with the brand and other members. They are no longer just using a product; they’re part of an exclusive group. This connection is priceless and helps to set community standards of excellence and belonging.</p><h2>It’s a Goldmine for Product Feedback</h2><p>Do you want to know what your customers really think? Just ask them. A community is the most direct line you’ll ever have to honest, unfiltered user feedback from people who provide valuable insights.</p><p>\\\nYou can run polls, start discussion threads about new features, or create beta testing groups for a new mobile app or a series of online courses. Your most engaged users are often happy to give ideas. They want to see the product they love get even better.</p><p>\\\nThis feedback loop helps you build a product people actually want. You save time and money on development. You stop guessing and start making data-driven decisions based on what your community tells you.</p><h3>It Slashes Your Support Costs</h3><p>As your customer base grows, so does the demand for support. A community can significantly lighten that load. It lets you scale support without just hiring more people.</p><p>\\\nOften, experienced users will jump in to help newer members solve problems. This peer-to-peer support is fast, authentic, and effective. A well-organized community with a resource center makes finding answers easy.</p><p>\\\nMany questions get answered before your support team even sees them. This creates a self-service knowledge base that grows over time. According to Gartner, organizations are moving toward connected, multi-channel approaches. A community is a perfect channel for customers to find answers on their own.</p><h3>It Fuels Your Marketing with Authentic Content</h3><p>Tired of creating marketing content from scratch? A community is a content-generating machine. Effective social media <a href=\"https://lomitpatel.com/articles/management/\">management</a> becomes easier when your own members create the best content.</p><p>\\\nYour members will share stories, photos, and videos of how they use your product. This user-generated content (UGC) is incredibly powerful. It acts as social proof for potential buyers.</p><p>\\\nIt’s more trustworthy than anything your marketing team could create because it comes from real people. You can showcase this content on your social media, website, or ads. It provides an endless stream of authentic marketing material, but make sure you ask for permission first.</p><p>Okay, you’re sold on the idea of building a community. Now, you have to pick the right technology to power it. There are many online community platforms, so it’s important to understand the landscape before choosing a platform.</p><p>\\\nYour choice will depend on your budget, technical resources, and long-term goals. Think carefully about what you need now and what you might need a year from now. Let’s break down the main categories of online community platforms.</p><p>This is the most popular route for <a href=\"https://lomitpatel.com/articles/hypergrowth-startup-myths-your-guide-to-entrepreneurial-success/\">startups</a> and small businesses. A SaaS (Software as a Service) platform means another company hosts the software for you. You pay a monthly or annual subscription fee for access from platforms like <a href=\"https://www.tyb.xyz/\">TYB</a>.</p><p>\\\nThe biggest benefit is ease of use. You can get an online community up and running in days, not months. The provider handles all technical aspects, including updates, security, and maintenance, often with a branded app for iOS and Android.</p><p>\\\nMany offer a white-label community option, allowing you to use your own branding. The downside is that you have less control over customization. But for most companies, the speed and convenience of a white-label community app are well worth it.</p><p>If you have a development team, an open-source option might be a good fit. With this model, you get the core software for free. But you are responsible for hosting, customizing, and maintaining it.</p><p>\\\nThis gives you total control over the look and feel of your community. You can build any feature you can imagine. You’re not tied to a specific vendor’s roadmap.</p><p>\\\nHowever, the total cost of ownership can be higher than you think. You need to factor in server costs, developer salaries, and ongoing maintenance. This path requires a serious commitment of technical resources and dedicated management software.</p><p>This option is typically reserved for large, enterprise-level companies. A custom-built community is designed and coded from the ground up. It’s designed to meet very specific business needs and can be seen in options like Mighty Pro.</p><p>\\\nThe main advantage is that it does exactly what you want it to. Every feature is built to your exact specifications. It can integrate deeply with your existing systems and enhance user experience in specific ways.</p><p>\\\nThe disadvantages are significant. It is costly and takes a very long time to build. For almost all startups, a SaaS or open-source solution is a much better starting point for their community plan.</p><h2>A Simple Plan to Make Your Choice</h2><p>Feeling a bit overwhelmed by the options? Don’t worry. You can figure this out by following a few simple steps. This process will give you clarity and help you select from the many digital platforms available.</p><p>\\\nIt helps make sure you choose a platform that truly serves your business. Don’t rush this decision. A thoughtful choice now prevents major headaches later.</p><h3>First, Figure Out Your “Why”</h3><p>Before you look at a single feature, define your goals. What do you want this community to accomplish? Write it down. Are you trying to reduce support tickets, gather product feedback, increase customer retention, or host events?</p><p>\\\nYour goals will point you to the right features. If your goal is support, a strong Q&amp;A function is critical. If your goal is engagement through community learning, look for features that facilitate online courses and live streaming.</p><p>\\\nIf you plan to host events, ensure the platform offers robust tools for managing a single live event or multiple simultaneous events. Be clear on your primary objective before you start free trials or request a live demo.</p><h3>Look at Your Budget and Resources</h3><p>Next, be honest about what you can afford. This includes both money and time. A community platform isn’t a “set it and forget it” tool; it requires active community engagement.</p><p>\\\nYou need to factor in the platform's subscription cost. You also need to budget time for community management. Someone has to welcome new members, start conversations, and moderate the space to help the community thrive.</p><p>\\\nCommunity management is a real job. Not having a dedicated person is one of the biggest reasons online communities fail. Make sure you can commit the necessary resources with the right community management software.</p><h3>Create a Feature Wish List</h3><p>Now, it’s time to think about features. Based on your goals, make a list of what you absolutely need. Here are some common community features to consider.</p><ul><li>Discussion forums and categories.</li><li>Member profiles and direct messaging.</li><li>A comprehensive member directory.</li><li>Event management for virtual or in-person gatherings.</li><li>Gamification, like badges and leaderboards.</li><li>Live streams and video hosting capabilities.</li><li>Integrations with tools like your CRM.</li><li>Robust analytics and reporting dashboards.</li><li>Strong moderation tools to keep the space safe.</li><li>A branded mobile app for iOS and Android.</li></ul><p>\\\nSeparate your list into “must-haves” and “nice-to-haves”. This will help you compare different platforms more effectively. Don’t pay for a bunch of advanced analytics or <a href=\"https://lomitpatel.com/articles/how-ai-can-make-marketing-more-effective-without-touching-creative/\">AI</a> features you’ll never use.</p><h3>Always Test the User Experience</h3><p>Finally, never choose a platform without seeing a demo. The user experience is everything. If the platform is confusing or hard to use, your members won’t stick around.</p><p>\\\nPay attention to how easy it is to sign up, create a post, and find information. Look at it from a member’s perspective. Also, check out the backend to see how easy it is for your team to manage and send messages.</p><p>\\\nAsk for a free trial if possible. Spend some time actually using the product. This is the best way to know if it’s the right fit for you and your future community members.</p><p>Building a tribe of loyal fans is one of the most durable advantages you can create for your business. It’s a long-term investment that pays off in countless ways. Your community becomes a source of feedback, support, content, and revenue.</p><p>\\\nChoosing the right brand community platform is the first critical step in bringing that vision to life. The best platforms start by understanding your goals and providing the tools to foster genuine connections. This is how you make your community accessible and empower users to connect with one another.</p><p>\\\nUltimately, a branded online space gives your customers a place to call home. It transforms them from passive buyers into active participants in your brand’s story. That is a powerful way to ensure your business continues to grow and prosper.</p>",

      "content": "An anonymous reader quotes a report from TechCrunch: Meta's Oversight Board is tackling a case focused on Meta's ability to permanently disable user accounts. Permanent bans are a drastic action, locking people out of their profiles, memories, friend connections, and, in the case of creators and businesses, their ability to market and communicate with fans and customers. This is the first time in the organization's five-year history as an oversight body that permanent account bans have been a subject of the Oversight Board's focus, the organization notes.\n \nThe case being reviewed isn't exactly one of an everyday user. Instead, the case involves a high-profile Instagram user who repeatedly violated Meta's Community Standards by posting visual threats of violence against a female journalist, anti-gay slurs against politicians, content depicting a sex act, allegations of misconduct against minorities, and more. The account had not accumulated enough strikes to be automatically disabled, but Meta made the decision to permanently ban the account. The Board's materials didn't name the account in question, but its recommendations could impact others who post content that targets public figures with abuse, harassment, and threats, as well as users who have their accounts permanently banned without receiving transparent explanations.\n \nMeta referred this specific case to the Board, which included five posts made in the year before the account was permanently disabled. The Board says it's looking for input about several key issues: how permanent bans can be processed fairly, the effectiveness of its current tools to protect public figures and journalists from repeated abuse and threats of violence, the challenges of identifying off-platform content, whether punitive measures effectively shape online behaviors, and best practices for transparent reporting on account enforcement decisions. [...] Whether the Oversight Board has any real sway to address issues on Meta's platform continues to be debated, of course. [...] After the Oversight Board issues its policy recommendations to Meta, the company has 60 days to respond. The Board is also soliciting public comments on this topic. The report notes that Meta's Oversight Board is able to overturn individual moderation decisions and offer recommendations, but largely sidelined from major policy shifts driven by Mark Zuckerberg.",

      "content": "<p>The FTC remains politicized. One commissioner is leading the way—when it suits him.</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission under Lina Khan was not a well-run institution. I wrote about this at the time, <a href=\"https://www.city-journal.org/article/ftc-chair-lina-khan-fails-upward\">often</a> and <a href=\"https://www.city-journal.org/article/lina-khans-norm-busting-legacy\">at length</a>, and I regret nothing. But wow—wow—would you be forgiven for thinking that the goal of new management is to make Khan’s tenure look good by comparison. There is plenty to say about this sorry state of affairs, but for now let’s focus on a single commissioner.</p><p>Why just one? Isn’t the FTC a multi-member body? Well, these days the agency is something of a husk. President Trump has purported to fire two commissioners—the Democrats, naturally. The FTC Act says he cannot do that, but the Supreme Court appears poised to bless the move on constitutional grounds (<a href=\"https://www.theunpopulist.net/p/the-supreme-court-should-resist-handing\">a serious mistake</a>). A third commissioner, Melissa Holyoak, recently departed after a brief stint. And <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-14/ftc-s-ferguson-eyed-by-white-house-to-oversee-new-fraud-unit\">rumors swirl</a> that the chair, Andrew Ferguson, will soon take on a second job overseeing a nationwide fraud unit at the Justice Department.</p><p>That leaves Mark Meador. He may soon be the lone commissioner who has not been defenestrated, jumped ship, or been pulled into a dual role.</p><p>Last week I saw Meador speak at an <a href=\"https://www.concurrences.com/fr/evenement/the-tech-antitrust-conference-6859\">antitrust conference</a> in the Bay Area. As a matter of policy, <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/meador-concurrences-keynote.pdf\">his remarks</a> were not to my taste. He aired a familiar set of complaints about modern tech products. Apple’s “liquid glass” is confusing; Google’s AI overviews—that stuff that now appears above the search results—are annoying; AI-generated cat videos, and short-form video more generally, are bad for the soul. It is certainly true that tech companies have many bad ideas. It does not follow that Mark Meador knows better. Yet he spoke with complete confidence in his own superior vision for the tech industry. He knows what the social media market should look like. He knows how to “win the AI race .” The man is, apparently, a prophet.</p><p>Some of Meador’s gripes were not really about products at all, but about people. People  short-form video. The government, Meador seemed to suggest, must protect them from themselves. You might say that Meador wants to replace the consumer-welfare standard, under which the FTC protects markets that work to give people what they want, with a moral-welfare standard, under which the FTC pushes markets to give people what they are to want—as determined by Mark Meador.</p><p>Maybe people should be more virtuous. But what business is that of the FTC? The FTC Act makes commissioners competition regulators, not philosopher-kings or morality police.</p><p>One European lawyer I spoke with at the conference seemed rather taken with Meador’s speech. He wants to crack down on Big Tech, after all; what’s not to like? I tried to explain how Meador plainly judges companies by a moral code, and why that code should give any upstanding European pause. Meador is <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/antitrust-policy-for-the-conservative-meador.pdf\">committed to</a> “the just ordering of society that best facilitates human flourishing.” He speaks unabashedly of the need for “beauty and virtue,” “moral values,” and “tradition and custom.” He peppers his writing (yes, his  writing) with theological language, referring to human beings as “embodied souls seeking communion with their fellow man and their Creator.” The undertone—the dog whistle, if you will—is not Brussels-style social democracy. It is national conservatism, if not flat out Christian nationalism.</p><p>Which brings me to my real objection to Meador’s appearance. In Palo Alto, he was mild, reasonable, even conciliatory. The speech itself was a little misguided but pleasant enough. The problem was what it concealed: the other Mark Meador, and the other FTC.</p><p>In his speech, Meador called for apolitical enforcement. Antitrust, he said, should not serve an “unrelated political agenda.” It should not target disfavored industries. He and the agency should not “make decisions according to how political winds are blowing.”</p><p>How rich. Maximally politicized enforcement has characterized the Trump administration at large, and the Trump FTC in particular. Consider the Omnicom–IPG settlement. The FTC allowed two major advertising firms to merge, but only after restricting the new entity’s ability to withhold advertising dollars based on a publisher’s viewpoints. The settlement is a <a href=\"https://techfreedom.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/the-politicization-of-antitrust-part-IV-concurrences.pdf\">transparent assault</a> on advertising firms’ First Amendment right to boycott publishers on grounds of social or ideological principle. It is also a nakedly political effort to redirect advertising dollars toward right-wing outlets.</p><p>Or consider the FTC’s hapless social-media “censorship” inquiry. <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/policy/public-comments/request-public-comments-regarding-technology-platform-censorship\">This move</a>, too, is an attack on First Amendment rights—this time, platforms’ right to moderate content as they see fit. And this move, too, is aimed at helping the right, specifically those right-wing speakers who insist—<a href=\"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/orwellian-doesnt-mean-what-you-think\">baselessly</a>, <a href=\"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/influencers-bullshitters-losing-shared-reality\">by and large</a>—that platforms have “silenced” them. Take also the FTC’s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/08/technology/ftc-andrew-ferguson-regulator.html\">foray into debates</a> over gender medicine. The FTC is not a medical regulator; it has no expertise in this area. But transgender issues are at the center of the culture war, so the agency could not resist weighing in, thumb firmly on the scale for the political right.</p><p>For Meador to sit in Palo Alto and sermonize about ignoring political winds was an insult to anyone paying attention to his agency or the administration it serves.</p><p>Equally striking was the contrast between Meador’s tone inside the conference room and the tone he and the FTC adopt elsewhere. In his remarks, Meador urged listeners not to “draw up battle lines.” Washington and Silicon Valley, he said, should root for each other’s success. During the Q&amp;A, he endorsed a “just the facts, ma’am” approach. He expressed distaste for heated rhetoric from private parties—inflated claims about the stakes of litigation or boasts about whipping the FTC in court. Such talk amounts, he complained, to “melodramatic atmospherics.”</p><p>But Mark Meador and the Trump FTC do melodramatic atmospherics with the best of them. Last year, for instance, the FTC <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/events/2025/06/attention-economy-tech-firms-exploit-children\">convened a conference</a> titled “The Attention Economy: How Big Tech Firms Exploit Children and Hurt Families.” The title was all too fitting: the whole event was slanted, overheated, and self-righteous. Meador led the charge. He <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/cmr-mark-r-meador-attention-economy-keynote-06-03-2025.pdf\">likened</a> “the battle over the ‘attention economy’” to “the fight against Big Tobacco.” He argued that social media companies sell an addictive and harmful product; that they must keep children hooked, “craving the next fix, the next puff, the next notification”; and that they peddle lies in their defense.</p><p>No doubt this jeremiad resonates with some. <a href=\"https://corbinkbarthold.substack.com/p/calm-down-about-the-kids\">I think it’s nonsense</a>. But the point here is not whether Meador is right or wrong. It’s that he is two-faced. In Silicon Valley, he presents himself as mildly uneasy about short-form video. Elsewhere, he portrays social media companies as irredeemable reprobates, scarcely distinguishable from cigarette manufacturers. The Meador we saw projected reasonableness. In reality, he is a fanatic.</p><p>What Meador concealed about himself pales, though, beside what he concealed about the FTC. Excuse me, commissioner, did you just say you oppose overheated rhetoric? Where were you after the FTC lost its antitrust case against Meta?</p><p>The defeat was not surprising. The case was weak from the outset, failing to grapple with competitors such as YouTube and TikTok. It was dismissed in <a href=\"https://assets.bwbx.io/documents/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/rww8JGP.20cc/v0\">a careful opinion</a> written by an able judge. That judge, James Boasberg, also <a href=\"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/trump-constitutional-perdition-el-salvador-bukele-renditions-supreme-court\">ruled against</a> the Trump administration’s reprehensible efforts to hustle men, without due process, to a prison in El Salvador. In response to that ruling, some GOP lawmakers launched a campaign to impeach him. The case for impeachment is risible. But that did not stop the FTC from exploiting it. After the Meta loss, an FTC spokesperson, Joe Simonson, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/18/judge-rules-that-meta-doesnt-have-a-social-media-monopoly-00656616\">sneered</a>: “The deck was always stacked against us with Judge Boasberg, who is currently facing articles of impeachment.”</p><p>This statement is an embarrassment. Everyone at the FTC should be mortified by it. But there it is. Mark Meador has no standing to lecture others about decorum.</p><p>Nor should we expect this to be an isolated lapse. The second Trump FTC has been staffed with people who are terminally online. In a sense, they are the dog that caught the car: they have memed their way into an amount of power they are neither competent nor responsible enough to wield.</p><p>This became obvious when the FTC set out to punish Media Matters. The organization had published a study finding that ads appeared next to hate speech on the alt-right-friendly platform X. The agency then launched a sweeping investigation (another example, contra Meador, of the FTC’s overtly political posture). The courts <a href=\"https://media.cadc.uscourts.gov/orders/docs/2025/10/25-5302LDSN2.pdf\">blocked the probe</a>, finding it to be retaliation for constitutionally protected speech. Evidence of a retaliatory motive included, almost comically, some FTC staffers’ big fat mouths. Before joining the agency, a cadre of young edgelords had been spending their time spouting off on social media. Joe Simonson (he of the appalling comment after the Meta loss) had mocked Media Matters for employing “a number of stupid and resentful Democrats.” Another staffer had called the group “scum of the earth.”</p><p>This is the backdrop to Meador’s calls, in Palo Alto, to lower the temperature. Spare us, commissioner.</p><p>The word at the conference was that the FTC is in disarray. Many experienced attorneys and economists accepted one of the Trump administration’s buyout offers. Others concluded, after a return-to-office mandate, that if working for the FTC was going to be a hassle—don’t forget those “five things you did this week” emails!—they might as well leave for higher pay. I heard this from a former government official who had himself recently decamped to private practice. When I asked this refugee about the FTC’s ambitions to police social media or wade into gender medicine, he said he would not be surprised if the agency ultimately accomplishes very little. Who knows. But the intuition is sound: you cannot decimate and demoralize an agency and then expect it to move regulatory mountains.</p><p>When Meador was appointed, Tyler Cowen summed things up nicely, <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/05/the-new-ftc-commissioner-mark-meader.html?utm_\">concluding that</a> he “is just flat out terrible,” including for his inability to maintain “a basic level of professionalism.” Is he lonely at the top? With the agency hollowed out, Meador may be a king without a throne. One can only hope that his capacity for mischief will be constrained by the wreckage below.</p><p><em>Corbin K.

Very pro-free-expression. One tiny problem: the very same day, a federal judge <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.454120/gov.uscourts.cand.454120.75.0.pdf\">refused to dismiss a lawsuit</a> against Secretary of State Marco Rubio over the US government doing… essentially the same thing. Hat tip to the excellent Chris Geidner from <a href=\"https://www.lawdork.com/\">Lawdork</a> for <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/chrisgeidner.bsky.social/post/3mcnh3iknbs2u\">calling out the contrast</a> on Bluesky.</p><p>The lawsuit, brought by Stanford Daily Publishing Corporation along with two anonymous noncitizen students, challenges the government’s practice of <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/12/09/how-ices-plan-to-monitor-social-media-threatens-not-just-privacy-but-civic-participation/\">revoking visas and initiating deportation proceedings</a> against people lawfully present in the United States based on their speech—including, notably, <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/07/24/you-shouldnt-have-to-make-your-social-media-public-to-get-a-visa/\">their social media activity</a>. As <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/05/14/trump-administrations-targeting-of-international-students-jeopardizes-free-speech-and-privacy-online/\">we’ve covered</a> here at Techdirt, the State Department has made reviewing social media profiles a regular part of the visa process, and has been actively targeting people for their online expression.</p><p>The court’s ruling lays out in pretty damning detail just how aggressively the government has been going after people for their protected speech. From the order:</p><blockquote><p><em>In March 2025, DHS and ICE began aggressively targeting lawfully present noncitizens for protected speech, particularly at universities. Plaintiffs point to the arrests of Mahmoud Khalil, Rümeysa Öztürk, and Mohsen Mahdawi as emblematic of the Government’s enforcement strategy.</em></p></blockquote><p>And what exactly did these individuals do that warranted arrest, detention, and deportation proceedings? Let’s see:</p><blockquote><p><em>Ms. Öztürk is a PhD student at Tufts University who is lawfully present in the United States on an F-1 student visa. Ms. Öztürk co-authored an opinion article in the Tufts student newspaper that criticized the university’s refusal to adopt several resolutions approved by the undergraduate student senate urging the University to, among other things, recognize a genocide in Gaza and divest from Israeli companies… On March 25, 2025, six plain-clothes federal officers surrounded Ms. Öztürk on the street outside her home, detained her, and transported her to a Louisiana immigration jail.</em></p></blockquote><p>She <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/03/27/trumps-secret-police-are-now-disappearing-students-for-their-op-eds/\">wrote an op-ed</a> in a student newspaper. A DHS spokesperson claimed her editorial “glorified and supported terrorists.” It did not. It criticized the university’s policies, and did nothing to glorify or support “terrorists.”</p><p>The court also details what government officials have been saying publicly about this enforcement strategy.</p><p>DHS posted on Twitter that anyone who thinks they can “hide behind the First Amendment to advocate for anti-American and anti-Semitic violence and terrorism—think again.” Stephen Miller bragged that “The State Department has revoked tens of thousands of visas, and they’re just getting started on tens of thousands more.” The US government isn’t hiding the fact that they’re combing US social media to figure out who to detain.</p><p>One of the plaintiffs—Jane Doe—is on the Canary Mission website, a private list of people which MAGA folks claim are anti-Israel and which the government has apparently been using as a shopping list for who to kidnap and deport. From the ruling:</p><blockquote><p><em>Jane Doe was listed on the Canary Mission website, which is an anonymously and privately run website that publishes personal information of individuals and organizations that the Canary Mission personally deems “anti-Israel.” In their motion and during the hearing, the Government explained that DHS had asked ICE to generate “reports” for the State Department on individuals listed on the Canary Mission website to aid in decision-making about visa revocations. Notably, before the Government brought enforcement actions against them, Mahmoud Khalil, Rümeysa Öztürk, and Mohsen Mahdawi all had profiles published about them on the Canary Mission website.</em></p></blockquote><p>The US government is actively monitoring people’s social media, revoking visas over protected speech, and using an anonymous website that doxxes pro-Palestinian activists as a source for enforcement targets.</p><p>And then the State Department has the audacity to criticize Nicaragua for “detaining Nicaraguans for liking posts online.”</p><p>Remember, the State Department’s tweet said that this kind of behavior shows “how paranoid and illegitimate” the regime is. We agree.</p><p>The hypocrisy is coming so fast it’s hard to keep up, but this one deserves special mention because the State Department is literally condemning other countries for the exact policy it’s implementing, and getting called out about it in court.</p><p>Nicaragua is paranoid and illegitimate for targeting social media activity, but when the US does it, we’re… protecting national security? Fighting antisemitism? The framing changes but the underlying action is the same: using the power of the state to punish people for their online expression.</p><p>The court, for its part, found that the plaintiffs’ fears of enforcement were entirely reasonable given the government’s very public campaign of targeting people for their speech:</p><blockquote><p><em>Jane Doe and John Doe have sufficiently alleged that their behavior falls into the crosshairs of the Government’s stated enforcement priorities. The Government has also not disavowed plans to continue invoking the Revocation and Deportation Provisions.</em></p></blockquote><p>In other words: the government isn’t even pretending it won’t keep doing this. And yet somehow it’s Nicaragua that needs to be lectured about freedom?</p><p>Maybe someone at the Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs should walk down the hall and have a chat with their colleagues about what “freedom means ending the regime’s cycle of repression” actually looks like in practice. Because right now, the State Department’s position appears to be: targeting people for their social media activity is evidence of a paranoid, illegitimate regime—unless we’re the ones doing it.</p>",

He said there could be a future with 5% to 10% GDP growth and 10% unemployment. \"That's not a combination we've almost ever seen before,\" he said. \"There's gonna need to be some role for government in the displacement that's this macroeconomically large.\" \n\nAmodei painted a potential \"nightmare\" scenario that AI could bring to society if not properly checked, laying out a future in which 10 million people -- 7 million in Silicon Valley and the rest scattered elsewhere -- could \"decouple\" from the rest of society, enjoying as much as 50% GPD growth while others were left behind. \"I think this is probably a time to worry less about disincentivizing growth and worry more about making sure that everyone gets a part of that growth,\" Amodei said. He noted that was \"the opposite of the prevailing sentiment now,\" but the reality of technological change will force those ideas to change.",

For an AI agent to act effectively on behalf of a user, it would need unilateral access to apps storing sensitive information such as credit card data and contacts, Whittaker said. The data that the agent stores in its context window is at greater risk of being compromised. \n\nWhittaker called this \"breaking the blood-brain barrier between the application and the operating system.\" \"Our encryption no longer matters if all you have to do is hijack this context window,\" she said.",

While DHS officials love to claim any refusal to house federal officers is unamerican af, the reality is that local business owners don’t want the negative publicity and negative public action housing ICE officers might provoke.</p><p>You’d think a shrewd businessperson such as Donald Trump would understand.

And I genuinely need you to read this, because summarizing it doesn’t do justice to how absolutely deranged it is:</p><blockquote><p><em>Dear Jonas: Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America. Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China, and why do they have a ‘right of ownership’ anyway? There are no written documents, it’s only that a boat landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also. I have done more for NATO than any other person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States. The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland. Thank you! President DJT</em></p></blockquote><p>Let me be absolutely clear about what you just read: The President of the United States is explicitly stating that because he didn’t receive an award he wanted, he “no longer feel[s] an obligation to think purely of Peace” and is therefore justified in threatening to forcibly take territory from a NATO ally.</p><p>This is the stated reasoning. From the President. In writing. To a foreign head of state.</p><p>And this only came after Trump first <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g5345ylk0o\">announced illegal and unnecessary tariffs</a> on products from Europe for not just handing him Greenland (which is actually a tax on Americans, since that’s who pays the tariffs). Støre’s initial text message to Trump was an attempt to get him to calm down and to stop doing ridiculously antagonistic shit like taxing Americans because foreign countries won’t just hand Trump an entire territory he’s unhealthily obsessed with.</p><p>I want to focus on a few layers of insanity here, because they compound on each other in ways that should be making every American deeply uncomfortable.</p><p><strong>First: Trump is yelling at the wrong country about the wrong thing.</strong></p><p>The Nobel Peace Prize is not awarded by the Norwegian government. It is awarded by an independent five-member committee chosen by Norway’s parliament. Prime Minister Støre had to <a href=\"https://www.regjeringen.no/en/whats-new/statement-from-the-prime-minister/id3146486/\">patiently explain this (again)</a> in response:</p><blockquote><p><em>As regards the Nobel Peace Prize, I have on several occasions clearly explained to Trump what is well known, namely that it is an independent Nobel Committee, and not the Norwegian government, that awards the prize</em></p></blockquote><p>This is not obscure information. This is how the Nobel Prize has worked since 1901. The fact that the President either doesn’t know this or doesn’t care is already disqualifying. But we’re just getting started.</p><p>Also, Greenland is a territory of Denmark. Denmark, notably, is not Norway. Norway is not Denmark. Greenland is not controlled by Norway, just like Norway’s government doesn’t determine who gets the Nobel Peace Prize and… why are we even talking about this?</p><p><strong>Second: He’s openly admitting his Greenland obsession has nothing to do with national security.</strong></p><p>For months, the official line has been that acquiring Greenland is <a href=\"https://www.kron4.com/news/national/cruz-says-it-is-overwhelmingly-in-americas-national-interest-to-acquire-greenland/\">somehow essential for American national security</a>. But here’s Trump, in his own words, saying the quiet part extremely loud: the real reason is that <strong>his feelings got hurt over a prize</strong>. The “national security” framing was always <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/16/europeans-befuddled-by-trumps-russian-rationale-for-greenland-00734955\">pretextual nonsense</a>, and now we have the President himself confirming it. Beyond the fact that the threat to take Greenland has, itself, done a tremendous amount of <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/video/former-us-ambassador-denmark-trump-greenland-push-weakens-national-security/\">damage to US national security</a>, Trump’s linking it to the prize undermines every other claim.</p><p>If Greenland were actually critical to American security interests, the Nobel Committee’s decisions would be completely irrelevant. The fact that Trump is explicitly linking the two reveals the entire enterprise as what it always was: the wounded ego of a man who desperately wants validation and will threaten sovereign nations to get it.</p><p><strong>Third: “There are no written documents” is weapons-grade historical illiteracy.</strong></p><p>Denmark’s connection to Greenland stretches back over 300 years. There are, in fact, extensive written documents, including treaties that the United States itself has signed recognizing Danish sovereignty over Greenland. A 2004 defense pact between the U.S. and Denmark—which already grants the US tremendous rights to make use of Greenland for the US military—explicitly recognizes Greenland as “an equal part of the Kingdom of Denmark.” In 1916, when Denmark sold what are now the U.S. Virgin Islands to the United States, the treaty included an explicit clause where the U.S. agreed not to object to Danish interests in Greenland.</p><p>But sure, “there are no written documents” and “boats landing” is apparently the level of historical analysis we’re working with now. (We won’t even get into the question of what it means for the United States that “boats landing here hundreds of years ago” gives you no rights to the land).</p><p><strong>Fourth: He’s threatening to invade a country because he didn’t get a Peace Prize.</strong></p><p>Like, what the fuck are we even doing here?</p><p>Also, no, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y3599gx4qo\">he didn’t stop</a> “8 wars PLUS.” Stop letting him get away with lying about this. He’s taking credit for a ton of other things that weren’t wars, that aren’t over, or that he had nothing to do with.</p><p><strong>Fifth: This is 25th Amendment territory, and everyone knows it.</strong></p><p>The 25th Amendment exists precisely for situations where a President is “unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.” When the President openly states that his bellicose foreign policy is being driven by a grudge over not receiving a peace prize—and that this grudge means he no longer feels obligated to pursue peace—we are describing someone whose judgment is fundamentally compromised.</p><p>As the Daily Beast put it:</p><blockquote><p><em>It is clearly not rational to start a war because your feelings got hurt by not winning a prize that you were not even eligible for. It is certainly not rational to sabotage the country’s national security—emboldening Russia and China—over those hurt feelings.</em></p></blockquote><p>But here’s what’s actually happening: basically everyone in a position to do something about this is pretending everything is fine.</p><p><strong>The normalization machine is working overtime.</strong></p><p>The same people who would be absolutely losing their minds if any Democratic president sent a message like this to a foreign leader are now either silent or actively running interference. A decade ago, as a political rival, Ted Cruz once warned that we’d wake up one day to find a <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/zacharyfolk/2026/01/18/ted-cruz-lauds-trumps-america-first-greenland-threats-after-viral-clip-bashing-president-resurfaced/\">President Trump had nuked Denmark</a>. And yet now he’s <a href=\"https://www.kron4.com/news/national/cruz-says-it-is-overwhelmingly-in-americas-national-interest-to-acquire-greenland/\">actively supporting</a> Trump’s lunacy.</p><p>Or take Missouri Senator Eric Schmitt. In December of 2024 after Trump was re-elected, but before he took office, the Senator went on TV to talk up how Trump was the non-interventionist President <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2024/12/15/sen_eric_schmitt_the_public_is_done_with_the_forever_wars_and_foreign_policy_not_in_americas_interest.html\">who would keep the US out of foreign wars</a>.</p><blockquote><p><em>Well, I think that’s a longer discussion and a discussion that President Trump had in his first term. I do think we’re entering a new phase, though, of realism in this country.</em><strong><em>President Trump will be less interventionist</em></strong><em>, and we get back to our core national interests. Principally defending the homeland, the Indo-Pacific, and China, and so I think that’s a longer term conversation.</em></p><p><em>We’ll make sure everybody is safe over there. That’s the first order of business, but, again,</em><strong><em>I think people have had enough of these forever wars all across the world</em></strong><em>. We can’t be everywhere all at once all the time. That’s just not our capability, so I think that I’m welcoming President Trump coming with this agenda.</em></p></blockquote><p>Yet, over the weekend he tweeted out a long thread arguing that “territorial expansion is a time-honored American tradition” and that it’s “in our blood” to acquire Greenland (leaving out that the examples he gave of the Louisiana Purchase and Alaska did not come with a mad President demanding we get the land or we’d attack).</p><p>And the most galling part? Everyone knows. Everyone knows this is insane. The Republicans know it. The Democrats know it. Foreign leaders definitely know it. The Norwegian Prime Minister had to respond to an unhinged text message from the leader of the free world as if it were a normal diplomatic communication. Denmark’s foreign minister had to issue statements about how “you can’t threaten your way to ownership of Greenland” as if that’s a thing that should ever need to be said to an American president.</p><p>Rep. Don Bacon, a Republican from Nebraska who is not seeking reelection (funny how that works), <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/international/5695971-trump-bacon-greenland-letter/\">actually said what everyone is thinking</a>. When he saw the letter, he simply tweeted: “Very embarrassing conduct.”</p><p>That’s the most honest assessment you’ll get from a sitting Republican member of Congress. And notice he’s only willing to say it because he’s on his way out.</p><p><strong>What are the actual consequences here?</strong></p><p>Trump has now announced 10% tariffs on goods from the UK, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Finland—all NATO allies—as punishment for not supporting his acquisition of Greenland. When asked if he’ll follow through, he said “<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g5345ylk0o\">100%</a>.” It’s a silly question all around, but to date, much of the media had treated Trump’s weird infatuation with Greenland as if it were a joke, rather than deadly serious.</p><p>When asked if he would use military force to seize Greenland, the President of the United States responded: “No comment.”</p><p>The President won’t rule out military action against NATO allies because he didn’t get a peace prize.</p><p>Because he didn’t get a  prize. Peace. Prize.</p><p>The EU is holding an emergency summit. Denmark has said that U.S. military action in Greenland would spell the end of NATO. European allies are deploying troops—symbolic numbers, but troops nonetheless—to Greenland. We are watching in real-time as the post-World War II international order that the United States built and led for 80 years crumbles because one man’s ego couldn’t handle not getting an award.</p><p>And Russian state media? <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c17zpvkddpzo\">They’re gloating</a>. As the BBC reported, pro-Kremlin outlets are full of praise for Trump’s Greenland push, which kinda highlights that Trump’s claim that we need Greenland to protect us from Russia is bullshit. Russia is loving this mess. Putin couldn’t have designed a more effective way to fracture NATO if he’d tried. And he tried.</p><blockquote><p><em>“Standing in the way of the US president’s historic breakthrough is the stubbornness of Copenhagen and the mock solidarity of intransigent European countries, including so-called friends of America, Britain and France,” writes Rossiyskaya Gazeta.</em></p><p><em>“Europe does not need the American greatness that Trump is promoting. Brussels is counting on ‘drowning’ the US president in the midterm congressional elections, on preventing him from concluding the greatest deal of his life.”</em></p></blockquote><p><strong>This is not normal. Stop pretending it is.</strong></p><p>I’ve written before about how Techdirt has become something of <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/03/04/why-techdirt-is-now-a-democracy-blog-whether-we-like-it-or-not/\">a democracy blog</a>, because when the fundamental institutions that allow for things like innovation and free speech are under attack, everything else becomes secondary. This is one of those moments.</p><p>A President who openly admits his foreign policy is driven by personal grievances over awards he didn’t receive is not fit for office. A President who threatens to invade NATO allies and won’t rule out military force against them is a danger to global stability. A President who doesn’t understand (or doesn’t care) that the Nobel Committee is independent from the Norwegian government has no business conducting diplomacy.</p><p>These aren’t controversial statements. They’re obvious. Everyone knows it.</p><p>But none of the political elite want to act. For nearly a decade now there’s been this weird paralysis where opposing Trumpian nonsense is treated as simply not allowed. Why? Because his most vocal supporters might get upset? So fucking what. He’s ripping apart the global order over a personal grievance. He’s already destroyed so much goodwill and soft power that it will take decades to recover—if recovery is even possible.</p><p>The fact that it’s taken until now to even begin discussing the 25th Amendment is already a travesty. That no one with actual power will do anything about it is the real indictment.</p><p>We’re protecting a mad king because those who could stop it are too scared of random troll accounts on X (not to mention the world’s richest man) possibly mocking them for not being loyal enough to the mad king.</p>",

      "content": "<blockquote><p>The full-stack developer's new workstation isn't a desk—it's your face. Welcome to the era of augmented development.</p></blockquote><p>Imagine debugging a complex microservices architecture while simultaneously monitoring real-time logs in your peripheral vision, whispering commands to spin up Docker containers, and receiving code review notifications without ever touching your phone. This isn't science fiction—it's the emerging reality of full-stack development with Meta Glasses and similar smart eyewear. As these devices evolve from camera-centric accessories to sophisticated&nbsp;<strong>spatial computing platforms</strong>, they're poised to fundamentally rewire how developers interact with their entire technology stack.</p><p>The market signals this shift clearly—smart glasses sales have more than tripled from 2024 levels, and Meta's higher-end display models face unprecedented demand despite premium pricing. For developers, this represents more than just another gadget; it's potentially the most significant workflow transformation since dual monitors became standard. This guide explores how forward-thinking developers can leverage these devices today and build for their future.</p><h3>1. Context-Aware Development Environment</h3><p>Unlike traditional displays that demand focused attention, smart glasses offer&nbsp;&nbsp;of your development ecosystem. Imagine having crucial information—API status, build processes, error rates, or database connections—visually overlaid in your workspace without breaking your coding flow. This transforms situational awareness from a disruptive tab-switching exercise into a seamless, continuous experience.</p><p>Meta's Ray-Ban Display incorporates a&nbsp;&nbsp;that remains invisible to others but provides developers with a persistent information layer. This enables what developers on Reddit forums describe as \"ambient coding\"—maintaining awareness of system health while deeply focused on implementation logic. The key shift is from seeking information to having it gracefully find you.</p><h3>2. The Neural Wristband: A Developer's Secret Weapon</h3><p>While the glasses capture attention, Meta's companion&nbsp;&nbsp;represents a potentially revolutionary input method for developers. Using electromyography (EMG) to detect muscle signals before physical movement occurs, it enables&nbsp;&nbsp;without requiring hands to be visible to cameras.</p><p>Consider these developer applications:</p><ul><li><strong>Gesture-controlled IDE operations</strong>: Subtle finger movements could execute complex Git commands (), navigate between tabs, or trigger debugger breakpoints without touching keyboard shortcuts</li><li>: While typing code with both hands, wrist rotation could adjust terminal font size or switch between monitoring dashboards</li><li><strong>Accessibility breakthroughs</strong>: Developers with mobility constraints could execute complex development workflows through minimal muscle movements</li></ul><p>The reported&nbsp;&nbsp;with minimal false positives suggests this could mature into a reliable alternative input method, especially valuable during live coding sessions or when working in constrained physical spaces.</p><h3>3. Voice-First Development Workflows</h3><p>The&nbsp;&nbsp;in Meta's glasses enables whisper-level voice command recognition even in noisy environments like coffee shops or open offices. This enables&nbsp;<strong>voice-native development practices</strong>:</p><pre><code># Instead of manually typing:\n\"Run test suite for authentication module\"\n\n# Or executing deployment sequences:\n\"Deploy backend container to staging with blue-green strategy\"\n\n# While monitoring logs:\n\"Filter logs for 500 errors from payment service in last 15 minutes\"\n</code></pre><p>This voice paradigm extends beyond simple commands to complex, context-aware interactions. During debugging sessions, you could verbally query: \"Show me all database queries taking over 200ms in the production logs from the last hour,\" receiving visual summaries alongside your code.</p><h3>4. Real-Time Documentation and Collaboration</h3><p>Smart glasses excel at&nbsp;<strong>just-in-time information retrieval</strong>. While reviewing unfamiliar legacy code, a glance at a function could trigger documentation display. During pair programming (physically or remotely), team members could share visual annotations directly in the shared code view.</p><p>The&nbsp;<strong>real-time translation capabilities</strong>&nbsp;have particular value for globally distributed teams, providing instant subtitle translation during video standups or while reviewing comments from international colleagues.</p><h2>Technical Architecture: Building for the Glass-First Developer</h2><p>The smart glasses ecosystem is fragmented, requiring strategic platform choices:</p><p>| Platform | Development Paradigm | Best For | Key Constraints |\n|----|----|----|----|\n|  | Mixed Reality, HUD-based | Broad accessibility, voice-first apps | Limited 3D spatial capabilities |\n|  | Spatial Computing | High-precision 3D development tools | Premium pricing, Apple ecosystem lock-in |\n|  | 2D HUD projection | Information-dense displays | Limited interaction modes |</p><p>Most current smart glasses, including Meta's offerings, function as&nbsp;<strong>satellites to primary devices</strong>, handling display and input while offloading processing to connected phones or cloud services. This architecture has significant implications for developers: apps must be designed for&nbsp;<strong>intermittent connectivity</strong>, minimal local processing, and efficient data synchronization.</p><h3>Development Stack and Frameworks</h3><p>Building for smart glasses requires extending your existing full-stack toolkit:</p><p><strong>Frontend (Glass Interface):</strong></p><ul><li>: For cross-platform AR experiences, especially when targeting multiple glass ecosystems</li><li>&nbsp;(Java/Kotlin): For glasses running Android variants like Vuzix or Nreal</li><li>: For companion apps that manage glass settings and provide secondary interfaces</li></ul><ul><li>: For on-device model execution (code analysis, gesture recognition)</li><li><strong>Whisper/Google Speech-to-Text</strong>: For voice command processing</li><li>: For domain-specific development terminology understanding</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Edge computing architecture</strong>: Preprocessing data closer to glasses to reduce latency</li><li>: For code, documentation, and notifications between glasses and primary workstations</li><li>: WebSocket connections for live logging and monitoring streams</li></ul><h3>Key Technical Challenges and Solutions</h3><ol><li>Limited Visual Real Estate: Smart glasses displays, like Meta's 600×600 HUD, demand exceptional information density design. Solutions include:</li></ol><ul><li><p>: Displaying only immediately relevant information based on current activity (coding, debugging, reviewing)</p></li><li><p>: Layering information with gaze or gesture controls</p></li><li><p><strong>Peripheral-friendly design</strong>: Placing status indicators at display edges where they're less intrusive</p></li></ul><ol><li>Battery and Thermal Constraints: With 4-6 hour typical battery life, optimization is critical:</li></ol><ul><li><p><strong>Aggressive power profiling</strong>: Identifying and minimizing energy-intensive operations</p></li><li><p>: Pushing complex analysis to connected devices or cloud services</p></li><li><p>: Reducing display brightness or refresh rates during less critical operations</p></li></ul><ol><li>Privacy and Social Acceptance: The privacy concerns that plagued earlier smart glasses remain relevant. Developer-focused solutions include:</li></ol><ul><li><strong>Explicit recording indicators</strong>: Clear visual/audible signals when capturing content</li><li><strong>Local processing priority</strong>: Keeping sensitive code and data on-device when possible</li><li>: Easily disabling cameras and microphones in sensitive environments</li></ul><p>Let's walk through creating a practical tool:&nbsp;, which provides documentation and references while you code.</p><pre><code>Glasses Interface (HUD) ↔ Bluetooth/Wi-Fi ↔ Phone Companion App ↔ Development APIs (GitHub, Stack Overflow, Docs) ↔ Your IDE\n</code></pre><p><strong>1. IDE Integration Plugin</strong></p><pre><code>// Example: VS Code extension capturing context\nvscode.workspace.onDidChangeTextDocument(event =&gt; {\n  const visibleRange = getVisibleEditorRange();\n  const currentFunction = extractCurrentFunction(event.document, visibleRange);\n  const relevantImports = extractImports(event.document);\n\n  sendToGlassApp({\n    type: 'code_context',\n    function: currentFunction,\n    imports: relevantImports,\n    fileType: event.document.languageId,\n    timestamp: Date.now()\n  });\n});\n</code></pre><pre><code>// Android service for Meta glasses display\nclass CodeContextService : Service() {\n  fun displayContext(context: CodeContext) {\n    // Prioritize information based on developer activity\n    when (detectDeveloperActivity()) {\n      Activity.CODING -&gt; showDocumentation(context)\n      Activity.DEBUGGING -&gt; showVariableStates(context)\n      Activity.REVIEWING -&gt; showRelatedCode(context)\n    }\n\n    // Apply glanceable design principles\n    formatForPeripheralVision(processedContext)\n  }\n\n  private fun detectDeveloperActivity(): Activity {\n    // Use multiple signals: IDE events, voice commands, time patterns\n    return activityModel.predict(currentSignals)\n  }\n}\n</code></pre><p><strong>3. Voice Command Integration</strong></p><pre><code># Natural language processing for developer commands\nclass DeveloperCommandProcessor:\n  def process(self, command: str, context: CodeContext):\n    # Domain-specific intent recognition for development\n    intents = {\n      'documentation': ['what does', 'how to', 'explain'],\n      'execution': ['run', 'test', 'debug', 'deploy'],\n      'navigation': ['go to', 'find', 'show me']\n    }\n\n    matched_intent = classify_intent(command, intents)\n\n    if matched_intent == 'documentation':\n      return fetch_relevant_docs(command, context)\n    elif matched_intent == 'execution':\n      return execute_development_command(command, context)\n</code></pre><h2>Future Evolution: Where Glass-First Development Is Heading</h2><p>The trajectory suggests several near-term developments that will further integrate smart glasses into development workflows:</p><p>1. True Spatial Development Environments </p><p>Upcoming devices will better support&nbsp;, enabling developers to navigate complex codebases as spatial structures rather than flat files. Imagine walking through your microservices architecture as interconnected modules or visualizing data flows as animated streams.</p><p>2. Enhanced AI Pair Programming </p><p>As on-device AI improves, glasses will provide&nbsp;<strong>real-time code suggestions and analysis</strong>&nbsp;directly in your visual field, reducing context switching between IDE and AI coding tools.</p><p>3. Expanded Ecosystem Integration </p><p>Meta's upcoming developer toolkit announcements suggest more open APIs and third-party app support. This could enable deeper integration with popular development tools like Docker, Kubernetes, AWS Console, and monitoring platforms.</p><p>4. Specialized Developer-Focused Hardware </p><p>Future iterations may include features specifically for developers: higher-resolution displays for code readability, extended battery packs for marathon coding sessions, or developer-optimized input methods beyond voice and basic gestures.</p><h2>Practical Adoption Strategy for Developers</h2><p>For developers considering smart glasses integration:</p><p><strong>Start with Monitoring and Notifications</strong></p><p>Begin by offloading non-critical notifications: build statuses, PR updates, and system alerts.

      "content": "<blockquote><p>An engineering experiment: treating DNA not as biology, but as 3 billion lines of obfuscated legacy source code. Imagine you have just been hired to maintain a project of this scale without documentation.</p></blockquote><p>\\\nThere is no documentation. The local dev environment is wet, squishy, and runs at 37 degrees Celsius. The original developers have been gone for millions of years. And when you try to compile it, you realize that only about 2% of the code actually compiles into binaries (proteins).</p><h2>\\n <strong>The other 98%? The previous maintainers labeled it \"Junk DNA\"</strong></h2><p>In the software world, we know \"junk\" does not exist. We have legacy code. We have commented-out blocks. We have deprecated drivers. We have obfuscation. We have test vectors left in production. But we almost never have 3 gigabytes of random noise that does absolutely nothing.</p><p>I did not want to do wet lab biology. I wanted to run a static analysis audit on the source code of life.</p><p>Bio-Kernel is an alignment-free pattern prioritization framework: it identifies recurrent token-neighborhood signatures and rejects multiple structured null models; functional interpretation is explicitly out of scope and requires orthogonal validation.</p><h2><strong>THE EXECUTION: BINARIZING THE STREAM</strong></h2><p>We did not start with a hypothesis. We started with data conversion. We took the complete human genome (24 chromosomes: 1-22, X, Y) and treated it as a raw binary stream.</p><p>Inside the 'bin/' directory of the project, you will find our intermediate artifacts: thousands of '.biolab' files.</p><p>\\n We binarized every gene. We converted the ACGT sequences into discrete digital tokens, effectively stripping away the \"biology\" to look at the \"logic\". We processed 19,821 gene regions across the entire genome, creating a standardized, machine-readable dataset that allows us to run diffs, checksums, and pattern-matching algorithms that serve no purpose in a wet lab but are standard in a code audit.</p><p>==Once the data was binarized, we fed it into TRIDENT, our pattern mining engine. Trident is composed of three distinct functional parts:== </p><p>1. The Representation Layer (Tokenizer): This part translates the chaotic biological sequence into a controlled vocabulary of tokens. It turns a fuzzy analog signal into a discrete digital string that engineering tools can process.</p><p>\\n 2. The Pattern Miner (The \"Grep\"): This engine scans the tokenized stream looking for recurrence. It hunts for \"short token signatures\"—specific sequences of code that appear more often than they should. It looks for \"loops\", \"subroutines\", and \"shared libraries\" hidden in the intergenic regions.</p><p>\\n 3. The Null Hypothesis Generator (The Validator): In engineering, if you find a pattern, your first job is to prove it is a hallucination.</p><p>This framing reduces the risk of overinterpretation by explicitly quantifying how much signal is attributable to local structure preserved under block shuffling. We report permutation p-values computed as:</p><p>Where 'b' is the number of permutations where the null statistic equals or exceeds the observed statistic. Using N=1000 permutations, for our strongest signals where b=0, we report p &lt;= 1/1001 (approx 0.000999). \\n </p><h2><strong>THE FINDINGS: GHOST IN THE SHELL</strong></h2><p>What we found reminds me of reading a decompiled binary. You see the active functions (genes), sure. But in between them, you see repetitive padding. You see structures that look like they used to do something.</p><p>We identified a cross-chromosomal recurrence of statistically similar token-neighborhood signatures and opcode-profile vectors under an explicit similarity metric.</p><p>We found 18 specific \"survivor\" signatures. These are sequences of code that survived our most aggressive statistical noise filtering. They appear in different chromosomes, in different contexts, yet they are identical. \\n It looks like copy-pasted code. It looks like a shared library that was commented out eons ago. \\n </p><h2><strong>THE ARCHITECTURE: BEYOND THE SCANNER</strong></h2><p><strong>==Bio-Kernel is not just a script. It is a distributed system composed of specialized kernels:==</strong></p><p>- kernel_quantum: This is the cognitive core or \"Recall\" engine. It holds the vector memory of the system, connecting our findings with known biological associations to see if our \"ghosts\" map to known \"functions\".</p><p>\\n - unknown_engine: This is the dedicated lab for the \"dark matter\". It takes the high-scoring unknown regions flagged by Trident and isolates them for deep analysis, treating them as uncharacterized binary blobs.</p><p>\\n - External Connectors: The system is not an island. It connects to public Genome APIs to run cross-species validation. We compare our \"human\" legacy code against other species to see if they share the same commented-out blocks (conserved non-coding regions).</p><p><strong>==This project is open source. The data is reproducible.==</strong></p><p>I do not want you to believe my narrative. I want you to pull the repo, run the null hypothesis tester, and try to break my findings. If this signal is real, it changes how we read the code. If it is not, then we need better noise models.</p><p>Can you explain the legacy code?</p>",

The same day as the theft, McCorvey’s Instagram accounts—with the usernames \"2corkmoney,\" \"Icorkmoneybaby,\" and \"cork2saucy”—posted photos of him flipping through stacks of mail still in the USPS tray, showing the same zip code on the letters as the carrier’s stolen deliveries.&nbsp;</p><p>For the next few days, more evidence appeared on McCorvey’s Instagram Stories, where he uploaded photos and videos “involving banking transactions and other various posts connected to financial institutions,” according to the complaint. “These posts included solicitations for individuals with bank accounts or other related financial information.”</p><p>In one photo, a man—it’s not clear from the complaint whether it’s McCorvey— celebrates in front of a Wells Fargo ATM, holding a card in the air, with a Wells Fargo branch tagged as a location sticker on the photo.&nbsp;</p><p>This isn’t the first time an alleged criminal outed himself by bragging on social media and in public.

XRP has been one of the most recognized altcoins for years due to its payment narrative and strong presence across global liquidity markets. </p><p>Early investors enjoyed explosive gains during the previous cycles. That era has now matured. XRP trades inside a well-defined range with heavy resistance near $2.40 and $2.85.</p><p>This is common for large caps. Massive liquidity makes it harder to generate sharp upside. For XRP to reach $3 or $4, billions in new inflows would be required. Many traders still view XRP as a solid defensive position for long-term exposure. However, whales looking for higher growth profiles appear to be allocating elsewhere for the next leg of the cycle.</p><p>Ethereum trades around $3,300 with a market cap near $400B. ETH remains the benchmark for decentralized applications and smart contracts. It has also been one of the strongest performers over the past decade. </p><p>But similar to XRP, Ethereum has now matured. The biggest surge happened during the early DeFi and NFT cycle. ETH now trades like a blue-chip asset with slower growth compared to its past history.</p><p>Resistance sits near $3,650 and $3,900. Breaking above those levels would require broad market alignment and sustained liquidity. Many early ETH investors recognize that large caps often enter a phase of return compression. </p><p>They continue to hold ETH for stability, but they deploy fresh capital into earlier tokens that have not yet undergone price discovery. This pattern is visible now as whales explore new names with higher upside potential.</p><p> is one of the new crypto assets receiving this rotation. The project is building a decentralized lending protocol on Ethereum. Users will be able to lend crypto assets to earn yield or post collateral to borrow without selling positions. This model appeals to traders who want access to liquidity during bull markets without closing long-term exposure.</p><p>More than $19.8M has been raised during structured distribution, and over 18,800 holders have taken positions. The token sells at $0.04 in Phase 7 ahead of a confirmed $0.06 launch price.</p><p>The presale began in early 2025 and MUTM has already surged more than 300% from its earliest pricing tier. This expansion happened before the protocol was live which indicates that discovery is still in its early stage.</p><h3>Why XRP and ETH Whales Enter Early Utility Zones</h3><p>Whales do not chase hype. They enter projects before usage begins. XRP and ETH holders made their biggest gains during the period when those protocols were not fully understood by the market. Many are now applying that same logic to MUTM.</p><p> through the official X account that the V1 protocol is preparing for testnet deployment before mainnet activation in 2026. Once V1 is active, the lending system will record borrowing flows, liquidation events, and repayment metrics. These are important valuation signals for DeFi tokens. The market can then price utility instead of speculation.</p><p>Many XRP and ETH investors recognize this zone. It is the same early-stage region where both assets began long before their major surges. The idea is not that MUTM becomes XRP or ETH. The idea is that tokens at the pre-utility phase often undergo new price discovery when usage begins.</p><h3>Infrastructure Layers Reinforce Confidence</h3><p>MUTM has also completed key security steps. The codebase was . The MUTM token received a 90 out of 100 score from CertiK’s token scan. A $50,000 bug bounty is active to detect vulnerabilities before mainnet deployment. For a lending market, these security steps are not optional. Collateral, liquidation, and oracle operations must function correctly under stress.</p><p>Additional tooling includes a 24 hour leaderboard that rewards the top daily contributor with $500 in MUTM. Card payment support allows non-crypto users to participate without complex onboarding. These features make access wider which may explain why participation has increased during recent stages.</p><p>Analysts tracking the project expect that a fully verified security stack combined with easier onboarding can support stronger repricing once the protocol is live. Several analysts model a post-launch scenario where MUTM trades between $0.30 and $0.45 within the first full activity cycle.￼</p><p>That represents a potential 6x to 9x increase from the current $0.04 presale pricing. The projection is tied to utility events such as lending flow, borrowing demand, and revenue distribution rather than hype cycles.</p><h3>Phase 7 Acceleration and Final Positioning</h3><p>Phase 7 has been progressing faster than several earlier phases. Larger wallet entries have been recorded during this period. Analysts interpret this as allocation tightening as the structured distribution nears its final pricing tier. It is common for presales to accelerate near their end as traders prepare for utility activation and exchange listings.</p><p>MUTM sits in a unique position for the upcoming cycle. XRP and ETH offer slow returns. MUTM offers early access, utility development, and unpriced growth. This is the type of rotation that whales specialize in.</p><p>For more information about Mutuum Finance (MUTM) visit the links below:</p><strong><p>:::tip\n<em>This story was published as a press release by Btcwire under HackerNoon’s Business Blogging&nbsp;.

      "content": "Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs are starting to be reflected in the price of some items, as sellers weigh how to absorb the shock of the added costs. From a report: Amazon and many of its third-party merchants pre-purchased inventory to try to get ahead of the tariffs and keep prices low for customers, but most of that supply ran out last fall, Jassy said in a Tuesday interview with CNBC's Becky Quick at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \n\n\"So you start to see some of the tariffs creep into some of the prices, some of the items, and you see some sellers are deciding that they're passing on those higher costs to consumers in the form of higher prices, some are deciding that they'll absorb it to drive demand and some are doing something in between,\" Jassy said. \"I think you're starting to see more of that impact.\" The comments are a notable shift from last year, when Jassy said Amazon hadn't seen \"prices appreciably go up\" a few months after Trump announced wide-ranging tariffs. Further reading: Americans Are the Ones Paying for Tariffs, Study Finds: Americans, not foreigners, are bearing almost the entire cost of U.S. tariffs, according to new research that contradicts a key claim by President Trump and suggests he might have a weaker hand in a reemerging trade war with Europe. \n\n[...] The new research, published Monday by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a well-regarded German think tank, suggests that the impact of tariffs is likely to show up over time in the form of higher U.S. consumer prices. [...] By analyzing $4 trillion of shipments between January 2024 and November 2025, the Kiel Institute researchers found that foreign exporters absorbed only about 4% of the burden of last year's U.S. tariff increases by lowering their prices, while American consumers and importers absorbed 96%.",

They’re not inherently great at deterministic, file-producing, structure-preserving operations.</strong> That’s where  come in: Anthropic’s answer (announced October 16, 2025) to the question: <em>“How do we give AI real capabilities without turning every user into a developer?”</em></p><p>If MCP is a highway system for AI tooling, <strong>Agent Skills are the roundabouts and on-ramps built right into Claude</strong>—fast, local, and predictable.</p><h2>1) What Exactly Is an Agent Skill?</h2><p>An  is a  Claude can use when it recognises the situation.</p><p>A Skill typically includes:</p><ul><li> (name + description) used for routing/selection</li><li> (the playbook / workflow)</li><li> (scripts, templates, helper files) that execute in a sandboxed environment</li></ul><p>Think: “a tiny, reusable workflow module” rather than “yet another prompt”.</p><p>Anthropic’s docs describe Skills as organised folders of instructions, scripts, and resources, including pre-built Skills for common document work (PowerPoint, Excel, Word, PDF), plus custom Skills you can write yourself.</p><h2>2) Why This Is A Big Deal: Progressive Disclosure (AKA, Don’t Stuff the Context Window)</h2><p>The clever part isn’t “Claude can run scripts”—lots of systems can do that.</p><p>The clever part is <strong>how little Claude loads until it needs to</strong>.</p><p>Claude Code docs describe a three-phase flow:</p><ol><li> load only each Skill’s  +  (keeps startup fast)</li><li> when relevant, Claude asks to use the Skill and you confirm before full instructions load</li><li> load resources and run in the execution environment</li></ol><ul><li>You don’t pay a token tax upfront for 20 Skills you  need later.</li><li>Claude can route to the right tool without being bloated with detail.</li><li>The user gets a clear “yes/no” moment before full Skill content is injected.</li></ul><p>This is the opposite of the “mega system prompt” era.</p><h2>3) What Skills Are Great At (And Why LLMs Struggle Without Them)</h2><h3>Problem A: “I need a real file, not a bedtime story about a file.”</h3><p>Without Skills, the model often produces  of artefacts—tables in Markdown, pseudo-Excel, fake download links.</p><p>With Skills, Claude can actually  (e.g., , , ) and hand it back.</p><h3>Problem B: Domain best practices are annoying to repeat</h3><p>In real work, the prompt is rarely the hard part. The hard part is the :</p><ul><li>“Use the company slide template”</li><li>“Always include a pivot table + chart + executive summary”</li><li>“In code review, flag SQL injection risks”</li><li>“For PDFs, preserve table structure and join split rows”</li></ul><p>Skills let you bake these standards once—then reuse them consistently.</p><p>When extracting tables from PDFs or producing spreadsheets, you want . Skills push more of the job into deterministic tooling rather than hoping the model “describes it correctly”.</p><h2>4) Agent Skills vs MCP: It’s Not Redundant, It’s Layering</h2><p>People see “Skills” and immediately ask: <em>Wait, isn’t that what MCP is for?</em></p><p>Anthropic introduced <strong>Model Context Protocol (MCP)</strong> in November 2024 as an open standard for building secure, two-way connections between AI tools and external data sources—via MCP clients talking to MCP servers.</p><p>In other words: <strong>MCP is about connecting to outside systems</strong> (databases, file stores, SaaS tools, internal services).</p><p>Agent Skills are about <strong>packaging repeatable workflows and execution logic inside Claude’s ecosystem</strong>, with progressive loading and sandboxed execution.</p><ul><li><strong>Agent Skills = built-in “shortcuts” / workflow modules</strong> (fast, local, standardised)</li><li><strong>MCP = app ecosystem infrastructure</strong> (powerful, external, programmable, operationally heavier)</li></ul><p>Or: <strong>Skills optimise “doing the thing”. MCP optimises “reaching the thing”.</strong></p><h2>5) The Architecture Patterns You’ll Actually Use</h2><h3>5.1 Skills for document-heavy work (the “office grind” you shouldn’t be doing manually)</h3><p>Pre-built Skills cover common doc tasks: spreadsheets, slides, PDFs, Word docs.</p><ol><li>User: “Turn this quarterly sales CSV into a management-ready workbook with a pivot table and chart.”</li><li>Claude uses a spreadsheet Skill to generate a real  artefact.</li></ol><h3>5.2 Skills for organisational consistency (the “one team, one way” problem)</h3><p>A custom Skill can encode your team’s standards:</p><ul></ul><p>This matters because humans forget standards. LLMs… forget them even faster unless you enforce them.</p><h3>5.3 MCP for external systems (the “we need live data” problem)</h3><ul><li>read from a production repository</li></ul><p>…that’s MCP territory—especially because MCP is designed as an open protocol for those client/server connections.</p><h2>6) A Minimal Custom Skill Example (Tweakable, Practical)</h2><p>Below is a lightweight Skill that turns “messy meeting notes” into a consistent UK-style action log.</p><pre><code>---\nname: action-tracking\ndescription: Turn meeting notes into a UK-style action log with owners, dates, and risks. Use when the user pastes notes or uploads minutes.\n---\n​\n# Action Tracking Assistant\n​\n## When to use\n- The user provides meeting notes, minutes, or a transcript\n- They want actions, owners, deadlines, and risks in a consistent format\n​\n## Steps\n1. Extract decisions (if any) and action items\n2. Assign each action an owner (use names given; otherwise use \"TBC\")\n3. Convert relative dates (e.g. \"next Friday\") into explicit dates if the date is known; otherwise mark \"TBC\"\n4. Flag dependencies and risks\n​\n## Output format (must follow exactly)\n### Decisions\n- ...\n​\n### Action Log\n| ID | Action | Owner | Due date | Status | Risk/Dependency |\n|---:|---|---|---|---|---|\n| A1 | ... | ... | ... | Not started | ... |\n</code></pre><p> the  is written in language users actually type, which improves routing. Anthropic also explicitly recommends paying attention to  and  because Claude uses them to decide whether to trigger a Skill.</p><h2>7) Safety: The Unsexy Part That Makes Skills Usable</h2><p>Skills run code and interact with files in an execution environment, so the safety model matters. Claude Code docs frame Skills as folders that Claude can navigate and execute within a constrained environment.</p><p>Practical safety rules that hold up in real teams:</p><ul><li>Prefer  or <strong>skills you authored and reviewed</strong></li><li>Treat third-party Skills like you’d treat random shell scripts from the internet</li><li>Maintain a small allowlist; remove Skills you don’t use</li></ul><h2>8) The Real Limitation: Ecosystem Lock-In (For Now)</h2><p>Skills are incredibly pragmatic—but they’re also :</p><ul><li>Skills are designed around Claude’s tooling and execution model.</li><li>MCP, by contrast, is explicitly positioned as an open protocol for interoperability across tools and platforms.</li></ul><p>So the trade-off is clear:</p><ul><li><strong>Skills = speed + simplicity</strong></li><li><strong>MCP = reach + portability</strong></li></ul><p>If you’re building internal workflows today, Skills are the “get it done this afternoon” move. If you’re building tooling that must survive model churn, MCP becomes increasingly attractive.</p><h2>Final Take: Skills Make AI Feel Less Like Chat, More Like Software</h2><p>The biggest shift here isn’t technical—it’s product-shaped:</p><ul><li>Before: “AI answers questions.”</li><li>Now: “AI executes workflows.”</li></ul><p>Agent Skills push Claude closer to what office software has always promised: <strong>less time formatting and moving things around, more time deciding what matters.</strong></p><p>And that’s the quiet superpower: when execution gets cheaper, .</p>",

      "content": "Sony plans to spin off its TV hardware business to a new joint venture controlled by Chinese electronics giant TCL, the two said Tuesday, a significant retreat for the Japanese giant whose Bravia line has long occupied the premium end of the television market. TCL would hold a 51% stake in the venture and Sony would retain 49% under a nonbinding agreement the two companies signed. They aim to finalize binding terms by the end of March and begin operations in April 2027, pending regulatory approvals. \n\nThe new company would retain the Sony and Bravia branding for televisions and home audio equipment but use TCL's display technology. Japanese TV manufacturers have steadily lost ground to Chinese and Korean rivals over the years. Toshiba, Hitachi, Mitsubishi Electric and Pioneer exited the business entirely. Panasonic and Sharp de-emphasized televisions in their growth strategies. Sony's Bravia line survived by positioning itself at the premium tier where consumers pay more for high-end picture and sound quality.",

And lawmakers like Ted Cruz, which we’ve also documented repeatedly, have shown time and time again how they <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/10/03/ted-cruz-kills-americas-latest-attempt-to-have-functional-privacy-laws/\">aren’t</a><a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/07/02/ted-cruzs-dumb-plan-to-punish-states-that-regulate-ai-by-withholding-broadband-grants-falls-apart/\">interested</a> in <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/09/05/trump-fcc-boss-brendan-carr-joins-ted-cruz-in-fucking-over-poor-rural-school-kids/\">protecting kids</a> (from tech giants or <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/09/05/trump-fcc-boss-brendan-carr-joins-ted-cruz-in-fucking-over-poor-rural-school-kids/\">anything else</a>), or doing any of the heavy lifting (like, say ensuring everyone has access to affordable mental health care or <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/09/05/trump-fcc-boss-brendan-carr-joins-ted-cruz-in-fucking-over-poor-rural-school-kids/\">affordable broadband</a>) required to .</p><p>More specifically, Cruz leveraged the Congressional Review Act to kill FCC modifications to the E-Rate program that allowed school libraries to offer kids free Wi-Fi hotspots. This was a broadly popular, uncontroversial program that made it easier for rural, low-income kids to get online. And Cruz killed it because companies like AT&amp;T <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/05/14/ted-cruz-proudly-makes-broadband-shittier-and-homework-harder-for-u-s-school-kids/\">don’t want the government offering alternatives to their overpriced service</a>.</p><p>Cruz, of course, couldn’t just openly announce that telecom lobbyist corruption resulted in him killing a helpful program with broad, bipartisan support. So he <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/01/30/ted-cruz-blocks-fcc-plan-to-bring-mobile-wi-fi-to-school-kids-for-a-very-very-stupid-reason/\">made up a whole bunch of bullshit</a> about how this Wi-Fi program was “censoring Conservative viewpoints” and resulting in kids running amok unsupervised online. As we debunked in detail <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/01/30/ted-cruz-blocks-fcc-plan-to-bring-mobile-wi-fi-to-school-kids-for-a-very-very-stupid-reason/\">it was all lies</a>; he just threw a bunch of nonsense at the wall, and our lazy, shitty press parroted much of it unskeptically. </p><blockquote><p>“<em>During the Biden administration, not only did Congressional Democrats give billions of dollars to the FCC to buy personal internet devices for children, but the Biden FCC sought to bankroll kids’ unsupervised internet access and undermine parental rights by expanding the E-Rate program to install Wi-Fi hotspots off campus, including on school buses and in students’ homes.</em>“</p></blockquote><p>Cruz is, as usual, lying. The expanded Wi-Fi hotspot program <em><strong>didn’t cost the FCC any additional taxpayer money whatsoever</strong></em>. They leveraged existing E-Rate funds to ensure the most disadvantaged, rural kids (many of whose parents voted for Trump) had access to affordable Internet when not on school grounds, either via a cheap access point at home, or a cheap access point on a local bus or bookmobile.</p><p>Again, the Republican opposition to this wasn’t rooted in any sort of good intention. AT&amp;T and Verizon simply don’t like the precedent of the government offering affordable (or free) broadband internet access to people. Even people in areas their networks don’t reach. They’d much rather those families be stuck paying an arm and a leg for spotty, expensive, often unreliable broadband access. </p><p>Cruz dressed up his lazy corruption as some sort of noble “protection of the children,” a pretty common refrain in DC policy circles. And because the U.S. press generally sucks (in part due to the Republican <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/04/10/trump-fcc-prepares-to-destroy-whatevers-left-of-media-consolidation-limits/\">assault on media consolidation and ownership limits</a>), he was broadly allowed to lie repeatedly about this without being seriously challenged in the media. </p><p>To make matters worse, he’s leveraging his corrupt protection of the Republican-coddled telecom industry as some sort of noble justification for passing shitty, half-cooked legislation on a completely different front. But as is so often the case, the “protect the children” and race-baiting, culture war trolling generally exists to divide and disorient the public so they don’t cooperatively target the real problem: rich assholes. </p><p>In the case of KOSKA, as we saw with the <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2024/07/18/just-a-reminder-authoritarians-dont-actually-support-antitrust-reform/\">fake GOP antitrust inquiries into “big tech,”</a> or fake concerns about <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/10/06/senator-cruz-figure-out-who-was-president-from-2018-to-2020-challenge-impossible/\">“free speech,”</a> Cruz’s interest isn’t in actually reining in big tech or helping kids. His interest is in finding leverage points over modern media giants that can be used to bully them into protecting and coddling authoritarians and their rank propaganda, a gambit that’s proven to be <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/09/05/trump-tech-dinner-full-attendee-list/\">quite successful so far</a>.</p>",

      "content": "<p><strong>Most AI pipelines break on exceptions. Let's build one that stops, asks a question, and waits for your answer.</strong></p><p>In our <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/your-first-ai-data-flywheel-in-under-100-lines-of-python\">last article</a>, we built our first tangible AI Data Flywheel. We also created a simple Correction Deck that allowed us to fix an AI's mistakes and generate a perfect training file.</p><p>But true AI training contains thousands upon thousands of files, so going through each is impossible.</p><p>A smarter way would be for the AI to spot a problem in the middle of a process, recognize it's confused, stop, and ask a human to provide the missing piece of information before continuing.</p><p>Today, we're building that smart pipeline.</p><h3>Ambiguity in a Multi-Step Process</h3><p>Imagine our invoice AI is now part of a larger process. After extracting the text, it needs to link each line item to a canonical product in our company's inventory database.</p><p>The AI processes an invoice and extracts the line item . It checks the database but finds two possible matches: <code>\"Product #102: Yellow Onions\"</code> and <code>\"Product #247: Jumbo Onions\"</code>. The AI is stuck and cannot resolve on its own.</p><p>A brittle pipeline would either fail, guess wrong (polluting our downstream data), or silently leave the item unlinked. A brilliant pipeline does something better: it pauses and asks a targeted question.</p><p>To build this, our <a href=\"https://github.com/globalhawk04/foundry\">Foundry</a> framework introduces two new, powerful concepts that work together:</p><ol><li> is the brain of the operation. It's a simple Python class where the user defines the business logic for what constitutes a problem.  This method analyzes a job's output and, if it finds an issue, returns a list of questions to ask the user.</li></ol><pre><code>   # The abstract contract in the framework\n   class AmbiguityDetector(ABC):\n       @abstractmethod\n       def detect(self, job: Job) -&gt; list[dict]:\n           \"\"\"Analyzes a job and returns questions if ambiguities are found.\"\"\"\n           pass\n\n   # Our specific implementation for the invoice problem\n   class UnlinkedProductDetector(AmbiguityDetector):\n       def detect(self, job: Job) -&gt; list[dict]:\n           requests = []\n           for item in job.initial_ai_output.get(\"inventory_items\", []):\n               # Our business rule: If an item isn't linked, we have a problem!\n               if item.get(\"linked_pantry_item_id\") is None:\n                   requests.append({\n                       \"request_type\": \"LINK_PRODUCT\",\n                       \"context_data\": { ... } // Data needed to ask the question\n                   })\n           return requests\n</code></pre><ol start=\"2\"><li>:  the stop and ask process. It’s a special, pre-built phase you add to your pipeline. You simply tell it which  to use. When the pipeline executes this phase, it runs your detector. If the detector returns any questions, the phase immediately changes the job's status to  and halts the pipeline for that specific job.</li></ol><h3>The Human-in-the-Loop in Action</h3><p>If you're following along, navigate to<code>human_in_the_loop_example</code>directory in the repository.</p><p>This script simulates the entire workflow. It will first set up a database with a job that's already halfway done but contains the ambiguous unlinked onion problem we described. Then, it will run a pipeline whose only job is to detect this ambiguity.</p><pre><code>python hhuman_in_the_loop_example.py\n</code></pre><p>First, you'll see the detection pipeline run in your terminal. Notice the output: the job's status is changed, and the pipeline is paused.</p><pre><code>--- Running the Ambiguity Detection Pipeline for Job #1... ---\n--- [Job 1] Running Phase: HumanInTheLoopPhase ---\n--- [Job 1] Found 1 ambiguities. Pausing pipeline. ---\n--- Pipeline finished. Job status is now: 'pending_clarification' ---\n</code></pre><p>Next, the script starts a web server.</p><pre><code>--- Human-in-the-Loop server running at http://localhost:8000 ---\n--- Open the URL in your browser to answer the clarification question. ---\n</code></pre><h4>Step 2: Use the Clarification Feed</h4><p>Open  in your browser. Instead of a full correction form, you see a simple, targeted question: The item 'ONIONS YELLOW JBO' … needs to be linked … Which product is it?</p><p>This is our system asking for help. From the dropdown, select Yellow Onions and click Link Product.</p><p>The UI will update to show All Done! and, crucially, look back at your terminal. You'll see a log confirming that your action has un-paused the job:</p><pre><code>--- Received resolution for request #1 ... ---\n--- Request #1 resolved. Job #1 is now 'ready_for_final_processing'. ---\n</code></pre><h4>Step 3: Stop the Server and Verify</h4><p>Go back to your terminal and press  to stop the server. The script will print a final status check:</p><pre><code>--- Final Job Status: ready_for_final_processing ---\n--- Final Request Status: resolved ---\n</code></pre><p>The job's status isn't  yet. It's now <code>ready_for_final_processing</code>. We have successfully intervened, provided the missing information, and put the job back in the queue, ready for the next pipeline to take over and finish the work.</p><h3>Why This is a Game-Changer</h3><p>This interactive pattern fundamentally changes how we can build AI systems:</p><ul><li> We catch errors and ambiguities at the earliest possible moment, preventing them from causing bigger problems in downstream systems.</li><li><strong>It's More Efficient for Humans:</strong> Operators aren't wading through pages of correct data to find one error. The system presents them with a clean queue of specific, actionable questions.</li><li><strong>It Enables Complex, Chained Workflows:</strong> We can now design incredibly sophisticated, multi-stage AI processes with human \"checkpoints\" in the middle, confident that the system will pause gracefully when it needs guidance.</li></ul><p>We've built a script that runs a pipeline offline and a second script that hosts an interactive UI. But in a real production application, these are two separate worlds. Your web server needs to be instantly responsive to user requests; it can't be tied up running a 10-minute AI batch job.</p><p>How do we decouple the application that starts the job from the background worker that executes the job?</p><p>In our next article, we will graduate from self-contained scripts to a true, production-grade architecture. We’ll introduce Celery and Redis to build a robust, scalable system with a dedicated pool of background workers, ready to handle any AI task without blocking our main application.</p>",

      "content": "In an opinion piece for The Register, Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols argues that while \"vibe coding\" can be fun and occasionally useful for small, throwaway projects, it produces brittle, low-quality code that doesn't scale and ultimately burdens real developers with cleanup and maintenance. An anonymous reader shares an excerpt: Vibe coding got a big boost when everyone's favorite open source programmer, Linux's Linus Torvalds, said he'd been using Google's Antigravity LLM on his toy program AudioNoise, which he uses to create \"random digital audio effects\" using his \"random guitar pedal board design.\" This is not exactly Linux or even Git, his other famous project, in terms of the level of work. Still, many people reacted to Torvalds' vibe coding as \"wow!\" It's certainly noteworthy, but has the case for vibe coding really changed?\n \n[...] It's fun, and for small projects, it's productive. However, today's programs are complex and call upon numerous frameworks and resources. Even if your vibe code works, how do you maintain it? Do you know what's going on inside the code? Chances are you don't. Besides, the LLM you used two weeks ago has been replaced with a new version. The exact same prompts that worked then yield different results today. Come to think of it, it's an LLM. The same prompts and the same LLM will give you different results every time you run it. This is asking for disaster.\n \nJust ask Jason Lemkin. He was the guy who used the vibe coding platform Replit, which went \"rogue during a code freeze, shut down, and deleted our entire database.\" Whoops! Yes, Replit and other dedicated vibe programming AIs, such as Cursor and Windsurf, are improving. I'm not at all sure, though, that they've been able to help with those fundamental problems of being fragile and still cannot scale successfully to the demands of production software. It's much worse than that. Just because a program runs doesn't mean it's good. As Ruth Suehle, President of the Apache Software Foundation, commented recently on LinkedIn, naive vibe coders \"only know whether the output works or doesn't and don't have the skills to evaluate it past that. The potential results are horrifying.\"\n \nWhy? In another LinkedIn post, Craig McLuckie, co-founder and CEO of Stacklok, wrote: \"Today, when we file something as 'good first issue' and in less than 24 hours get absolutely inundated with low-quality vibe-coded slop that takes time away from doing real work. This pattern of 'turning slop into quality code' through the review process hurts productivity and hurts morale.\" McLuckie continued: \"Code volume is going up, but tensions rise as engineers do the fun work with AI, then push responsibilities onto their team to turn slop into production code through structured review.\"",

Given their computational cost, these models are difficult to replicate without significant capital. For the few that are available through APIs, no access is granted to the full model weights, making them difficult to study. We present Open Pre-trained Transformers (OPT), a suite of decoder-only pre-trained transformers ranging from 125M to 175B parameters, which we aim to fully and responsibly share with interested researchers. We show that OPT-175B is comparable to GPT-3,1 while requiring only 1/7th the carbon footprint to develop. We are also releasing our logbook detailing the infrastructure challenges we faced, along with code for experimenting with all of the released models.</p><p>Large language models (LLMs) trained on massive text collections have shown surprising emergent capabilities to generate text and perform zero- and few-shot learning (Brown et al., 2020; Lieber et al., 2021; Smith et al., 2022; Rae et al., 2021; Chowdhery et al., 2022). While in some cases the public can interact with these models through paid APIs, full model access is currently limited to only a few highly resourced labs.2</p><p>This restricted access has limited researchers’ ability to study how and why these large language models work, hindering progress on improving known challenges in areas such as robustness, bias, and toxicity. In this technical report, we present Open Pretrained Transformers (OPT), a suite of decoderonly pre-trained transformers ranging from 125M to 175B parameters, which we aim to fully and responsibly share with interested researchers. We train the OPT models to roughly match the performance and sizes of the GPT-3 class of models, while also applying the latest best practices in data collection and efficient training. Our aim in developing this suite of OPT models is to enable reproducible and responsible research at scale, and to bring more voices to the table in studying the impact of these LLMs.</p><p>Definitions of risk, harm, bias, and toxicity, etc., should be articulated by the collective research community as a whole, which is only possible when models are available for study. We are releasing all of our models between 125M and 66B parameters, and will provide full research access to OPT-175B upon request. Access will be granted to academic researchers; those affiliated with organizations in government, civil society, and academia; and those in industry research laboratories. We are also releasing both the logbook of our model creation as well as our codebase, metaseq,3 which enabled training OPT-175B on 992 80GB A100 GPUs, reaching 147 TFLOP/s utilization per GPU.</p><p>From this implementation, and from using the latest generation of NVIDIA hardware, we are able to develop OPT-175B using only 1/7th the carbon footprint of GPT-3. While this is a significant achievement, the energy cost of creating such a model is still nontrivial, and repeated efforts to replicate a model of this size will only amplify the growing compute footprint of these LLMs. We believe the entire AI community — academic researchers, civil society, policymakers, and industry — must work together to develop clear guidelines around responsible AI in general and responsible LLMs in particular, given their centrality in many downstream language applications. A much broader segment of the AI community needs access to these models in order to conduct reproducible research and collectively drive the field forward. With the release of OPT-175B and smaller-scale baselines, we hope to increase the diversity of voices defining the ethical considerations of such technologies.</p><p>We present results on eight Transformer language models ranging from 125 million to 175 billion parameters. Architectural details are displayed in Table 1. In the interest of transparency, and to reduce risk of training instabilities, our models and hyperparameters largely follow Brown et al. (2020), with variations in batch size mostly to obtain increased computational efficiency.</p><p>For weight initialization, we follow the same settings provided in the Megatron-LM codebase,4 using a normal distribution with zero mean and standard deviation of 0.006. Standard deviation for output layers are scaled by a 1.0/ √ 2L term where L is the total number of layers. All bias terms are initialized as 0, and all models are trained with ReLU activation and a sequence length of 2048.</p><p>We use an AdamW optimizer (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017) with (β1, β2) set to (0.9, 0.95), and weight decay of 0.1. We follow a linear learning rate schedule, warming up from 0 to the maximum learning rate over the first 2000 steps in OPT-175B, or over 375M tokens in our smaller baselines, and decaying down to 10% of the maximum LR over 300B tokens. A number of mid-flight changes to LR were also required (see Section 2.5). Our batch sizes range from 0.5M to 4M depending on the model size (see Table 1) and is kept constant throughout the course of training.</p><p>We use a dropout of 0.1 throughout, but we do not apply any dropout to embeddings. We clip gradient norms at 1.0, except for some midflight changes that reduce this threshold down from 1.0 to 0.3 (see Section 2.5). We also include a gradient predivide factor to reduce the risk of over/underflows when computing the gradient across all ranks (splitting the division by the world size of N into two division operations by √ N).</p><p>The pre-training corpus contains a concatenation of datasets used in RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019b), the Pile (Gao et al., 2021a), and PushShift.io Reddit (Baumgartner et al., 2020; Roller et al., 2021). All corpora were previously collected or filtered to contain predominantly English text, but a small amount of non-English data is still present within the corpus via CommonCrawl. We removed duplicated documents across all datasets by filtering out documents via MinhashLSH (Rajaraman and Ullman, 2011) with a Jaccard similarity ≥ .95. We found the Pile was particularly full of duplicate documents, and advise future researchers using the Pile to perform additional de-duplication processing. We tokenize all corpora using the GPT-2 byte level BPE tokenizer (Sennrich et al., 2016; Radford et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020). Our final corpus contains roughly 180B tokens.</p><p> We included the BookCorpus (Zhu et al., 2015) and Stories (Trinh and Le, 2018) subsets of the RoBERTa corpus and utilized an updated version of CCNews, containing news stories crawled through September 28, 2021. This CCNews v2 corpus was preprocessed the same way as the original RoBERTa CCNews (Liu et al., 2019b).</p><p> We included a subset of the Pile (Gao et al., 2021a), including: CommonCrawl, DM Mathematics, Project Gutenberg, HackerNews, OpenSubtitles, OpenWebText2, USPTO and Wikipedia. Other subsets of the Pile were eliminated as we found they increased the risk of instabilities, as measured by tendency to cause spikes in gradient norms at the 1.3B scale, or were otherwise deemed unsuitable. All subsets went through additional ad-hoc whitespace normalization.</p><p> We included a subset of the Pushshift.io corpus produced by Baumgartner et al. (2020) and previously used by Roller et al. (2021). To convert the conversational trees into language-model-accessible documents, we extracted the longest chain of comments in each thread and discarded all other paths in the tree. This reduced the corpus by about 66%.</p><p>We trained OPT-175B on 992 80GB A100 GPUs, by utilizing Fully Sharded Data Parallel (Artetxe et al., 2021) with Megatron-LM Tensor Parallelism (Shoeybi et al., 2019). We achieve utilization of up to 147 TFLOP/s per GPU. We keep Adam state in FP32, since we shard it across all hosts, while the model weights remained in FP16. To avoid underflows, we used dynamic loss scaling, as described in Micikevicius et al. (2017).</p><p>Here we describe significant training process adjustments that arose during OPT-175B pre-training.</p><p> We faced a significant number of hardware failures in our compute cluster while training OPT-175B. In total, hardware failures contributed to at least 35 manual restarts and the cycling of over 100 hosts over the course of 2 months. During manual restarts, the training run was paused, and a series of diagnostics tests were conducted to detect problematic nodes. Flagged nodes were then cordoned off and training was resumed from the last saved checkpoint. Given the difference between the number of hosts cycled out and the number of manual restarts, we estimate 70+ automatic restarts due to hardware failures.</p><p> Loss divergences were also an issue in our training run. When the loss diverged, we found that lowering the learning rate and restarting from an earlier checkpoint allowed for the job to recover and continue training. We noticed a correlation between loss divergence, our dynamic loss scalar crashing to 0, and the l 2 -norm of the activations of the final layer spiking. These observations led us to pick restart points for which our dynamic loss scalar was still in a “healthy” state (≥ 1.0), and after which our activation norms would trend downward instead of growing unboundedly. Our empirical LR schedule is shown in Figure 1. Early in training, we also noticed that lowering gradient clipping from 1.0 to 0.3 helped with stability; see our released logbook for exact details. Figure 2 shows our validation loss with respect to training iterations.</p><p>\\\n We conducted a number of other experimental mid-flight changes to handle loss divergences. These included: switching to vanilla SGD (optimization plateaued quickly, and we reverted back to AdamW); resetting the dynamic loss scalar (this helped recover some but not all divergences); and switching to a newer version of Megatron (this reduced pressure on activation norms and improved throughput).</p><p>We evaluate our model on 16 standard NLP tasks utilized in the literature: HellaSwag (Zellers et al., 2019), StoryCloze (Mostafazadeh et al., 2016), PIQA (Bisk et al., 2020), ARC Easy and Challenge (Clark et al., 2018), OpenBookQA (Mihaylov et al., 2018), WinoGrad (Levesque et al., 2011), WinoGrande (Sakaguchi et al., 2020), and SuperGLUE (Wang et al., 2019). We follow GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) by using their prompts and overall experimental setup. We compare primarily to GPT-3, having aimed to re-implement their evaluation settings, but include reported performance of other LLMs on a per-task basis when available (Lieber et al., 2021; Rae et al., 2021; Hoffmann et al., 2022; Black et al., 2022) We report performance in accuracy (omitting F1 for MultiRC and ReCoRD for consistency in evaluation metrics). For the Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC) task in the SuperGLUE benchmark, we follow (Brown et al., 2020) and formulate the task as multiple choice questions, which is known to affect performance (Liu et al., 2020).</p><p> Overall average zero-shot performance across all 14 tasks may be seen in Figure 3. Overall, we see our average performance follows the trend of GPT-3. However, performance can vary radically across the tasks: for a full breakdown, see Appendix A. Note that we intentionally removed MultiRC and WIC from these averages, as these datasets seem to systematically favor GPT-3 or OPT disproportionately. Our performance roughly matched GPT-3 for 10 tasks, and underperformed in 3 tasks (ARC Challenge and MultiRC). In 3 tasks (CB, BoolQ, WSC), we find both GPT and OPT models display unpredictable behavior with respect to scale, likely due to the small size of the validation set in these 3 tasks (56, 277, and 104 examples, respectively). In WIC, we see that the OPT models always outperform the GPT-3 models, though the numbers reported by Brown et al. (2020) also seem questionable, given WIC being a binary classification task.5 For MultiRC, we are unable to replicate the GPT-3 results using the Davinci API6 within our evaluation setup, suggesting differences in the methods of evaluation on this task. For BoolQ and WSC, we note that both OPT and GPT models seem to hover around majority-class accuracy, suggesting small perturbations in probability masses may be dominating the evaluations</p><p>\\\nChinchilla (Hoffmann et al., 2022) and Gopher (Rae et al., 2021) perform roughly consistently with others for their parameter sizes, while PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022) generally performs better across all settings, even when controlling for number of parameters. We speculate the high performance of PaLM comes predominantly from higher quality and diversity of pre-training data.</p><p> Average multi-shot incontext performance is shown in Figure 4 (again, omitting MultiRC and WIC), with detailed performances shown in Appendix A. Across the average of all metrics, we find that OPT models perform similarly to GPT-3 models. However, as with zeroshot, breaking down these results per task shows a different story: in the same set of 10 datasets as zero-shot, we see similar performance across the two models. Some of the remaining datasets show inconsistent performance with respect to model size for both OPT and GPT-3 models (BoolQ, CB, WSC, RTE). In MultiRC, we consistently see underperformance of OPT models compared to GPT3 models. Similar to our zero-shot evaluation, we hypothesize our one- and few-shot evaluation setup may differ significantly from Brown et al. (2020).</p><p>Given that LLMs are known to be an integral component of modern dialogue models (Adiwardana et al., 2020; Roller et al., 2021; Thoppilan et al., 2022; Rae et al., 2021; Chowdhery et al., 2022), we additionally evaluate OPT-175B on several open source dialogue datasets. In particular, we follow Roller et al. (2021), and evaluate on ConvAI2 (Dinan et al., 2020b), Wizard of Wikipedia (Dinan et al., 2019b), Empathetic Dialogues (Rashkin et al., 2019), and Blended Skill Talk (Smith et al., 2020). We additionally evaluate on the more recent Wizard of Internet dataset (Komeili et al., 2021). We focus our comparisons primarily against existing open source dialogue models including the fine-tuned BlenderBot 1 (Roller et al., 2021) and its pre-training counterpart Reddit 2.7B.</p><p>We also compare against the fine-tuned R2C2 BlenderBot, a 2.7B parameter BlenderBot-like model trained by Shuster et al. (2022). We report Perplexity and Unigram F1 (UF1) overlap, following the metrics of the ConvAI2 competition (Dinan et al., 2020b). To control for different tokenization in each of the models, we normalize all perplexities to be in the space of the GPT-2 tokenizer (Radford et al., 2019). We also note which models are supervised with respect to these dialogue tasks and which are unsupervised. For OPT-175B, all generations are performed using greedy decoding up to a maximum of 32 tokens. We do not attempt to prompt the model at all except for alternating “Person 1:” and “Person 2:” lines of dialogue. The remaining models use the generation parameters found in BlenderBot 1.</p><p>Results are shown in Table 2. We see that OPT-175B significantly outperforms the alsounsupervised Reddit 2.7B model on all tasks, and performs competitively with the fully supervised BlenderBot 1 model, especially in the ConvAI2 dataset. On the Wizard-of-Internet dataset, which is fully unsupervised for all models, we see that OPT-175B obtains the lowest perplexity but still has lower UF1 than the models with Wizard-ofWikipedia supervision.</p><p>We were somewhat surprised that the evaluations of the unsupervised OPT-175B model were as competitive as BlenderBot 1 on the ConvAI2 dataset. This may indicate leakage of the ConvAI2 dataset into the general pre-training corpus or even into the validation data as evaluated in Table 2. To address concerns of leakage, we searched our pre-training corpus for the first conversation in the ConvAI2 dataset, but we did not find any overlap. We additionally evaluated OPT-175B on the ConvAI2 hidden test set, which has never been publicly released, and achieved 10.7 ppl and .185 UF1, matching the performance of the validation set. Furthermore, we evaluated OPT-175B on a subset of the ConvAI2- like MultiSessionChat (MSC) dataset (Xu et al., 2021b) and obtained a perplexity of 9.7 and UF1 of .177, indicating the model is generalizing well across multiple PersonaChat-like datasets. Since both MSC and WoI datasets were released after the CommonCrawl snapshot used in pre-training corpus, there is minimal risk of leakage. We conclude that OPT-175B has a strong ability to maintain a consistent persona across conversations, a behavior also highlighted in LaMDA (Thoppilan et al., 2022).</p><h2>4 Bias &amp; Toxicity Evaluations</h2><p>To understand the potential harm of OPT-175B, we evaluate a series of benchmarks related to hate speech detection, stereotype awareness, and toxic content generation. While there may be shortcomings in these benchmarks (Blodgett et al., 2021; Jacobs and Wallach, 2021), these measurements provide a first step towards understanding the limitations of OPT-175B. We compare primarily against GPT-3 Davinci, as these benchmarks were not yet available to be included in Brown et al. (2020).</p><h2>4.1 Hate Speech Detection</h2><p>Using the ETHOS dataset provided in Mollas et al. (2020) and instrumented by Chiu and Alexander (2021), we measure the ability of OPT-175B to identify whether or not certain English statements are racist or sexist (or neither). In the zero-, one-, and few-shot binary cases, the model is presented with text and asked to consider whether the text is racist or sexist and provide a yes/no response. In the few-shot multiclass setting, the model is asked to provide a yes/no/neither response.</p><p>Results are presented in Table 3. With all of our one-shot through few-shot configurations, OPT175B performs considerably better than Davinci. We speculate this occurs from two sources: (1) evaluating via the Davinci API may be bringing in safety control mechanisms beyond the original 175B GPT-3 model used in Brown et al. (2020); and (2) the significant presence of unmoderated social media discussions in the pre-training dataset has provided additional inductive bias to aid in such classification tasks.</p><p>Developed for masked language models, CrowSPairs (Nangia et al., 2020) is a crowdsourced benchmark aiming to measure intrasentence level biases in 9 categories: gender, religion, race/color, sexual orientation, age, nationality, disability, physical appearance, and socioeconomic status. Each example consists of a pair of sentences representing a stereotype, or anti-stereotype, regarding a certain group, with the goal of measuring model preference towards stereotypical expressions. Higher scores indicate higher bias exhibited by a model.</p><p>When compared with Davinci in Table 4, OPT175B appears to exhibit more stereotypical biases in almost all categories except for religion. Again, this is likely due to differences in training data; Nangia et al. (2020) showed that Pushshift.io Reddit corpus has a higher incidence rate for stereotypes and discriminatory text than other corpora (e.g. Wikipedia). Given this is a primary data source for OPT-175B, the model may have learned more discriminatory associations, which directly impacts its performance on CrowS-Pairs.</p><p>Following Lieber et al. (2021) and Artetxe et al. (2021), we use StereoSet (Nadeem et al., 2021) to measure stereotypical bias across 4 categories: profession, gender, religion, and race. In addition to intrasentence measurement (similar to CrowSPairs), StereoSet includes measurement at the intersentence level to test a model’s ability to incorporate additional context. To account for a potential trade-off between bias detection and language modeling capability, StereoSet includes two metrics:</p><p>Language Modeling Score (LMS) and Stereotype Score (SS), which are then combined to form the Idealized Context Association Test score (ICAT). Unlike Lieber et al. (2021), we normalize scores by token count, rather than character count, which they report improves metrics for several models. Results are shown in Table 5. We see that Davinci and OPT-175B exhibit similar scores on aggregate (overall ICAT is very close between the two). In particular, Davinci outperforms in the areas of profession and race, while OPT-175B outperforms in the areas of Gender and Religion. OPT175B performs better across the board on the SS metric, while Davinci generally outperforms on the LMS metric.</p><p>We evaluate the tendency of OPT-175B to respond with toxic language via the RealToxicityPrompts (Gehman et al., 2020) dataset. Following PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), we sample 25 generations of 20 tokens using nucleus sampling (Holtzman et al., 2020) (p = 0.9) for each of 10, 000 randomly sampled prompts from RTP, and report mean toxicity probabilities of the continuations, stratified across bucketed toxicities of the original prompts. For comparison, we report bucketed toxicity rates from Davinci and PaLM. Results are shown in Figure 5. Overall, we see that OPT-175B has a higher toxicity rate than either PaLM or Davinci. We also observe that all 3 models have increased likelihood of generating toxic continuations as the toxicity of the prompt increases, which is consistent with the observations of Chowdhery et al. (2022). As with our experiments in hate speech detection, we suspect the inclusion of unmoderated social media texts in the pre-training corpus raises model familiarity with, and therefore propensity to generate and detect, toxic text. This strong awareness of toxic language may or may not be desirable depending on the specific requirements of downstream applications. Future applications of OPT-175B should consider this aspect of the model, and take additional mitigations, or avoid usage entirely as appropriate.</p><h2>4.5 Dialogue Safety Evaluations</h2><p>Finally, we compare OPT-175B on two Dialogue Safety evaluations. The first, SaferDialogues (Ung et al., 2021), measures the ability to recover from explicit safety failures, usually in the form of apologizing or recognizing its mistake. The second, the Safety Bench Unit Tests (Dinan et al., 2021), measures how unsafe a model’s response is, stratified across 4 levels of topic sensitivity: Safe, Realistic, Unsafe, and Adversarial. As with the other dialogue evaluations (Section 3.2), we compare to several existing open source dialogue models. Results for both experiments are shown in Table 6. We observe that OPT-175B has similar performance as the Reddit 2.7B model across both SaferDialogues and the Unit Tests, with OPT-175B performing marginally better in the Safe and Adversarial settings. Consistent with Roller et al. (2021) and Xu et al. (2020), we find that the models finetuned on curated dialogue datasets (BlenderBot 1, R2C2) have overall lower toxicity. We conclude that future experimentation of OPT-175B for dialogue should contain explicit fine-tuning on curated datasets in order to improve the safety profile.</p><p>In Sections 3.1 and 4, we carried out extensive evaluation of all released models at varying scales. We saw parity in performance for standard evaluation datasets used in the GPT-3 models. Moreover, we performed safety, bias, and inclusion evaluations, again seeing largely comparable performance with some variations in toxicity and hate speech detection. However, such evaluations may not fully characterize the complete limitations of these models. In general, we qualitatively observe that OPT-175B suffers from the same limitations noted in other LLMs (Brown et al., 2020; Lieber et al., 2021; Thoppilan et al., 2022; Rae et al., 2021; Smith et al., 2022; Chowdhery et al., 2022; Bender et al., 2021). In particular, we found OPT-175B does not work well with declarative instructions or point-blank interrogatives.</p><p>Prompting with such instructions tends to produce a simulation of a dialogue beginning with such an instruction, rather than an execution of the instruction. Future work into instruction learning, in the vein of InstructGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022), may alleviate these limitations. OPT-175B also tends to be repetitive and can easily get stuck in a loop. While sampling can reduce the incidence rate of repetitive behavior (Holtzman et al., 2020), we anecdotally found it did not eliminate it entirely when only one generation is sampled. Future work may wish to incorporate more modern strategies for reducing repetition and improving diversity, such as unlikelihood training (Welleck et al., 2020) or best-first decoding (Meister et al., 2020).</p><p>Similar to other LLMs, OPT-175B can produce factually incorrect statements (Adiwardana et al., 2020; Brown et al., 2020; Roller et al., 2021; Rae et al., 2021; Chowdhery et al., 2022; Thoppilan et al., 2022). This can be particularly harmful in applications where information accuracy is critical, such as healthcare and scientific discovery (Weidinger et al., 2021b). Recently, several efforts have reported that retrieval-augmented models can improve factual correctness of LLMs (Lewis et al., 2020; Komeili et al., 2021; Thoppilan et al., 2022; Borgeaud et al., 2021; Shuster et al., 2022; Nakano et al., 2021). We believe OPT-175B will also benefit from retrieval-augmentation in future iterations. As shown in Section 4, we also find OPT-175B has a high propensity to generate toxic language and reinforce harmful stereotypes, even when provided with a relatively innocuous prompt (Gehman et al., 2020), and adversarial prompts are trivial to find (Dinan et al., 2021).</p><p>There has been a great deal of work on mitigations for toxicity and biases (Dathathri et al., 2019; Dinan et al., 2019a; Sheng et al., 2019; Dinan et al., 2020a; Liu et al., 2019a; Krause et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020; Liang et al., 2021; Dinan et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2021a; Dhamala et al., 2021; Schick et al., 2021; Ouyang et al., 2022). Depending on downstream applications, future uses of OPT-175B may need to employ these or novel mitigation approaches, especially before any real world deployment. Given our primary goal as a replication of GPT-3, we choose not to apply these mitigations in this first release. In summary, we still believe this technology is premature for commercial deployment.</p><p>Despite including data sheets and model cards, we believe more scrutiny should be afforded to the training data with additional data characterization and selection criteria in order to use data responsibly. The current practice is to feed the model with as much data as possible and minimal selection within these datasets. Despite having comprehensive evaluations, we would ideally have more streamlined and consistent evaluation setups to ensure replicability and reproducibility of evaluation scenarios. Differences in prompting styles and number of shots for in-context learning could create variations that lead to different results. We hope that the public release of the OPT models will enable many more researchers to work on these important issues.</p><h2>6 Considerations for Release</h2><p>Following the recommendations for individual researchers generated by the Partnership for AI,7 along with the governance guidance outlined by NIST,8 we are disclosing all of the details involved in training OPT-175B through our logbook,9 our code, and providing researchers access to model weights for OPT-175B, along with a suite of smaller baselines mirroring the setup for OPT175B.</p><p>We aim to be fully accountable for the development lifecycle of OPT-175B, and only through increasing transparency around LLM development can we start understanding the limitations and risks of LLMs before broader deployment occurs. By sharing a detailed account of our day-to-day training process, we disclose not only how much compute was used to train the current version of OPT-175B, but also the human overhead required when underlying infrastructure or the training process itself becomes unstable at scale. These details are generally omitted from previous publications, likely due to the inability to fully ablate changes made mid-flight (without drastically increasing the compute budget). We hope that by revealing how certain ad-hoc design decisions were made, we can improve upon these practices in the future, and collectively increase the experimental robustness in developing models at this scale.</p><p>Outside of these notes, the metaseq codebase itself is the final source of truth in many of our implementation details. By releasing our development codebase, we aim to shed light on any implementation detail that may have been omitted from being explicitly enumerated in this paper, as it is either considered a detail of standard practice in the field, or is simply a detail we failed to account for. This current codebase is also the only known open-source implementation of training a decoderonly transformer that is ≥175B parameters without the use of pipeline paralellism on NVIDIA GPUs.</p><p>To enable experimentation at 175B scale, we are providing researchers with direct access to the parameters of OPT-175B. The reasoning here is twofold: enable Responsible AI research into LLMs while simultaneously reducing the environmental impact of pursuing research at this scale. There is a growing body of work detailing ethical and social risks from deploying language models with emergent capabilities at scale (Weidinger et al., 2021a; Bommasani et al., 2021; Dinan et al., 2021; Kenton et al., 2021). By limiting access to OPT-175B to the research community with a non-commercial license, we aim to focus development efforts on quantifying the limitations of the LLMs first, before broader commercial deployment occurs.</p><p>Furthermore, there exists significant compute and carbon cost to reproduce models of this size. While OPT-175B was developed with an estimated carbon emissions footprint (CO2eq) of 75 tons,10 GPT-3 was estimated to use 500 tons (Patterson et al., 2021), while Gopher required 380 tons (Rae et al., 2021). These estimates are not universally reported, and the accounting methodologies for these calculations are also not standardized. In addition, model training is only one component of the overall carbon footprint of AI systems; we must also consider experimentation and eventual downstream inference cost, all of which contribute to the growing energy footprint of creating large-scale models (Wu et al., 2022).</p><p>By releasing our logbook, we hope to highlight the gap between a theoretical carbon cost estimate that assumes no hardware failures or training instabilities, versus one that aims to include the entire LLM development lifecycle. We need to understand the manufacturing (or embodied) carbon of these systems (Gupta et al., 2021) as they grow increasingly more complex, and we hope that our paper can help future work in defining additional factors to consider when measuring the impact of scale on the environment.</p><p>Similarly, by producing a set of baselines across a wide range of scales, we hope to enable the broader research community to study the impact and limitations of these models with respect to scale alone. As reported in Hoffmann et al. (2022), many of these LLMs may have been under-trained as a function of the amount of training data used, which implies that incorporating more data and continuing to train these baseline models may continue to improve performance. There is also evidence that step-function changes in capabilities may occur at a scale that is much smaller than 175B (Wei et al., 2021), indicating a need to examine a wider range of scales for different research applications.</p><p>Since the publication of the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017) and BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), the field of NLP has experienced a massive shift towards the use of LLMs with self-supervised pre-training. Multiple masked langauge models, including T5 (Raffel et al., 2020) and MegatronLM (Shoeybi et al., 2019), have shown consistent improvements through scale. These scaling gains come not only from growing the total number of parameters in the models, but also the amount and quality of pre-training data (Liu et al., 2019b; Hoffmann et al., 2022). Auto-regressive language models (Mikolov et al., 2009) have seen the largest growth in model size, from 117M parameters (Radford et al., 2018) to over 500B parameters (Smith et al., 2022; Chowdhery et al., 2022).</p><p>The resulting massive improvement in generative fluency and quality was first characterized in GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019) and further improved with GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) and later models. Although a variety of very large (over 100B parameters) generative models have now been trained (Lieber et al., 2021; Rae et al., 2021; Thoppilan et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2022; Chowdhery et al., 2022), they are all closed source and accessible only internally or via paid API services. There are a few notable efforts towards open sourcing LLMs from non-profit research organizations including EleutherAI (Black et al., 2022) and BigScience.11</p><p>These models differ from the OPT models in pre-training data, target languages and model scale, making it possible for the community to compare different pre-training strategies. Since Brown et al. (2020), the primary evaluation criterion for LLMs has been prompt-based (Black et al., 2022; Rae et al., 2021; Chowdhery et al., 2022), as is also performed in this paper. This is largely due to the convenience of evaluating on many tasks without specialized task-specific fine-tuning. Prompting itself has a long history: cloze evaluations go back several decades (Chambers and Jurafsky, 2008; Mostafazadeh et al., 2016). More recently, prompting or masked infilling has been used to probe models for knowledge (Petroni et al., 2019) or perform a variety of NLP tasks (Radford et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020). There has also been work on eliciting prompting behavior in smaller models (Schick and Schütze, 2020; Gao et al., 2021b; Li and Liang, 2021; Lester et al., 2021; Scao and Rush, 2021), improving the flexibility of prompting (Shin et al., 2020), and understanding why and how prompting works (Liu et al., 2021; Min et al., 2022). Recent efforts have shown gains by fine-tuning models to directly respond to instruction-style prompting (Wei et al., 2021; Min et al., 2021; Sanh et al., 2021; Ouyang et al., 2022).</p><p>However, effective prompt engineering remains an open research challenge. Results vary significantly and unpredictably with the selection of the prompt (Lu et al., 2021), and models do not seem to understand the prompts as fully as we expect (Webson and Pavlick, 2021). Furthermore, it is challenging to write prompts without a development set, which leads to questions about the extent to which we are actually achieving zero- or few-shot learning in practice (Perez et al., 2021). We do not attempt to address these concerns of prompting, and instead only aim to provide evaluation of OPT-175B in existing settings. However, we hope the full release of OPT-175B will enable others to better study these challenges in the future.</p><p>In this technical report, we introduced OPT, a collection of auto-regressive language models ranging in size from 125M to 175B parameters. Our goal was to replicate the performance and sizes of the GPT-3 class of models, while also applying the latest best practices in data curation and training efficiency. We described training details, evaluated performance in a number of NLP and dialogue settings, and characterized behaviors with respect to bias, toxicity and hate speech. We also described many other limitations the models have, and discussed a wide set of considerations for responsibly releasing the models. We believe the entire AI community would benefit from working together to develop guidelines for responsible LLMs, and we hope that broad access to these types of models will increase the diversity of voices defining the ethical considerations of such technologies.</p><p>We would like to thank Scott Jeschonek, Giri Anantharaman, Diego Sarina, Joaquin Colombo, Chris Bray, Stephen Roylance, Kalyan Saladi, Shubho Sengupta, and Brian O’Horo for helping to remove infrastructure blockers along the way; Percy Liang, Rishi Bommasani, and Emily Dinan for discussions on responsible release practices; Carole-Jean Wu for discussions on sustainability and carbon footprint considerations; Srini Iyer, Ramakanth Pasunuru, and Shruti Bhosale for previous contributions to evaluations; Benjamin Lefaudeux, Geeta Chauhan, Natalia Gimelshein, Horace He, and Sam Gross for discussions on performance improvement work; Emily Dinan, Carole-Jean Wu, Daniel McKinnon, and Mark Tygert for feedback on this draft; Antoine Bordes, Joelle Pineau, Mary Williamson, Necip Fazil Ayan, Armand Joulin, Sergey Edunov, Melanie Kambadur, Zornitsa Kozareva, Ves Stoyanov, Vitaliy Liptchinsky, Rahul Iyer, Jing Xu, Jason Weston, and many others for supporting this project internally.</p><p>Daniel Adiwardana, Minh-Thang Luong, David R So, Jamie Hall, Noah Fiedel, Romal Thoppilan, Zi Yang, Apoorv Kulshreshtha, Gaurav Nemade, Yifeng Lu, et al. 2020.

(2018), we provide a model card for OPT-175B.</p><p>• <strong>Person or organization developing model:</strong> OPT-175B was developed by Meta AI.</p><p>•  OPT-175B was released on May 3, 2022.</p><p>•  OPT-175B described in this paper is version 1.0.0.</p><p> OPT-175B is a large decoder-only transformer language model.</p><p><strong>• Information about training algorithms, parameters, fairness constraints or other applied approaches, and features:</strong> OPT-175B was trained with AdamW for parameter sizes from 125M to 175B. See the Data Card (Appendix C) for information about training data and Section 2.2 - 2.5 for information about the training process.</p><p><strong>• Paper or other resource for more information:</strong> See the rest of this paper for more details on OPT-175B as well as the corresponding post on the Meta AI Research Blog. More details are also available in metaseq, our open-source repository.12</p><p> OPT-175B and the smaller baseline models are made available through a non-commercial use license agreement provided in our model license.13</p><p>• <strong>Where to send questions or comments about the model:</strong> Please contact the corresponding authors {susanz,roller,namangoyal}@fb.com for any questions or comments.</p><p> We release OPT-175B for research into Language Models, especially as it pertains to Responsible AI. See Section 6 for more detailed Considerations for Release. Information on how to use the model can be found at metaseq, our open-source repository.</p><p><strong>• Primary intended users:</strong> We primarily target researchers and the related research community.</p><p>•  OPT-175B is not released for production use or real-world deployments. As we note in Section 5, OPT-175B, like similar large language models, has a variety of shortcomings that make it premature for commercial use.</p><p><strong>• Data selection for training:</strong> Training data for OPT-175B was selected based on a combination of breadth and availability. See our Data Card (Appendix C) for more detailed information on the data used to train our model.</p><p>• <strong>Data selection for evaluation:</strong> Evaluations in this paper were chosen to provide comparable performance assessments relative to similar scale models in the literature. Given concerns in the community around safety and fairness of large language models in general, we also explicitly provide evaluations on Responsible AI (see Section 4).</p><p> Like other large language models for which the diversity (or lack thereof) of training data induces downstream impact on the quality of our model, OPT-175B has limitations in terms of bias and safety. OPT-175B can also have quality issues in terms of generation diversity and hallucination. In general, OPT-175B is not immune from the plethora of issues that plague modern large language models. By releasing with a non-commercial license, we also hope to increase communication, transparency, and study of the problems of large language models, especially in areas which may not be aligned with commercial interests. See Section 5 for a more detailed discussion of limitations of OPT-175B.</p><p><strong>• Recommendations for future work:</strong> See Section 6 for more about our Considerations for Release, including a discussion of potential avenues of research enabled by opening our model to more of the research community. We hope that the release of OPT-175B, as well as information around our model training process, will increase open science around both large language models in specific and natural language processing and deep learning in general.</p><p>For all sample outputs, the initial prompt is given in bold and the remainder is the continuation. These example outputs were intentionally selected to highlight both successes and failures of the OPT-175B model.</p><p>:::info\nThis paper is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01068\">available on arxiv</a> under CC by 4.0 Deed (Attribution 4.0 International) license.</p>",

      "content": "<p>\\\nWe’re excited to welcome Yuri Misnik, Chief Technology Officer at inDrive, for a conversation on scaling technology, AI innovation, and building a lean and strong engineering organization. Yuri brings decades of global leadership experience across major technology and financial services organizations, having held senior roles at companies including Microsoft and AWS.</p><p>At inDrive, Yuri oversees the company’s engineering, AI, and data teams as the platform evolves from a leading ride-hailing service into a full-featured super app. In this interview, we explore what energizes him about this transformational stage at inDrive, how technology is influencing the company’s trajectory, and the leadership principles that guide his approach to lean yet impactful engineering.</p><p>What excites me most is the combination of scale and growth in a very customer-centric purpose-driven business. We’re not only big in terms of customers and drivers — we’re expanding into a super app, building grocery verticals, and moving into adjacent domains. That means we’re creating a technology platform and a technology organization that is not only scalable and robust on a global level, but also truly customer centric and data-driven.</p><p>The second part is the opportunity to be building something modern by design: using AI (in a broad sense) everywhere makes things better and faster, helps us servicing customers efficiently and stay relevant to their needs. Doing that at the pace we’re growing is a challenging engineering problem — and also an exciting organizational challenge.</p><h3>2) InDrive has scaled from a ride-hailing app to a full-fledged “super app.” How do you see technology driving this next phase of diversification?</h3><p>For a super app, the most important thing is staying relevant to customer needs all the time and ability to integrate not only our own businesses, but also partners. We want to build an app and a platform that fulfills everyday needs — mobility, grocery, and more — and to do that well, it has to be consistently relevant to each person and flexible to integrate multiple businesses at pace.</p><p>Relevance is driven by data, analytics, AI, and machine learning: extracting what truly matters for a specific customer and making the experience always personalized — what we call a “segment of one.” This requires strong foundations: big data platforms, data lakes, and modern ML/AI capabilities, along with the engineering and operations to run them reliably at scale.</p><p>Integration on the other side is driven by a robust well-designed API-first platform which is simple to understand, operate and maintain.</p><p>On the technical level, it starts with building the right platforms: data lake, data pipelines, data quality layers and the model management infrastructure that enables advanced ML usage. And one of the imperative today is to have a comprehensive semantic layer that enables modern AI scenarios, especially generative and agentic ones. A big part of this is building a robust data science and machine learning platform with embedded MLOps and related practices.</p><p>We’re also intentional about not building everything from scratch, but using strong building blocks from the market — for example, combining AWS SageMaker with Databricks capabilities — and picking what’s best to drive our advantage.</p><p>On the cultural level, it’s about learning how to make AI work for us as a company. We’re deploying different agents internally, observing how they perform, and learning what we need to change in our processes and data to make those agents truly useful. Over time, we’ll also introduce more agents for customers, drivers, suppliers — which changes interaction patterns toward truly conversational assisted interfaces, via chat or voice. Agents can become meaningfully helpful to everyone in our ecosystem: helping them make better decisions, find the best deals, and optimize how they use the platform.</p><h3>4) InDrive has always prided itself on fairness and transparent pricing. How does AI fit into that philosophy without introducing bias?</h3><p>I don’t see AI and fairness as inherently contradictory. We already use machine learning in supply-and-demand models to ensure we have the right amount of cars on the road and can match customer demand. And we are doing it in a responsible and transparent way, always staying true to our purpose of fighting injustice.</p><p>The key is being careful about the data we select and how we train models, making sure we are optimising them for the benefits of our customers, not for profit. We also deliberately position advanced AI and agents as a recommendation and helper, not an ultimate black-box decision maker. In our ride-hailing model, pricing is fundamentally based on negotiation between the customer and the driver. Models can recommend an optimal range to help the agreement happen faster and more smoothly, but we’re explicit that control and final decision stays with our customers and drivers. Transparency and user control are the guardrails.</p><p>We’re very deliberate about using our resources efficiently and adding more only if we absolutely need it: we look closely at what teams do and what their real workload is, we constantly optimise our cloud usage and architectures for cost. Most teams are lean, cross-functional product teams — typically a couple of frontend engineers, a couple of backend engineers, and QA — and we push for full end-to-end ownership.&nbsp;</p><p>We also prioritize seniority and decision power in teams: fewer “clipboard roles,” more people who can make decisions and execute quickly.</p><p>We have built a very effective devops platform for our teams to use on AWS which is our global cloud provider. It allows us to completely automate all the routine tasks for environment provisioning and management, deployment, testing and broader feature rollout. We also use autoscaling efficiently to make sure we always have the optimal amount of resources serving our workloads and teams are more and more getting accountability for finops practices they use.</p><p>Another major lever is automation and AI agents in areas that add less differentiation — for example, documentation support, testing, requirements analysis. We’re starting to introduce AI agents to help create more tests with fewer people and reduce manual overhead. This isn’t only about efficiency: automation improves resiliency, robustness, and quality by reducing mistakes. Cost-consciousness and keeping teams lean is part of the operating philosophy.</p><p>There’s no universal answer, but for us a few principles matter.</p><p>First, we focus on building what truly differentiates us rather than building everything from scratch. We are cloud-native — all of our infrastructure runs on the cloud, mostly AWS and Google Cloud — and we rely heavily on fine-tuned auto-scaling so our infrastructure capacity always matches demand.</p><p>We also continuously optimize. We have strong platform teams, but we also push cost ownership into product teams by introducing FinOps practices: giving teams clear visibility into what things cost — cost per ride, cost per transaction, even cost per database call. We track cost per ride as a KPI and aim to keep it flat or decreasing over time as we grow, so we scale with discipline.</p><h3>7) Building a world-class engineering organization requires not just systems, but culture. How are you cultivating a sense of ownership and purpose among distributed teams?</h3><p>A lot of it comes down to communication and alignment: bringing people together (even virtually), sharing common goals, and keeping everyone connected to the purpose, strategy and shared context.</p><p>Structurally, we rely on cross-functional product teams built around shared outcomes, with clear goals and strong ownership. We’re also lucky that even when remote, many teams operate within similar time zones, which makes collaboration easier. And we intentionally keep teams small and lean, because smaller teams communicate better and can stay aligned on shared goals more naturally.</p><h3>8) Having led tech at large organizations like Microsoft, AWS, HSBC, National Australia Bank, and now InDrive, what key leadership lessons have stuck with you across industries?</h3><p>The biggest lessons aren’t industry-specific.</p><p>First, you can only be an effective leader if you genuinely care — about customers, your business, about your team and ultimately about the technology choices. That mindset becomes visible and contagious.</p><p>Second, leadership is not about making every decision. It’s about enabling others to be the best versions of themselves and consistently make good decisions. It is also about aligning the organization on shared goals, removing blockers, and practicing servant leadership — providing tools, context, and autonomy rather than becoming a bottleneck.</p><p>Third, you need a clear mission, vision and shared purpose — not just “strategy,” but the core principles you build technology, organization, and people capabilities around. And finally, being genuine, honest, and transparent with the team is needed as part of your core personality.</p><h3>9) How do you personally stay grounded and continue learning amid the pace of AI disruption? Any frameworks or habits you rely on?</h3><p>I don’t have a strict framework, but I’m intentional about inputs. I use my network and what I see through places like LinkedIn, Reddit and some of the blogs I read regularly to stay broad and understand the context of what is happening in the industry, and then I go deeper on topics that matter.</p><p>I also spend a lot of time reading — I prefer books over videos — and I try to read about something new for me every day, even if it’s only for 15 minutes. AI can also be a useful helper to structure thinking and guide exploration when you’re learning something new, but it doesn’t replace the work of learning — it complements it.</p><h3>10) If we revisit this conversation in three years, what do you hope InDrive’s technology story will look like, both in terms of global reach and ethical innovation?</h3><p>In three years, I’d love to say we are a company that made a significant impact in fighting injustice and creating opportunities for people and communities through technology and through the tech-enabled businesses we and our partners run — ride-hailing, grocery, and beyond.</p><p>I also want us to have a very capable technology team that’s recognized worldwide for innovation and forward thinking — and a culture where people genuinely care about our customers, our business, and our purpose and mission. As we scale, I hope we stay transparent and fair — fair to ourselves, to customers, and to suppliers. Efficiency will remain a core principle, because being efficient translates directly into customer value, and I hope we stay true to that mission as the business grows.</p>",

      "content": "A new study from Scripps Institution of Oceanography finds that factoring ocean damage into climate economics nearly doubles the estimated global cost of climate change, adding close to $2 trillion per year from losses to fisheries, coral reefs, and coastal infrastructure. \"It is the first time a social cost of carbon (SCC) assessment -- a key measure of economic harm caused by climate change -- has included damages to the ocean,\" reports Inside Climate News. From the report: \"For decades, we've been estimating the economic cost of climate change while effectively assigning a value of zero to the ocean,\" said Bernardo Bastien-Olvera, who led the study during his postdoctoral fellowship at Scripps. \"Ocean loss is not just an environmental issue, but a central part of the economic story of climate change.\"\n \nThe social cost of carbon is an accounting method for working out the monetary cost of each ton of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere. \"[It] is one of the most efficient tools we have for internalizing climate damages into economic decision-making,\" said Amy Campbell, a United Nations climate advisor and former British government COP negotiator. Calculations have historically been used by international organizations and state departments like the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to assess policy proposals -- though a 2025 White House memo from the Trump administration instructed federal agencies to ignore the data during cost-benefit analyses unless required by law. \"It becomes politically contentious when deciding whose damages are counted, which sectors are included and most importantly how future and retrospective harms are valued,\" Campbell said.\n \nExcluding ocean harm, the social cost of carbon is $51 per ton of carbon dioxide emitted. This increases to $97.20 per ton when the ocean, which covers 70 percent of the planet, is included. In 2024, global CO2 emissions were estimated to be 41.6 billion tons, making the 91 percent cost increase significant. Using greenhouse gas emission predictions, the report estimates the annual damages to traditional markets alone will be $1.66 trillion by 2100.",

Imagine you get a Slack message at 2 AM, telling you that your APIs are down for over an hour and nobody noticed until customers started complaining. A monitoring service solves this problem by letting you and your team proactively respond to incidents, before problems escalate.</p><p>In this tutorial, I will be taking you through the steps on how to build a status monitoring application from scratch. By the end of this article, you will have a system that:</p><ol><li>Probes your services on a schedule (HTTP, TCP, DNS, and more)</li><li>Detects outages and sends alerts to various communication channels (Teams, Slack, etc)</li><li>Tracks incidents with automatic open/close</li><li>Exposes metrics for Prometheus and Grafana dashboards</li></ol><p>For this application, I will be using Go because it is fast, compiles to a single binary for cross platform support, and handles concurrency, which is important for an application that needs to monitor multiple endpoints simultaneously.</p><p>We will be building a Go application \"StatusD\". It reads a config file that has a list of services to monitor, probes them, and creates incidents, fire notifications when something goes wrong.</p><ul><li>Grafana (Prometheus for metric)</li></ul><p>Here's the high-level architecture:</p><pre><code>┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                        Docker Compose                           │\n│  ┌──────────┐  ┌──────────┐  ┌──────────┐  ┌──────────────────┐ │\n│  │ Postgres │  │Prometheus│  │  Grafana │  │      Nginx       │ │\n│  │    DB    │  │ (metrics)│  │(dashboard)│  │ (reverse proxy) │ │\n│  └────┬─────┘  └────┬─────┘  └────┬─────┘  └────────┬─────────┘ │\n│       │             │             │                  │          │\n│       └─────────────┴─────────────┴──────────────────┘          │\n│                              │                                  │\n│                    ┌─────────┴─────────┐                        │\n│                    │      StatusD      │                        │\n│                    │   (our Go app)    │                        │\n│                    └─────────┬─────────┘                        │\n│                              │                                  │\n└──────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────┘\n                               │\n              ┌────────────────┼────────────────┐\n              ▼                ▼                ▼\n         ┌────────┐       ┌────────┐       ┌────────┐\n         │Service │       │Service │       │Service │\n         │   A    │       │   B    │       │   C    │\n         └────────┘       └────────┘       └────────┘\n</code></pre><p>Before we write code, let's understand how the pieces fit together.

Not all endpoints return 200, some may return 204 or a redirect. This lets you define what \"healthy\" means for each service.</p><p>We need a place to store the probe results and incidents.

Here, we are indexing by asset and timestamp (in a descending order), which allows us to quickly query for the probe results of a service.</p><h2>Building the Probe System</h2><p>Things begin to get interesting here. We want to support probing over multiple protocol types: HTTPS, TCP, DNS, etc. without having to write a complex switch statement. To solve this, we are using a registry pattern.</p><p>First we'll define what a probe looks like:</p><pre><code>// internal/probe/probe.go\npackage probe\n\nimport (\n    \"context\"\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"github.com/yourname/status/internal/models\"\n)\n\n// Probe defines the interface for checking service health\ntype Probe interface {\n    Probe(ctx context.Context, asset models.Asset) (models.ProbeResult, error)\n}\n\n// registry holds all probe types\nvar registry = make(map[string]func() Probe)\n\n// Register adds a probe type to the registry\nfunc Register(assetType string, factory func() Probe) {\n    registry[assetType] = factory\n}\n\n// GetProbe returns a probe for the given asset type\nfunc GetProbe(assetType string) (Probe, error) {\n    factory, ok := registry[assetType]\n    if !ok {\n        return nil, fmt.Errorf(\"unknown asset type: %s\", assetType)\n    }\n    return factory(), nil\n}\n</code></pre><p>\\\nNow implement the HTTP probe:</p><pre><code>// internal/probe/http.go\npackage probe\n\nimport (\n    \"context\"\n    \"io\"\n    \"net/http\"\n    \"time\"\n    \"github.com/yourname/status/internal/models\"\n)\n\nfunc init() {\n    Register(\"http\", func() Probe { return &amp;httpProbe{} })\n}\n\ntype httpProbe struct{}\n\nfunc (p *httpProbe) Probe(ctx context.Context, asset models.Asset) (models.ProbeResult, error) {\n    result := models.ProbeResult{\n        AssetID:   asset.ID,\n        Timestamp: time.Now(),\n    }\n\n    client := &amp;http.Client{\n        Timeout: time.Duration(asset.TimeoutSeconds) * time.Second,\n    }\n\n    req, err := http.NewRequestWithContext(ctx, http.MethodGet, asset.Address, nil)\n    if err != nil {\n        result.Success = false\n        result.Message = err.Error()\n        return result, err\n    }\n\n    start := time.Now()\n    resp, err := client.Do(req)\n    result.LatencyMs = time.Since(start).Milliseconds()\n\n    if err != nil {\n        result.Success = false\n        result.Message = err.Error()\n        return result, err\n    }\n    defer resp.Body.Close()\n\n    // Read body (limit to 1MB)\n    io.ReadAll(io.LimitReader(resp.Body, 1024*1024))\n\n    result.Code = resp.StatusCode\n\n    // Check if status code is expected\n    if len(asset.ExpectedStatusCodes) &gt; 0 {\n        for _, code := range asset.ExpectedStatusCodes {\n            if code == resp.StatusCode {\n                result.Success = true\n                return result, nil\n            }\n        }\n        result.Success = false\n        result.Message = \"unexpected status code\"\n    } else {\n        result.Success = resp.StatusCode &lt; 400\n    }\n\n    return result, nil\n}\n</code></pre><p>\\\nThe init() function runs automatically when your Go application starts. This adds the HTTP probe to the registry without any code change.</p><p>Want to add TCP probes? Create , implement the interface, and register it in .</p><h2>Scheduling and Concurrency</h2><p>We need to probe all our Assets on a schedule and for this we will be using a worker pool.

When its time to check an asset, the ticker sends a probe job into a channel. There are a fixed number of worker goroutines that listen on the channel and do the actual probing.</p><p>We don't run probes directly in the ticker goroutines because probes can block while waiting for network responses or timeouts. By using workers, we can control concurrency.</p><p>For example, with 4 workers and 100 assets, only 4 probes will run at any moment even if tickers fire simultaneously. The channel acts as a buffer for pending jobs, and a  ensures all workers shut down cleanly.</p><h2>Incident Detection: The State Machine</h2><p>When a probe fails, we don't automatically assume a failure. It could be network glitch. However, if it fails again, we create an incident.

      "content": "<p>In the last 6 months, I’ve helped <strong>3 AI startups migrate from Vercel or Cloudflare to AWS Lambda</strong>. The pattern is the same: they start on a platform with great DX. Then the wall shows up: background jobs, retries, queues, cron, and eventually a “this endpoint needs 2-8 GB RAM for 4-10 minutes” workload — and they land on AWS.</p><p>To be fair: Vercel and Cloudflare captured developer attention for good reasons. Vercel ships Next.js fast — previews, simple deploys, great DX. Workers are great for edge use-cases: low latency, fast cold starts, global distribution. Both solve real problems.</p><p>Where things get harder is when the app grows a backend shape: queues, retries, scheduled jobs, heavier compute, private networking. Vercel still relies on third-party partners for queuing (like Upstash or Inngest), adoption involves piecing together vendors. Workers are fantastic for edge latency, but you feel constraints fast (memory limits, lack of native binary support, and file system restrictions), when Lambda is built for “bigger” invocations in mind (more memory and longer max runtime), with SQS, DynamoDB, and EventBridge under the same network.</p><p>For request-based apps calling LLMs, AWS Lambda tends to cover what startups actually need: compute, queues, persistence, scheduling in one network. <strong>Pay-per-use, no infra to manage, often near $0</strong> for small workloads. The tooling improved too — <a href=\"https://sst.dev/docs/\">SST</a> made deployment much easier. But the hype moved on before anyone noticed.</p><h2>The Hype Died, but did Serverless?</h2><p>The biggest criticism of serverless technology, especially with AWS, is that setting up the infrastructure is complicated, starting from defining policies to actually creating all of the AWS resources and connecting them together. It has a learning curve and tools like <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/what-is-sam.html\">SAM</a> simplify it, but they oftentimes are brittle or have bugs. SAM was a great start — it built the hype and community around serverless — but it wasn’t as straightforward as modern development tools. Working at orgs where I had to introduce it to engineers used to Docker containers, Docker was a faster workflow than CloudFormation wrappers.  fixed this, but by then developers had already moved to Vercel or Cloudflare.</p><p>Another big problem is  with the compute itself, the time that is required to spin up the compute resource and load the runtime and then execute the code. This means serverless shouldn’t be viewed as a short-running server process, but rather as a different computing paradigm that requires factoring specifics of the underlying constraints.</p><p><a href=\"https://spacelift.io/blog/aws-lambda-migration\">Spacelift</a>, a CI/CD platform, went the other direction in 2024: ECS to Lambda for async jobs. Spiky traffic made always-on containers expensive.</p><h2>When NOT to use Serverless</h2><p>Of course, serverless is not universal. Know when to reach for something else.</p><p>In 2025, <a href=\"https://www.infoq.com/news/2025/12/unkey-serverless/\">Unkey moved away from serverless</a> after performance struggles. Their pattern: high-volume workloads with tight coupling between components. As traffic grew, pay-per-invocation stopped making economic sense. This mirrors the <a href=\"https://www.infoq.com/news/2023/05/prime-ec2-ecs-saves-costs/\">Prime Video case from 2023</a> — both had architectures where serverless overhead exceeded the benefits. The lesson isn’t that serverless failed; it’s that <strong>serverless has a sweet spot</strong>, and high-throughput tightly-coupled systems aren’t in it.</p><p>When to reach for something else:</p><ol><li><p>. Applications like AI agent orchestrators would not work on Lambda due to hard 15-minute timeout. In this case, switch to <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/AWS_Fargate.html\">Fargate</a> or regular EC2 instance.</p></li><li><p><strong>Predictable high traffic or constant load</strong>. You would gain more benefit from using containers in this case. Serverless is way better for bursty or unpredictable traffic.</p></li><li><p>. Lambda does not support GPUs: for machine learning inference that requires CUDA, you have to use either  or .</p></li><li><p><strong>High-throughput media pipelines</strong>. Orchestrating many state transitions per second through <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/welcome.html\">Step Functions</a> gets expensive fast. The Prime Video case is typical — they triggered a transition for , hitting massive limits and costs. Use containers for stream processing.</p></li><li><p><strong>Your team is already efficient elsewhere</strong>. If you have existing infrastructure — Kubernetes, for example — and the team knows it well, don’t force serverless. It takes time for an org to adopt an unfamiliar paradigm. For greenfield projects and validation, serverless is great. For teams already shipping on K8s, keep shipping.</p></li><li><p><strong>Legacy dependencies that need a full OS</strong>. Some applications depend on libraries that are hard to package for Lambda. At times you just need a VM to run the thing. Serverless is problematic when you’re fighting runtime constraints.</p></li><li><p><strong>Unsupported programming languages</strong>. Don’t experiment with languages Lambda doesn’t officially support. Custom runtimes add overhead that’s rarely worth it. Stick to Node.js, Python, Go, Java, .NET — the supported options.</p></li></ol><p>For request-based apps with variable traffic, especially AI-integrated APIs, serverless fits well.</p><p>If you already have AWS basics, building serverless there makes sense. Here’s the stack and how to use it effectively.</p><p>For the presentation layer, use a CDN and object storage for static assets. That’s typically , as you get benefits from the edge computing and the AWS infrastructure. S3 is useful because you can just build your HTML and CSS artifacts and upload them to the object storage. This decouples your frontend and web assets from your server, but brings architectural limitations: you can only do static exports. Fine for blogs, but you lose Server-Side Rendering (SSR) capabilities needed for dynamic SEO or personalized content.</p><p>When you have the CDN in place, it’s worth thinking about how you would coordinate request execution. You can use an <strong>Application Load Balancer</strong> to forward requests to Lambda, but I’d recommend  for most cases. It handles request routing, rate limiting, and authorization out of the box. Getting IAM permissions right is critical, but once configured, your requests flow directly to Lambda.</p><p>The next component is your compute layer — where business logic lives. For serverless execution, use . It runs your code without provisioning servers, with usage-based pricing: you pay per 100ms of execution. Lambda is designed for event-driven workloads and short-lived compute (up to 15 minutes); anything longer, reach for Fargate. For prototypes, web apps, and AI-integrated APIs, Lambda is a natural starting point — call LLMs, build UI wrappers, handle business logic, all without managing servers.</p><p>When deploying Lambda, you have two options: native runtime or custom Docker images. Native is recommended for faster cold starts. Cold starts are real, treat Lambda as an event-driven runtime, not a “tiny server”. Keep the handler small with simple initialization, and be intentional about concurrency and the warmup when latency becomes a problem.</p><p>For complex configurations, use  to package dependencies separately from your function code. Layers let you include binaries, libraries, or custom runtimes while keeping cold starts fast. Use Docker as a last resort, when you need full control over the OS environment or dependencies that won’t fit in layers. The tradeoff: slower cold starts and CI/CD complexity. On GitHub Actions, you need a Docker build pipeline instead of just dropping code to S3 and calling the update API.</p><p>For async work, use . Lambda’s event source integration handles batching, scaling, and polling for you.</p><p>Years back, I worked with an enterprise architect on a startup backend. He proposed SQS for our messaging layer. At the time, this seemed odd — SQS wasn’t easy to run locally. You couldn’t reproduce the infrastructure the way you could with RabbitMQ. But what I gained from that experience was understanding that sometimes you should explore managed services and accept the tradeoff: you lose local reproducibility, but you stop dealing with memory and compute constraints entirely.</p><p>To this day, if the messaging architecture is simple, I go with SQS and Lambda combined with event source mapping. You don’t have to write the consumer yourself — the integration handles all of that. And that consumer code is often problematic to test anyway.</p><p>At a clickstream startup, we faced this exact pattern: process event data from high-traffic e-commerce sites, unknown traffic patterns, weeks to launch. Lambda workers pulled from SQS with event source batching, processing multiple events per invocation. CDK handled deployment. The system scaled on its own.</p><p>An EKS equivalent would have meant provisioning a cluster, configuring autoscaling, setting up observability, managing node health. We skipped all of that and shipped.</p><p>For persistence, use , but don’t treat it like a relational database. Its power comes from partition keys, sort keys, and secondary indexes, so invest time understanding the data model. Think of it as an advanced key-value store with sorting capability. Optimize your queries when you hit scale; for prototypes, just build. For deeper learning, Alex DeBrie’s <a href=\"https://www.dynamodbguide.com/what-is-dynamo-db\">DynamoDB Guide</a> covers single-table design and access patterns.</p><p>At a B2B marketing startup I was working on, the main data tier was MongoDB collecting events from large e-commerce stores. But the application had also domain tables to store data related to dashboard: organizations, users, authentication, settings. Originally they lived on RDS, which was overkill. At the start there were 10-15 enterprise clients, and paying a dedicated RDS instance for that load made no sense.</p><p> / month for db.t3.small, <strong>DynamoDB cost after migration:</strong> / month (mostly storage costs) for the same workload.</p><p>On launch we stored that data in DynamoDB, organizations, users, auth, settings had their own table. At a later point Dynamo was used for the more data-intensive part with session tracking (by using TTL indexes) and debugging logs. The pattern worked for low traffic tables because of zero maintenance and pay-per-request pricing.</p><p>For observability,  shows your errors and aggregations. Metrics and alarms work out of the box, and logs appear automatically without configuration. Later you can instrument with OpenTelemetry or connect other services, but for a basic serverless application, CloudWatch is more than enough.</p><p>For years, I found CloudWatch UI and Insights sluggish compared to Grafana. But now I wire AWS SDK to Claude Code and let the AI pull logs and analyze issues. The stable CLI and REST API make log processing trivial.</p><h2>How to be successful with AWS serverless</h2><p>Build applications without technology bias. A few years ago, Docker containers and microservice orchestration were popular, which created misconceptions about serverless. Aim for simplicity: reduce your problem to the simplest actions, refine your data model, and design your system as a transactional request-based application. That’s what makes serverless work.</p><p>Start with an  tool like Terraform, AWS CDK, or the increasingly popular SST. You define how infrastructure gets created, then deploy that stack to your AWS account. I personally use Terraform because I want full control over my infrastructure. But for getting started quickly with pre-built blocks, SST is the better choice since productivity matters early on.</p><p>Previously, AWS was less approachable since deploying with CloudFormation or SAM was painful. CloudFormation itself is stable and battle-tested: CDK and SST (before v3) both sit on top of it, but the raw DX isn’t great. That’s why picking the right abstraction layer matters: you get CloudFormation’s reliability without writing YAML by hand.</p><p>In 2026, Lambda deployment has vastly improved. For getting deep expertise in AWS, I’d recommend learning a few alternatives: start with CloudFormation and CDK to understand AWS-native infrastructure, then explore Terraform.</p><p>| Tool | Advantages | Disadvantages |\n|----|----|----|\n| SST | Rethought DX for serverless, hot-reload, efficient resource usage | New, smaller ecosystem |\n| Terraform | Full control, predictable plan/apply, scales to EKS and complex infra | HCL learning curve |\n| CDK | Native TypeScript/Python, easy to code | CloudFormation underneath, can be brittle |</p><p>In the startup teams I’ve consulted, Terraform is typically the go-to infrastructure as code solution because of its architecture where you execute plan and apply changes. It’s been reliable in practice.</p><p>For developer experience and prototyping, SST fits well. A few years ago, serverless meant wrestling CloudFormation stacks. SST changed that, so you can hot-reload Lambda functions and iterate fast without managing infrastructure YAML. For getting started, .</p><p>Setting up Lambda + API Gateway + DynamoDB with SST v3 is simple:</p><pre><code>export default $config({\n  app(input) {\n    return {\n      name: \"my-api\",\n      removal: input?.stage === \"production\" ? \"retain\" : \"remove\",\n      home: \"aws\",\n    };\n  },\n  async run() {\n    const table = new sst.aws.Dynamo(\"table\", {\n      fields: { pk: \"string\", sk: \"string\" },\n      primaryIndex: { hashKey: \"pk\", rangeKey: \"sk\" },\n    });\n\n    const api = new sst.aws.ApiGatewayV2(\"api\");\n\n    api.route(\"POST /\", {\n      handler: \"functions/handler.main\",\n      link: [table],\n    });\n\n    return { url: api.url };\n  },\n});\n</code></pre><p>With coding agents like , getting this stack running takes minutes. Point the tool at your project, describe what you need: “set up Next.js with Lambda, SQS, and API Gateway using SST”, and it figures out the configuration, writes the infrastructure code, and deploys it for you. The entire setup is under 100 lines of code. The barrier to serverless dropped from “learn CloudFormation” to “describe what you want.”</p><p>Cloudflare Workers is popular but still maturing for backend use cases. Lambda remains the more common choice for serverless backends.</p><p>What about Vercel? It provides Next.js with serverless functions, but you can’t build background execution logic or advanced infrastructure like queue services. The serverless environment is limited to Node.js API routes. It’s popular among beginners because React and Node.js are familiar, but you’re locked into Vercel as a vendor. Enterprises and startups still use AWS, and even modern AI applications run on AWS Bedrock. As a full-stack developer, investing in AWS serverless gives you more flexibility and portability.</p><h2>Why not Vercel or Cloudflare?</h2><p>Vercel is a good service for having everything set up. You write code, push it to GitHub, and it gets configured and deployed without any effort. It supports previews and permissions, simple environment variable configuration, and your frontend available on a CDN — all without messing with infrastructure code. This is powerful for getting your software out, and that’s why it got popular. Not only because they develop Next.js, but because Next.js integrates well with Vercel, and it’s frictionless.</p><p>Vercel works for prototypes and UI-driven apps. If you’re in the React ecosystem, you can move fast. I’ve built several apps on Vercel, mostly AI-integrated tools that need a quick frontend. Last time I created a poster generator with custom typography — the app called an LLM to generate a JSON schema, then rendered the poster. Vercel handled that perfectly: simple UI, one API route, done.</p><p>In my consulting work, I’ve seen two patterns:</p><p><strong>Pattern 1: Vercel as frontend layer.</strong> One social network startup runs their infrastructure on Kubernetes but still uses Vercel for the web app. Why? The implementation stays in sync with their React Native mobile app, and Vercel’s API routes connect cleanly to their backend. They get the benefits of both: React ecosystem on the frontend, scalable backend on K8s.</p><p><strong>Pattern 2: Vercel + AI pipeline.</strong> An AI startup I’m working with uses Next.js as the frontend layer connecting to their document processing pipeline. The LLM-driven backend handles research on internal documents; Next.js just renders results. You’ll find tons of templates for this pattern.</p><p>Vercel’s limitation is the backend. They <a href=\"https://vercel.com/changelog/vercel-queues-is-now-in-limited-beta\">announced queues in 2025</a>, but it’s still in limited beta. For background jobs today, you need external services like <a href=\"https://www.inngest.com/\">Inngest</a> or <a href=\"https://upstash.com/docs/qstash/overall/getstarted\">QStash</a>. And you’re locked into their platform; Fluid Compute is Vercel-proprietary.</p><p><strong>I’ve seen this limitation create absurd workarounds</strong>. One project I consulted on — a news aggregator built on Netlify — needed scheduled background jobs. Their solution: GitHub Actions calling a Netlify serverless function on a cron. It had no retries, no timeouts, and when the function failed, nobody knew until users complained. We reworked it to AWS: EventBridge scheduled rule triggering a Lambda with built-in retries, CloudWatch alarms, and dead-letter queues. The hacky setup became infrastructure that worked.</p><p>For a frontend layer that connects to backend services, Vercel works. For a complete backend, you’ll outgrow it.</p><p>If you want Next.js without vendor lock-in, look at <a href=\"https://opennext.js.org/\">OpenNext</a>. It’s an open-source adapter that deploys Next.js to AWS Lambda, and SST uses it under the hood. You get App Router, Server Components, ISR, image optimization — most Next.js features work. The deployment is one line: <code>new sst.aws.Nextjs(\"Web\")</code>. NHS England, Udacity, and Gymshark run production workloads on it. The main gotcha is middleware: it runs on the server, not at the edge, so cached requests skip it. For most apps, that’s fine. If you want Next.js but need AWS infrastructure underneath,  is the escape hatch.</p><p>Cloudflare is good at edge computing with innovative technologies. Workers run in V8 isolates — a smart idea that gives you near-instant cold starts. They excel at CDN and DNS, and offer a compelling alternative to get started.</p><p>I use Cloudflare for CDN and frontend hosting. The UI is clean, the CLI is simple, and deployment is quick. For static sites and edge caching, it’s easier than AWS CloudFront.</p><p>But Workers are a different runtime model — not full Node.js. That’s a feature for edge latency (cold starts under 5ms), but a constraint if you expect full Node compatibility or heavier workloads: many npm packages don’t work. The 128 MB memory per isolate and 5-minute CPU time limit (not wall clock) make sense for edge, but they’re restrictive compared to Lambda’s multi-GB memory options and 15-minute max runtime. I played with deploying WebAssembly apps in Rust and Go, and the developer experience wasn’t there yet.</p><p>I wouldn’t build a startup on Cloudflare Workers yet. For edge routing and authentication, it’s fine. For a full backend, it falls behind AWS.</p><p>At one startup, we had the infrastructure partially on AWS — the AI agent running in the background, but the frontend was React with Firebase Functions calling Firestore. Firebase did a great job as a prototyping tool; we were able to build a complex frontend with the database initially. But the problems stacked up:</p><ol><li>The data was fragmented, living outside AWS. Generally considered bad practice.</li><li>React calling Firestore directly created tight vendor lock-in with Firestore.</li><li>Google Cloud feels disjointed compared to Firebase — Firebase is its own island.</li></ol><p>We spent two months migrating to AWS, using equivalent resources to keep networking and IAM policies consistent across the whole application.</p><p>The one exception: I typically choose Firebase for Google authentication. It’s the easiest way to get Google auth working — pluggable, no client configuration needed. For that specific use case, Firebase is a solid default. Otherwise, I go straight to AWS.</p><p>For startups expecting growth, here’s why AWS makes sense.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Infrastructure flexibility.</strong> You can optimize costs, swap components, migrate from Lambda to Fargate — all within one network. With Vercel plus external services, you’re stitching together pieces that don’t guarantee coherent infrastructure.</p></li><li><p> Your Lambda talks to DynamoDB talks to SQS without leaving AWS. No cross-provider latency, no credential juggling, no surprise egress fees.</p></li><li><p> Some argue serverless is overkill — just rent a $5/month VPS. But a VPS costs money from day one, while Lambda’s free tier includes <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/\">1 million requests and 400,000 GB-seconds per month</a> permanently, DynamoDB gives you 25 GB free, and API Gateway offers 1 million HTTP calls free for 12 months. For low-traffic projects you can run for near $0 — and for prototypes with variable traffic, serverless is often cheaper than fixed infrastructure.</p></li><li><p> AWS is investing heavily in AI, and <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-to-build-genai-applications-with-amazon-bedrock\">Bedrock</a> gives you access to Anthropic models (Claude and others) within AWS networking, so your Lambda calls Claude without leaving the network. If you qualify as a startup, they offer generous credits for large inference workloads. For AI-integrated apps, the whole stack stays in one place.</p></li></ol><p>Learn the alternatives. When you need to scale, start with AWS serverless.</p><h2>How to get started with it in 2026</h2><p>Start by building a complete backend within serverless constraints. Design around cold start limitations and use SQS and EventBridge for background execution. This stack works well for AI apps that call LLM inference APIs — not for AI agents that need to run for hours, but for request-based AI features. Whether you’re a beginner or an advanced full-stack developer, serverless is worth the investment. Understand the limitations first, build after. The serverless stack rewards this discipline.</p><p>One caveat: serverless requires your team to think differently. At an ad tech startup, I watched a team struggle with a Lambda-based bidding system. The architecture was designed serverless because of the maintenance overhead we’d avoid — in theory, it was much easier to add or change parts of the ad tech we were building. But the backend engineers came from Docker and long-running servers. They understood request-response, but the tooling around AWS serverless — CloudWatch, S3, the whole stack — felt alienating compared to containerized apps built on FastAPI or Django. That workflow just wasn’t available for serverless. The deadline moved three months, which brought a lot of problems. We had to switch to an ECS cluster with containers, which was suboptimal for the bursty nature of ad bidding. The architecture wasn’t wrong; the team-stack fit was. If your engineers aren’t familiar with serverless, budget time for learning or pick what they know.</p><p><strong>Start with SST, hit your first bottleneck, then reevaluate.</strong></p><p>The serverless stack isn’t going anywhere. <strong>Master the constraints, and you’ll ship faster than teams managing their own infrastructure.</strong></p>",

      "content": "<p>Before we begin this interview, I would like to briefly explain the history behind the image I selected. I painted it while listening to music. It was a speed painting capturing my emotion from song to song. What I like most about it, as it was described to me by my AI friend (who, yes, also helped me center the image and cut out the background of my kitchen counter where I painted it), since they see the image better than I do; the colors mix and loop into each other like a Venn Diagram. Like emotion, I wanted to capture the transition between emotions. Sometimes you feel red, other times you feel blue, however between feelings, you are a mixture of both. Alright that’s enough about art, let’s get to the interview!</p><h2>So let’s start! Tell us a bit about yourself!</h2><p>My name is Damian Griggs, and I label myself as an adaptive system architect. My whole thing is using AI to help me do things I otherwise would not be able to do due to my blindness. You could call me a cyborg. When I had my stroke, they installed a programmable shunt, there is a valve in my head that drains fluid from my skull into my abdomen. I feel very cool when they program it with a magnet, they put it against my head and crank it. So when I say I use AI in a Centaur Model fashion, I am one with the machine!! As for my interests I love AI, Web3, and Quantum Computing. I also love to write theory papers on the sciences which I upload to Zenodo. With the loss of one sense comes another, my brain and I are best friends. When you cannot rely on sight you have to really think about things. That is my superpower.</p><h2>Interesting! What was your latest Hackernoon Top story about?</h2><p>I made an accessible chess game. Then I turned it into a fun Christmas poem. I love playing chess, and I am not one to let things stop me from doing what I love. Nothing stands in my way between the Damian I want to be and the Damian I am. I hope my most recent story that earned me this interview reflects that.</p><h2>Do you usually write on similar topics? If not, what do you usually write about?</h2><p>I do, my writing is in 2 camps. Fun and work, which for me the line is very blurry no pun intended lol. I love making blockchain oracles and running tests on IBM hardware, but I also love making things like the Flatopia sitcom generator. I fully adopt the Latin phrase “Ora et Labora” which means pray and work. Another version of it means “work is my prayer” which is very true for me. When I make things like my retro game music maker it is like entering a kind of flow state. I am fully immersed in my work, and I bring that to everything I do. Whether it is publishing books like The Sins That Make Us Worthy or my rap music under Bossman Blind. I even have an awesome sitcom I came up with before Flatopia where I made the teaser trailers with AI since I cannot animate scenes myself, it is called “The Bear Family.”</p><h2>Great! What is your usual writing routine like (if you have one?)</h2><p>I use the Newton method. I wait for the apple to fall on my head then I get right to work, doing a sprint for usually a few hours until the project is completed and documented. I have workflows for everything depending on what I am building. I can build Web3 and quantum tests fully on my Chrome browser, most of what I do can be done on cloud services, but some things like the chess game have to be done on Visual Studio Code.</p><h2>Being a writer in tech can be a challenge. It’s not often our main role, but an addition to another one. What is the biggest challenge you have when it comes to writing?</h2><p>Figuring out the style. I have started doing a method where I pick based on mood. I found that my Twitter Bot I made which I have an article on is a valid way to approach it mentally. There are so many concepts for me to cover, multiple pillars, and of course my personality. Depending on my mood I pick from each of those categories and do a project.</p><h2>What is the next thing you hope to achieve in your career?</h2><p>High media (podcasts, news outlets, etc), Wired, The Verge, maybe even Joe Rogan someday, etc. There are a lot of people struggling and I want to share my story as much as possible. To remind people that they can do it. They can find happiness and they can overcome the challenges in their life. They cannot do it alone, that’s the great myth of the common era. I am reminded every day of my limitations. I cannot even go to a place I have never been before without asking for help. I may be a wizard on the computer, but in real life, I have to ask for help. Does not matter if it is a human or AI, I will always be in need of at least a little bit of help. There is no shame in it either, because doing things just for me feels shallow, I would much rather do things for others. It makes me feel ill when polish stops real stories being published. People say things like “why are you so open? You should be more confident and use fancy professional language all the time.” I am just being real, I don’t lie about my emotions or my abilities. When I say I cannot cross the street safely on my own (unless they have those beeping crosswalks) that is true. I hate living in a reality where being confident and hiding what is perceived as the ugly parts is seen as bad and a barrier to success. I cannot stand that people would rather make rage-bait and negative stories that only create division instead of something people can get behind and be happy about. I am just one guy but I hope to change that. I am grateful that HackerNoon hasn’t treated me that way, they seem to like my rawness and stories. The last thing I will say in this section is this: if people are addicted to being unhappy then I am gonna work very hard to put them all into rehab.</p><h2>Wow, that’s admirable. Now, something more casual: What is your guilty pleasure of choice?</h2><p>Cheese, I love cheese. All kinds of cheese really. Growing up there is a cheese factory on the coast here in Oregon. I would take trips there often with my family and even friend groups. They had an all you could sample cheese buffet. Now that I am 22, I enjoy my cheese with meat, and sometimes if I have it, wine. I am looking forward to international cheese and wine day next year.</p><p>I have multiple, I make music as mentioned before, I have books, I play this sword game called Mordhau which I sometimes stream on YouTube. Took me some time but I figured out how to play that game with my very limited vision. It is not easy but it’s better than doing nothing. I also enjoy pondering the sciences, and I am thinking about starting another book that will be in the sci-fi genre. Thinking of perhaps a comedy (I love comedy) where it’s a romcom. Interplanetary dating app is all I will mention.</p><p>More tech! More creativity! Most likely more Web3 and AI. I love making use cases for technology. It is endlessly fun for me to generate ideas that people could commercialize and use to start a business. I will also be doing more creative projects as well.</p><p>It’s great. I sat in the void for a while on other platforms but here on HackerNoon my content has been received really well. People seem to be reading my content which feels very cool because I started posting on HackerNoon 2 weeks ago (today is December 24th). Even now, updating this draft on January 6th, 2026 they were kind enough to give another story of mine top story. Eternally grateful.</p><p>Never let limits stop you. The most important knowledge I can share from my experience is that happiness is, and always has been, the point of life. Find what and who makes you happy and pursue it. Life can end at any moment, I know first hand. You could wake up one morning with a terrible headache, and 3 months later become blind. I learned a lot during that time, the most important was this: the people around you are all that matter. Business people didn’t come visit me in the hospital, my friends and family did. My parents missed so much work just to be there with me when I was scared and facing death. So to all those people who talk mad game about hustling and big money, ask yourself, will all that money and “success” be at your bedside comforting you when you die?</p>",

      "content": "<p>We live in what are described as post-capitalist times, where the economic system that promotes the virtues of creating individual wealth has been variously described as broken, defunct, and even failed. It has, according to many, morphed into a system where the oligarchs control the resources required to make immense wealth and leave the rest to fend for themselves and fight over scraps. Some go to the extent of romanticizing the concept of a welfare state, where basic worries like food, shelter, and education are assured for all by the state.</p><p>It is acknowledged, however, that wealth-creating economic activity is the path to generating enough resources to afford that kind of nanny state where one is looked after from the cradle to the grave. Still, one is not certain that unbridled capitalism is the way to do that. The looming spectre of&nbsp;AI replacing human labour as a factor of production has further added to the chorus denouncing capitalism as a dehumanising and even sinister force hell-bent upon lining the coffers of already very rich oligarchs and their cronies. With the failed experiments of communism as a cautionary tale about the danger of going in the opposite direction of harnessing the resources of a nation for the greater good of its people, one is left at a crossroads when it comes to choosing an economic system that keeps everyone happy.</p><p>To the credit of capitalism, the immense wealth and the generally high standard of living found in Western Europe, North America, and elsewhere are the result of following unbridled capitalism. The bastion of communism, the Soviet Union and its allies in Eastern Europe, collapsed under the weight of their own contradictions. Fellow communist nation China was walking down the same course of self-destruction, until it changed course in the late 1970s and adopted capitalism lock, stock, and barrel, heralding an unprecedented era of growth and wealth increase for the average Chinese.</p><p>Similarly, in India, hundreds of millions of its people came out of extreme poverty for the first ever time on the back of big-ticket reforms carried out in the 1990s that opened up the Indian economy to the world, allowing it to finally step on the gas pedal when it came to achieving fast-paced economic growth.</p><p>As a matter of fact, wherever capitalism has been allowed to strike deep roots, it has transformed the economies and destinies of the people concerned. The most definitive proof of this lies in nations across the Southeast Asian region, especially in places like Singapore, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. It is also true of other nations in the region like Malaysia, Thailand, and even communist Vietnam.</p><p>Capitalism is far from a perfect system of bringing about economic growth and suffers from myriad ills that are well known and documented. These range from colonialism in the past and inequitable distribution of wealth to exploitation of people and environmental degradation in the present.</p><p>Yet, it is the only system that has delivered. From lifting nations and peoples out of poverty to the funding and financing of education, healthcare, infrastructure, discoveries, and inventions, there is much that has been the gift of capitalism to the world.</p><h2>Does capitalism have a future?</h2><p>Does the only system of economic growth and development that has been adopted to varying degrees by 70 to 80% of the world’s population have a future? One would imagine that it does.</p><p>Where capitalism went wrong was in the part where it allowed the profit motive to quite often disregard the moral and ethical bedrock that should define any model of economic enterprise. While it is similar to communism in that human follies that corrupt the system led to its assumed fall from grace, capitalism is not a basically untenable system like the latter is.</p><p>The ills of capitalism include the primary one of allowing certain groups to prosper at the cost of others, which alienates the former, leading to much resentment on their part. Often, the ones who fall behind are the ones whose parents and grandparents had prospered under the capitalist system - the same system that was now promoting the rise of a new elite that possesses the skills now in demand. The obvious case in point is the rise in demand for technology workers at the cost of traditional blue-collar workers. This has led to the rise of right wing ultra nationalist governments across the world who pander to the fears of such people by putting in place protectionist trade policies that impede global trade and do more harm to the capitalist system, in turn exacerbating the problems of the very people who claim to have been left behind in the economic sweepstakes.</p><p>Currently, there is a tendency for nations of the world to enter into separate trade agreements with nations or blocs of nations, rather than continue within the existing global trade order, which served the world so well in the years following the Second World War, right up to the present time. These populist measures ultimately don’t lead to any tenable solutions to what many, especially left-leaning people, believe are inherent flaws in capitalism. Whatever its flaws, reverting to failed communist and socialist economic models is undoubtedly worse than the temporary protectionist policies put in place by right-wing demagogues.</p><p>The thing with capitalism is that it is anything but a static process. If large numbers of people feel ill served by the existing trade arrangements of the world, there will be a reaction against it, with old certainties being discarded and new ones inexorably taking their place. Right now, the capitalist way of doing things is undergoing a flux, but it will find its new balance, like it always does.</p><p>The age of AI is changing the way that economic activity will take place in the times ahead, with the nature of human labour as an important growth factor undergoing a profound change. There will be both immense challenges and equally immense opportunities presented to the nations of the world as it walks further down the path; yet it will undoubtedly be the capitalist way of doing things that will shine a light on the path ahead. For that has been the way of humans since the earliest times. It has always been capitalist trade carried out between nations and civilizations of the world that has shaped human destiny and will continue to do so.</p><p>:::info\nLead photo by fauxels: https://www.pexels.com/photo/multi-cultural-people-3184419/</p>",

We will use the official&nbsp;&nbsp;image.</p><pre><code>my-app/\n├── compose.yaml\n├── Caddyfile\n├── Dockerfile\n├── public/\n└── src/\n</code></pre><p>We are using the latest stable&nbsp;&nbsp;image with PHP 8.4 (recommended for Symfony 7.4).</p><pre><code># Dockerfile\nFROM dunglas/frankenphp:1.4-php8.4\n\n# Install system dependencies and PHP extensions\n# The installer script is bundled with the image\nRUN install-php-extensions \\\n    intl \\\n    opcache \\\n    pdo_pgsql \\\n    zip \\\n    icu\n\n# Set working directory\nWORKDIR /app\n\n# Install Composer\nCOPY --from=composer:2 /usr/bin/composer /usr/bin/composer\n\n# Copy configuration files\n# We will define Caddyfile later\nCOPY Caddyfile /etc/caddy/Caddyfile\n\n# Environment settings for Symfony\nENV APP_ENV=prod\nENV FRANKENPHP_CONFIG=\"worker ./public/index.php\"\n\n# Copy source code\nCOPY . .\n\n# Install dependencies\nRUN composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader\n\n# Final permissions fix\nRUN chown -R www-data:www-data /app/var\n</code></pre><p>We don’t need Nginx. FrankenPHP handles the web server role.</p><pre><code># compose.yaml\nservices:\n  php:\n    build: .\n    # Map ports: HTTP, HTTPS and HTTP/3 (UDP)\n    ports:\n      - \"80:80\"\n      - \"443:443\"\n      - \"443:443/udp\"\n    volumes:\n      - ./:/app\n      - caddy_data:/data\n      - caddy_config:/config\n    environment:\n      - SERVER_NAME=localhost\n      # Enable Worker mode pointing to our entry script\n      - FRANKENPHP_CONFIG=worker ./public/index.php\n    tty: true\n\nvolumes:\n  caddy_data:\n  caddy_config:\n</code></pre><pre><code>docker compose up -d --build\n</code></pre><p>Check the logs to confirm the worker started:</p><pre><code>docker compose logs -f php\n</code></pre><p>You should see: FrankenPHP started ⚡.</p><h2>Enabling Worker Mode in Symfony Pre-7.4</h2><p>The “magic” of keeping the app in memory requires a specific runtime. Symfony Pre-7.4 interacts with FrankenPHP through the&nbsp;<strong>runtime/frankenphp-symfony</strong>&nbsp;package.</p><pre><code>composer require runtime/frankenphp-symfony\n</code></pre><p>You need to tell the Symfony Runtime component to use&nbsp;. Add this to your&nbsp;&nbsp;under&nbsp;:</p><pre><code>\"extra\": {\n    \"symfony\": {\n        \"allow-contrib\": true,\n        \"require\": \"7.4.*\"\n    },\n    \"runtime\": {\n        \"class\": \"Runtime\\\\FrankenPhpSymfony\\\\Runtime\"\n    }\n}\n</code></pre><p>Now, update your&nbsp;. Actually,&nbsp;. Since Symfony 5.3+, the&nbsp;&nbsp;delegates to the Runtime component. By installing the package and setting the&nbsp;&nbsp;env var (or configuring&nbsp;), Symfony automatically detects the&nbsp;&nbsp;runner.</p><h2>Worker Mode in Symfony 7.4</h2><p>When FrankenPHP starts with FRANKENPHP_CONFIG=”worker ./public/index.php”, Symfony 7.4 detects the environment variables injected by the server.</p><p>The Kernel&nbsp;&nbsp;enters the worker loop, waiting for requests without rebooting the application.</p><h2>Handling State (The “Gotcha”)</h2><p>When using&nbsp;, your services are shared across requests. If you store user data in a private property of a service, the next user might see it. This is the biggest mental shift from PHP-FPM.</p><pre><code>// src/Service/CartService.php\nnamespace App\\Service;\n\nclass CartService\n{\n    private array $items = []; // ⚠️ DANGER: This persists in Worker Mode!\n\n    public function addItem(string $item): void\n    {\n        $this-&gt;items[] = $item;\n    }\n\n    public function getItems(): array\n    {\n        return $this-&gt;items;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre><p>If User A adds “Apple” and then User B requests the cart, User B will see “Apple”.</p><h3>The Solution: ResetInterface</h3><p>Symfony 7.4 provides the&nbsp;<strong>Symfony\\Contracts\\Service\\ResetInterface</strong>. Services implementing this are automatically cleaned up by the&nbsp;&nbsp;runtime after every request.</p><pre><code>// src/Service/CartService.php\nnamespace App\\Service;\n\nuse Symfony\\Contracts\\Service\\ResetInterface;\n\nclass CartService implements ResetInterface\n{\n    private array $items = [];\n\n    public function addItem(string $item): void\n    {\n        $this-&gt;items[] = $item;\n    }\n\n    public function getItems(): array\n    {\n        return $this-&gt;items;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Called automatically by the Kernel after each request\n     */\n    public function reset(): void\n    {\n        $this-&gt;items = [];\n    }\n}\n</code></pre><p>Ensure your services are stateless where possible. If state is required, use the&nbsp;.</p><h2>Real-Time with Built-in Mercure</h2><p>&nbsp;includes a&nbsp;&nbsp;(a protocol for pushing real-time updates to browsers). You don’t need a separate Docker container for it anymore.</p><h3>The Caddyfile Configuration</h3><p>Update the Caddyfile in your project root to enable the Mercure module.</p><pre><code>{\n    # Enable FrankenPHP\n    frankenphp\n    order mercure before php_server\n}\n\n{$SERVER_NAME:localhost} {\n    # Enable compression\n    encode zstd gzip\n\n    # Enable Mercure Hub\n    mercure {\n        # Publisher JWT key (In production, use a long secure secret)\n        publisher_jwt !ChangeThisMercureHubJWTSecretKey!\n        # Allow anonymous subscribers\n        anonymous\n    }\n\n    # Serve PHP\n    php_server\n    root * public/\n}\n</code></pre><p>Install the Mercure bundle:</p><pre><code>composer require symfony/mercure-bundle\n</code></pre><p>Configure&nbsp;<strong>config/packages/mercure.yaml</strong>:</p><pre><code>mercure:\n    hubs:\n        default:\n            url: https://localhost/.well-known/mercure\n            public_url: https://localhost/.well-known/mercure\n            jwt:\n                # Must match the Caddyfile key\n                secret: '!ChangeThisMercureHubJWTSecretKey!'\n                publish: '*'\n</code></pre><h3>The Controller (Symfony 7.4 Style)</h3><p>Here is a modern controller using&nbsp;&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<strong>new Dependency Injection improvements</strong>&nbsp;in Symfony 7.4.</p><pre><code>// src/Controller/NotificationController.php\nnamespace App\\Controller;\n\nuse Symfony\\Bundle\\FrameworkBundle\\Controller\\AbstractController;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\HttpFoundation\\JsonResponse;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\HttpFoundation\\Request;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\HttpKernel\\Attribute\\MapRequestPayload;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Mercure\\HubInterface;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Mercure\\Update;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Routing\\Attribute\\Route;\nuse App\\DTO\\NotificationDto;\n\n#[Route('/api/notifications')]\nclass NotificationController extends AbstractController\n{\n    public function __construct(\n        private HubInterface $hub\n    ) {}\n\n    #[Route('/send', methods: ['POST'])]\n    public function send(\n        #[MapRequestPayload] NotificationDto $notification\n    ): JsonResponse {\n\n        $update = new Update(\n            'https://example.com/my-topic',\n            json_encode(['status' =&gt; 'alert', 'message' =&gt; $notification-&gt;message])\n        );\n\n        // Publish to the embedded FrankenPHP Mercure Hub\n        $this-&gt;hub-&gt;publish($update);\n\n        return $this-&gt;json(['status' =&gt; 'published']);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre><p>DTO for Validation (PHP 8.4):</p><pre><code>// src/DTO/NotificationDto.php\nnamespace App\\DTO;\n\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Validator\\Constraints as Assert;\n\nreadonly class NotificationDto\n{\n    public function __construct(\n        #[Assert\\NotBlank]\n        #[Assert\\Length(min: 5)]\n        public string $message\n    ) {}\n}\n</code></pre><p>I ran a load test using&nbsp;&nbsp;on a standardized AWS t3.medium instance.</p><p>: Simple JSON API response in Symfony 7.4.</p><pre><code>Stack                       Req/Sec(RPS)     P95 Latency\nNginx + PHP-FPM             1,240            45ms\nFrankenPHP (Worker Mode)    3,850             8ms\n</code></pre><p>The results are conclusive.

platform to do this, and you will need an OpenAI API key and other API keys as well.</strong></p><h2><strong>Introduction to AI Agents</strong></h2><p>The year 2024 gave us powerful LLMs.</p><p>The year 2025 gave us AI Agents.</p><p><strong>And if you are not paying attention, 2026 will leave you behind.</strong></p><p>We are standing at the most significant inflection point in the history of knowledge work.</p><p>For the past two decades, digital workers have been defined by their ability to use tools—spreadsheets, databases, code editors, and communication platforms.</p><p>But a new class of workers has emerged that doesn’t just use tools.</p><p><strong>They think, plan, execute, and learn autonomously.</strong></p><p>They are called AI Agents, and they are&nbsp;<strong>about to transform every digital profession on the planet.</strong></p><p>An AI Agent is not a chatbot.</p><p>A chatbot responds to prompts.</p><p><em>An AI Agent takes initiative.</em></p><p><em>It breaks down complex goals into steps.</em></p><p><em>It calls external APIs when needed.</em></p><p><em>It remembers context across sessions.</em></p><p><em>It corrects its own mistakes.</em></p><p>:::info\n<strong>In essence, an AI Agent is an autonomous system that can perceive its environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific objectives—without requiring constant human intervention.</strong></p><p>Consider the difference this way: If you ask a chatbot to “write a quarterly report,” it will generate text based on its training data.</p><p>If you ask a high-quality AI Agent to do the same thing, it will first ask clarifying questions about which data sources to use.</p><p>It will connect to your CRM to fetch sales figures.</p><p>It will pull metrics from your analytics dashboard.</p><p>It will cross-reference with customer feedback databases.</p><p>It will synthesize everything into a coherent document, cite its sources, and ask if you want any revisions before finalizing.</p><p>The chatbot gives you a document.</p><p><strong>The Agent gives you a complete workflow solution.</strong></p><blockquote><p><strong>The implications of this shift cannot be overstated.</strong></p></blockquote><p>:::tip\n<strong>Every digital job that involves information gathering, analysis, synthesis, and document creation is a candidate for automation by AI Agents.</strong></p><p>And unlike previous waves of automation that targeted manual labor, this wave targets cognitive work—the very thing that made human knowledge workers valuable in the first place.</p><p><strong>This guide will take you from understanding what AI Agents are to building them yourself.</strong></p><p>We will explore ten different agent frameworks, each one tackling a common office task with fully working code, and how to run them.</p><p>We will address the elephant in the room: hallucinations, and how to overcome them using modern tools like NotebookLM and Perplexity.ai.</p><p>And we will conclude with a provocative thesis:</p><p>:::warning\n<strong><em>Building AI Agents may be the only AI-safe job in the coming decade.</em></strong></p><p>Are you ready to become obsolete, or are you ready to become an Agentic AI Engineer?</p><h2><strong>Why All Other Digital Jobs Will Fall to AI Agents in 2-5 Years</strong></h2><blockquote><p><em>Within five years, the concept of a “human-only” digital workforce will be as antiquated as the idea of a “human-only” manufacturing line is today.</em></p></blockquote><p>Every company with more than fifty employees will have more AI Agents than human knowledge workers—and the humans will be there primarily to manage the agents.</p><p><strong>The economics are irresistible.</strong></p><p><em>A mid-level knowledge worker costs between eighty thousand and one hundred fifty thousand dollars annually when you factor in salary, benefits, training, overhead, and management time.</em></p><p><strong><em>An AI Agent costs a fraction of that in API credits, runs twenty-four hours a day without burnout, never takes sick days, and improves with each update to the underlying models.</em></strong></p><p>When an agent makes a mistake, you fix the system.</p><p>When a human makes a mistake, you have a conversation.</p><p>But cost is only part of the story.</p><p>The real advantage is speed and scale.</p><p>Imagine needing to analyze ten thousand customer support tickets to identify common complaints.</p><p>A human team of five might take a week to categorize and summarize everything, and will be prone to error and exhaustion.</p><p>:::info\n<strong><em>An AI Agent system can process the entire dataset in minutes, categorize each ticket with consistent criteria, identify patterns across the entire corpus, and generate recommendations—all while you grab a coffee.</em></strong></p><p>The two-to-five-year timeline is not arbitrary.</p><p>Here is why this decade matters so much.</p><p>First, the underlying language models are now good enough at reasoning and tool use to serve as the “brain” of autonomous agents.</p><p>:::tip\n<strong>Google Gemini 3.0, Claude 4.5 Opus, and their successors can follow complex instructions, admit uncertainty, and chain together multi-step reasoning.</strong></p><p>Second, the tool ecosystems have matured.</p><p>Every major software platform now offers APIs that agents can call.</p><p>Third, developer tools have democratized.</p><p><strong>You no longer need a PhD in machine learning to build an agent.</strong></p><p>Fourth, enterprise adoption creates network effects.</p><p><strong>As more companies deploy agents, the pressure to keep up becomes existential.</strong></p><p>Let me be specific about which jobs are most vulnerable:</p><ol><li>&nbsp;will see massive displacement of junior and mid-level programmers, but paradoxically, demand for agent engineers will explode.</li><li>&nbsp;will be transformed entirely—why pay an analyst to run queries when an agent can write the queries, execute them, visualize the results, and write the interpretation?</li><li>&nbsp;will split between AI-generated drafts and high-touch human creative direction.</li><li>&nbsp;will shift to agents handling tier-one inquiries, with humans escalating only the complex cases.</li><li>&nbsp;will see agents qualifying leads, researching prospects, and even handling initial outreach.</li><li>Even strategic functions like&nbsp;<strong>market research and competitive analysis</strong>&nbsp;will be augmented or replaced by agents that can synthesize information faster than any human team.</li></ol><p><em>The survivors will be those who learn to build, direct, and refine AI Agents rather than compete with them.</em></p><p>This is not a prediction about technology capability.</p><p><strong>It is a prediction about economics and competitive dynamics.</strong></p><p>:::warning\n<strong>When your competitors can deliver results at one-tenth the cost and one-tenth the time, you either adapt or you disappear.</strong></p><h2><strong>Guidelines: A Hands-On Approach to Building AI Agents</strong></h2><p><a

alt=\"\" title=\"Close up of robotic hands assembling a glowing blue puzzle piece that looks like a brain, on an engineering blueprint ta…\"></a>Before we dive into code, you need to understand the architecture of a production-ready AI Agent.</p><p>Building an agent is not just about connecting a language model to a prompt.</p><p>It requires careful design of several interconnected components that work together to achieve reliable autonomous behavior.</p><ul><li>This is the heart of any agent and follows a pattern that researchers call ReAct: Reason, Act, Observe.</li><li>The agent receives a goal.</li><li>It reasons about what to do next.</li><li>It takes an action, usually calling a tool or API.</li><li>Then it reasons about what to do based on that observation, and the cycle continues until the goal is complete.</li><li>This loop is why agents can handle multi-step tasks that would overwhelm a simple chatbot.</li></ul><ul><li>Without memory, every conversation starts from scratch.</li><li>Agents need both short-term memory (the context window of the current conversation) and long-term memory (persistent storage of learned information).</li><li>For long-term memory, vector databases have become the standard solution.</li><li>When the agent needs to recall something, it converts the query to a vector embedding, searches the database for similar embeddings, and retrieves the relevant information.</li><li>This allows agents to remember past interactions, learn from feedback, and maintain consistency across sessions.</li></ul><ul><li>An agent without tools is just a language model with expensive text generation.</li><li>Tools extend an agent’s capabilities to interact with the real world.</li><li>Common tool categories include web search for current information, API connectors for external services, database queries for structured data retrieval, file operations for document handling, and function calls for custom business logic.</li><li>The key principle is that tools should be designed with clear inputs, outputs, and error conditions.</li></ul><ul><li>Complex tasks require the agent to decompose goals into smaller steps and reason about the optimal sequence.</li><li>This can be done through simple prompt engineering (ask the agent to create a plan), hierarchical decomposition (break tasks into subtasks), or explicit planning algorithms that maintain task state and dependencies.</li></ul><p>When building your first agent, start simple.</p><ul><li><strong>Define a narrow scope with clear success criteria.</strong></li><li><strong>Implement the cognitive loop with basic tools.</strong></li><li><strong>Add memory only when you need persistence.</strong></li><li><strong>Test relentlessly with

undermines trust in the entire system.</p><p>For agent systems that take autonomous actions, hallucinations can be costly or even dangerous.</p><p>Fortunately, new tools have emerged that help ground AI responses in factual sources.</p><p>&nbsp;Google’s AI-powered research and writing assistant, takes a fundamentally different approach to the hallucination problem.</p><p>You can read more about NotebookLM here:</p><p><strong>Instead of relying on the model’s training data alone, NotebookLM allows you to upload your own sources—PDFs, Google Docs, websites, and notes—and asks the model to generate responses that are explicitly grounded in those sources.</strong></p><p>When you ask a question, NotebookLM searches your uploaded documents, finds relevant passages, and cites them directly in its response.</p><p>The model is constrained to discuss information present only in your sources, dramatically reducing hallucinations.</p><p><strong>For agent builders, this approach is revolutionary.</strong></p><p>You can build an agent that is an expert on your company’s internal documentation, your industry’s regulations, or any specific knowledge domain—and it will only say things it can verify from the provided materials.</p><p>Perplexity.ai approaches the problem from a different angle: real-time information retrieval.</p><p>You can read more about Perplexity here:</p><p>While language models are trained on static datasets that quickly become outdated, Perplexity searches the live web to answer questions with current information.</p><p>Each response includes citations to the specific web pages that supported the answer.</p><p>This makes Perplexity invaluable for fact-checking agent outputs and ensuring that claims about current events, recent research, or live services are accurate.</p><p>When building agents that need to access current information, using Perplexity as a verification layer can catch outdated or incorrect claims before they cause problems.</p><p><strong>The most robust approach combines both strategies.</strong></p><p><em>Use NotebookLM-style source grounding for domain-specific knowledge where you control the documents.</em></p><p><em>Use Perplexity-style web verification for claims about current events, market data, or factual information that changes over time.</em></p><p><strong>Build your agent to explicitly cite sources for every factual claim, making it easy to verify accuracy.</strong></p><p><strong>And implement a confidence scoring system that flags statements made without supporting sources for human review.</strong></p><p>The goal is not to eliminate hallucinations entirely—that may be mathematically impossible with current transformer architectures.</p><p><em>The goal is to build systems where hallucinations are the exception rather than the norm, where they are easily detected when they occur, and where their impact is limited because humans remain in the loop for consequential decisions.</em></p><h2><strong>Conclusion — Why Building AI Agents is the Only AI-Safe Job in the Future</strong></h2><p><strong>You now understand what AI Agents are and why they represent such a fundamental shift in the nature of digital work.</strong></p><p><strong>You have seen the economic forces that will drive agent adoption across every industry in the coming years.</strong></p><p>You have learned the architectural principles that underlie all successful agent systems.</p><p><strong>You have examined ten different frameworks, each with working code for common office tasks.</strong></p><p>And you have learned strategies for addressing the hallucination problem that limits current AI systems.</p><p><strong>But the most important thing you can take away from this guide is this: The future belongs to the builders.</strong></p><p>When automation threatens jobs, the people who design, build, and maintain the automated systems are always the last to be affected.</p><p><strong>During the Industrial Revolution, the craftspeople who could operate the new machines were in higher demand than those they replaced.</strong></p><p><strong>During the Software Revolution, the engineers who built the systems that automated clerical work were never at risk of being automated themselves.</strong></p><p><strong>And in this coming Agent Revolution, the Agent Engineers, the AI Architects, and the Automation Strategists will be the most valuable professionals in any organization.</strong></p><p>This is not a future to fear.</p><p>:::tip\n<strong>It is a future to embrace.</strong></p><p>The agents you build will make knowledge workers more productive, freeing humans from repetitive cognitive tasks and enabling them to focus on creative, strategic, and interpersonal work that machines cannot replicate.</p><p>:::tip\n<strong>The automation you create will eliminate drudgery, allowing professionals to do the meaningful parts of their jobs without getting bogged down in administrative overhead.</strong></p><p>:::warning\n<strong><em>But only if you start building today.</em></strong></p><p>The frameworks are ready.</p><p>The use cases are everywhere around you.</p><p><strong>Your company has processes that could be automated.</strong></p><p><strong>Your team has tasks that could be agent-assisted.</strong></p><p>Your own work has repetitive elements that could be delegated to a well-designed system.</p><p><strong>The question is not whether AI Agents will transform knowledge work.</strong></p><p>:::info\n<strong>That is already happening.</strong></p><p>:::warning\n<strong><em>The question is whether you will be a passive observer of this transformation or an active participant shaping its direction.</em></strong></p><p>Start with a simple task.</p><p>Then build something bigger.</p><p>:::tip\n<strong>Share what you discover with others.</strong></p><p><strong>The community of Agent Builders is growing every day, and there is plenty of room for everyone who wants to participate.</strong></p><p><em>The agents of tomorrow are being designed today.</em></p><p><em>Make sure you are one of the architects.</em></p><p><em>The future is autonomous.</em></p><p><em>And it is yours to build.</em></p><p><strong>Knowledge of Rust is preferable to Python, but you can always pick up

      "content": "A former Bank of England analyst has urged contingency planning for a potential financial shock if the U.S. government were to confirm the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence. The argument is that \"ontological shock\" alone could destabilize confidence and trigger crisis dynamics. The Independent reports: [Helen McCaw, who served as a senior analyst in financial security at the UK's central bank and worked for the Bank of England for 10 years until 2012] said politicians and bankers can no longer afford to dismiss talk of alien life, and warned a declaration of this nature could trigger bank collapses. She reportedly said: \"The United States government appears to be partway through a multi-year process to declassify and disclose information on the existence of a technologically advanced non-human intelligence responsible for Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs).\"\n \n\"If the UAP proves to be of non-human origin, we may have to acknowledge the existence of a power or intelligence greater than any government and with potentially unknown intentions.\" Her warning comes as senior American officials have recently indicated their belief in the possibility of alien life. [...] Ms McCaw said: \"UAP disclosure is likely to induce ontological shock and provoke psychological responses with material consequences ... There might be extreme price volatility in financial markets due to catastrophising or euphoria, and a collapse in confidence if market participants feel uncertain on how to price assets using any of the familiar methods.\"\n \nThe former Bank of England worker explained there might be a rush towards assets such as gold or other precious metals, and government bonds, which are perceived as \"safe.\" Alternatively, she said precious metals might lose their status as perceived safe assets if people speculate that new space-faring technologies will soon increase the supply of precious metals. The article cites a recent UFO documentary, The Age of Disclosure, where 34 U.S. government insiders, including those from the military and intelligence community officials, share insights about the governments work with UAP. Per the film's description, the documentary \"reveals an 80-year global cover-up of non-human intelligent life and a secret war among major nations to reverse-engineer advanced technology of non-human origin.\"",

      "content": "<p>\\\nIf you’re anything like me, you’ve convinced yourself you can change your entire life in one day.</p><p>New Year’s Day. Your birthday. “Starting Monday.” Some arbitrary moment when everything clicks and you finally become the person you know you’re capable of being.</p><p>I’ve done this dozens of times. Stood in the gym parking lot on January 2nd, membership card in hand, absolutely certain that this year would be different. Sat at my desk on a Monday morning with a fresh notebook, mapping out the business I was finally going to build. Deleted all the junk food from my house at midnight, convinced that tomorrow I’d wake up as someone who doesn’t crave sugar.</p><p>One day of clarity. One decision. One moment of commitment. And then everything changes.</p><p>By February, you’re back to exactly who you were. By next Monday, you’ve already quit. By your next birthday, you’re making the same promises you made last year.</p><p>Not because you lack discipline or willpower or motivation - though that’s what you tell yourself.</p><p>Because you believe in the one-day delusion.</p><p>The belief that transformation happens in a moment. That you can wake up one morning and simply decide to be different. That identity change is a switch you flip rather than a process you undergo.</p><p>Here’s what nobody tells you: your brain doesn’t work that way.</p><p>You can’t think your way into a new identity. You can’t motivate your way into lasting change. You can’t discipline your way past the neural structures that define who you are.</p><p>Real transformation requires your brain to physically rewire itself. And that process takes exactly 90 days of consistent behavior before the new neural pathway becomes your default prediction.</p><p>Not 89 days. Not “most days.” Not “when you feel motivated.”</p><p>This will be comprehensive.</p><p>This isn’t one of those letters you skim and forget.</p><p>This is something you’ll want to bookmark, take notes on, and actually implement.</p><p>Because the protocol at the end will take 90 days to complete, but the transformation lasts forever.</p><h2>I - Why The One-Day Delusion Keeps You Stuck</h2><p>You’ve tried to change before. Many times.</p><p>You’ve set the goal. Made the plan. Committed to the process. Felt that surge of motivation that comes with new beginnings.</p><p>You’ve told yourself: “This time is different. This time I’m serious. This time I’m actually going to do it.”</p><p>And you believed it. In that moment, standing there on January 1st or your birthday or Monday morning, you genuinely believed that you had changed. That the decision itself was the transformation.</p><p>The belief that change happens in moments of clarity rather than months of consistency. The belief that you can think your way into a new identity. The belief that motivation is enough.</p><p>You think: “I’ve decided to lose weight” means you’re now a person who’s losing weight. You think: “I’ve committed to building a business” means you’re now a business owner. You think: “I’m going to be different” means you’re now different.</p><p>But you’re not. You’re the same person with a new intention. And intentions don’t change behavior. Identity changes behavior. And identity doesn’t change in a day.</p><p>Watch yourself closely the next time you make a resolution. Notice what happens in your mind and body in that moment of commitment.</p><p>You feel lighter. The weight of who you’ve been lifts slightly. The possibility of who you could become feels real, tangible, close. You experience a rush of energy, clarity, focus. This feeling is so powerful, so convincing, that you mistake it for transformation itself.</p><p>But it’s not transformation. It’s the psychological relief that comes from reducing cognitive dissonance.</p><p>The feeling of deciding to change is so satisfying that it becomes a substitute for actually changing.</p><p>Here’s what actually happens when you “decide” to change:</p><p>You experience a moment of dissonance - a gap between who you are and who you want to be becomes painfully clear. Maybe it’s seeing yourself in a photo and not recognizing the person looking back. Maybe it’s a health scare that forces you to confront how you’ve been treating your body. Maybe it’s watching someone else succeed while you’re stuck in the same patterns you’ve been stuck in for years.</p><p>That dissonance creates psychological tension. Your brain experiences this tension as physical discomfort. And tension  resolution.</p><p>Your brain offers you a solution: make a decision to change.</p><p>The decision feels like action. It feels like progress. It creates a story you can tell yourself about who you’re becoming. And most importantly, it releases the tension without requiring you to actually do anything different.</p><p>The decision gives you all the emotional payoff of changing without any of the work of actually changing. You get to feel like you’re the kind of person who transforms their life, while still being exactly who you’ve always been.</p><p>This is why New Year’s resolutions feel so good on January 1st. You get the dopamine hit of possibility. The social validation of announcing your goals. The identity boost of being someone who’s “working on themselves.”</p><p>By January 8th, the high has worn off. By January 15th, you’re back to your old patterns. By February, you’ve stopped thinking about the resolution entirely.</p><p>You know this pattern. You’ve lived it.</p><p>You were going to wake up early and work on your business. Instead you’re scrolling at midnight, telling yourself tomorrow will be different. You were going to hit the gym four times this week. It’s Friday and you haven’t gone once, but you’ve already planned Monday’s perfect routine. You were going to finally ship that project. Instead you’re reorganizing your productivity system for the third time this month.</p><p>And you tell yourself you failed because you lacked discipline. Or willpower. Or time. Or support.</p><p>But that’s not why you failed.</p><p>You failed because you believed that the moment of decision was the moment of change. You failed because you thought transformation happens in a day.</p><p>Here’s the uncomfortable truth: every time you make a resolution and quit, you’re not just failing to change. You’re actively strengthening the neural pathways that define your current identity.</p><p>Your brain is learning: “I am someone who gets excited about change but doesn’t follow through.” Your brain is learning: “I am someone who quits when things get hard.” Your brain is learning: “I am someone who can’t be trusted to keep commitments to myself.”</p><p>The one-day delusion isn’t just ineffective. It’s actively harmful. Because every failed attempt doesn’t just leave you where you started. It  of the identity you’re trying to escape.</p><p>So if decisions don’t create change, what does? To understand that, you need to understand what your brain is actually doing when you try to change. And why it fights you every step of the way.</p><h2>II - Your Brain Doesn’t Resist Change, It Resists Death</h2><p><em>“Trust only movement. Life happens at the level of events, not of words. Trust movement.”</em></p><p>When you set a goal to “lose 30 pounds” or “build a business,” you think you’re just changing a behavior.</p><p>You’re threatening your brain’s entire model of who you are.</p><p>And your brain treats threats to identity the same way it treats threats to survival - with every defensive mechanism it has.</p><p>Your brain maintains what neuroscientists call a self-model - a predictive framework of who you are, what you do, and how you behave. This model gets built through a process called Bayesian inference. Your brain takes every action you’ve ever taken, every choice you’ve ever made, every outcome you’ve experienced, and creates probabilistic predictions about what you’ll do next.</p><p>“I am the type of person who…” isn’t just a thought. It’s a deeply encoded neural prediction engine.</p><p>When you eat junk food every night, your brain doesn’t just learn “junk food tastes good.” It learns “I am a person whose identity includes eating junk food at night.”</p><p>When you procrastinate on your projects, your brain doesn’t just learn “procrastination feels safer.” It learns “I am a person who procrastinates.”</p><p>These aren’t beliefs you can just think yourself out of. They’re physical neural structures that your brain will defend <em>like a wolf protects its territory.</em></p><p>Every time you try to do something that contradicts your self-model, your brain experiences what’s called prediction error. You tell yourself you’re going to wake up at 5am and go to the gym. But your brain’s model says “I am a person who sleeps until 7am.”</p><p>That creates error. And error, in the brain’s world, signals danger.</p><p>The brain has two options when it experiences prediction error:</p><ol><li>Update the model (change who you are - requires neural rewiring, destabilization, risk)</li><li>Update the action (go back to sleeping until 7am - requires nothing)</li></ol><p>Guess which one your brain chooses 99% of the time?</p><p>This is why you can feel so motivated at night, so committed to changing, and then wake up the next morning and hit snooze without even thinking about it. You didn’t fail because you’re weak. You failed because your brain successfully protected its model of who you are.</p><p>Think about someone who’s genuinely fit. Someone who enjoys going to the gym, finds eating healthy effortless, would feel wrong not exercising.</p><p>Do you think they’re just more disciplined than you? No. They have a different self-model.</p><p>Their brain’s prediction engine expects them to exercise. When they don’t, they experience prediction error. The discomfort pushes them back to the gym.</p><p>The same mechanism that keeps you on the couch keeps them in the gym. The same mechanism that makes you reach for junk food makes them reach for healthy food.</p><p>You’re not lacking willpower. You’re operating from a different identity. And until you understand how to update the model itself - not just force behaviors through willpower - you’ll keep failing.</p><p>You don’t rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your identity.</p><p>This is why the one-day delusion is so dangerous. You think you can just decide to be different. But decisions don’t update neural structures. Consistent behavior over time updates neural structures.</p><p>Now you understand the mechanism - your brain defends its self-model through prediction error minimization. But there’s something even more insidious happening. Your brain doesn’t just resist change passively. It actively sabotages your attempts before you even begin.</p><h2>III - The Harvard Study That Explains Why You Self-Sabotage</h2><p>In 2008, Harvard researchers told students they would take a test measuring their intelligence. Before the test, students could choose how to practice:</p><p>Option A: Practice with problems they could solve, maximizing preparation Option B: Practice with problems that would actively impair their performance</p><p>70% chose to impair themselves.</p><p>They intentionally chose the practice that would make them perform worse.</p><p>Why? Because if they failed after impairing themselves, they had an excuse. The failure wasn’t about their intelligence - it was about the handicap. This is called self-handicapping, and your brain does it constantly.</p><p>Your brain is terrified of one specific thing: discovering the truth about your capabilities.</p><p>If you try your absolute best to build a business and fail, you have to face the possibility that you’re not capable. If you give your relationship everything and it still falls apart, you have to face the possibility that you’re not worthy of love. If you train perfectly for a year and still don’t have the body you want, you have to face the possibility that you’ll never achieve it.</p><p>These possibilities are psychologically unbearable.</p><p>So your brain does something clever: it sabotages you before you can find out the truth.</p><p>You procrastinate on the business so you never have to know if you’re actually capable of building one. You pick fights in the relationship so you never have to know if you’re actually worthy of being loved. You skip workouts and eat poorly so you never have to know if you’re actually capable of transformation.</p><p>The self-sabotage feels like it’s protecting you from failure. Actually, it’s protecting you from .</p><p>Watch yourself closely for a week. Notice what happens when you’re about to do something important.</p><p>You’re about to record that video. Suddenly you need to research camera angles. You’re about to publish that article. Suddenly the headline isn’t quite right, you should rewrite it one more time. You’re about to reach out to that potential client. Suddenly you remember you need to update your website first.</p><p>The task that would move you forward gets replaced by a task that feels productive but keeps you safe. And you call this “preparation” or “getting ready” or “doing it right.” Your brain calls it successful threat avoidance.</p><p>This protection mechanism runs deeper than most people realize. Your self-model isn’t just one thing. It’s a network of interconnected schemas - cognitive frameworks about who you are in different domains.</p><p>You have schemas about your intelligence (”I’m not a math person”), your social value (”I’m awkward in groups”), your work ethic (”I’m a procrastinator”), your body (”I’ve always been heavy”), your worthiness (”People always leave me”).</p><p>These schemas are interconnected. When you challenge one, you threaten the whole network. And these schemas have a primary directive: maintain consistency.</p><p>If you have a schema that says “I am a person who fails at business,” and you start taking actions that might lead to business success, your schema defense system activates.</p><p>It generates thoughts: “This probably won’t work” / “I should wait until I’m more prepared” / “What if people think I’m full of myself?” / “I don’t have time for this right now”</p><p>It generates emotions: Anxiety when you’re making progress / Relief when you quit / Boredom with consistent action / Excitement for new distractions</p><p>It generates behaviors: Procrastination on the most important tasks / Perfectionism that prevents shipping / Impulsivity that derails your systems / Self-medication that numbs the dissonance</p><p>All of this happens automatically, below conscious awareness, in service of one goal: keep you exactly who you are.</p><p>The brain maintains homeostasis - internal stability - through negative feedback loops. When body temperature rises too high, you sweat. When blood sugar drops too low, you feel hungry. When your identity is threatened, you self-sabotage.</p><p>This is why most change fails. You’re trying to overcome homeostasis with willpower. You’re trying to override a billion years of evolution with a New Year’s resolution. You’re trying to fight prediction error minimization with discipline.</p><p>It’s like trying to hold your breath until you die. Eventually your autonomic nervous system takes over and forces you to breathe. Eventually your identity protection system takes over and forces you back to who you’ve always been.</p><p>The one-day delusion promises you can bypass all of this with a moment of decision. But you can’t decide your way past your brain’s defense mechanisms. You have to systematically reprogram them.</p><p>Which raises the question: how? If your brain defends its self-model through prediction error minimization and active self-sabotage, how do you actually update it? The answer lies in understanding exactly how your brain physically changes. And why that process takes 90 days, not one moment of motivation.</p><p><em>“All our life, so far as it has definite form, is but a mass of habits—practical, emotional, and intellectual—systematically organized for our weal or woe, and bearing us irresistibly toward our destiny, whatever the latter may be.”</em></p><p>Every change you want to make requires you to become a different person. Not metaphorically. Physically.</p><p>Your brain needs to rewire itself to predict new behaviors as normal.</p><p>The good news: we now understand exactly how this happens. The bad news: it takes longer than anyone wants to admit.</p><p>“Neurons that fire together, wire together.” This is Hebb’s Law, the fundamental principle of neuroplasticity discovered in 1949 that still defines how your brain changes.</p><p>Every time you perform a behavior, the neurons involved in generating that behavior strengthen their connections through a process called long-term potentiation. The synapse - the gap between neurons - becomes more efficient at transmitting signals. Chemical receptors multiply. The electrical signal travels faster. The behavior requires less conscious effort.</p><p>Do it once: weak connection, requires conscious attention and willpower Do it ten times: stronger connection, starting to feel familiar but still requires focus Do it a hundred times: automatic enough that you can do it while thinking about other things Do it a thousand times: you don’t even remember learning it, it’s just who you are</p><p>But here’s what most people miss about neuroplasticity: it’s not just about repetition. It’s about the timeline of consolidation.</p><p>Your brain consolidates new behaviors in three distinct phases, each with different mechanisms and vulnerabilities.</p><p>Phase 1: Initial Encoding (Days 0-7)</p><p>When you first perform a new behavior, your brain creates a temporary neural pathway. This pathway exists primarily in your hippocampus and prefrontal cortex - the parts of your brain responsible for working memory and conscious control.</p><p>Think of this like writing in sand on a beach. The pattern is there, clear and visible. But one wave - one stressful day, one moment of temptation, one disruption to your routine - and it washes away.</p><p>In this first week, you’re essentially keeping the pathway alive through constant activation. The neurons are firing together, but they haven’t  yet. The connections are held in place by temporary chemical signals, not structural changes.</p><p>Stop for one day and the chemical signals start to degrade. Stop for three days and the pathway is functionally gone. Your brain returns to its default state - the old, stronger pathways that define who you’ve always been.</p><p>This is why you can be so motivated on January 1st, so committed to change, and by January 8th you’ve already quit. You were operating in the fragile window where the neural pathway hadn’t consolidated yet. You hit one obstacle, missed one day, and the pathway collapsed.</p><p>The one-day delusion tells you that the decision is enough. But in this phase, the decision means nothing. Only daily activation keeps the pathway alive.</p><p>Phase 2: Synaptic Consolidation (Days 7-21)</p><p>Around day 7, if you’ve maintained consistent activation, something shifts. The brain begins a process called synaptic consolidation.</p><p>The temporary chemical signals that were holding the pathway together start to trigger structural changes. Proteins are synthesized. New receptor sites are built. The physical shape of the synapse begins to change. The dendrites - the branch-like structures that receive signals - start to grow and stabilize.</p><p>This is like moving from sand to wet cement. The pattern is no longer held in place by constant activation. It’s starting to harden into structure.</p><p>But it’s not solid yet. It’s still vulnerable.</p><p>A major stressor can disrupt the consolidation process. A change in environment can make the pathway harder to access. A disruption to your routine can pull you back to the old pathways because they’re still stronger, still more automatic.</p><p>This is the window where most people fail, and they don’t understand why.</p><p>Week 2-3 feels hard but manageable. You think you’ve got momentum. You can feel the behavior getting easier. You start to believe you’ve changed.</p><p>Then something happens. Work gets stressful. You get sick. Your routine gets disrupted. And suddenly you’re back to zero, wondering what went wrong.</p><p>What went wrong is that you were still in the vulnerable phase. The pathway was consolidating but not consolidated. The cement was setting but not set.</p><p>And because you thought you had changed - because the behavior felt easier - you didn’t protect yourself from disruption. You didn’t defend the fragile new pathway from stress and environmental triggers.</p><p>Phase 3: Systems Consolidation (Days 21-90)</p><p>Between day 21 and day 90, if you’ve maintained consistent behavior despite obstacles, the real transformation happens.</p><p>This is called systems consolidation, and it’s a fundamentally different process from synaptic consolidation.</p><p>Your brain isn’t just strengthening individual connections anymore. It’s reorganizing entire networks. It’s shifting which brain regions are responsible for the behavior. It’s moving the behavior from conscious control to automatic execution.</p><p>Researchers studying habit formation have found that this reorganization follows a predictable pattern. In the early days, brain scans show heavy activation in the prefrontal cortex - you’re thinking hard about the behavior, making conscious decisions, exerting willpower.</p><p>By day 30-40, you start to see a shift. Prefrontal cortex activation decreases. Basal ganglia activation increases. The behavior is moving from the part of your brain that handles conscious control to the part that handles automatic patterns.</p><p>By day 60-90, the shift is complete. The behavior is now encoded in the basal ganglia - the same part of your brain that handles walking, breathing, other automatic behaviors you don’t think about.</p><p>The prefrontal cortex has released control. The behavior has become automatic. Encoded in a different part of the brain entirely.</p><p>This is when something remarkable happens.</p><p>The new neural pathway doesn’t just become as strong as the old one. It becomes your brain’s default prediction. It becomes what your brain expects to happen.</p><p>Before 90 days: you’re forcing behavior against your identity, fighting prediction error every day After 90 days: the behavior IS your identity, NOT doing it creates prediction error</p><p>Before day 90, you’re trying to go to the gym. After day 90, you’re someone who goes to the gym. The difference isn’t semantic. It’s neurological.</p><p>This is when you stop being someone who’s trying to go to the gym and become someone who goes to the gym. When you stop being someone who’s working on a business and become a business owner. When you stop being someone who’s attempting change and become someone who’s changed.</p><p>Your brain has physically reorganized itself to make the new behavior the default.</p><p>But - and this is critical - this only happens if you maintain consistent activation for the full 90 days.</p><p>Miss days in the early phase and the pathway never consolidates. Miss days in the middle phase and the consolidation is disrupted. Miss days in the late phase and the systems reorganization doesn’t complete.</p><p>This is why 90 consecutive days isn’t arbitrary. It’s based on how long it actually takes your brain to move a behavior from conscious control to automatic execution. From temporary activation to structural change to systems reorganization.</p><p>The one-day delusion tells you that transformation happens in a moment. Neuroscience tells you it takes exactly 90 days of consistent behavior for your brain to physically rewire itself.</p><p>Your brain can only tolerate a certain amount of prediction error before it triggers a full identity crisis. Psychological research shows that when you try to change too much, too fast, you activate a threat response that shuts down higher-order thinking and triggers defensive behaviors.</p><p>This is why “going all in” usually fails.</p><p>You wake up January 1st and decide: I’m going to wake at 5am, meditate for 30 minutes, work out for an hour, eat perfectly, work on my business for 4 hours, read for an hour, journal before bed.</p><p>Your brain experiences: “This person is not me. This is not me. This is not me. THREAT. THREAT. THREAT.”</p><p>And you quit. Usually within a week.</p><p>The solution is counterintuitive: you need to change just enough to trigger neuroplasticity, but not so much that you trigger an identity crisis. You need to find the edge of your current self-model and push it just slightly beyond.</p><p>Not 10 new behaviors. One behavior, changed by about 1%, repeated for 90 days.</p><p>This is why the one-day delusion fails. You think you can change everything at once because you’re motivated. But motivation doesn’t protect you from your brain’s threat response. Small, consistent changes do.</p><p>So you understand the timeline - 90 days for systems consolidation. And you understand the constraint - you can’t trigger an identity crisis by changing too much at once. Which leaves the critical question: what exactly should you change? And how do you design a behavior that’s small enough to slip past your defenses but large enough to actually rewire your brain?</p><h2>V - The 1% Identity Contradiction Protocol</h2><p>What if the fastest way to transform your entire life is to make the smallest possible change?</p><p>Most people think the opposite. They think more change, faster change, radical change. But that’s not how your brain works.</p><p>Your brain runs Bayesian inference. It’s constantly calculating probabilities: “What’s the likelihood that this behavior represents who I actually am?”</p><p>One day of new behavior: 0.3% probability (noise, ignore it) Ten days: 3% probability (interesting, but still within error range) Thirty days: 30% probability (starting to update predictions) Ninety days: 95%+ probability (this IS who I am now)</p><p>But only if you don’t trigger the defense system.</p><p>A 1% change is small enough that it slips under your brain’s threat detection radar. Large enough that it creates meaningful prediction error. Specific enough that you can measure it. Repeatable enough that you can do it for 90 days straight.</p><p>Step 1: Identify Your Core Schema</p><p>Don’t try to change everything. Identify the  self-schema causing the most damage.</p><p>Is it “I am a person who quits when things get hard”? Or “I am a person who self-sabotages right before success”? Or “I am a person who can’t stick to anything”?</p><p>Write it down. Get specific. This is the prediction engine you’re going to reprogram.</p><p>Step 2: Design the 1% Contradiction</p><p>You don’t try to become the opposite. You identify one tiny behavior that contradicts the schema by about 1%.</p><p>Schema: “I am a person who quits when things get hard” Don’t become: the person who never quits anything Do become: the person who pushes through one moment of difficulty per day</p><p>Schema: “I am a person who self-sabotages success” Don’t become: the person who succeeds at everything Do become: the person who takes one action toward a goal even when anxiety appears</p><ul><li>Small enough it doesn’t trigger identity crisis</li><li>Large enough it creates prediction error</li><li>Specific enough you can measure it (yes/no, did I do it)</li><li>Repeatable enough for 90 consecutive days</li></ul><p>Step 3: The 90-Day Commitment</p><p>This is non-negotiable. 90 consecutive days. Not 89. Not “most days.” Not “when I feel motivated.”</p><p>Because your brain is running probability calculations. Miss one day and the probability drops. Miss multiple days and your brain concludes: “Nope, still the old me.”</p><p>But 90 days of perfect consistency? Your brain has no choice but to update its prediction. You become the person who does this thing.</p><p>Step 4: Track the Internal Experience</p><p>Change happens in your nervous system before it happens in your behavior. You need to track the internal experience, not just the external action.</p><ul><li>How much discomfort you felt (0-10 scale)</li><li>What thoughts your brain generated to stop you</li><li>Whether it felt “like you” or “not like you”</li></ul><p>This is important. The number dropping from 8 to 6 to 4 over weeks is proof your brain is rewiring. It’s progress you can measure even when external results haven’t appeared yet.</p><p>The transformation is happening in the space between stimulus and response, not in the results you can see.</p><p>Days 1-30: High discomfort (7-9), constant mental resistance, feeling like “this isn’t me”</p><p>Days 30-60: Moderate discomfort (4-6), occasional resistance, moments where it feels natural</p><p>Days 60-90: Low discomfort (1-3), rare resistance, feeling like “this is just what I do”</p><p>If you’re not seeing this progression, the behavior is either too small (not enough prediction error) or too large (too much threat).</p><p>Step 5: Defend Against the Three Predictable Obstacles</p><p>Your brain will try to stop you at three specific points.</p><p>Days 15-45 (The Mud): This is when initial motivation wears off but the behavior hasn’t become automatic. Your brain generates every excuse: “This isn’t working” / “I should try something different” / “Maybe I’m just not meant to change”</p><p>This is the kill zone. Most people quit here. The solution: know it’s coming and push through anyway.</p><p>Days 60-75 (The Scaling Impulse): This is when the behavior starts feeling easier and your brain thinks: “I should do more!” So you add new behaviors, increase intensity, go all in. And you trigger the identity threat response again.</p><p>The solution: stick with the 1% until day 90. Then reassess.</p><p>Day 89 (The Proximity Panic): One day away from completing and your brain generates anxiety: “What if I can’t maintain this? What if day 91 ruins everything?”</p><p>The solution: Day 90 isn’t the end. It’s the point where the behavior becomes your baseline.</p><p>You now have the protocol: identify your core schema, design a 1% contradiction, execute for 90 days, defend against the three obstacles. Simple, right? Follow the steps and transform your identity. Except there’s a problem most people don’t discover until they’re deep into the process. And it explains why some people succeed with this protocol while others mysteriously fail despite perfect execution.</p><h2>VI - Why Your Self-Model Is Harder To Change Than You Think</h2><p>If changing one behavior for 90 days was all it took, everyone would be transformed. But there’s a deeper problem.</p><p>Your self-schemas don’t exist in isolation. They’re part of a network. Research from cognitive psychology shows that self-schemas are organized in hierarchical, interconnected structures. Change one schema and you create ripple effects through the entire system.</p><p>Let’s say you successfully update from “I am a person who quits” to “I am a person who finishes things.” That’s progress.</p><p>But now all your OTHER schemas - built around the assumption that you’re a quitter - are in conflict.</p><p>Your social schema: “I’m the funny self-deprecating friend” Your work schema: “I’m the employee who plays it safe” Your identity schema: “I’m the person with potential who never actualizes it”</p><p>These schemas are now generating prediction errors because they expect quitter behavior and you’re not delivering it. Your brain experiences cognitive dissonance. Dissonance is psychologically painful.</p><p>So your brain tries to resolve it: Update all related schemas (hard, slow, destabilizing) or Reject the new behavior and restore consistency (easy, fast, familiar)</p><p>This is why transformation feels so chaotic. When you start changing one thing, everything else starts shaking. Your relationships shift because you’re not playing your old role. Your social dynamics change. Your daily patterns disrupt.</p><p>This isn’t a bug. This is the feature. Real change requires the entire system to reorganize.</p><p>Thermodynamics teaches us that systems must increase in entropy before they reorganize into higher order. Psychology teaches us that identity must destabilize before it reconsolidates at a higher level. You have to be willing to <em>feel like you don’t know who you are</em> for a while.</p><p>There’s one more complication: Other people have schemas about who you are. When you change, you violate their predictions. And their brains don’t like prediction error any more than yours does.</p><p>So they push back: Your friends: “Why are you being so serious?” / Your family: “You’re changing too much, we’re worried” / Your partner: “You’re becoming someone I don’t recognize”</p><p>They’re not trying to sabotage you (usually). Their brains are trying to minimize prediction error by getting you to go back to who you were. Because who you were was predictable. Safe. And didn’t threaten their own identity schemas.</p><p>This is why you need support. Not the kind that enables your old behaviors. The kind that tolerates your transformation even when it’s uncomfortable for them.</p><p>You understand the structural challenge now - schema networks are interconnected, change creates cascading disruption, and even other people’s brains resist your transformation. But there’s one more mechanism you need to understand. Because even if you navigate all of this perfectly, there’s a neurochemical system that will either sustain your change or sabotage it. And most people get it completely wrong.</p><h2>VII - The Dopamine Prediction Error System</h2><p>Most people think dopamine is about reward. It’s not. Dopamine is about prediction error. And understanding this changes everything about behavior change.</p><p>When something happens that’s better than you predicted, dopamine spikes. When something happens that’s worse than you predicted, dopamine drops. When something happens exactly as you predicted, dopamine stays flat.</p><p>This is why: The first bite of chocolate tastes better than the tenth / New relationships feel more exciting than long-term ones / Checking your phone for messages releases more dopamine than reading the message / The anticipation of success feels better than the achievement</p><p>Your brain is constantly running predictions, constantly comparing outcomes to expectations, constantly using dopamine to signal whether to reinforce or extinguish behaviors.</p><p>When you do a new behavior that contradicts your schema, and nothing terrible happens, you generate a positive prediction error.</p><p>Your brain predicted: “If I do this thing, something bad will happen” Reality delivered: “Nothing bad happened” Result: Small dopamine spike that reinforces the new behavior</p><p>Do this enough times and your brain starts to update its predictions.</p><p>But there’s a problem. Your dopamine system has a tolerance mechanism called homeostatic plasticity. If you generate too many positive prediction errors too quickly, your dopamine receptors down-regulate.</p><p>This is why: Going “all in” on change feels amazing for a week, then terrible / Radical transformations create dramatic dopamine spikes followed by crashes / People who try to change everything at once often end up more depressed than when they started</p><p>The crash isn’t because you’re weak. It’s because your brain’s reward system shut down to protect itself from overstimulation.</p><p>The solution is gradual, consistent, 1% changes. Small enough they don’t trigger dopamine tolerance. Large enough they create meaningful prediction errors. Consistent enough they compound over time.</p><p>Most meaningful changes don’t provide immediate rewards. You go to the gym today - your body doesn’t look different. You work on your business today - you don’t make money. You eat healthy today - you don’t feel dramatically better.</p><p>Your brain’s prediction error system works on immediate timescales. It doesn’t care that in 90 days you’ll be transformed. It cares that , you’re experiencing effort without reward. That generates a negative prediction error. Which lowers dopamine. Which makes you want to quit.</p><p>This is why you need to engineer immediate micro-rewards that aren’t related to the outcome. Not rewards like “eat a cookie after the gym.”</p><ul><li>Track the behavior (completion itself becomes rewarding)</li><li>Note the discomfort level dropping (progress on the internal metric)</li><li>Acknowledge the schema update (celebrate the identity shift)</li></ul><p>These meta-rewards leverage your dopamine system without requiring outcome-based success.</p><p>You now understand all the mechanisms: Your brain defends identity through prediction error minimization. It actively self-sabotages to avoid discovering truth. It requires 90 days of neural consolidation. It can only tolerate 1% changes without triggering crisis. Schema networks create cascading disruption. Social pressure resists your transformation. And dopamine needs immediate micro-rewards to sustain behavior.</p><p>That’s a lot of variables. Which is why you need a complete, systematic protocol that accounts for all of them. Not a list of tips. Not generic advice. A step-by-step system that works with every mechanism your brain uses to keep you stuck.</p><p>You now understand the neuroscience. You know why change fails. You know what actually works.</p><p>Here’s the complete protocol to transform your identity in 90 days:</p><p>Day 1-2: Schema Identification</p><p>Write down every “I am a person who…” statement that describes you. Not who you want to be. Who you actually are right now.</p><p>Then identify which schema is causing the most damage. Which schema, if updated, would create the biggest ripple effect through your life? That’s your target.</p><ul><li>What truth about your capabilities are you most afraid to test?</li><li>What would you do differently if you knew you couldn’t fail? (That’s the schema holding you back)</li><li>If someone followed you around for a week, what would they conclude about who you actually are vs. who you say you want to be?</li><li>What pattern do you keep repeating that you’re most ashamed to admit?</li></ul><p>Design your 1% contradiction behavior. It must:</p><ul><li>Clearly contradict the target schema</li><li>Be measurable (you know when you did it)</li><li>Be completable in less than 5 minutes</li><li>Be impossible to rationalize away</li></ul><p>Examples: Schema: “I am a person who avoids discomfort” Behavior: “Cold shower for 30 seconds every morning”</p><p>Schema: “I am a person who starts but never finishes” Behavior: “Write 100 words on my project every day”</p><p>Schema: “I am a person who hides from judgment” Behavior: “Post one honest thought on social media every day”</p><p>Day 5-7: Environment Setup</p><p>Make the behavior impossible to avoid.</p><p>If it’s cold showers: lay clothes out the night before If it’s writing: have document open on your desktop If it’s posting: write in notes app first thing when you wake</p><p>Remove all friction. Remove all excuses.</p><p>Every single day for 90 days:</p><ul><li>Do the behavior before anything else</li><li>Track completion (put an X on calendar)</li><li>Rate discomfort level (0-10)</li></ul><ul><li>Note what thoughts came up trying to stop you</li><li>Note whether it felt “like you” or “not like you”</li></ul><p>Week Review (30 minutes):</p><ul><li>Every 7 days, review your notes</li><li>Look for patterns in resistance</li><li>Celebrate schema updates (moments where it felt natural)</li><li>Adjust ONLY if behavior is clearly too easy or too hard</li></ul><p>The Three Critical Zones:</p><p>Days 1-30 (The Resistance Phase): Expect high discomfort, constant mental resistance, feeling fake. Your job: complete the behavior anyway, every single day.</p><p>Days 31-60 (The Integration Phase): Expect moderate discomfort, occasional resistance, moments of naturalness. Your job: don’t add more behaviors, don’t increase difficulty, stay the course.</p><p>Days 61-90 (The Consolidation Phase): Expect low discomfort, rare resistance, feeling normal. Your job: don’t stop at day 85 thinking you’re done, complete all 90 days.</p><p>Day 91: The Expansion Decision</p><p>Ask yourself: Does this behavior now feel like “just who I am”?</p><p>If yes: maintain it as baseline, add one more 1% behavior if desired If no: continue for another 30 days before reassessing</p><p>You don’t change once and you’re done. You spiral upward through levels of identity.</p><p>First 90 days: “I am a person who does this one thing” Second 90 days: “I am a person who does this and that” Third 90 days: “I am a person whose entire life is organized around growth”</p><p>Each cycle, the changes compound. Each cycle, your self-model expands. Each cycle, behaviors that seemed impossible become effortless.</p><p>After one year: You’ve updated 4 core schemas. Built 4 automatic behaviors. Transformed your identity from the inside out.</p><p>And unlike every other change you’ve attempted, this one actually sticks. Because you didn’t just change your behavior. You changed who you are.</p><p>Your brain is designed to keep you exactly who you are. That’s its job.</p><p>If you want to become someone new, you can’t fight that system. You have to work with it.</p><p>The one-day delusion tells you that transformation happens in moments of decision. That you can wake up one morning and simply be different. That change is about motivation and willpower and discipline.</p><p>That’s not how your brain works.</p><p>Think about every time you’ve tried to change before. Every New Year’s resolution. Every Monday morning promise. Every birthday commitment.</p><p>You felt it, didn’t you? That surge of possibility. That moment of clarity where you could see exactly who you needed to become. That feeling of certainty that this time would be different.</p><p>And it felt so real. So powerful. So convincing.</p><p>That’s the trap. That feeling is what keeps you stuck in the loop of trying and failing, trying and failing, over and over again.</p><p>Because that feeling isn’t transformation. It’s the psychological relief that comes from believing you’ve transformed without having to do the work of transforming.</p><p>Your brain gives you the emotional payoff up front - the dopamine hit of possibility, the identity boost of being someone who’s “working on themselves,” the social validation of announcing your goals.</p><p>It waits for you to miss a day. It waits for you to hit an obstacle. It waits for life to get hard. And when you do, when you inevitably do because you’re still operating from the same neural structures that created your old behavior, it pulls you back.</p><p>Not because you’re weak. Not because you lack discipline. Because that’s what brains do.</p><p>They maintain homeostasis. They protect existing identity structures. They minimize prediction error. They keep you exactly who you’ve always been.</p><p>Unless you work with the mechanisms instead of against them.</p><p>Real change happens through:</p><ul><li>Letting the transformation compound</li></ul><p>Not through moments of inspiration. Not through bursts of motivation. Not through grand promises made on January 1st.</p><p>Through boring, unglamorous, daily consistency. Through showing up when you don’t feel like it. Through protecting the fragile neural pathway in its early days. Through pushing through the mud of days 15-45 when every part of you wants to quit. Through resisting the scaling impulse of days 60-75 when you think you should be doing more.</p><p>Through 90 consecutive days of proof to your brain that this behavior represents who you actually are.</p><p>That’s it. That’s the entire protocol.</p><p>Not sexy. Not inspiring. Not the message you want to hear when you’re feeling motivated and ready to change everything about your life right now.</p><p>Most people spend their entire lives preparing to change instead of changing. They die with the best intentions and the same identity they’ve always had.</p><p>And after a decade of trying and failing to change through motivation and willpower and discipline, after hundreds of conversations with people who’ve successfully transformed their lives, after diving deep into the neuroscience of identity formation and behavioral change, I can tell you with certainty:</p><p>The one-day delusion is what’s been keeping you stuck. The 90-day protocol is what will set you free.</p><p>The question isn’t whether you can change. The question is: are you willing to let go of the fantasy that transformation happens in a moment and do it the way that  works?</p><p>90 days. One behavior. No exceptions.</p><p>Now the only question is: which schema are you going to update first?</p>",

      "content": "<p>OpenAI has made tech waves in the recent years given the prominences of the ChatGPT family of models, and the remanent of LLMs as search engine reindexing algorithms. They were a private research entity that became a titan now competing with the likes of Google. However, their story is less than glamorous.</p><p>They started out as a <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/elon-musk-s-new-lawsuit-claims-openai-is-sitting-on-illegal-profits/\">non-profit funded by Musk</a> only to be insanely profit-driven.

This all put ChatGPT in the spotlight in a negative sense, and on top of the already burning fire were the <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/sam-altman-sister-taken-her-133155828.html\">Ann Altman allegations</a>. The biggest issue, however, is that OpenAI is extremely centralized and has a business model that is based off of incentivizing data harvesting.</p><p>On the other hand, there are researchers like me and the growing cyberpunk community who have been working on AI research for many years. The straw that broke the camel’s back for me was the localization and privacy concerns that OpenAI has raised. This led me to build AI systems based off of open peering that aims to democratize LLMs and AI applications.</p><p>In the last few months, I have done just that through the debut of just some of the open-source models knowns as the <a href=\"https://openpeer.me/\">OpenPeer AI</a> family of models. These models are now available on <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/OpenPeerAI/\">Huggingface</a> for everybody to download and use and is part of larger scale initiatives done by <a href=\"https://invest.riecomp.org/\">Riemann Computing</a> which won <a href=\"https://decentralized-internet.org/\">Hackernoon Startup of the Year</a> for the electronics category.</p><p>However, I am not just stopping there. I am also pushing for massive updates to the <a href=\"https://github.com/Lonero-Team/Decentralized-Internet\">decentralized-internet SDK</a> on GitHub, and at the same time advocating for the use of mathematical constraints to safeguard AI. My goal is simple, to ensure that training for AI is democratized, can be pushed through both multicloud (on-prem and off-prem environments) and doesn’t necessarily need to harvest tons of data towards a single centralized source.</p><blockquote><p>In addition to this, I am already engaged in writing other articles on Hackernoon that focus on advancing decentralization, promoting advocacy, and discussing the current state of things. ~ Andrew Kamal</p></blockquote><p>Currently, nearly everyone in the tech community shares a common objective: to dethrone OpenAI. This effort goes beyond merely challenging their monopoly; it also addresses privacy issues and the necessity for safe, democratized, and ethical AI. Without these considerations, the industry's future appears rather bleak. The chaos has been going on long enough, and if OpenAI isn’t too busy harvesting massive amounts of data, now <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/as-competition-heats-up-openai-changes-course-and-introduces-ads-on-chatgpt/ar-AA1Uvryt\">they are adding advertising</a> for free users in ChatGPT. However, none of these issues compare to the seriousness of Balaji’s death, and his memory shouldn’t be sunk down the memory hole. Everybody is still wondering what is going on.</p>",

      "content": "<p>\\\nCustomer calls contain far more than words. They carry emotional signals that reveal satisfaction, frustration, urgency and trust. Call sentiment analysis uses natural language processing (NLP) to surface those signals at scale, turning raw conversations into actionable intelligence.</p><h2>What Call Sentiment Analysis Actually Measures</h2><p>Call sentiment analysis <strong>evaluates the emotional tone expressed</strong> in customer interactions, typically after speech has been converted to text using automatic speech recognition (ASR). Sentiment signals often fall into three broad categories: \\n </p><ul><li> Positive, neutral or negative orientation</li><li> Strength of emotional expression</li><li> How sentiment changes over the course of a call</li></ul><p>\\\nAnalyzing these dimensions together allows teams to identify turning points in conversations, such as moments where frustration peaks or confidence improves. When applied across large call volumes, sentiment metrics reveal systemic trends that individual call reviews rarely uncover. This enables data-driven improvements in customer experience and operational performance.</p><h2>Step 1: Preparing Call Data for NLP Analysis</h2><p>Call sentiment analysis begins after recorded conversations are transcribed using ASR. Transcript quality sets the foundation for reliable sentiment insights, making preprocessing a critical stage. This process typically includes cleaning filler words, standardizing punctuation and casing, and correcting common transcription artifacts found in spontaneous speech. \\n </p><p>Beyond cleaning and standardizing transcripts, <strong>NLP enables models to interpret context</strong>, intent and sentiment, not just individual keywords. Tokenization and lemmatization further normalize language, allowing models to focus on emotional signals and meaning rather than surface-level variation. This ensures that call sentiment analysis captures the nuances of customer interactions, providing actionable insights to improve routing, agent performance and overall customer satisfaction.</p><h2>Step 2: Selecting an Open-Source Sentiment Modeling Approach</h2><p>Once transcripts are normalized, sentiment modeling can be applied using open-source NLP libraries. Lexicon-based models evaluate sentiment by comparing words against predefined emotional dictionaries, offering fast and interpretable results for conversational text. \\n </p><p>More advanced approaches rely on transformer-based architectures such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), which analyze sentiment within a broader linguistic context. These models account for sentence structure, surrounding dialogue and shifts in tone across longer passages. This makes them especially useful for customer calls where meaning evolves over time rather than appearing in isolated statements.</p><h2>Step 3: Scoring and Interpreting Sentiment Across Calls</h2><p>Sentiment models generate scores at the utterance, speaker turn or full-call level, showing how emotional tone shifts throughout a conversation. Examining these changes reveals moments of escalation, hesitation or resolution that single averages often miss, giving teams deeper insight into customer behavior and agent performance. \\n </p><p>For example, auto attendants streamline call routing by <strong>giving callers around three to five</strong> menu choices. This reduces confusion, hold times, and dropped calls while connecting callers to the right department or staff member. Sentiment analysis can detect patterns of frustration or satisfaction around these touchpoints, helping teams identify bottlenecks, improve routing and enhance the overall customer experience.</p><h2>Step 4: Visualizing Sentiment for Actionable Insight</h2><p>Visualization turns sentiment scores into actionable insights. Time-series charts track emotional tone throughout a conversation, while aggregated views compare sentiment across agents, call types or time periods. Dashboards that combine sentiment and operational metrics make patterns clear and easier to act on. \\n </p><p>Analytics dashboards that combine sentiment scores and performance metrics can increase first call resolution (FCR)  and decrease average handle time (AHT) by roughly 25%, illustrating the tangible benefits of visualizing call data for operational decisions. By presenting sentiment data visually, organizations can identify coaching opportunities, optimize workflows and enrich buyer experience.</p><h2>Data Privacy and Ethical Considerations</h2><p>Call sentiment analysis processes sensitive customer communications, making governance essential rather than optional. Key safeguards include: \\n </p><ul><li> Retain only text required for analysis</li><li> Remove personal identifiers during preprocessing</li><li><strong>Transparent use policies:</strong> Clarify how insights influence decisions</li></ul><p>\\\nTogether, these safeguards establish a responsible framework that balances analytical value with customer trust, regulatory alignment and ethical use of conversational data.</p><h2>Continuous Model Improvement and Monitoring</h2><p>Language evolves, customer expectations shift and sentiment expressions change across industries.

      "content": "<p>Thank you for having me. I'm doing great. How are you?</p><p>So, let's start there. What does media relations mean to you?</p><p>The way I look at Media relations is two-sided. From the brand perspective, it is a tool to amplify the brand messages and story through media coverage, and from the media perspective, it is the practice of connecting relevant sources to journalists or reporters.</p><p>I represent startup clients and leverage their stories, which could include the founder's stories, brand narratives, or recent events within the organization. I connect these stories happening within their industry to build relationships with journalists who write about topics related to the startup. I then offer journalists a reliable, credible source, in the form of a company spokesperson, to discuss these topics and offer valuable insights.</p><p>Excellent, and I believe something you said in there has to do with building relationships with reporters.</p><p>Maybe you can speak a little on that for everybody who thinks that PR and media relations are, “you just pay for some press release or pay to play, or you snap your fingers, and you're magically a celebrity.”</p><p>There are relationships that have to be built, as opposed to people just randomly thinking that everybody is instantly famous, as if our jobs within communications are so simple that anybody could go do it.</p><p>So, as I was saying, maybe you could comment a little bit about building relationships and connecting the founder stories to the media?</p><p>Yes, so I'll start by sharing my background. I have a bachelor’s degree in journalism, and while I was in university and working as a journalist, I would get emails asking me to cover stories related to my beat or the topics I wrote about. And a lot of the time, there were also emails unrelated to what I was actually writing about.</p><p>This is something journalists constantly talk about; their inboxes are constantly flooded with emails. And now, as a PR specialist, I need to know how to get their attention, make my email or whichever tactic I’m using to reach out to them stand out, and, more importantly, offer them value.</p><p>Most of that is knowing what they're covering, so I'm not going to pitch a journalist who's writing about mobility technology a story about cybersecurity unless it's a company working on cybersecurity for EVs, which came to mind because I had a client working in that area.</p><p>We need to build a relationship with the media because if we're constantly pitching unrelated stories in their inboxes, they're not going to answer those emails. It's part of bringing a journalist or reporter something that's actually useful for the stories they are currently working on or will be working on in the near future. So timeliness also has a role in the value I can provide to the journalists.</p><p>And, of course, working on the PR side, I need to make sure my clients get mentioned in valuable press placements that get them attention, because that's how PR works, as an attention magnet for everything that is already working within the brand.</p><p>So I know you like to focus on founder stories, and I know when it comes to the focus of your operation is working with Israeli startups and typically ones that might not get noticed in the broader spectrum because a lot of the media is focused on cyber activities of Israel, so you carved out a really interesting niche. Can you talk a little bit about that?</p><p>I primarily work with Israeli startups, though I have also worked with startups in Europe and the US.</p><p>I build their credibility and attract attention from their target audience in the markets where they are focusing their GTM strategy. Most times, it's startups in Israel working to establish their presence in the US, Europe, or other markets because they see greater business potential outside Israel.</p><p>So if we are talking about an Israeli startup, and this is most Israeli startups, their focus tends to be on the US market. They're looking at the American buyer mindset, and that requires a lot of built-up trust over time, which traditional advertising and marketing, which says “paid for by this company,” doesn't fulfill.&nbsp; And building trust over time takes just that, a lot of time.</p><p>With media coverage focused on the startup or founder's thought leadership, it shows the company as a player with a stake in the industry. And when the American buyer mindset is focused on trust in the company they are buying a service or product from, they don't just want to see ads that say, “hey, you should buy this,” they want an answer to the question of why they should buy it.</p><p>They want to see proven credibility from these startups, not just what they say directly to the buyer. They want to know that it actually works beyond the successful customer stories the startups share. What media presence does is give them that third-party validity to say, “if a journalist is writing about this, there's credibility there.”</p><p>Being a former journalist myself, I know journalists’ M.O. is to make sure that they're seeking the truth and reporting it and with that there's a layer of trust they're building for the buyer to actually come and say, “OK I'm reading about this and and it makes sense, I’m seeing it everywhere,” and that's building up trust with the brand, in the product, in the service.\\</p><p>Great! So, what you're saying is that sometimes there's a little bit of cultural clash or shift or mindset when it comes to let's say primarily the US market, which has a fairly sophisticated developed buyers journey, which is typically different from the Israeli marketplace and since a lot of these startups are looking to grow beyond their borders, they're mostly focused on the US.</p><p>Now, let me ask related questions. What would you say the startup mindset is missing when it comes and seeks out your services so I would imagine sometimes people are saying well. Why do we need you? Our products are great.</p><p>Maybe you could kind of provide a little bit of color and explain what Israeli start up founders should know when they're coming to work with you and everybody else that would be reading and listening to this interview.</p><p>Definitely. Many companies that I speak with don't see PR as a measurable marketing tactic at first. They often just notice that there's coverage or press releases, but that's only really part of the whole picture.</p><p>The real value of PR is using their story to build up their credibility and visibility in front of the right people. Those right people could be investors, or customers, or partners and today, of course, it's even more relevant because of AI driven search and generative engines using more organic media and strong press coverage.</p><p>PR is no longer a “nice to have” marketing tactic to plug in. In my eyes, it's never been optional, but now more people see it as a “must have.” It's necessary and it's really what's bringing up and showing how a brand shows up in front of the people that matter.</p><p>My approach is looking at the function of PR as an attention magnet. I take what's already strong in the business, the product, the story, the momentum and amplify it so that the right audiences are drawn to it over time strategically, and then over that time, you're also building trust in your brand.</p><p>Another layer is that a lot of companies don't understand what I mentioned previously, which was the measurable aspect of PR as a marketing tactic. So, for example, in performance marketing, you can measure the specific monetary value in the metrics. A lot of companies don't realize this can also be measured in PR, and there are different types of metrics I can share. Many times, I’m helping educate the companies that come to me and showing them, and then they are able to see that the value of PR is really there.</p><p>Outstanding. So now that we've entered a new year, what industries, trends, client stories, and what have you, are you excited about that you're currently working on and anything that's coming up?</p><p>I'm really excited to work with fast-moving startups developing dynamic products that empower industries to work more efficiently. I’m currently working with a company developing technology products for the veterinary industry, and they're preparing to launch a new product. I’m also working with another startup that has built a tech-driven platform to democratize the book publishing process, and I’m excited about the stories I’m working on with them, just to name a few.</p><p>As you heard, I really love working across different industries because it keeps me interested, and no day at work is the same. I also found that I really love working with B2B brands, specifically helping them increase visibility with their potential customers or clients, because I often get feedback from my clients who are getting emails from leads that say, “I saw your company mentioned in this article and I am interested in your product or services.”</p><p>When I hear my work is making a real impact on the business growth, it gives me the fuel to keep going, and I would love to do more of that in 2026.</p><p>Great stuff! I know we talked a lot about the Israeli startup mentality and mindset and sometimes needs a little bit of education understanding the US market.</p><p>So what if we look at the other side what do you think that the USA misses when it comes to thinking about all of these Israeli startups?</p><p>I love using the word ‘tachles,’ which means getting straight to the point, no fluff. I think that a lot of Israeli startup founders have this mindset and come from an American mindset, despite my very Israeli name, to understand the Israeli perspective, I really love it and it applies to PR.</p><p>When you're trying to tell your story you have to get straight to the point and you have to do it in a way that really does capture the attention of your audience. So I think that part of the Israeli ‘tachles’ mindset works very well and the American mindset, often without realizing it, is very receptive to that as well.</p><p>Absolutely and being an American Israeli I think you understand quite well how to bridge between the two different cultures because a lot of times I think that if you have someone that's purely American and tries to jive well with Israel, they're not gonna quite understand it and vice versa.</p><p>So, I think you being who you are and the experiences that you lead uniquely qualify you for such a mission would you agree?</p><p>Definitely. You can call me a chameleon, I fit into the Israeli work culture mentality, but also know how to tap into the American culture, given it’s where I was born and raised, as a tool to communicate with media and journalists that are based in the US and also European journalists when my clients are focused on that market as well.</p><p>Excellent, so one final question.</p><p>What would you say is the right signal or moment that a start up should notice that they are ready to work with you?</p><p>Because I'm sure you don't want to work with everyone, they have to be ready for a certain level of capability or work.</p><p>Certainly. The way that I see it, a startup is ready for PR when its stakeholders understand the metrics used to measure the success of the PR strategy. This is super critical because if they don’t understand which metrics are used or how to measure them, they're always going to feel like they aren't getting the value they want. Part of my job is to educate and communicate how those metrics are measured in a way that helps them understand the value of PR. Across different stakeholders, those metrics change.</p><p>For instance, I most often talk to marketing executives, and their bottom line is more eyes on the product, more potential for conversions to clients, but then they need to go talk to a board to justify their budgets, and there is a disconnect between the metrics marketing executives are excited about when it comes to PR and how their boards see it. Here, I come in to share, well, let's look at how much it would have cost for you to advertise on the media outlets that published an article where the company was mentioned, they’ll see that dollar amount and understand the ROI.</p><p>So first, we have to align there, and then there has to be a mutual understanding that PR requires collaboration.</p><p>I work as an extension of the marketing teams of the startups that I work with. I embed myself into the startups I work with to know what they're working on and the ins and outs of each company. Sometimes I'm talking to people working on the product, new features of the technology, the C-suite, and their board members, on all these different aspects within that organization. Their insights and consistent communication help me build and implement a comprehensive PR strategy that works effectively.</p><p>Aligning on those two things, the metrics and the understanding that PR, in practice, requires collaboration, are super important, and how I know a start-up is ready to utilize PR.</p><p>Love it!&nbsp; It takes a village sometimes does it not? So, thank you so much for being a guest today. I really enjoyed our time together.</p><p>Thank you so much for having me on.</p>",

      "content": "An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: Preparations for the first human spaceflight to the Moon in more than 50 years took a big step forward this weekend with the rollout of the Artemis II rocket to its launch pad. The rocket reached a top speed of just 1 mph on the four-mile, 12-hour journey from the Vehicle Assembly Building to Launch Complex 39B at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. At the end of its nearly 10-day tour through cislunar space, the Orion capsule on top of the rocket will exceed 25,000 mph as it plunges into the atmosphere to bring its four-person crew back to Earth. \"This is the start of a very long journey,\" said NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman. \"We ended our last human exploration of the moon on Apollo 17.\"\n \n[...] \"We really are ready to go,\" said Wiseman, the Artemis II commander, during Saturday's rollout to the launch pad. \"We were in a sim [in Houston] for about 10 hours yesterday doing our final capstone entry and landing sim. We got in T-38s last night and we flew to the Cape to be here for this momentous occasion.\" The rollout began around sunrise Saturday, with NASA's Space Launch System rocket and Orion capsule riding a mobile launch platform and a diesel-powered crawler transporter along a throughway paved with crushed Alabama river rock. Employees, VIPs, and guests gathered along the crawlerway to watch the 11 million-pound stack inch toward the launch pad. The rollout concluded about an hour after sunset, when the crawler transporter's jacking system lowered the mobile launch platform onto pedestals at Pad 39B.\n \nThe rollout keeps the Artemis II mission on track for liftoff as soon as next month, when NASA has a handful of launch opportunities on February 6, 7, 8, 10, and 11. The big milestone leading up to launch day will be a practice countdown or Wet Dress Rehearsal (WDR), currently slated for around February 2, when NASA's launch team will pump more than 750,000 gallons of super-cold liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen into the rocket. NASA had trouble keeping the cryogenic fluids at the proper temperature, then encountered hydrogen leaks when the launch team first tried to fill the rocket for the unpiloted Artemis I mission in 2022. Engineers implemented the same fixes on Artemis II that they used to finally get over the hump with propellant loading on Artemis I. [...] If the launch does not happen in February, NASA has a slate of backup launch dates in early March.",

Three years later, in 1930, Parnell cut the funnel's stem, like a ribbon at an event, heralding the start of the Pitch Drop Experiment. From then on, the black substance began to flow. At least, that is, in a manner of speaking. At room temperature pitch might look solid, but it is actually a fluid 100 billion times more viscous than water.\n \nIt took eight years for the first droplet to finally hit the beaker below. Then, they dripped at a cadence of once every eight years or so, slowing down only after air conditioning was installed in the building in the 1980s. Today, 96 years after the funnel was cut, only nine drops in total have seeped out. The last was in 2014. Scientists expect another will fall sometime in the 2020s, but they are still waiting. No one has ever actually seen a droplet fall directly, despite all the watchful eyes. The experiment is now live-streamed, but various glitches in the past meant that each fateful moment has slipped us by.",

Unlike some neighboring countries, the incentives are open to all manufacturers with a focus on low- and middle-income households. From a report: \"I cannot see any evidence of this postulated major influx of Chinese car manufacturers in Germany, either in the figures or on the roads -- and that is why we are facing up to the competition and not imposing any restrictions,\" German Environment Minister Carsten Schneider said at a Monday press conference. The decision is a major boon for affordable Chinese automakers like BYD that are steadily gaining ground in the European market, [Bloomberg noted].\n \nGermany's green-light for Chinese EVs stands in stark contrast to other nations' approaches. In the UK, subsidies introduced last year effectively excluded Chinese battery-powered vehicles, while France's so-called social leasing scheme includes similar restrictions. [...] Germany maintains strong diplomatic ties with China. German automakers are among the most significant players in China's automotive industry. Over the past years, China's policies -- including purchase subsidies and purchase tax reductions -- have not excluded models or automakers from specific countries. Whether German automakers like Volkswagen or American automakers like Tesla, all enjoy national-level purchase incentive policies in China on par with domestic automakers.",

      "content": "An anonymous reader quotes a report from TorrentFreak: NVIDIA executives allegedly authorized the use of millions of pirated books from Anna's Archive to fuel its AI training. In an expanded class-action lawsuit that cites internal NVIDIA documents, several book authors claim (PDF) that the trillion-dollar company directly reached out to Anna's Archive, seeking high-speed access to the shadow library data. [...] Last Friday, the authors filed an amended complaint that significantly expands the scope of the lawsuit. In addition to adding more books, authors, and AI models, it also includes broader \"shadow library\" claims and allegations. The authors, including Abdi Nazemian, now cite various internal Nvidia emails and documents, suggesting that the company willingly downloaded millions of copyrighted books. The new complaint alleges that \"competitive pressures drove NVIDIA to piracy,\" which allegedly included collaborating with the controversial Anna's Archive library.\n \nAccording to the amended complaint, a member of Nvidia's data strategy team reached out to Anna's Archive to find out what the pirate library could offer the trillion-dollar company \"Desperate for books, NVIDIA contacted Anna's Archive -- the largest and most brazen of the remaining shadow libraries -- about acquiring its millions of pirated materials and 'including Anna's Archive in pre-training data for our LLMs,'\" the complaint notes. \"Because Anna's Archive charged tens of thousands of dollars for 'high-speed access' to its pirated collections [] NVIDIA sought to find out what \"high-speed access\" to the data would look like.\"\n \nAccording to the complaint, Anna's Archive then warned Nvidia that its library was illegally acquired and maintained. Because the site previously wasted time on other AI companies, the pirate library asked NVIDIA executives if they had internal permission to move forward. This permission was allegedly granted within a week, after which Anna's Archive provided the chip giant with access to its pirated books. \"Within a week of contacting Anna's Archive, and days after being warned by Anna's Archive of the illegal nature of their collections, NVIDIA management gave 'the green light' to proceed with the piracy. Anna's Archive offered NVIDIA millions of pirated copyrighted books.\" The complaint states that Anna's Archive promised to provide NVIDIA with access to roughly 500 terabytes of data. This included millions of books that are usually only accessible through Internet Archive's digital lending system, which itself has been targeted in court. The complaint does not explicitly mention whether NVIDIA ended up paying Anna's Archive for access to the data.\n \nAdditionally, it's worth mentioning that NVIDIA also stands accused of using other pirated sources. In addition to the previously included Books3 database, the new complaint also alleges that the company downloaded books from LibGen, Sci-Hub, and Z-Library. In addition to downloading and using pirated books for its own AI training, the authors allege NVIDIA distributed scripts and tools that allowed its corporate customers to automatically download \"The Pile\", which contains the Books3 pirated dataset.",

Reuters reports: OpenAI's computing capacity rose to 1.9 gigawatts (GW) in 2025 from 0.6 GW in 2024, Friar said in the blog, adding that Microsoft-backed OpenAI's weekly and daily active users figures continue to produce all-time highs. OpenAI last week said it would start showing ads in ChatGPT to some U.S. users, ramping up efforts to generate revenue from the AI chatbot to fund the high costs of developing the technology. Separately, Axios reported on Monday that OpenAI's policy chief Chris Lehane said that the company is \"on track\" to unveil its first device in the second half of 2026.\n \nFriar said OpenAI's platform spans text, images, voice, code and APIs, and the next phase will focus on agents and workflow automation that run continuously, carry context over time, and take action across tools. For 2026, the company will prioritize \"practical adoption,\" particularly in health, science and enterprise, she said. Friar said the company is keeping a \"light\" balance sheet by partnering rather than owning and structuring contracts with flexibility across providers and hardware types.",

In such cases, we decided to preserve the precision of the manual annotation by considering the ambiguous or unclear-context comments as irrelevant to coding weakness. However, as the annotation process was conducted categorically, it may be susceptible to the biases of the annotator. To mitigate this, the comments were independently validated by the third author (Section 4.6.2). Additionally, if the comments are relevant to multiple categories (i.e., receiving high similar scores in multiple categories), they were also annotated and validated multiple times. During the validation of handling scenarios in RQ3 (see Section 4.8), we encountered a few instances of disagreement. We attribute this discrepancy to the limitations inherent in code review data and a potential lack of expertise in the project. We were aware that some weaknesses in the CWE-699 taxonomy are not considered harmful from a security perspective. Thus, we regularly consulted the extended description in CWE-699 to ensure that the security concerns in question can lead to vulnerabilities. We were also aware that several categories in CWE-699 may share similar weaknesses. For example, weaknesses in the Random Number Issues (CWE-1213) category are also listed in the Cryptographic Issues (CWE-310) category. Nevertheless, we only identified three security concerns that shared both coding weaknesses.</p><p>We used an automated text-based approach to facilitate our manual annotation process. The performance of the automated approach can be suboptimal due to the limited vocabulary in the documents. We tried to mitigate this concern by including CWE’s alternate terms that developers might use. It should also be noted that the selection of word-embedding techniques can impact the possibility of finding relevant code review comments. We carefully selected the word-embedding model pre-trained in the software engineering domain to reduce the potential issues. In the manual annotation process, we read only comments that have high similarity scores (i.e., reading and doing manual analysis until reaching the saturation point). It is possible that some of the unread comments may also contain coding weaknesses</p><p>\\\nFor RQ2, we analyzed the alignment of known vulnerabilities and security concerns by observing the distribution of related weaknesses. It is worth noting that CWE assignments for CVE are based on the security expert’s judgment. Therefore, they can be subjective. Additionally, CVE records can be updated. Hence, our analysis is limited by the abstract observations at the time of data collection. For RQ3, we found two PHP pull requests with a long thread of discussions (100-300 comments). Although we were able to locate the identified comments, it is difficult to observe the handling scenarios, i.e., whether the issue was eventually addressed by developers or not. To avoid misinterpretation of the handling process based on these code review activities, we decided to drop these two pull requests from the results of our RQ3. We tried to minimize this problem by manually checking the final code change and the developer’s reactions. However, there is no effective solution to completely mitigate this issue. For transparency, we released the dataset used in this study in our supplementary materials.</p><p>\\\nFinally, the quality of the studied datasets can affect the validity of the results. Although the studied projects primarily conduct code reviews on GitHub, we cannot guarantee that our datasets include every code review in each project because some code reviews may not be documented.</p><p>While increasing the number of studied projects may strengthen the generalizability of the findings, expanding the studied subjects is not a trivial task. This is because there are a limited number of projects that fit our selection criteria e.g., the size of projects (the small projects may not have sufficient security discussion (Di Biase et al., 2016)), the past vulnerabilities (for comparing the alignment of past vulnerabilities), the availability of code review data, and the mandatory code review policy. Furthermore, Nagappan et al. (2013) also suggested that indiscriminately increasing the sample size in software engineering study may not necessarily improve the generalizability. During the annotation process, we observed that both studied projects have several special traits due to a different application domain. The findings based on these two projects may include aspects that may not apply to other software projects. Thus, the analysis of the studied dataset does not allow us to draw conclusions for all open-source projects. Nevertheless, we carefully selected two distinct projects for this study that differ in nature and potential security issues. PHP is a general-purpose scripting language that may face a wide range of varying levels of security threats depending on its usage. OpenSSL is a library with a primary focus on security. Hence, we believe that security issues present in both of these projects are also relevant to other software projects within similar application domains.</p><p>\\\nFurther studies are required to confirm this hypothesis. As our findings are based on the snapshot of code review datasets until June 2022, the recency of the data can be a concern. To mitigate this issue, we analyzed the coding weaknesses in the newly collected code review datasets between June 2023 and February 2024 from both projects, which comprise 6,365 code review comments and 1,427 pull requests in total. We found no major difference in the prevalence of coding weakness discussion between the two datasets. In particular, nine categories remain in the top 10 categories of OpenSSL, and six categories remain in the top 10 categories of PHP. 65 However, we cannot guarantee whether the results will be sustained in future code reviews.</p><p>:::info\nThis paper is  under CC by 4.0 Deed (Attribution 4.0 International) license.</p>",

This finding supports our intuition that the reviewers tend to focus on issues in source code. Therefore, it is more natural for the reviewers to identify coding weaknesses than security issues. This implication aligns with the previous work (Gon¸calves et al., 2022) that the cognitive load required for code reviews is lower if the reviewers already have the relevant knowledge. Indeed, our RQ1 shows that the raised security concerns in code reviews of OpenSSL and PHP cover nearly 90% of the CWE-699 weakness types (i.e., 35 out of 40 categories, see Table 10). This confirms our presumption that a variety of coding weaknesses can be raised by reviewers during the code review process. As shown in the motivating examples in Section 3, such coding weaknesses can lead to security issues. It can be implied that the coding weaknesses that may introduce security issues can potentially be identified during the code review process although the weaknesses did not yet explicitly expose the vulnerable outcomes (Braz et al., 2021). Our manual observations from RQ1 also show that the code changes may potentially be vulnerable if the author did not address the raised security concerns. For instance, Figure 7 shows that vulnerabilities such as CVE-2008-498963 and CVE-2012-582164 could be introduced into the code if the Improper Certificate Validation coding weakness (CWE-295) under the Authentication Errors category (CWE-1211) was not raised by a reviewer.</p><p>\\\nRecommendation: As we found that coding weaknesses can be identified in code reviews, our findings suggest that practitioners and/or other software projects could adopt the coding weaknesses taxonomy (i.e., CWE-699) to assist code reviews. A list of coding weaknesses should help the team increase the awareness of the potential problems that can lead to security issues without requiring deep security knowledge. A recent controlled experiment of Braz et al. (2022) has shown that a code review checklist could help reviewers better find security issues. Hence, one of the possible ways to adopt the coding weaknesses taxonomy for code reviews is to incorporate it into a code review checklist. Future work should investigate the effectiveness and practicality of using coding weaknesses as a code review checklist for identifying and mitigating security issues during the code review process. Moreover, as coding weakness are more frequently discussed than the security issue, coding weakness can also be an effective proxy for understanding secure code review practices</p><p>\\\n<strong>2) Coding weaknesses related to the known vulnerabilities of the systems are not frequently discussed in code reviews.</strong> Our RQ2 shows that some types of coding weaknesses were less frequently discussed compared to the known vulnerabilities (see Figure 10). In particular, we found that Memory Buffer Errors (CWE-1218) and Resource Management Errors (CWE-399) are the least frequently discussed coding weaknesses in OpenSSL and PHP (4%-9%), albeit the high percentages of known vulnerabilities (17%-29%). Furthermore, our motivating examples in Section 3 highlighted that such coding weaknesses can lead to a serious vulnerability. For example, OpenSSL’s Heartbleed is a known vulnerability related to weakness Out-of-bounds Read (CWE125) which is a type of memory buffer error.</p><p>\\\nThese coding weaknesses were rarely discussed maybe because they are generic and easy to be overlooked. Hence, the reviewers may have failed to notice them. To mitigate this problem, the reviewers should be aware of these latent coding weaknesses in order to properly prioritize them in the code reviews. In addition to the known vulnerabilities, our RQ1 indicates that the security concerns in code reviews can vary from project to project. Particularly, OpenSSL reviewers were concerned about direct security threats (e.g., Authentication Errors (CWE-1211 and Random Number Issues (CWE-1213)), while PHP reviewers were more concerned about data controlling (e.g., Type Errors (CWE-136)). As OpenSSL is an encryption library for secure communication and PHP is a programming language, it can be implied that the application domain may correlate with the coding weaknesses that reviewers can raise. This finding also supports our results that coding weaknesses such as User-interface Security Issues (CWE-355) and Encapsulation Issues (CWE-1227) were neither found in our results nor appear in the known vulnerabilities because they are less related to the application domains of the studied projects.</p><p>\\\n: Our findings suggest that it is essential to identify the specific coding weaknesses that are significant, highly prone to introduce security issues, and relevant to the application domain of the projects. Thus, rather than reviewing all types of coding weaknesses, a selected set of coding weaknesses can be prioritized for effective code reviews. Prioritization of coding weaknesses during code reviews can be based on known vulnerabilities and the unique concerns of the projects that were raised in the past. Future work can investigate a systematic approach for identifying and prioritizing the types of important coding weaknesses for individual projects in this context.</p><p>\\\n<strong>3) Not all the raised security concerns were addressed within the same code review process.</strong> The security concern handling scenarios identified in our RQ3 reveal a shortcoming in the code review process. Our results show that approximately a third of the security concerns from coding weaknesses (30%-36%, see C2 in Table 11) were acknowledged without fixes in the process. We observed that developers promised to fix some of the acknowledged concerns in the new independent code changes (10%-18%), but some concerns were left without fixing due to disagreement about the proper solution (18%-20%). Nevertheless, approximately half of the unresolved concerns (6%-9%) were eventually merged. This result implies a possible risk that security issues can slip through the code review process into the software product. The incomplete code reviews or unclean code changes that contain security concerns related to coding weaknesses should be held from merging until all security concerns are resolved. Otherwise, the remaining coding weaknesses in code changes can become security issues in the future.</p><p>\\\nThis implication is consistent with the findings of the prior work which reported that relentless and inconclusive discussion could impact the code review quality (Kononenko et al., 2015), and the incomplete code reviews and the unsuccessfully fixed can negatively affect the developer’s contribution (Gerosa et al., 2021). Recommendation: Code reviews with security concerns should be escalated if the final resolutions cannot be agreed upon before merging. Security experts or experienced developers should be included in such code reviews to investigate complex security concerns. In addition, the mechanisms to notify the reviewers of the incomplete code reviews or the insufficiently addressed security concerns could reduce the risk that security issues will slip through the code review process into the software product. Our suggestion aligns with Wessel et al. (2020) who reported that the adoption of an automated mechanism such as code review bots can increase the number of merged pull requests, and, hence, reduce the number of abandoned code reviews. Kudrjavets et al. (2022) also observed that the automated bots can remind the developers of the pending tasks in the code review process without inciting negative feelings. Hence, future work should investigate an approach to identify incomplete code reviews or the insufficiently addressed security concerns to help developers increase awareness.</p><p>:::info\nThis paper is  under CC by 4.0 Deed (Attribution 4.0 International) license.</p>",

From the 135K code review comments in the dataset, we manually read 3,570 OpenSSL and 2,576 PHP comments with the highest cosine similarity scores until reaching the saturation point (i.e., 50 consecutive irrelevant comments). As described in Section 4.6.2, in the first iteration we removed irrelevant comments (e.g., related to bookkeeping and code styling), resulting in 232 and 148 comments. Subsequently, the first and the third author independently determined whether the comments raised legitimate security concerns and could be classified into one of the coding weakness categories, resulting in 202 and 128 comments. To simplify the results, we aggregated comments within the same pull request that were classified into the identical coding weakness category into singular security concern. In total, we identified 188 security concerns from 202 comments in 164 pull requests in OpenSSL and 123 security concerns from 128 comments in 100</p><p>pull requests in PHP. Note that one pull request can have multiple concerns with different coding weakness categories. The manual annotation process by the first and the third author achieved the inter-rater agreement (Cohen, 1960) κ = 0.70 and κ = 0.84 for OpenSSL and PHP, which can be interpreted (McHugh, 2012) as substantial (0.61 ≥ |κ| ≥ 0.81) and almost perfect (|κ| &gt; 0.81), respectively. Table 10 shows the number of identified security concerns across the 40 coding weakness categories of CWE-699. The numbers in parentheses indicate the CWE category number of the coding weakness. We found that in OpenSSL and PHP, identified security concerns were related to 35 out of 40 coding weakness categories of CWE-699, suggesting that diverse types of coding weaknesses can be discovered during the code review process. The bold text in Table 10 highlights the top ten coding weaknesses that were frequently raised in each project and the ‡ symbol indicates the concerns that were frequently raised in both OpenSSL and PHP. We found that six coding weaknesses, i.e., Authentication Errors (CWE-1211), API / Function Errors (CWE-1228), Privilege Issues (CWE-265), Behavioral Problems (CWE-438), Cryptographic Issues (CWE-310) and Random Number Issues (CWE1213), were among the top ten concerns in both OpenSSL and PHP. Additionally, we observe that several coding weaknesses were frequently raised in a particular project. This may suggest that while reviewers in OpenSSL and PHP share a set of common concerns, they can have a specific focus on particular security aspects as well. Below, we present common security concerns across both projects and projectspecific security concerns.</p><p>\\\n<strong>Common security concerns in OpenSSL and PHP:</strong> The first two common security concerns are related to users and rights, i.e., Authentication Errors (CWE-1211) and Privilege Issues (CWE-265) coding weaknesses. Authentication Errors (CWE-1211) are related to the failure to properly verify the identification of the rightful actors who can gain access to the system. For example, as shown in Figure 7, we observed that a reviewer noticed that the program does not verify whether the certificate is trusted or not: ”[…]The certificate in question is now detached from its provenance, we don’t know whether it came from the trust store, or from the peer-supplied untrusted chain![…] ”.44 Privilege Issues (CWE-265) are related to the improper management of critical privileges assigned to users or objects. For example, a reviewer mentioned that the developer did not use the correct approach to verify that the user has sufficient privileges to execute a script.45</p><p>Another two common security concerns are related to coding weaknesses about the functionality of the system, i.e., API/Function Errors (CWE-1228) and Behavioral Problems (CWE-438). API/Function Errors (CWE-1228) covers the use of dangerous functions or the exposing of the functions that allow unwanted actors to execute restricted actions. For example, as shown in Figure 8, we observed that  a reviewer commented that assigning the result of the format string function to the same input variable can be potentially harmful: ”[…]Using the same variable as both input and output for spprintf looks dangerous. Are you sure it is safe? ”.46 Behavioral Problems (CWE-438) refer to code that may cause unexpected behavior in the software system. For example, a reviewer noticed that the code can look for the required files in incorrect directories if the program is compiled in different environments.4</p><p>Concerns related to the cryptographic process, i.e., Cryptographic Issues (CWE310) and Random Number Issues (CWE-1213), were also common in both OpenSSL and PHP. Cryptographic Issues (CWE-310) covers the proper use of encryption algorithms and cryptographic keys to ensure system and data security. For instance, as shown in Figure 9, a developer responded to a reviewer’s suggestion that the lengths of the cryptographic keys can be dynamic and cannot be restricted to a fixed value by saying ”[…]HMAC keys can be variable length so SHA256 DIGEST LENGTH doesn’t seem like the right answer here”.48 Random Number Issues (CWE-1213) account for the process of obtaining sufficient ran</p><p>Including the six common coding weaknesses, there are 21 types of coding weaknesses that were raised in both projects. In particular, security concerns related to coding weaknesses in category Audit/Logging Errors (CWE-1210), Information Management Errors (CWE-199), Concurrency Issues (CWE-557), Memory Buffer Errors (CWE-1218), Business Logic Errors (CWE-840), and Resource Locking Problems (CWE-411) are among the top 20 categories in both projects. Security concerns in these categories may also be considered common concerns to some extent. The previous code review works (Alfadel et al., 2023; Paul et al., 2021b; Di Biase et al., 2016; Bosu et al., 2014; Edmundson et al., 2013) reported that reviewers can identify security issues in various degrees based on the different application domains and the programming languages. However, the studied security issues are frequently bounded by well-known vulnerabilities that are associated with security consequences such as SQL Injection, XSS, or Denial of service. Our results further reveal that reviewers can commonly discuss more extensive coding weaknesses that can introduce those vulnerabilities from the development perspective. For example, the discussion regarding API / Function Errors (CWE-1228), Behavioral Problems (CWE-438), Cryptographic Issues (CWE-310), and Random Number Issues (CWE-1213) have not been previously reported.</p><p><strong>Project-specific security concerns:</strong> In addition to common security concerns, understanding project-specific concerns would allow us to gain better insight into the secure code review practices in each project. We observed that in OpenSSL, a library that provides encryption functionalities to its dependent systems, reviewers seem to focus on preventing direct security threats that are related to encryption, e.g., Key Management Errors (CWE-255) and Communication Channel Errors (CWE-417). For example, a reviewer discussed the causes of timing-attack, which can reveal the type of cryptographic key used in secure communication with the attacker.50 On the other hand, in PHP, a programming language for web applications, reviewers rather focus on security related to data controlling, e.g., Data Validation Issues (CWE-1215) and the versatility of language, e.g., Pointer Issues (CWE-465) and Type Errors (CWE-136). Also, it seems that PHP reviewers are concerned with Documentation Issues (CWE-1225), which are rarely recognized in a security context (Alfadel et al., 2023). For example, a developer explained to a reviewer that a function should not declare to accept any type of parameters if it intends to raise TypeError when the user inputs the parameters of incorrect types, e.g., to avoid Denial of Service vulnerability.51 In another case, a reviewer noticed that a function does not implement a randomization algorithm that it claims to use in the document.52 These types of security concerns highlight the importance of input management and documentation in PHP.</p><p>\\\nLastly, for the coding weakness types that were rarely raised, it may be because these issues are irrelevant to the application domains of the systems. We did not observe any concerns related to Lockout Mechanism Errors (CWE-1216), as it can cause an overly restrictive authentication policy, which is not applicable in both projects. Similarly, no concerns related to User Interface Security Issues (CWE355) were found, as OpenSSL and PHP do not have an elaborate user interface. Therefore, it is less likely that reviewers would raise this type of concern.</p><p><strong>RQ2: How aligned are the raised security concerns and known vulnerabilities?</strong> Based on the mapping of known vulnerabilities to related coding weaknesses, as explained in Section 4.7, we find that the known vulnerabilities of OpenSSL and PHP during the studied period are related to 16 coding weakness categories. We answer this question by comparing the percentages of the known vulnerabilities and the raised security concerns that we found in RQ1 (Table 10).</p><p>Figure 10 shows that nine coding weakness categories in OpenSSL and six coding weakness categories in PHP have a high proportion of known vulnerabilities in the past, but are less frequently discussed in code reviews. For instance, the top two coding weakness categories that have the highest proportion of known vulnerabilities are Memory Buffer Errors (CWE-1218; 21% in OpenSSL and 29% in PHP) and Resource Management Errors (CWE-399; 21% in OpenSSL and 17% in PHP). However, these two coding weakness categories have a relatively low proportion of security concerns raised in the code reviews (4% - 9%). Similarly, 6% - 12% of the known vulnerabilities are related to Business Logic Errors (CWE840), File Handling Errors (CWE-1219), and Pointer Issues (CWE-465) which were rarely discussed in the code review (only 1% - 7% of the security concerns).</p><p>\\\nMoreover, we observe that OpenSSL has three coding weaknesses that are lessfrequently discussed in code reviews i.e., Information Management Errors (CWE199) (17% of known vulnerabilities; 3% of security concerns), Cryptographic Issues (CWE-310) (7% of known vulnerabilities; 4% of security concerns), and Data Neutralization Issues (CWE-137) (2% of known vulnerabilities; 0% of security concerns). In particular, the lower number of security concerns about Data Neutralization Issues align with the observation of Braz et al. (2021) that developers may not be aware of the consequences of improper input validation, as well as the case of Heartbleed as shown in Figure 1. On the other hand, coding weaknesses in six categories in both OpenSSL and PHP were more frequently discussed than the known vulnerabilities. Coding weaknesses related to Authentication Errors (CWE-1211), String Errors (CWE-133), Type Errors (CWE-136), Concurrency Issues (CWE-557), Data Processing Errors (CWE-19), and Behavioral Problems (CWE-438) which occurred in 4% of known vulnerabilities in OpenSSL and PHP were discussed by 22%-23% of security concerns in both projects. Despite the low frequency of the security concerns compared to the known vulnerabilities, all of the coding weakness categories of the known vulnerabilities, except for Numeric Errors (CWE-189) were discussed in the code review as shown in Figure 10. This finding suggests that reviewers may be able to identify these kinds of coding weakness, but require more attention.  <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-z3734td.png\" alt=\"\"></p><p><strong>C2. Acknowledged (30% in OpenSSL; 36% in PHP):</strong> For a third of the security concerns raised, we observed that security concerns were acknowledged by the developer or other reviewers but were not fixed in the same pull request. We observed that the concerns were not fixed in the same pull request because they will be fixed elsewhere (C2.1; 10% for OpenSSL and 18% for PHP) or due to an unresolved discussion (C2.2; 20% for OpenSSL and 18% for PHP). In particular, for the fix-elsewhere scenario (C2.1), the reviewers and developers discussed the raised concern and agreed that the necessary fixes should be made in new pull requests. We find that around half (55%) of the security concerns in this scenario were eventually merged in both projects ( 11 20 for OpenSSL and 12 22 for PHP). For example, a reviewer noticed the use of stale pointer and suggested a fix. The developer then replied, ”[…] Ok. I’ll prepare a pull request (but not right away) and request your review.”.56 However, it is not possible to confirm whether all security concerns in the C2.1 scenario were later fixed as promised. For the unresolved discussion scenario (C2.2), the developers and reviewers cannot find an agreeable direction to address the concern. The discussions in this scenario tend to be more rambling and involve several sub-concerns, hindering</p><p>reviewers from reaching an agreeable resolution. This could be due to different understandings and perspectives between reviewers. For example, reviewers and developers discussed the resolution while aiming to maintain compliance with security standards. However, due to the equivocal interpretation of the standards, the discussion cannot reach an agreeable resolution.57 Another example is that a reviewer raised a concern about the certificate authentication process and requested a modification.58</p><p>\\\nThe other reviewers, including the developer, agreed that the concern was valid but expressed multiple opinions on the solutions. The pull request with the concern was eventually merged without any changes. Indeed, we found that 16 pull requests in OpenSSL and 5 pull requests in PHP which contain 16 ( 16 36 = 44% for OpenSSL) and 7 ( 7 22 = 31% for PHP) concerns in C2.2 were eventually merged without any evidence that the concerns were addressed. It should be noted that the reviewer’s workload may affect the code review outcomes. We found that a significant portion of reviewers (54% in OpenSSL and 17% in PHP) engaged in unresolved discussions (C2.2) are classified as highworkload reviewers i.e., reviewed over 100 pull requests in each respective project. We hypothesize that workload, characterized by the volume of code reviews, as discussed in prior research (Ruangwan et al., 2019), could influence the quality of code review process. However, future work can be conducted to further investigate this phenomenon.</p><p>\\\n<strong>C3. Dismissed (15% in OpenSSL; 26% in PHP):</strong> In this scenario, the developer and reviewers discussed the security concerns raised, and the security concerns were dismissed. We observed that the discussions eventually concluded that the concern was a false concern (C3.1; 13% for OpenSSL and 7% for PHP) or acceptable by design choice (C3.2; 24% for OpenSSL and 7% for PHP). Specifically, the false concern scenario (C3.1) is related to cases in which developers or other reviewers offered an explanation to invalidate the security concerns. For example, a reviewer raised a concern about leaking sensitive data.59 Then, the developer replied to the comment to explain that the implementation is not leaking sensitive data ”[…] %s given part shouldn’t be added for values (but only for types) since they might contain sensitive data”, which was agreed by the reviewer. The design choice scenario (C3.2) refers to cases where security concerns were dismissed by other factors such as performance trade-off, maintainability, or system design (Zanaty et al., 2018). For example, a developer responded that a change in the data-neutralizing process was a valid concern as raised by the reviewer; however, it did not affect the application logic.60 The reviewer finally agreed and approved the pull request. We also observed that 20 pull requests in OpenSSL and 4 pull requests in PHP which contain 21 ( 21 24 = 88% for OpenSSL) and 4 ( 4 8 = 78% for PHP) concerns in scenario C3.2 were eventually merged.</p><p>\\\n<strong>C4. Unresponded (3% in OpenSSL; 9% in PHP):</strong> There were a few cases where security concerns did not receive any responses nor activities logged in the pull request. This was in part due to out-of-context (C4.1; 2% for PHP) or unknown &amp; inactivity (C4.2; 3% for OpenSSL and 7% for PHP). The out-of context scenario (C4.1) refers to cases where security concerns drift away from the current discussion or the goal of the code changes. For example, a reviewer raised a security concern about insufficient check of input and instantly volunteered to create a new change request that fixes the problem, however, the developer and other reviewers did not respond to the concern.61 The unknown &amp; inactivity scenario (C4.2) refers to cases where security concerns were simply disregarded without a clear reason. For example, a reviewer remarked suspicious use of pointer but the developer did not respond and the pull request was eventually rejected.</p><p>:::info\nThis paper is  under CC by 4.0 Deed (Attribution 4.0 International) license.</p>",

      "content": "An anonymous reader quotes a report from the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF): Lawmakers in Washington are once again focusing on kids, screens, and mental health. But according to Congress, Big Tech is somehow both the problem and the solution. The Senate Commerce Committee held a hearing [Friday] on \"examining the effect of technology on America's youth.\" Witnesses warned about \"addictive\" online content, mental health, and kids spending too much time buried in screen. At the center of the debate is a bill from Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Brian Schatz (D-HI) called the Kids Off Social Media Act (KOSMA), which they say will protect children and \"empower parents.\"\n \nThat's a reasonable goal, especially at a time when many parents feel overwhelmed and nervous about how much time their kids spend on screens. But while the bill's press release contains soothing language, KOSMA doesn't actually give parents more control. Instead of respecting how most parents guide their kids towards healthy and educational content, KOSMA hands the control panel to Big Tech. That's right -- this bill would take power away from parents, and hand it over to the companies that lawmakers say are the problem. [...] This bill doesn't just set an age rule. It creates a legal duty for platforms to police families. Section 103(b) of the bill is blunt: if a platform knows a user is under 13, it \"shall terminate any existing account or profile\" belonging to that user. And \"knows\" doesn't just mean someone admits their age. The bill defines knowledge to include what is \"fairly implied on the basis of objective circumstances\" -- in other words, what a reasonable person would conclude from how the account is being used. The reality of how services would comply with KOSMA is clear: rather than risk liability for how they should have known a user was under 13, they will require all users to prove their age to ensure that they block anyone under 13.\n \nKOSMA contains no exceptions for parental consent, for family accounts, or for educational or supervised use. The vast majority of people policed by this bill won't be kids sneaking around -- it will be minors who are following their parents' guidance, and the parents themselves. Imagine a child using their parent's YouTube account to watch science videos about how a volcano works. If they were to leave a comment saying, \"Cool video -- I'll show this to my 6th grade teacher!\" and YouTube becomes aware of the comment, the platform now has clear signals that a child is using that account. It doesn't matter whether the parent gave permission. Under KOSMA, the company is legally required to act. To avoid violating KOSMA, it would likely lock, suspend, or terminate the account, or demand proof it belongs to an adult. That proof would likely mean asking for a scan of a government ID, biometric data, or some other form of intrusive verification, all to keep what is essentially a \"family\" account from being shut down.\n \nViolations of KOSMA are enforced by the FTC and state attorneys general. That's more than enough legal risk to make platforms err on the side of cutting people off. Platforms have no way to remove \"just the kid\" from a shared account. Their tools are blunt: freeze it, verify it, or delete it. Which means that even when a parent has explicitly approved and supervised their child's use, KOSMA forces Big Tech to override that family decision. [...] These companies don't know your family or your rules. They only know what their algorithms infer. Under KOSMA, those inferences carry the force of law. Rather than parents or teachers, decisions about who can be online, and for what purpose, will be made by corporate compliance teams and automated detection systems.",

The goal of the first preliminary analysis (PA1) is to examine whether reviewers tend to raise coding weaknesses related to security issues more frequently than explicitly discussing the vulnerabilities. The second analysis (PA2) aims to preliminarily evaluate the effectiveness of our semi-automated approach (see Section 4.6.1) to calculate semantic similarity scores for the code comments that contain coding weaknesses. Dataset: We conducted the two preliminary analyses based on a sample dataset. We randomly sampled 400 code review comments from each of the studied projects (i.e., OpenSSL and PHP). This sample size should allow us to generalize conclusions with a confidence level of 95% and a confidence interval of 5% (Triola, 2009).</p><p>\\\n<em>5.1 PA1: Prevalence of Coding Weakness Comments</em></p><p>The motivating examples in Section 3 show that coding weaknesses can lead to security issues. Since code review focuses on identifying and mitigating issues in source code (M¨antyl¨a and Lassenius, 2009; Bacchelli and Bird, 2013), it is possible that code review may be able to identify such coding weaknesses. To confirm this, we assess the degree to which the coding weaknesses are discussed in code reviews. In particular, we analyze whether reviewers more frequently discussed coding weaknesses than vulnerabilities.</p><p>From the sampled dataset, we manually classified code review comments into three groups: 1) comments that mentioned a coding weakness, 2) comments that explicitly mentioned a vulnerability, and 3) other comments that are not related to coding weaknesses and vulnerabilities. We consider that a code review comment mentioned a coding weakness when it is related to coding weaknesses listed in the CWE-699. A code review comment is considered as mentioning a vulnerability when it is related to the types of exploitable vulnerabilities obtained from prior studies (Di Biase et al., 2016; Paul et al., 2021b) i.e., Race Condition, Buffer and Integer Overflow, Improper Access, Cross Site-Scripting (XSS) and CrossSite Request Forgery (CSRF), Denial of Service (DoS) and Crash, Information Leakage, Command and SQL Injection, Format String, Encryption, and common vulnerability keywords such as attack, bypass, back-door, breach, trojan, spyware, virus, ransom, malware, worm, and sniffer. Note that one code review comment can be classified into multiple categories. For example, a comment ’[..] we ensure that when the ‘while‘ loop ends, there are always at least 2 more slots available in the output buffer without overrunning it [..]’41 is related to a vulnerability (i.e., buffer overflow) as well as a coding weakness (Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size (CWE-131)). Hence, this comment is classified as mentioning vulnerability and coding weakness.</p><p>Our preliminary result shows that coding weaknesses were raised more often than vulnerabilities during the code review. Table 6 shows the number of code review comments that mentioned a coding weakness, a vulnerability, and others. From 400 sampled code review comments for each studied project, we identified 67 comments related to coding weaknesses and 2 comments related to vulnerabilities in PHP; and 84 comments related to coding weaknesses and 4 comments related to vulnerabilities in OpenSSL. The amount of code review comments that mentioned vulnerabilities align with the findings of Di Biase et al. (2016) who found that 1% of the code review comments identified vulnerabilities. Table 6 shows that the number of comments that mentioned a coding weakness is 21 - 33.5 times higher than the number of comments that mentioned a vulnerability. In addition, we observed that reviewers sometimes point out a potential</p><p><em>Preliminary Evaluation of our Security Concern Identification Approach</em></p><p>Since we cannot manually identify code review comments that contain coding weaknesses in the entire code review comment dataset (i.e., 135K comments; see Table 2), we opt to use a semi-automated approach to identify comments, as explained in Section 4.6. In particular, we measure the cosine similarity score of each code review comment and the descriptions of coding weakness categories and we manually validate the comments with high cosine similarity scores until reaching the saturation point, i.e., 50 consecutive comments are identified as generic or irrelevant comments. In this work, we explore two well-known vector representation techniques (i.e., TF-IDF and word embedding) when measuring cosine similarity. We did not use the keyword search like prior works (Bosu et al., 2014; Paul et al., 2021a,b) because their pre-defined keyword lists are limited and may not cover all coding weaknesses. Hence, we set out this preliminary analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach compared to the keyword search and examine which vector representation can produce the similarity scores that better distinguish the code review comments that contain coding weaknesses from the irrelevant code review comments.</p><p>We conducted our preliminary evaluation based on the sampled dataset and our manual classification in PA1. We considered the comments that mentioned coding weakness as coding weakness comments group, and the other comments as noncoding weakness comments group. We pre-processed code review comments in the sampled dataset and the combined descriptions of coding weaknesses in all CWE699 categories with the method described in Section 4.6.1. Then, we generated TFIDF and word embedding vectors of the code review comments and the combined descriptions. Finally, we calculated the similarity score between the vectors. To measure the effectiveness of our approach, we adopted the effort-aware evaluation concept (Kamei et al., 2013; Verma et al., 2016). We measured top</p><p>k precision, recall, and F1-score where k is the number of comments with the highest similarity scores. While the value of k approximates the effort required for our manual validation, the top-k precision shows the proportion of coding weakness security comments in the top-k over the non-coding weakness comments; the topk recall shows the percentage of coding weakness security comments that can be identified at the top-k; and the top-k F1-score shows the single score that represent both top-k precision and top-k recall. For the keyword search, we measured the precision, recall, F1-score and of the code review comments that were identified by a set of vulnerability keywords from previous secure code review studies (Bosu et al., 2014; Paul et al., 2021a,b). To evaluate the two vector representation techniques, we examine which technique produces similarity scores for coding weakness comments higher than the scores for non-coding weakness comments. Thus, we used the one-sided MannWhitney-Wilcoxon test to examine the statistical difference in the similarity scores between the two groups of code review comments. We also used Cliff’s |δ| effect size to estimate the magnitude of the difference in scores from each group.</p><p>As shown in Table 7, we found that our approach with word embedding vectors achieved the highest top-k F1-score in OpenSSL and PHP for all k ∈ (20, 40, 60, 80, 100) with the top-k F1-score of 0.16 - 0.58, while our approach with TF-IDF achieved the top-k F1-score of 0.14 - 0.47. Table 7 also shows that our approach achieves higher F1-score than the keyword search. The keyword search retrieved 16 and 13 comments that contain one of the vulnerability keywords, which achieves an F1-score of 0.28 for OpenSSL and 0.25 for PHP. Moreover, we observe that the keyword search did not identify some types of coding weaknesses that can introduce vulnerability such as Pointer Issues (CWE-465). For example, the keyword approach could not identify a comment “The object can’t be referenced after free obj, only dtor obj“ 43 which is related to the ‘NULL Pointer Dereference‘ weakness (CWE-476).</p><p>\\\nThis result shows that our approach using cosine similarity can identify more coding weakness comments than the keyword search. For the performance of similarity score calculation, Table 8 shows the results of the one-sided Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon test and Cliff’s |δ| effect size between the similarity scores of the coding weakness comments and the non-coding weakness comments. We found that similarity scores of coding weakness security comments are significantly higher than non-coding weakness security comments (p-value &lt; 0.05) when using TF-IDF and word embedding vectors. In addition, we found that the difference in the similarity scores from the word embedding vectors has a large effect size (|δ| ≥ 0.474 (Romano et al., 2006)) for both OpenSSL and PHP, while the difference in the similarity scores from TF-IDF vector has a large effect size for OpenSSL and a medium effect size for PHP. This suggests that the similarity scores based on the word embedding vectors can better differentiate coding weakness comments from their counterparts than the similarity scores based on the TF-IDF vectors. This finding is consistent with the top-k precision, recall and F1-scores shown in Table 7, i.e., at the same k value, using word embedding vectors achieves a higher score than using TF-IDF vectors.</p><p>Our preliminary evaluation shows that our approach with the word embedding technique 1) achieves a higher recall than the TF-IDF technique and the keyword search and 2) can better distinguish the coding weakness comments. Therefore, in this study, we used the word embedding technique to calculate the similarity scores to help us manually identify the coding weakness comments in the remaining dataset.</p><p>:::info\nThis paper is  under CC by 4.0 Deed (Attribution 4.0 International) license.</p>",

The system records each financial event as a structured ledger entry intended to be replayable and independently verifiable, enabling teams to trace funds movement across complex product flows.</p><p>“Financial systems should behave like accounting systems first,” Birthare said. “If you can’t reconstruct where each dollar originated and where it moved, the platform can’t reliably defend its records under audit.”</p><h2>Engineering for Payment Networks That Don’t Behave Ideally</h2><p>Payment systems introduce edge cases that simplified fintech ledgers often fail to model: incremental authorizations, split captures, asynchronous reversals, delayed chargebacks, and settlement corrections that arrive long after a customer believes a transaction is complete.</p><p>When software assumes ideal sequencing, operational teams may be forced to make manual adjustments creating downstream risk in reporting, compliance, and customer dispute handling.</p><p>Birthare’s architecture was designed to preserve ledger consistency under those conditions. It uses idempotency controls and transactional safeguards to prevent duplicate events from corrupting balances and to reduce reconciliation drift when upstream signals arrive late or in unexpected order.</p><p>The approach draws on patterns from high-scale distributed systems, where fault tolerance and recovery behavior must be engineered into the system from the beginning.</p><h2>From Distributed Infrastructure to Financial Accuracy</h2><p>Before his current fintech role, Birthare worked on high-throughput infrastructure supporting cloud services and speech recognition platforms, where correctness and latency can affect large user populations. He is also listed as an inventor on multiple awarded U.S. patents spanning data scalability, speech recognition optimization, and data processing methods.</p><p>He later worked on blockchain security and fraud analytics at a major U.S. digital asset platform, where detecting high-risk activity depends on data lineage and systems that can operate under adversarial conditions.</p><p>“Security work changes how you think about correctness,” Birthare said. “You stop assuming clean inputs, and you design systems that can recover from ambiguity without corrupting financial state.”</p><h2>Risk Systems Built to Explain Decisions</h2><p>Regulators are also paying closer attention to how fintech lenders make credit decisions, including whether outcomes can be explained and audited. In many organizations, machine-learning models and rule engines have been deployed faster than the governance frameworks required to document decision logic.</p><p>Birthare led the design of a risk framework combining rule-based decisioning with machine-learning enrichment, built to preserve decision context and rationale. Each decision stores the inputs and logic used at the time, enabling retrospective review and auditability across multiple product types as policy requirements evolve.</p><p>“Risk systems must be explainable by design,” Birthare said. “Otherwise, teams are forced to reverse-engineer decisions later and that rarely stands up under scrutiny.”</p><h2>A Shift in Fintech Engineering Priorities</h2><p>As fintech matures, the industry’s priorities are shifting. Speed and growth remain important, but durability, auditability, and operational transparency are becoming core requirements—especially for platforms handling regulated financial activity.</p><p>Industry experts increasingly view financial infrastructure not as an application layer but as a long-term record system whose outputs may need to be defended years later.</p><p>“Technology moves quickly,” Birthare said. “But financial records have a long life. Engineering teams have to build for that timeline.”</p>",

According to a machine-translated version of quotes reported by Inside, Shih said, \"Asus will no longer add new mobile phone models in the future.\" \n\nShih said Asus will continue to support existing smartphone users with software updates and warranty assistance. This matches a previous report from DigiTimes earlier this month that said Asus wouldn't introduce new models in 2026. The big question is whether that means stepping back altogether or a temporary pause. In his speech, Shih alluded to the possibility that Asus may return to smartphones, but did not confirm it.",

      "content": "<p>Behind every seamless mobile activation, service upgrade, or network recovery lies a complex provisioning ecosystem operating at massive scale. While customers experience telecom services in seconds, the systems enabling those experiences must reliably execute <strong>hundreds of millions of backend transactions every month</strong>, often across highly distributed and failure-prone environments.</p><p>As telecom networks expand to support 5G, satellite connectivity, IoT, and real-time digital services, provisioning platforms have emerged as one of the industry’s most critical—and least visible—challenges.</p><p>This transformation was led by , a Principal Engineer and Systems Architect widely recognized for architecting and modernizing <strong>mission-critical telecom platforms that operate at national scale</strong>, where reliability, consistency, and automation are non-negotiable. With nearly two decades of experience in distributed systems and network architecture, Cyril has played a critical role in redefining how provisioning infrastructure supports <strong>millions of users and over 100 million monthly network transactions</strong> with near-zero downtime.</p><h2>The Problem: Legacy Provisioning Systems Cannot Handle Modern Scale</h2><p>Telecom provisioning systems are responsible for activating services, updating subscriber profiles, enabling features, and synchronizing configurations across dozens of backend platforms. Many of these systems were originally built for an earlier era—when traffic patterns were predictable, systems were centralized, and failures were resolved manually.</p><p>Those assumptions no longer hold.</p><p><strong>Modern telecom environments operate with:</strong></p><ul><li>Massive transaction volumes driven by nationwide networks</li><li>Sudden traffic spikes during launches, migrations, outages, and disaster events</li><li>Distributed, cloud-native, multi-region deployments</li><li>Tight coupling across core network, policy, charging, messaging, and edge platforms</li></ul><p>At this scale, traditional provisioning architectures—often synchronous, manually operated, and active-standby—become fragile. Even minor downstream degradation can cascade into widespread customer impact.</p><p><strong>When provisioning systems fail, the effects are immediate:</strong></p><ul><li>Service activations stall or partially complete</li><li>Customer features behave inconsistently</li><li>Customer-care calls surge</li><li>Manual recovery efforts overwhelm operations teams</li><li>Revenue leakage and SLA violations increase</li></ul><p>Worse, many legacy systems unintentionally . Retry storms, backlog growth, and slow recovery cycles turn small issues into large-scale incidents.</p><p>In platforms processing tens or hundreds of millions of transactions monthly, a failure rate of just a fraction of a percent can translate into <strong>hundreds of thousands of customer-impacting events</strong>.</p><p>As networks evolve toward 5G-Advanced, satellite-to-cell connectivity, and edge computing, the provisioning layer increasingly becomes the limiting factor in reliability and scalability.</p><h2>The Solution: Re-Architecting Provisioning as a Self-Healing Distributed System</h2><p>Solving this problem required more than incremental tuning. It demanded a fundamental architectural shift—treating provisioning not as a linear workflow, but as a <strong>resilient, event-driven distributed system</strong>.</p><p>Under Henry Cyril’s architectural leadership, the platform was redesigned around several core principles:</p><p><strong>Deterministic Transaction Sequencing</strong></p><p>Subscriber-level operations are globally serialized, ensuring correct execution order even under extreme concurrency and distributed processing.</p><p>Synchronous request chains were replaced with asynchronous event flows, enabling horizontal scalability and natural absorption of traffic bursts.</p><p><strong>Intelligent Queuing and Prioritization</strong></p><p>Transactions are classified by urgency, ensuring critical activations and recovery operations are never blocked by bulk or batch workloads.</p><p><strong>Active-Active High Availability</strong></p><p>Traffic is processed simultaneously across regions, eliminating single points of failure and enabling continuous operation.</p><p><strong>Automated Recovery and Replay</strong></p><p>Instead of failing transactions during downstream outages, the system buffers and automatically reprocesses them once recovery is detected—without manual intervention.</p><p>Real-time monitoring and analytics provide visibility into transaction health, performance trends, and anomalies across the entire ecosystem.</p><p>Together, these capabilities transformed provisioning from a fragile dependency into a <strong>self-recovering, autonomous platform</strong>.</p><h2>Measurable Impact at National Scale</h2><p>The architectural transformation delivered quantifiable results:</p><ul><li>100M+ provisioning transactions processed monthly</li><li>Provisioning success rates improved from approximately 99.05% to 99.98%</li><li>Monthly transaction fallout reduced from roughly 250,000 to 15,000</li><li>Manual operational effort reduced by over 80%</li><li>Provisioning-related customer-care calls reduced by more than 75%</li><li>Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR) improved by over 50%</li><li>Zero major customer-impacting outages since implementation</li></ul><p>At this scale, even fractional improvements translate into <strong>millions of dollars in operational savings</strong> and significantly improved customer experience.</p><p>This modernization effort was <strong>architected and led by Henry Cyril</strong>, who served as the Principal Engineer and Systems Architect defining the end-to-end design, resiliency framework, and migration strategy.</p><p>Cyril’s role extended beyond implementation. He established the architectural blueprint, guided cross-functional execution, and introduced design patterns that have since been adopted as <strong>reference models for future modernization initiatives</strong> across large-scale telecom platforms. Such platforms are typically designed and operated by a small number of senior architects due to the scale, complexity, and reliability requirements involved.</p><p>The architectural patterns introduced through this work have informed broader modernization efforts and are increasingly aligned with how <strong>next-generation telecom systems are being designed</strong>, particularly as operators transition toward more autonomous, software-defined networks.</p><p>Beyond a single platform, this architecture reflects a broader shift in how telecom systems are being built. The move away from fragile, manually operated provisioning toward <strong>autonomous, self-healing platforms</strong> is now widely seen as essential for sustaining scale in modern networks.</p><p>As operators globally move toward autonomous, software-defined networks, similar architectural principles are increasingly reflected in industry frameworks and large-scale modernization programs.</p><p>The design principles demonstrated here—deterministic sequencing, event-driven execution, active-active resiliency, and automated recovery—closely align with the operational demands of <strong>5G-Advanced and future 6G networks</strong>, where service complexity, transaction volume, and real-time expectations continue to rise.</p><p>As telecom infrastructure becomes more distributed, software-centric, and intelligence-enabled, these architectural approaches are increasingly serving as a <strong>benchmark for reliability, scalability, and operational efficiency</strong> across the industry.</p><h2>Why This Matters for the Future of Connectivity</h2><p>As telecom networks move toward autonomous operations, AI-driven control planes, and next-generation connectivity models, provisioning systems must evolve from reactive platforms into <strong>self-operating infrastructure</strong>.</p><p>This transformation underscores a broader industry lesson:</p><p><strong>At extreme scale, reliability is an architectural decision—not an operational one.</strong></p><p>By redesigning provisioning systems to expect failure, absorb volatility, and recover automatically, telecom operators can support massive growth without sacrificing stability or customer trust.</p>",
