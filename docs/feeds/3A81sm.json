      "content": "\"Billions fewer birds are flying through North American skies than decades ago,\" reports the Associated Press, \"and their population is shrinking ever faster, mostly due to a combination of intensive agriculture and warming temperatures, a new study found.\"\n\n\nNearly half of the 261 species studied showed big enough losses in numbers to be statistically significant and more than half of those declining are seeing their losses accelerate since 1987, according to Thursday's journal Science... The only consolation is that the birds that are shrinking in numbers the fastest are species — such as the European starling, American crow, grackle and house sparrow — with large enough populations that they aren't yet at risk of going extinct, said study lead author Francois Leroy, also an Ohio State ecologist... \n\nWhen it came to population declines — not the acceleration — the scientists noticed bigger losses further south. When they did a deeper analysis they statistically connected those losses to warmer temperatures from human-caused climate change. \"In regions where temperatures increase the most, we are seeing strongest declines in populations,\" [said study co-author Marta Jarzyna, an ecologist at Ohio State University]. \"On the other hand, the acceleration of those declines, that's mostly driven by agricultural practices.\" The scientists found statistical correlations between speeded-up decline rates and high fertilizer use, high pesticide use and amount of cropland, Leroy said. He said they couldn't say any of those caused the acceleration of losses, but it indicates agriculture in general is a factor. \"The stronger the agriculture, the faster we will lose birds,\" said Leroy... \n\nMcGill University wildlife biologist David Bird, who wasn't part of the study, said it was done well and that its conclusions made sense. With a growing human population, agriculture practices are intensified, more bird habitats are being converted to cropland, modern machinery often grind up nests and eggs and single crop plantings offer less possibilities for birds to find food and nests, said Bird, the editor of Birds of Canada. \"The biggest impact of agricultural intensity though is our war on insects. Numerous recent studies have shown that insect populations in many places throughout the world, including the U.S., have crashed by well over 40 percent,\" Bird said in an email. \"Many of the birds in this new study showing population declines depend heavily on insects for food.\" \n\n\nA 2019 study of the same bird species by Cornell University conservation scientist Kenneth Rosenberg also found that North America had 3 billion fewer birds than in 1970, the article points out.",

      "content": "<p>When a new, disruptive technology comes along, fearmongering is never far behind. Writing was said to erode our memory, yet most of you still somehow managed to remember to put underwear on today. Movies and television were supposed to destroy our imaginations, yet the Star Wars and Harry Potter universes are bursting with human imagination, and the sheer volume of their wildly inappropriate fan fiction likewise proves so. Smartphones supposedly eradicated our attention spans, yet… wow, that’s really shiny! I’m sure I don’t need to tell you how disruptive AI is, so naturally, the fearmongering has followed. </p><p>\\\nThe thing is, this particular brand of fearmongering around AI has escalated rather quickly, even in the face of both absurd and hyperbolic arguments, such as AI destroying our critical thinking, collapsing our institutions, and ending our world. Even better, there’s an unspoken thread in this fearmongering that implicates you, the user of AI, as part of this destruction because, apparently, you’re just too damned incompetent.</p><h2><strong>Destruction of Critical Thinking</strong></h2><p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/8pmL8ZpO2yTCxdRc1VIehxMAYNQ2-dz939nr.jpeg\" alt=\"\">One of the supposed negative side effects of AI use is the destruction of critical thinking. It seems we are going to be so enamored with AI that we’re going to use it to supplant much of our thinking. No longer will you have to sit and have a think because you can simply have your AI do it for you. Don’t know what’s for dinner? Ask AI! Unsure of the moral implications of capital punishment in a contemporary society? Just ask AI! Is there life after death? AI, my friend. AI.</p><p>\\\nThe argument basically boils down to this: because AI is so ubiquitous, we are going to be unloading so much of our cognitive effort that our critical thinking skills will diminish. It’s the old “use it or lose it” idea. But if the logic is inventions that reduce cognitive effort therefore reduce critical thinking, why didn’t the invention of writing prevent the invention of books, which should have prevented the invention of adding machines, which should have prevented the invention of computers, which should have prevented the invention of AI, whose creation required some of the most arduous collective critical thinking ever undertaken by humanity? </p><p>\\\nIt seems as though the best evidence for this brand of fearmongering is that students who use AI to write their papers are not engaging their critical thinking. Unfortunately, even this claim can’t be supported. What  definitively be said about students using AI to generate their papers is not that their critical thinking skills are degrading, but that they are spending less time writing. Do we need a reminder that writing is not critical thinking? Because if it is, Socrates was an idiot, as he didn’t write. So while writing can certainly be tied to critical thinking, it is not critical thinking itself.</p><p>\\\nThe problem is, many of these arguments use writing as a measure for critical thinking, demonstrating a deep lack of critical thinking. Not that it needs to be said, but two things can be true at once: you can be a good critical thinker and a crap writer. You also don’t have to think critically to write a paper. As a community college instructor, I’ve seen plenty of papers that are bereft of even a grain of critical thinking, but somehow, there were still a bunch of words printed on paper. So my students broke reality in addition to my hopes for them.</p><p>\\\nNo, the best claim that can be made is that many students are spending less time writing, so it’s  there might be a reduction in time spent on critical thinking. But even then, it would be a leap to assume none ever occurs. Am I to understand that students using AI to write papers are not even going to see what the AI wrote and use critical thinking to evaluate the essay? Are they completely unaware that AI hallucinates and makes errors? If all that is the case, it’s not the AI that is preventing critical thinking, now, is it? As surprising as it is, cheating predates AI.</p><p>\\\nWait a minute… I must wholeheartedly apologize. I am absolutely unqualified to think about this critically, as I was in the top 1% of users who sent messages to ChatGPT in 2025. Therefore, I will start acting appropriately: Derrrrrr! Duh, AI good!</p><h2><strong>The Fall of Civic Institutions</strong></h2><p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/8pmL8ZpO2yTCxdRc1VIehxMAYNQ2-s8b398k.jpeg\" alt=\"\">Our beloved civic institutions will also fall due to AI. An infamous paper recently made its way around the AI doom circles on this exact topic, <em>How AI Destroys Institutions</em>, and it proposes that this is going to happen through three mechanisms: deteriorating expertise through cognitive offloading, interfering with our decision-making, and isolating humans from each other.</p><p>\\\nMuch like the argument for critical thinking, our professional skills are going to be eroded because of skill offloading from AI. It’s not that we might get worse at that specific thing AI is doing for us; rather, it’s that our professional skills will degrade. This is why I can never use an LLM for classroom content as an English as a second language instructor—my English skills would degrade, I wouldn’t be able to speak English anymore, and I’d be out of a job. Thanks, AI!</p><p>\\\nSo we are to believe that professionals, people who have invested time and money into education and building up careers, are simply going to let important skills get unknowingly chipped away at because of AI? Are lawyers just going to become people who bring Claude into court? So all these people who’ve been highly trained won’t notice they’re not as effective at their jobs as they used to be? Their bosses won’t? The clients who pay for competent services won’t? That’s an extremely dependent and extraordinarily unlikely inverted pyramid made from a lack of self-awareness.</p><p>\\\nSo I guess I won’t notice the degradation of my accountant’s skills when I have to pay six times more in taxes because of their mistakes, and I guess the parents of students won’t notice their children’s grades slipping because the teacher used AI and therefore sucks at teaching. Apparently, AI functions as a global blindfold. It’s fun when you find unintended uses of products!</p><p>\\\nApparently, we’re also just going to have AI make our difficult moral choices for us because we’re just so damned lazy. We’re going to outsource our morality and judgment, all hidden behind an unknowable algorithm. No one will ever hash it out and come to a better agreement because we’re just going to outsource all of that to AI. I know how eager the public is to outsource our ethics, judgment, and morality to AI. Thank goodness there’s never, ever, ever been any pushback on this idea. Like ever. I guess Catholics will ask for repentance through Grok rather than through priests.</p><p>\\\nIn order to collapse our civic institutions, such as education and the justice system, AI will also erode human relationships. Now, it is true that AI will displace some relationships; there’s a good chance the relationship you had with your assistants will be a faint memory when AI replaces them. Honestly, I still haven’t replaced the relationship I had with my ice block delivery man or the horse he rode on. Gosh, I sure do miss the 80s… The 1880s, that is.</p><p>\\\nAnd of course, all of this destruction of human relationships will happen only because of AI. If you thought it started happening with the decline of the monoculture as digital technology ramped up, well, you’re just wrong.</p><p>\\\nAdditionally, people will become isolated because, with AI being so agreeable, there’s less reason to hash stuff out with others in an uncomfortable manner. I get it; people are conflict-averse. That’s why when I turn on the news, I only see stories about rainbows and puppies rather than wars and protests. Humanity is so harmonious!</p><p>\\\nSo yeah, our beloved civic institutions will crumble. Damn you, AI!</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/8pmL8ZpO2yTCxdRc1VIehxMAYNQ2-ygc39fx.jpeg\" alt=\"\">If destroying our society wasn’t bad enough, AI is also going to contribute to the end of the world. The Doomsday Clock by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists has been moved to 85 seconds to midnight, in part because of the threat from AI. Biological, nuclear, and informational warfare AI upgrades are pushing us closer than we’ve ever been. And while these threats do actually have some merit, the hyperbolic conclusion still leaves this firmly in the fearmongering camp.</p><p>\\\nThe fear of’ biological warfare is that AI will create a new, dangerous pathogen that people have no defense against. For nuclear warfare, AI’s implementation could mask the decision-making process, increasing the chances of error with a devastating weapon. And for informational warfare, it’s more about sowing chaos through deepfakes and the like.</p><p>\\\nI’ll be the first one to admit that these particular threats do seem a bit more compelling, though I’m still unsure that inching us toward doom is the appropriate conclusion. It is very conceivable that AI could design an extremely dangerous pathogen, but to be fair, we’ve kept plenty of dangerous pathogens for many years, so I’m just going to continue keeping my fingers crossed.</p><p>\\\nFor nuclear warfare, technology in general typically reduces the need for human judgment, and it’s easily argued that it reduces errors from human judgment, so the doom argument seems like a wash at best. As for informational warfare with deepfakes, yeah, that one’s hard to refute. Society is just going to have to figure that one out as we did with other disruptive technologies, though again, contributing to the end of the world seems a bit of a hyperbolic conclusion in the meantime.</p><p>While AI doom slop has always annoyed me, it wasn’t until I sat down and thought about what binds them together, somehow without the help of AI, that I found the thread: humans are too incompetent to use AI responsibly. See, the allure of AI is simply too great for humanity, so naturally, the result is a degradation of our critical thinking, the collapse of our society, and even the destruction of our world.</p><p>\\\nWe must first acknowledge that for any of these doom scenarios to come to fruition, it requires an incredible amount of human failure stacked on human failure stacked on human failure. We’ve already been warned by the doomers who seem immune to AI’s negative effects, yet we’re just not going to do anything to mitigate these potential disasters? Is AI not going to improve in any marked way? The companies that create AI have no incentive not let it destroy the world? I had no idea profits continued to percolate to the afterlife.</p><p>\\\nIt seems parents and educators will simply shrug and accept that their children won’t be very good thinkers. The institutions that prop up our societies apparently can’t do anything in the face of AI to save themselves from ultimate destruction. And the great powers of the world would certainly never do anything to mitigate the risk of world destruction, even though the primary goal of conflict is to not be destroyed, but whatever. Remember, humanity is incompetent. They won’t say it outright, but it’s an implicit requirement in all of these predictions.</p><p>\\\nPlus, while we may be a bit late to the party, historically, we have always recognized the dangers of technology and done our best to minimize the risks. Cars now have seatbelts and airbags, houses now have circuit breakers and grounded outlets, guns have safeties, and even the Three Mile Island, Chornobyl, and Fukushima disasters produced increased nuclear safety. I wonder which magical property of AI makes it resistant to our inevitable improvements.</p><p>\\\nWhat can actually be stated with confidence is that it’s possible we might become too reliant on AI for problem-solving. It’s possible AI will collapse our institutions, but the sheer number of required failures to get there makes it virtually impossible. It’s also possible AI will be participating in the destruction of the planet, but if over 80 years of humanity having nuclear technology is any indication, we’re about 23.95 hours till midnight rather than 85 seconds.</p><p>\\\nTo be clear, none of this means we shouldn’t be cautious; caution with a new disruptive technology should be a requirement. However, we all know the claims being made aren’t advising caution; that’s gone out the window, and they’re predicting disaster.</p><p>\\\nI suppose <em>AI Will Erode Our Critical Thinking</em> is a bit catchier than <em>AI Will Erode Our Critical Thinking If We Simply Do Nothing But Twiddle All Our Thumbs As It Happens</em>. <em>How AI Destroys Institutions</em> is a bold and head-turning title whose cup overflows with hyperbole; <em>AI Has The Possibility To Generate Some Negative Effects On Our Institutions, So Let’s Prepare Ahead Of Time</em> isn’t nearly so bold. <em>AI Is Pushing Us Closer To Global Doom</em> naturally gets many clicks; <em>AI Is A New Tool, So Let’s Proceed Cautiously</em> doesn’t, even if it’s more accurate.</p><p>So, what can be learned from these AI doom stories? Well, it seems they think you’re incompetent and can’t use AI responsibly. They think you’re not going to do anything to mitigate any potential problems from AI. They also think you are simply going to use it in a manner that is ultimately destructive. So really, what we’ve learned is that the soft bigotry of low expectations has come to the world of AI.</p>",

      "content": "<p>It’s fair to think that this could only be a myth, but it's actually not. There  people who have become millionaires with Bitcoin and crypto investments. Does this mean you will do it, too? Who knows. The reality is more complex than just a little investment, and without a doubt, the crypto market is much more complex now than it was before.</p><p><strong>What we do know, though, is that the stories of these people are real. The stats are real, and their luck or conscious decisions were real</strong>. At this point, when we say “crypto millionaire,” we mean someone who holds (or held in the past) at least one million US dollars in cryptocurrencies, measured by market value. Probably, this amount was initially just a few cents or dollars that grew with time and patience.</p><p>Let’s explore this idea of crypto millionaires and what they did to become one.</p><p>Most cryptocurrencies have public chains, so we have public stats. We know which addresses are richer, and how many. The  estimated that <strong>over 241,700 users worldwide held at least one million dollars in crypto assets at some point during the previous year.</strong> That count included around 145,100 Bitcoin millionaires alone, reflecting Bitcoin’s dominant share of total market value. We can even  in real time with percentages and USD equivalents.</p><p>To include some names, we have  of the top Bitcoin holders in 2026. Besides Satoshi Nakamoto and institutions like Binance, Robinhood, Bitfinex, Tether, and the US government, we also have unknown whales around, with millions and up to billions in BTC holdings.</p><p>Market capitalization and historical prices aren’t a myth, either. We can travel back to 2013, for instance, when the total crypto market cap was around $1.6 billion, and the Bitcoin price was about $135 per coin []. By January 2026, the total market cap surpassed $3 trillion, and the Bitcoin price was at $86k (not to mention previous records of over $126k). That represents increases of 187,400% and up to 93,233%, respectively.</p><p>In other words, if you had bought $1,200 in BTC in 2013 and held on for dear life (HODL) all these years, you would have over one million dollars today.</p><p>Besides stats and anonymous addresses, we have some well-documented cases with names and stories. Likely the younger millionaire here is , who invested in Bitcoin when he was barely 12 years-old. <strong>His grandma gave him $1,000, and he bought BTC at $12 per unit in 2011.</strong> He founded an educational startup with his earnings in 2014 and sold it for 300 BTC in 2015. So, thanks to Bitcoin, he was a millionaire before turning 18.</p><p> is another young investor: he sold some of his toys to invest in Bitcoin when he was just 11 years-old, in 2012. He also bought Ether in 2016 and made himself a millionaire with his crypto trades. Now, also speaking about Ether,  is worth mentioning. He bet his life savings and family house on buying ETH in 2016, when the currency was barely known. The result was $13 million by 2017. He did his research, but of course, doesn’t recommend trying this extremely risky move at home (or with your house).</p><p>The  isn’t exactly a non-anonymous case, but we know that the person behind it’s an early Bitcoin miner. <strong>This charity fund appeared in 2017, revealing plans to donate more than 5,000 BTC to ONGs and some individuals in need.</strong> That was between $55 and $86 million at the time. The organizer, “Pine,” explained that the coins had been acquired quietly years earlier and left untouched while Bitcoin climbed. They had more money than they could ever spend.</p><p>More recently, we can mention the case of two middle-aged . Tommy, James, and several of their family members bought about $8,000 in Shiba Inu (SHIB), a memecoin, before the price exploded in 2021. They ended up making up to $9 million.</p><p>Well, not every crypto millionaire around just bought and sat to wait. Some of them are familiar faces who became wealthy by building infrastructure or companies related to digital assets. <strong>Among them, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), founder of Binance,  for having sold his apartment to buy Bitcoin in 2013.</strong> He launched the exchange in 2017 after a successful Initial Coin Offering (ICO), and now, , he’s the 23rd richest person in the world, with a net worth of around $78.8 billion.</p><p>Jihan Wu is another good example. He co-founded Bitmain in 2013, one of the largest manufacturers of ASIC machines for Bitcoin mining. In 2021, he also launched Bitdeer, which is among the largest Bitcoin miners by computing power. Wu’s net worth has been  at around $2.3 billion.</p><p>Around 2013 as well, when Bitcoin was young and Ethereum didn’t exist yet, <strong>Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss turned a famous $65 million legal settlement over Facebook into a huge cryptocurrency presence.</strong> about $11 million to buy Bitcoin when it was roughly $100-120 per coin, giving them 1% of all Bitcoin in existence at the time. Some years later, in 2014, they founded the regulated crypto exchange Gemini. This platform became one of the biggest U.S. exchanges for buying, selling, and storing digital assets.  lists each twin with a net worth of around $3.7 billion as of early 2026, largely from crypto holdings and Gemini’s growth.</p><p>At this point, there are plenty of predictions. The dream of every crypto investor is to see Bitcoin reach one million per coin. If that’s even possible, we don’t know yet. If you can buy a memecoin for a few cents today and see a price explosion of 100,000%+ tomorrow, only luck can tell. All investors mentioned above went in before mainstream awareness, when prices were low, and uncertainty was high. Holding through sharp drops mattered just as much. This is really a mix of research and faith, but we need to remember that cryptocurrencies aren’t just speculation.</p><p><strong>They were created as a way to get rid of middlemen like banks and governments. It’s free money (as in freedom) available for everyone, everywhere, anytime.</strong> If you have your keys, no one else can have your coins. In , we have our own  of addresses (for GBYTE holdings), but what really matters is that no middleman can take your coins away.</p><p>Without miners or “validators,” Obyte offers a multipurpose platform where you can trade and invest your crypto holdings without censorship concerns. At the end of the day, the first real step to becoming a millionaire is having complete control over your assets.</p><p>:::info\nFeatured Vector Image by macrovector / </p>",

And they imply, Malara argues, that Galileo ultimately broke with Ptolemy's cosmos because his mastery of the traditional paradigm's reasoning convinced him that a heliocentric [sun-centered] system would better fulfill Ptolemy's own mathematical logic.\n",

      "content": "<p>The Rust team is happy to announce a new version of Rust, 1.77.0. Rust is a programming language empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software.</p><p>\\\nIf you have a previous version of Rust installed via , you can get 1.77.0 with:</p><p>\\\nIf you'd like to help us out by testing future releases, you might consider updating locally to use the beta channel () or the nightly channel (). Please <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/new/choose\">report</a> any bugs you might come across!</p><p>This release is relatively minor, but as always, even incremental improvements lead to a greater whole. A few of those changes are highlighted in this post, and others may yet fill more niche needs.</p><p>Rust now supports C-string literals () which expand to a nul-byte terminated string in memory of type . This makes it easier to write code interoperating with foreign language interfaces which require nul-terminated strings, with all of the relevant error checking (e.g., lack of interior nul byte) performed at compile time.</p><h3>Support for recursion in </h3><p>Async functions previously could not call themselves due to a compiler limitation. In 1.77, that limitation has been lifted, so recursive calls are permitted so long as they use some form of indirection to avoid an infinite size for the state of the function.</p><p>\\\nThis means that code like this now works:</p><pre><code>async fn fib(n: u32) -&gt; u32 {\n   match n {\n       0 | 1 =&gt; 1,\n       _ =&gt; Box::pin(fib(n-1)).await + Box::pin(fib(n-2)).await\n   }\n}\n</code></pre><p>1.77.0 stabilizes  for struct fields, which provides access to the byte offset of the relevant public field of a struct. This macro is most useful when the offset of a field is required without an existing instance of a type. Implementing such a macro is already possible on stable, but without an instance of the type the implementation would require tricky unsafe code which makes it easy to accidentally introduce undefined behavior.</p><p>\\\nUsers can now access the offset of a public field with <code>offset_of!(StructName, field)</code>. This expands to a  expression with the offset in bytes from the start of the struct.</p><h3>Enable strip in release profiles by default</h3><p>Cargo <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/cargo/reference/profiles.html\">profiles</a> which do not enable <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/cargo/reference/profiles.html#debug\">debuginfo</a> in outputs (e.g., ) will enable  by default.</p><p>\\\nThis is primarily needed because the (precompiled) standard library ships with debuginfo, which means that statically linked results would include the debuginfo from the standard library even if the local compilations didn't explicitly request debuginfo.</p><p>\\\nUsers which do want debuginfo can explicitly enable it with the <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/cargo/reference/profiles.html#debug\">debug</a> flag in the relevant Cargo profile.</p><ul><li><code>slice::split_first_chunk_mut</code></li><li><code>slice::split_last_chunk_mut</code></li></ul><p>Many people came together to create Rust 1.77.0. We couldn't have done it without all of you. <a href=\"https://thanks.rust-lang.org/rust/1.77.0/\">Thanks!</a></p>",

Sign up for</em><em><a href=\"https://mrkup.org/XvjZS\">Klaxon</a>, a newsletter that delivers our stories and tools directly to your inbox.</em></p><p>\\\nElizabeth Tyree was recently trying to teach her West Texas students about the connections between Emily Dickinson’s letters and her poetry. The project she designed asked students to read Dickinson’s correspondence and compare them to her art, finding examples of how one led to the other. Dickinson’s letters are available for free through The Internet Archive, a nonprofit, digital library that has, among other content, 44 million digitized books and texts at archive.org.</p><p>\\\nBut Tyree and her students couldn’t get to them. Archive.org is blocked by their school district. The federal government <a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/childrens-internet-protection-act\">effectively mandated</a> web filters for schools in 2000 through the Children’s Internet Protection Act. At the time, filters were seen as an important way to keep kids from accessing online porn. <a href=\"http://mrkup.org/block\">A Markup investigation</a> published earlier this month, however, showed these filters have morphed into tools of digital censorship, keeping students in some districts from abortion information, sex ed, and LGBTQ+ resources, including suicide prevention.</p><p>\\\nAfter our investigation published, teachers—including Tyree—took to social media to point out how the web filters frustrate them, too.</p><p>\\\nTyree has been in classrooms for 16 years, teaching students of all ages a mix of English, writing, science, and music. Because the federal government only requires districts to keep students from obscene and harmful content and otherwise leaves them to block whatever else they want, Tyree has had different problems from one district to another. Sometimes tech support will unblock websites she asks to be unblocked, but her request to get her students access to Archive.org was recently denied over a concern that the website also hosts adult content.</p><p>\\\n“It was the only place online that we could get access to Emily Dickinson’s correspondence for free,” Tyree said. “We had to change the entire project.”</p><p>\\\nKaitlyn D’Annibale, an athletic trainer in Washington, D.C. who works with high school athletes, has run into similar hurdles. She needs access to the healthcare website MedBridge both for continuing education and to create home exercise programs for the students she works with, but the site is blocked by her school.</p><p>\\\n“They pay for the membership, but I can’t access the site,” D’Annibale said.</p><p>\\\nWhen she needs to review hospital MRIs to assess students’ playing capacity, she can’t go through the hospital portal to open them because such portals are blocked. Her workaround? Wait until she gets home to look on her own computer.</p><p>\\\nShe recently wanted to look up suicide prevention resources for a student. “Anything I put into Google that was ‘suicidal’ anything got blocked,” D’Annibale said. Eventually she made it to a useful PDF by getting creative with the wording of her search terms.</p><p>\\\nD’Annibale said she has asked for sites to be unblocked in the past but the process is tedious and resolution is short-lived. Sites that the IT department has unblocked for her have reverted to being blocked. She hasn’t been able to figure out why.</p><p>\\\nOne commenter on TikTok said that the process for requesting sites be unblocked in her district requires her to do research about the blocked site (at home, where she can access it), make a case to an administrator, answer follow-up questions, wait for that person to take the request to a board for approval, and then answer more follow-up questions before a decision can be made.</p><p>\\\nAnother described a similar situation: “My district has sites blocked that are actually in the curriculum. We’re supposed to contact our district [department] heads to ask them to get it unblocked. Like they don’t have enough to do. It’s ridiculous.”</p><p>\\\nOther teachers told The Markup about how hard it can be to make lesson plans for substitute teachers, because they aren’t sure which of the sites that are available to them are actually blocked to subs and students. They described indiscriminate blocks to YouTube, Pinterest, and Wikipedia—sites that have useful educational resources mixed in with other content.</p><p>\\\nNancy Willard saw this all coming.</p><p>\\\nBack in 2000, Willard worked at the Center for Advanced Technology in Education at the University of Oregon and submitted testimony to the Children’s Internet Safety Committee, urging Congress not to require filters in the Children’s Internet Protection Act. Reached by phone this week, Willard called the filters a “technical, quick-fix solution” that either don’t work—because students find ways around them—or leave kids unprepared for the real world.</p><p>\\\n“Their world doesn’t have filtering software on their computers at home and their world as adults isn’t going to have filtering software,” Willard said. “So if they haven’t developed the self-control, the ability to assess credibility of information, the ability to focus on the task at hand and not go play [online games], if they haven’t developed that ability, how effective are they going to be as adults?”</p><p>\\\nWillard’s insistence that schools teach students about safe internet use made it into the law. Of course, much to her dismay and the continued frustration of teachers all over the country, the filtering requirement did, too.</p>",

It was done \"based on lots of discussions with different companies and groups and the other stable kernel maintainer.\" The other maintainer is Sasha Levin, who co-maintains these Linux kernel releases alongside Greg. Now, the updated support schedule for the currently active LTS kernels looks like this: \n — Linux 6.6 now EOLs Dec 2027 (was Dec 2026), giving it a 4-year support window. \n\n — Linux 6.12 now EOLs Dec 2028 (was Dec 2026), also a 4-year window. \n\n — Linux 6.18 now EOLs Dec 2028 (was Dec 2027), at least 3 years of support. \n\nWorth noting above is that Linux 5.10 and 5.15 are both hitting EOL this year in December, so if your distro is still running either of these, now is a good time to start thinking about a move.\n",

      "content": "In a 9,000-word expose, a writer for Harper's visited San Francisco's young entrepreneurs in September to mockingly profile \"tech's new generation and the end of thinking.\" \nThere's Cluely founder Roy Lee. (\"His grand contribution to the world was a piece of software that told people what to do.\") And the Rationalist movement's Scott Alexander, who \"would probably have a very easy time starting a suicide cult...\"\n\nAlexander's relationship with the AI industry is a strange one. \"In theory, we think they're potentially destroying the world and are evil and we hate them,\" he told me. In practice, though, the entire industry is essentially an outgrowth of his blog's comment section... \"Many of them were specifically thinking, I don't trust anybody else with superintelligence, so I'm going to create it and do it well.\" Somehow, a movement that believes AI is incredibly dangerous and needs to be pursued carefully ended up generating a breakneck artificial arms race. \n\nThere's a fascinating story about teenaged founder Eric Zhu (who only recently turned 18):\n\nClients wanted to take calls during work hours, so he would speak to them from his school bathroom. \"I convinced my counselor that I had prostate issues... I would buy hall passes from drug dealers to get out of class, to have business meetings.\" Soon he was taking Zoom calls with a U.S. senator to discuss tech regulation... Next, he built his own venture-capital fund, managing $20 million. At one point cops raided the bathroom looking for drug dealers while Eric was busy talking with an investor. Eventually, the school got sick of Eric's misuse of the facilities and kicked him out. He moved to San Francisco. \n\nEric made all of this sound incredibly easy. You hang out in some Discord servers, make a few connections with the right people; next thing you know, you're a millionaire... Eric didn't think there was anything particularly special about himself. Why did he, unlike any of his classmates, start a $20 million VC fund? \"I think I was just bored. Honestly, I was really bored.\" Did he think anyone could do what he did? \"Yeah, I think anyone genuinely can.\" \n\nThe article concludes Silicon Valley's investors are rewarding young people with \"agency\". Although \"As far as I could tell, being a highly agentic individual had less to do with actually doing things and more to do with constantly chasing attention online.\" Like X.com user Donald Boat, who successfully baited Sam Altman into buying him a gaming PC in \"a brutally simplified miniature of the entire VC economy.\" (After which \"People were giving him stuff for no reason except that Altman had already done it, and they didn't want to be left out of the trend.\")\n\nShortly before I arrived at the Cheesecake Factory, [Donald Boat] texted to let me know that he'd been drinking all day, so when I met him I thought he was irretrievably wasted. In fact, it turned out, he was just like that all the time... He seemed to have a constant roster of projects on the go. He'd sent me occasional photos of his exploits. He went down to L.A. to see Oasis and ended up in a poker game with a group of weapons manufacturers. \"I made a bunch of jokes about sending all their poker money to China,\" he said, \"and they were not pleased....\" \n\n\"I don't use that computer and I think video games are a waste of time. I spent all the money I made from going viral on Oasis tickets.\" As far as he was concerned, the fact that tech people were tripping over themselves to take part in his stunt just confirmed his generally low impression of them. \"They have too much money and nothing going on...\" Ever since his big viral moment, he'd been suddenly inundated with messages from startup drones who'd decided that his clout might be useful to them. One had offered to fly him out to the French Riviera. \n\nThe author's conclusion? \"It did not seem like a good idea to me that some of the richest people in the world were no longer rewarding people for having any particular skills, but simply for having agency.\"",

      "content": "Saturday afternoon Sam Altman announced he'd start answering questions on X.com about OpenAI's work with America's Department of War — and all the developments over the past few days. (After that department's negotions had failed with Anthropic, they announced they'd stop using Anthropic's technology and threatened to designate it a \"Supply-Chain Risk to National Security\". Then they'd reached a deal for OpenAI's technology — though Altman says it includes OpenAI's own similar prohibitions against using their products for domestic mass surveillance and requiring \"human responsibility\" for the use of force in autonomous weapon systems.) \nAltman said Saturday that enforcing that \"Supply-Chain Risk\" designation on Anthropic \"would be very bad for our industry and our country, and obviously their company. We said [that] to the Department of War before and after. We said that part of the reason we were willing to do this quickly was in the hopes of de-esclation.... We should all care very much about the precedent... To say it very clearly: I think this is a very bad decision from the Department of War and I hope they reverse it. If we take heat for strongly criticizing it, so be it.\" \n\n\nAltman also said that for a long time, OpenAI was planning to do \"non-classified work only,\" but this week found the Department of War \"flexible on what we needed...\"\n\n Sam Altman: The reason for rushing is an attempt to de-escalate the situation. I think the current path things are on is dangerous for Anthropic, healthy competition, and the U.S. We negotiated to make sure similar terms would be offered to all other AI labs. \n\nI know what it's like to feel backed into a corner, and I think it's worth some empathy to the Department of War. They are... a very dedicated group of people with, as I mentioned, an extremely important mission. I cannot imagine doing their work. Our industry tells them \"The technology we are building is going to be the high order bit in geopolitical conflict. China is rushing ahead. You are very behind.\" And then we say \"But we won't help you, and we think you are kind of evil.\" I don't think I'd react great in that situation. I do not believe unelected leaders of private companies should have as much power as our democratically elected government. But I do think we need to help them. \n\n\n\nQuestion: Are you worried at all about the potential for things to go really south during a possible dispute over what's legal or not later on and be deemed a supply chain risk...? \n\n\n\nSam Altman: Yes, I am. If we have to take on that fight we will, but it clearly exposes us to some risk. I am still very hopeful this is going to get resolved, and part of why we wanted to act fast was to help increase the chances of that... \n\n\nQuestion: Why the rush to sign the deal ? Obviously the optics don't look great. \n\n\nSam Altman: It was definitely rushed, and the optics don't look good. We really wanted to de-escalate things, and we thought the deal on offer was good. \nIf we are right and this does lead to a de-escalation between the Department of War and the industry, we will look like geniuses, and a company that took on a lot of pain to do things to help the industry. If not, we will continue to be characterized as as rushed and uncareful. I don't where it's going to land, but I have already seen promising signs. I think a good relationship between the government and the companies developing this technology is critical over the next couple of years... \n\n\n\nQuestion: What was the core difference why you think the Department of War accepted OpenAI but not Anthropic? \n\n\nSam Altman: [...] We believe in a layered approach to safety--building a safety stack, deploying FDEs [embedded Forward Deployed Engineers] and having our safety and alignment researcher involved, deploying via cloud, working directly with the Department of War. Anthropic seemed more focused on specific prohibitions in the contract, rather than citing applicable laws, which we felt comfortable with. We feel that it it's very important to build safe system, and although documents are also important, I'd clearly rather rely on technical safeguards if I only had to pick one... \n\n\n\n\nI think Anthropic may have wanted more operational control than we did... \n\n\n\nQuestion: Were the terms that you accepted the same ones Anthropic rejected? \n\n\nSam Altman: No, we had some different ones. But our terms would now be available to them (and others) if they wanted. \n\n\n\nQuestion: Will you turn off the tool if they violate the rules? \n\n\n\nSam Altman: Yes, we will turn it off in that very unlikely event, but we believe the U.S. government is an institution that does its best to follow law and policy. What we won't do is turn it off because we disagree with a particular (legal military) decision. We trust their authority.\n\n \n\nQuestions were also answered by OpenAI's head of National Security Partnerships (who at one point posted that they'd managed the White House response to the Snowden disclosures and helped write the post-Snowden policies constraining surveillance during the Obama years.) And they stressed that with OpenAI's deal with Department of War, \"We control how we train the models and what types of requests the models refuse.\"\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: Are employees allowed to opt out of working on Department of War-related projects? \n\n\nAnswer: We won't ask employees to support Department of War-related projects if they don't want to. \n\n\n\nQuestion: How much is the deal worth? \n\n\nAnswer: It's a few million $, completely inconsequential compared to our $20B+ in revenue, and definitely not worth the cost of a PR blowup. We're doing it because it's the right thing to do for the country, at great cost to ourselves, not because of revenue impact... \n\n\n\n\nQuestion: Can you explicitly state which specific technical safeguard OpenAI has that allowed you to sign what Anthropic called a 'threat to democratic values'? \n\n\nAnswer: We think the deal we made has more guardrails than any previous agreement for classified AI deployments, including Anthropic's. Other AI labs (including Anthropic) have reduced or removed their safety guardrails and relied primarily on usage policies as their primary safeguards in national security deployments. Usage policies, on their own, are not a guarantee of anything. Any responsible deployment of AI in classified environments should involve layered safeguards including a prudent safety stack, limits on deployment architecture, and the direct involvement of AI experts in consequential AI use cases. These are the terms we negotiated in our contract. \n\nThey also detailed OpenAI's position on LinkedIn:\n\nDeployment architecture matters more than contract language. Our contract limits our deployment to cloud API. Autonomous systems require inference at the edge. By limiting our deployment to cloud API, we can ensure that our models cannot be integrated directly into weapons systems, sensors, or other operational hardware... \n\n\n\nInstead of hoping contract language will be enough, our contract allows us to embed forward deployed engineers, commits to giving us visibility into how models are being used, and we have the ability to iterate on safety safeguards over time. If our team sees that our models aren't refusing queries they should, or there's more operational risk than we expected, our contract allows us to make modifications at our discretion. This gives us far more influence over outcomes (and insight into possible abuse) than a static contract provision ever could. \n\n\n\nU.S. law already constrains the worst outcomes. We accepted the \"all lawful uses\" language proposed by the Department, but required them to define the laws that constrained them on surveillance and autonomy directly in the contract. And because laws can change, having this codified in the contract protects against changes in law or policy that we can't anticipate.",

      "content": "Friday was \"a horrible day\" for investors in Duolingo, reports Fast Company. But Friday's one-day 14% drop is just part of a longer story. \n\nSince last May, Duolingo's stock has dropped 81%. Yes, the company faced a social media backlash that month after its CEO promised they'd become an \"AI-first\" company (favoring AI over human contractors). And yes, Duolingo did double its language offerings using generative AI. But more importantly, that summer OpenAI showed how easy it was to just roll your own language-learning tool from a short prompt in a GPT-5 demo, while Google built an AI-powered language-learning tool into its Translate app. \n\n\nAnd yet, Friday Duolingo's shares dropped another 14%, after announcing good fourth quarter results but an unpopular direction for its future. Fast Company reports:\n\n\nOn the surface, many of the company's most critical metrics saw decent gains for the quarter, including: \n — Daily Active Users: 52.7 million (up 30% year-over-year) \n — Paid Subscribers: 12.2 million (up 28% year-over-year) \n — Revenue: $282.9 million (up 35% year-over-year) \n — Total bookings: $336.8 million (up 24% year-over-year) \n\nThe company also reported its full-year 2025 financials, revealing that for the first time in its history, it crossed the $1 billion revenue mark for a fiscal year. \n\nBut the Motley Fool explains that Duolingo's higher ad loads and repeated pushes for subscription plans \"generated revenues in the short term, but made the Duolingo platform less engaging. Ergo, user growth decelerated while revenues rose.\" Thursday Duolingo announced a big change to address that, including moving more features into lower-priced tiers. Barron's reports:\n\nD.A. Davidson analyst Wyatt Swanson, who rates Duolingo stock at Neutral, posited that the push to monetize \"led to disgruntled users and a meaningful negative impact to 'word-of-mouth' marketing.\" Duolingo has guided for bookings growth between 10% and 12% in 2026, compared with the 20% rate the company would have expected to see \"if we operated like we have in past years....\"\nIf stock reaction is any indication, investors are concerned about Duolingo's new focus.",

In May the The Mandalorian and Grogu opens, and one year later there's the release of the Ryan Gosling-led Star Wars: Starfighter. \n\nBut \"there are some insiders who already believe that Starfighter will be a bigger hit than The Mandalorian and Grogu...\"\n\nAccording to unnamed sources who spoke with Variety, there's a \"sense\" that Star Wars: Starfighter, which is directed by Deadpool &amp; Wolverine's Shawn Levy, will be a more satisfying viewing experience. These same sources are allegedly impressed by the early footage they've seen of Ryan Gosling's performance and also suggested that Levy has \"recaptured the franchise's spirit of fun.\" Furthermore, the article states that there's concern that because The Mandalorian and Grogu is spinning out of a streaming-exclusive series, it might not have as much appeal to people who aren't already fans of The Mandalorian... Star Wars: Starfighter, on the other hand, will be accessible to everyone equally. It's set five years after The Rise of Skywalker, which is an unexplored period for the Star Wars franchise onscreen. It's also expected that most, if not all of its featured characters will be brand-new, so no knowledge of past adventures is required. \nSlashdot reader gaiageek reminds us that 2027 will also see a special 50-year anniversary event in movie in theatres: a \"newly restored\" version of the original 1977 Star Wars.",

Here are the studies this week that exposed prehistoric hookups, marched toward death, feasted on their own bodies, and found a buried legend in the Sahara.</p><p>First, Neanderthal males had lots more babies with human females than human males had with Neanderthal females. What’s up with that?! Then, strap in for a stellar swan song, antlers for breakfast, and a timeless style icon from the Cretaceous.</p><h2><strong>Dad’s a Neanderthal, Mom’s a human, I’m in therapy</strong></h2><p>Humans and our close relatives, Neanderthals, produced children together many times before the latter went extinct about 40,000 years ago. As a result, the vast majority of people living today carry a pinch of Neanderthal DNA—the enduring proof of past copulations between our species.</p><p>Now, scientists have proposed that these prehistoric partnerships overwhelmingly occurred between Neanderthal males and females of our own species, , with far fewer couplings between Neanderthal females and human males. This strong sexual bias provides the most \"parsimonious” explanation for the uneven distribution of Neanderthal alleles (variants of specific genes) in modern human genomes, according to a new study.</p><p>“One of the notable features evident in alignments of Neanderthal genomes to those of modern humans is the presence of ‘Neanderthal deserts’ within modern human genomes: genomic regions where Neanderthal alleles are conspicuously rare in the modern human (and ancient modern human) gene pool,” said researchers led by Alexander Platt of the University of Pennsylvania.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In particular, the team noted that Neanderthal deserts show up on the human X chromosome, which they think hints at a strong sex bias toward breeding between Neanderthal males and human females.&nbsp;</p><p>The team compared Neanderthal genomes with genetic data from some sub-Saharan African populations that have no Neanderthal ancestry. This approach allowed them to track ancient gene flow from anatomically modern humans (AMHs)—in other words, our ancient  ancestors—into Neanderthal populations.&nbsp;</p><p>The results revealed that the Neanderthal X chromosomes had a 62 percent relative excess of DNA from AMHs. In other words, not only are there Neanderthal deserts on human X chromosomes, there are corollary “floods” or “oases” (whatever metaphor you like) of human DNA on Neanderthal X chromosomes.&nbsp;</p><p>This discovery is strong evidence that humans were contributing more alleles to the Neanderthal X chromosome, and Neanderthals were contributing less to the human X chromosome, due to an unexplained asymmetry in mate preference.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, the genetic patterns the team observed “were likely colored by a persistent preference for pairings between males of predominantly Neanderthal ancestry and females of predominantly AMH ancestry over the reverse,” the researchers concluded. “The bias that we inferred seems to have remained consistent across admixture events separated by 200,000 years.”</p><p>Men prefer blondes; women prefer Neanderthals? I don’t know. This is just wildly interesting.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>A (hypergiant) star is born</strong></h2><p>We’ve all been there: One day, you’re an extreme red supergiant, and the next, you’re a yellow hypergiant. A new study reports that WOH G64, one of the biggest known stars in the sky, went through this “dramatic transition” sometime in 2014 (or at least, that’s when astronomers first captured this spectral shift in the star, which is located about 163,000 light years from Earth).</p><p>If the Sun were as big as WOH G64, it would stretch to the orbit of Saturn. This late-stage stellar titan offers an ultra-rare opportunity to see how red supergiants (RSGs) end their lives, a process that is shrouded in mystery—often literally, as these stars tend to be obscured by a lot of circumstellar gas.</p><p>“The apparent lack of luminous RSGs detected as supernova progenitors has sparked an ongoing debate over the fate of these stars,” said researchers led by Gonzalo Muñoz-Sanchez of the National Observatory of Athens. “WOH G64 thus provides critical insight into post-RSG evolution and the formation of dense circumstellar environments seen in core-collapse supernovae.”&nbsp;</p><p>It could be that WOH G64 does detonate. In fact, this may have already happened, but the light show hasn’t reached us yet. It may also collapse directly into a black hole with no supernova to show for it. We’ll just have to keep watching this space! This has been Big Star News.</p><p>Antlers in deer are usually a male ornamentation that allows females to judge potential mates based on the quality of their head-bling. Caribou females, however, buck this trend as the only female deer with antlers. So, as a folktale might ask: How did the caribou get her antlers?&nbsp;</p><p>One answer is that antlers make a great post-partum snack, according to a new study. In migratory populations, female caribou shed their antlers when they reach calving grounds, usually just days before they give birth, which may give nursing mothers a much-needed vitamin boost.&nbsp;</p><p>“Pervasive antler consumption by caribou suggests that synchroneity between birthing and antler shedding evinces the importance of nutrient (calcium, phosphorus) transport for supporting calf survival,” said researchers led by Madison Gaetano of the University of Cincinnati. “Though intriguing, additional research will be important to more explicitly evaluate the dietary and fitness benefits (for both females and their calves) of antler-derived nutrients.”</p><p>Given that caribou also eat their placentas, it’s really impressive how these new mothers nourish themselves and their young with the fruits of their own bodies. Hardcore. Respect.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>New spinosaur just dropped</strong></h2><p>Speaking of animals with rad headgear, we’ll close with a shoutout to , a newly-discovered species of giant carnivorous dinosaur that rocked an epic scimitar-shaped skull crest. Move over, rock band T. Rex—this killer is the new wave of dinosaurian glam.&nbsp;</p><p>“…discovered in the central Sahara alongside long-necked dinosaurs in a riparian habitat, is distinguished by a scimitar-shaped bony crest projecting far above its skull roof,” said researchers led by Paul C. Sereno of the University of Chicago.</p><p>Spinosaurus stock has gone through the roof in recent decades as new finds have confirmed that they were the biggest land predators of all time, dethroning  from a tyrant king to a mere tyrant vassal. As the ultimate charismatic megafauna, spinosaurs are popular in dino-blockbusters. Indeed, one of my favorite gags in cinematic history is when a Spinosaurus swallows a satellite phone in , so you know it’s lurking when you hear the Nokia ring tone. Pure dinosaurian comedic gold.&nbsp;</p><p>In any case, the new study sheds new light into the semi-aquatic nature of this majestic hunter, suggesting that this particular species was “a wading, shoreline predator with visual display an important aspect of its biology.” While this animal was no doubt visually captivating, it’s best to view it from a safe distance of about 94 million years.</p><p>Thanks for reading! See you next week.</p>",

But later Friday there were even more repercussions... \n\n\nIn a post to his 1.1 million followers on X.com, U.S. Secretary of War Pete Hegseth criticized Anthropic for what he called \"a master class in arrogance and betrayal as well as a textbook case of how not to do business with the United States Government or the Pentagon.\"\n\nOur position has never wavered and will never waver: the Department of War must have full, unrestricted access to Anthropic's models for every LAWFUL purpose in defense of the Republic... Cloaked in the sanctimonious rhetoric of \"effective altruism,\" [Anthropic and CEO Dario Amodei] have attempted to strong-arm the United States military into submission — a cowardly act of corporate virtue-signaling that places Silicon Valley ideology above American lives. The Terms of Service of Anthropic's defective altruism will never outweigh the safety, the readiness, or the lives of American troops on the battlefield. Their true objective is unmistakable: to seize veto power over the operational decisions of the United States military. That is unacceptable... \n\nIn conjunction with the President's directive for the Federal Government to cease all use of Anthropic's technology, I am directing the Department of War to designate Anthropic a Supply-Chain Risk to National Security. Effective immediately, no contractor, supplier, or partner that does business with the United States military may conduct any commercial activity with Anthropic... America's warfighters will never be held hostage by the ideological whims of Big Tech. This decision is final. \n\nMeanwhile, Anthrophic said on Friday that \"no amount of intimidation or punishment from the Department of War will change our position.\" (And \"We will challenge any supply chain risk designation in court.\")\nDesignating Anthropic as a supply chain risk would be an unprecedented action — one historically reserved for US adversaries, never before publicly applied to an American company. We are deeply saddened by these developments. As the first frontier AI company to deploy models in the US government's classified networks, Anthropic has supported American warfighters since June 2024 and has every intention of continuing to do so. We believe this designation would both be legally unsound and set a dangerous precedent for any American company that negotiates with the government... Secretary Hegseth has implied this designation would restrict anyone who does business with the military from doing business with Anthropic. The Secretary does not have the statutory authority to back up this statement. \n\nAnthropic also defended the two exceptions they'd requested that had stalled contract negotiations. \"[W]e do not believe that today's frontier AI models are reliable enough to be used in fully autonomous weapons. Allowing current models to be used in this way would endanger America's warfighters and civilians. Second, we believe that mass domestic surveillance of Americans constitutes a violation of fundamental rights.\" \n\n\nAlso Friday, OpenAI announced that \"we reached an agreement with the Department of War to deploy our models in their classified network.\"\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman emphasized that the agreement retains and confirms OpenAI's own prohibitions against using their products for domestic mass surveillance — and requires \"human responsibility\" for the use of force including for autonomous weapon systems. \"The Department of War agrees with these principles, reflects them in law and policy, and we put them into our agreement. We also will build technical safeguards to ensure our models behave as they should, which the Department of War also wanted. \"\n\nWe are asking the Department of War to offer these same terms to all AI companies, which in our opinion we think everyone should be willing to accept. We have expressed our strong desire to see things de-escalate away from legal and governmental actions and towards reasonable agreements. We remain committed to serve all of humanity as best we can. The world is a complicated, messy, and sometimes dangerous place.\n",

But in November scientists drilled six new holes at least a mile and a half deep and installed cables with hundreds more light detectors — an upgrade to the massive 15-year-old IceCube Neutrino Observatory to detect the charged particles produced by lower-energy neutrinos interacting with matter:\n\n\n\nWhen they do, the neutrinos produce charged particles that travel through the ice at nearly the speed of light, creating a blue glow called Cherenkov radiation... \"Within the first couple years, we should be making much better measurements,\" [said Erin O'Sullivan, an associate professor of physics at Uppsala University in Sweden and a spokesperson for the project.] \"There's hope to expand the detector, by an order of magnitude in volume, so the important thing there is we're not just seeing a few neutrino point sources, but we're starting to be a true telescope. ... That's really the dream.\" \n\nThe scientists spent seven years planning the upgrade, according to the article. \"To drill holes a mile and a half deep takes about 30 hours, and 18 more hours to return to the surface,\" the article points out. \"Then, the race begins because almost immediately, the hole starts to shrink as the water refreezes.\" (\"If it takes too much time, the principal investigator says, \"the instruments don't fit in anymore!\")",

The planned battery would dwarf a 19 GW lithium-ion project in the UAE... \n\nForm Energy's batteries work very differently from most large batteries today. Instead of using lithium like the batteries in electric cars, they store electricity by making iron rust and then reversing the rusting process to release the energy when needed... Form's iron-air batteries are heavier and less efficient than their counterparts; they can only return about 50% to 70% of the energy used to charge them, while lithium-ion batteries return more than 90%. However, Form's batteries have one distinct advantage. They are cheaper than lithium-ion batteries, costing about $20 per kilowatt-hour of storage, which is almost three times as cheap... It will store 150 MWh of electricity and can supply to the grid for up to 100 hours, delivering about 1.5 MW at peak output.\n \nThanks to long-time Slashdot reader schwit1 for sharing the article.",

Based on both the research literature and resources in English and in Chinese, this paper gives a comprehensive overview of deepfake, covering multiple important aspects of this emerging concept, including 1) different definitions, 2) commonly used performance metrics and standards, and 3) deepfake-related datasets, challenges, competitions and benchmarks. In addition, the paper also reports a meta-review of 12 selected deepfake-related survey papers published in 2020 and 2021, focusing not only on the mentioned aspects, but also on the analysis of key challenges and recommendations. We believe that this paper is the most comprehensive review of deepfake in terms of aspects covered, and the first one covering both the English and Chinese literature and sources.</p><p>: Deepfake, Survey, Definition, Datasets, Benchmarks, Challenges, Competitions, Standards, Performance Metrics.</p><p>Recent advancements in AI and machine learning have increased the capability to produce more realistic media, e.g., video, image, and audio. Especially, state-of-the-art deep learning methods enabled the generation of “deepfakes”, manipulated or synthetic media the realness of which are not easily recognisable by the human eye. Although deepfake is a relatively new phenomenon (having first appeared at the end of 2017), its growth has been remarkable. According to the 2019 and 2020 Deeptrace reports on the state of deepfake [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark139\">2</a>], the number of deepfake videos in the English-speaking internet grew from 7,964 (December 2018) to 14,678 (July 2019) to 85,047 (December 2020), representing a 968% increase from 2018 to 2020.</p><p>In this work, we review existing deepfake-related research ecosystem in terms of various aspects, including performance metrics and standards, datasets, challenges, competitions, and benchmarks. Furthermore, we provide a meta-review of 12 selected deepfake-related survey papers which covers several additional aspects other than the mentioned ones in a systematic manner, such as performance comparison, key challenges, and recommendations.</p><p>Despite being a hugely popular term, there is a lack of consensus on the definition of “deepfake” and the boundary between deepfakes and non-deepfakes is not clear cut. For this survey, we adopt a relatively more inclusive approach to cover all forms of manipulated or synthetic media that are considered deepfakes in a broader sense. We also cover closely related topics including biometrics and multimedia forensics, since deepfakes are often used to launch presentation attacks against biometrics-based authentication systems and detection of deepfakes can be considered part of multimedia forensics. A more detailed discussion on different definitions of “deepfake” is given next.</p><h2>1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Definitions of the Term Deepfake</h2><p>As its name implies, the term “deepfake” is derived from the combination of “deep” (referring to  (DL)) and “fake”. It is normally used to refer to manipulation of existing media (image, video and/or audio) or generation of new (synthetic) media using DL-based approaches. The most commonly discussed deepfake data are fake face images, fake speech forgeries, and fake videos that combine both fake images and fake speech forgeries. While having “fake” in the word indicates manipulated or synthesised media, there are plenty of benign applications of the deepfake technology, e.g., for entertainment and creative arts. With this respect, another term “deep synthesis” has been proposed as a more neutral-sounding alternative [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark197\">60</a>]. This new term, however, has not been widely adopted.</p><p>In addition to the lack of a universal definition, as mentioned already, the boundary between deepfakes and non-deep fakes is actually not a clear cut. There are at least two important aspects we should consider, one on detection of and the other on creation of deepfakes.</p><p>First, detection of deepfakes often follows very similar approaches to detection of traditional fakes generated without using DL techniques. Advanced detection methods have also started leveraging DL to improve their performance, but they do not necessarily need to know how a target media is created (deep or not). To some extent, one could argue that detecting deepfakes does not involve developing deepfake-specific methods (even though some researchers choose to do so), but a more robust and universal detector that can handle any (deep or not) fake media. This can be seen for two closely related topics: biometrics and multimedia forensics. For biometrics, there is a trend of using deep learning techniques to generate fake biometric signals (e.g., face images and videos) for biometric spoofing or presentation attacks. For multimedia forensics, deepfake-based forgeries have become a new threat to the traditional problem of “forgery detection”. For both topics, detection of biometric spoofing and multimedia forgeries have evolved to consider both deep and non-deep fakes.</p><p>Second, one may argue that the word “deep” in “deepfake” does not necessarily refer to the use of “deep learning”, but any “deep” (i.e., sophisticated) technology that creates a very believable fake media. For instance, Brady [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark146\">9</a>] considered deepfake as audio-visual manipulation using “a spectrum of technical sophistication … and techniques”. They also introduced two new terms,  and , referring to “low level manipulation of audio-visual media created with (easily) accessible software [or no software] to speed, slow, restage or re-contextualise content”. This broader understanding of “deepfake” has also been adopted by law makers for new legislations combating malicious deepfakes. For instance, the following two United States acts define “deepfakes” as follows:</p><ul><li>2018 Malicious Deep Fake Prohibition Act<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark1\">1</a>:</li></ul><p>§1041.(b).(2): “<em>the term ‘deep fake’ means an audiovisual record created or altered in a manner that the record would falsely appear to a reasonable observer to be an authentic record of the actual speech or conduct of an individual.</em>”</p><ul><li>2019 DEEP FAKES Accountability Act<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark2\">2</a>:</li></ul><p>§1041.(n).(3): “<em>The term ‘deep fake’ means any video recording, motion-picture film, sound recording, electronic image, or photograph, or any technological representation of speech or conduct substantially derivative thereof—</em></p><p><em>(A)&nbsp; which appears to authentically depict any speech or conduct of a person who did not in fact engage in such speech or conduct; and</em></p><p><em>(B)&nbsp; the production of which was substantially dependent upon technical means, rather than the ability of another person to physically or verbally impersonate such person.</em>”</p><p>As we can see from the above legal definitions of “deepfake”, the use of DL as a technology is not mentioned at all. The focus here is on “authenticity”, “impersonation” and (any) “technical means”.</p><h2>1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scope and Contribution</h2><p>Based on the above discussion on definitions of deepfake, we can see it is not always straightforward or meaningful to differentiate deepfakes from non-deep fakes. In addition, for our focus on performance evaluation and comparison, the boundary between deepfakes and non-deep fakes is even more blurred. This is because DL is just a special (deeper) form of machine learning (ML), and as a result, DL and non-deep ML methods share many common concepts, metrics and procedures.</p><p>Despite the fact that deepfake may be understood in a much broader sense, in this work, we have a sufficiently narrower focus to avoid covering too many topics. We, therefore, decided to define the scope of this survey as follows:</p><ul><li>For metrics and standards, we chose to include all commonly used ones for evaluating general ML methods and those specifically defined for evaluating deepfake creation or detection methods.</li><li>For datasets, challenges, competitions and benchmarks, we considered those related to fake media covered in the deepfake-related survey papers and those with an explicit mention of the term “deepfake” or a comparable term.</li><li>For the meta-review, we considered only survey papers whose authors explicitly referred to the term “deepfakes” in the meta data (title, abstract and keywords).</li></ul><p>Research papers covered in this survey (i.e., the deepfake-related survey papers) were identified via systematic searches on the scientific databases, Scopus and China Online Journals (COJ)<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark4\">3</a>. The following search queries were used to perform the searches on Scopus and COJ, respectively:</p><p>(deepfake* OR deep-fake* OR “deep fake*”) AND (review OR survey OR overview OR systemati* OR SoK)</p><p>(deepfake OR 深度伪造) AND (综述 OR 进展)</p><p>The searches returned 41 survey papers in English and 15 survey papers in Chinese. Out of these papers, eight published in English and four published in Chinese were selected for consideration.</p><p>Deepfake-related challenges, competitions and benchmarks were identified via multiple sources: the survey papers selected, research papers from the co-authors’ personal collections, Google Web searches, and manual inspection of websites of major AI-related conferences held in 2020 and 2021 (where such challenges and competitions are routinely organised). The inspected conferences include those listed in the ACL (Association for Computational Linguistics) Anthology<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark5\">4</a>, ICCV, CVPR, AAAI, ICML, ICLR, KDD, SIGIR, WWW, and many others. In addition, a comprehensive list of datasets was compiled based on the selected survey papers and the identified challenges, competitions, and benchmarks. Relevant standards were identified mainly via research papers covered in this survey, the co-authors’ personal knowledge, and Google Web searches. For performance metrics, we covered those commonly used based on relevant standards, the survey papers, and the identified challenges, competitions, and benchmarks.</p><p>In this survey, we focus on performance evaluation and comparison of deepfake generation and detection methods. The metrics used for such performance evaluations are at the core of our discussions. In this section, we review the performance metrics that are commonly used to evaluate deepfake generation and detection algorithms. Note that all metrics covered in this section are also commonly used for evaluating performance of similar systems that are not for generating or detecting deepfakes. Therefore, this section can be seen as a very brief tutorial on general performance metrics.</p><p>In the last subsection, we also briefly discuss how the related performance metrics are covered in formal standards. By “formal standards”, we refer to standards defined following a formal procedure, often by one or more established standardisation bodies such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark6\">5</a> and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark7\">6</a>. Note that we consider a broad range of documents defined to be standards by standardisation bodies, e.g., International Telecommunication Union (ITU)<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark8\">7</a> recommendations and ISO technical reports (TRs).</p><h2>3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Confusion Matrix</h2><p>Deepfake detection is primarily a binary classification problem. A binary classifier takes an input that is  or  and outputs a binary value denoting it to be  or . For example, a deepfake detection system will take a suspected image as the input that may be  or  and output  or .</p><p>A fundamental tool used in evaluating a binary classifier is the  that summarises the success and failure of the classification model. On one axis are the two  values and on the other axis are the two  values. The classification is  (true positive and true negative) when the actual and the predicted values match. It is  (false positive and false negative) when the actual and predicted values do not match. Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark9\">1</a> shows the confusion matrix for a binary deepfake classifier (detector). The two cells in green, TP (the number of ) and TN (the number of ), indicate correct prediction results, and the two cells in red, FN (the number of ) and FP (the number of ), indicate two different types of errors when making incorrect prediction results.</p><p>\\\nTable 1: Confusion matrix for a binary classifier for detecting deepfake.</p><p>|    | fake (predicted) | real (predicted) |\n|----|----|----|\n| fake (actual) | TP | FN |\n| real (actual) | FP | TN |</p><h2>3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Precision and Recall</h2><p>Based on the four fundamental values introduced in Section <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark3\">3.1</a>, i.e., TP, TN, FP and FN, we define two important performance metrics for a binary classifier –  and .</p><p>Precision of a binary classifier is defined as the fraction of  samples among all the . In the confusion matrix, it is the fraction of true samples in the first column. It can be formally defined as Eq. (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark10\">1</a>).</p><p>When the “natural” ratio between positive and negative samples is significantly different from the test set, it is often useful to adjust the weight of the false positives, which leads to the  (wP) defined in Eq. (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark11\">2</a>), where  0 is a weight determined by the ratio between the negative and positive samples.</p><p>Recall of a binary classifier is the fraction of  samples among the  samples, as shown in Eq. (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark12\">3</a>). In the confusion matrix, it is the fraction of true samples in the first row.</p><p>Let us consider an example binary classifier that predicts if an image from a database containing both deepfake and real (authentic) images is fake or not. Precision of the classifier is the fraction of correctly classified images among all images classified as deepfake. On the other hand, recall is the fraction of deepfake images identified by the classifier, among all deepfake images in the database.</p><h2>3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; True and False Positive Rates</h2><p>Focusing on predicted positive samples, we can also define two metrics:  (TPR), also called  (CDR), as the fraction of the predicted positive samples among the actually positive samples and  (FPR), also called  (FAR), as the fraction of the predicted positive samples among the actually negative samples, as shown in Eqs. (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark13\">4</a>) and</p><p>(<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark14\">5</a>). In the confusion matrix, TPR is the fraction of predicted positive samples in the first row and FPR is the fraction of predicted positive samples in the second row. Note that TPR is basically a different name for  (Eq. (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark12\">3</a>)).</p><h2>3.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; True and False Negative Rates</h2><p>Similar to true and false positive rates, we can define two other rates focusing on negative predicted results:  (TNR) indicating the fraction of the predicted negative samples among the actually negative samples, and  (FNR) indicating the fraction of the predicted negative samples among the actually positive samples, as shown in Eqs. (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark15\">6</a>) and (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark16\">7</a>).</p><h2>3.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sensitivity and Specificity</h2><p>In some applications of binary classifiers, especially in biology and medicine, the TPR and the TNR are more commonly used, and they are often called  (TPR) and  (TNR). The focus of these two terms is on the two types of correctness of the predicted results. These are less used in deepfake-related research, hence, we will not refer to them in the remainder of this paper.</p><p>Focusing on error rates means that we need to consider the FPR and the FNR. These two rates normally conflict with each other so that reducing one rate normally leads to an increase in the other. Therefore, rather than trying to reduce both error rates at the same time, which is normally impossible, the more realistic task in practical applications is to find the right balance so that they are both below an acceptable threshold.</p><p>In some applications, such as biometrics, people are particularly interested in establishing the so-called  (EER) or  (CER), the point where the FPR and the FNR are equal. The EER/CER is not necessarily a good metric for some applications, especially when the two types of errors are of different levels of importance, e.g., for detecting critical deepfakes (e.g., fake news that can influence how people cast their votes) we can often tolerate more false positives (false alarms) than false negatives (missed alarms).</p><h2>3.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accuracy and F-Score</h2><p>In addition to the EER/CER, there are also other metrics that try to reflect both types of errors, in order to give a more balanced indication of the overall performance of a binary classifier. The two most commonly used are  and  (also called ). Both metrics can be defined based on the four fundamental values (TP, TN, FP, and FN).</p><p>Accuracy of a binary classifier is defined as the fraction of  samples (true positives and true negatives) among the total number of samples that have been classified, as shown in Eq. (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark17\">8</a>).</p><p>The F-score of a binary classifier is actually a family of metrics. Its general form can be described based on a parameter  as defined in Eq. (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark18\">9</a>).</p><p>The most widely used edition of all F-scores is the so-called , which is effectively the F-score with  = 1. More precisely, it is defined as shown in Eq. (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark19\">10</a>).</p><h2>3.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve and Area Under Curve</h2><p><strong>Receiver operating characteristic</strong> (ROC) curves are commonly used to measure the performance of binary classifiers that output a score (or probability) of prediction.</p><p>Consider the following. Let  be the set of all test samples and let the output scores  () (for all  ∈ ) lie in the interval [] on the real line. Let  ∈ [] be a prediction threshold for the model, and assume that the classifiers works as follows for all  ∈ :</p><p>\\\nIt is easy to see that, for  = , all the samples will be classified as positive, leading to FN = TN = 0 so TPR = FPR = 1; while for  = , all the samples will be classified as negative, leading to FP = TP = 0 so TPR = FPR = 0. For other threshold values between  and , the values of TPR and FPR will normally be between 0 and 1. By changing  from  to  continuously, we can normally get a continuous curve that describes how the TPR and FPR values change from (0,0) to (1,1) on the 2D plane. This curve is the ROC curve of the binary classifier.</p><p>For a random classifier, assuming that  () distributes uniformly on [] for the test set, we can mathematically derive its ROC curve being the TPR = FPR line, whose area under the ROC curve (AUC) is 0.5. For a binary classifier that performs better than a random predictor, we can also mathematically prove that its AUC is always higher than 0.5, with 1 being the best possible value. Note that no binary classifier can have an AUC below 0.5, since one can simply flip the prediction result to get a better predictor with an AUC of 1 − AUC. The relationship between the ROC and the AUC is graphically illustrated in Figure <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark20\">1</a>.</p><p>Another widely used performance metric for binary classifiers that can return a probability score for the predicted label is . For a binary classification with a true label  ∈ {0*,* 1} and an estimated probability  = Pr( = 1), the log loss per sample is the negative log-likelihood of the classifier given the true label, defined as shown in Eq. (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark21\">12</a>).</p><p>Given a testing set with  samples, the log loss score of a binary classifier can be calculated using Eq. (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark22\">13</a>), where  is 1 if the -th sample is true and 0 if false, and ˆ is the predicted probability of  = 1.</p><h2>3.10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Extension to Multi-class Classifiers</h2><p>All metrics that are defined based on the four basic values TP, TN, FP and FN can be easily extended to <strong>multi-class classification</strong> by considering the prediction to be true or false individually with respect to each class. For example, if the system is classifying animals (cats, dogs, horses, lions, tigers, etc.), then a true positive prediction of an image to be of a cat, would simultaneously be true negative predictions for the remaining classes (dogs, horses, lions, tigers, etc.). If an image of a cat is incorrectly predicted to be that of a dog, it would be a false negative with respect to a cat, a false positive with respect to a dog, and a true negative with respect to all other classes.</p><h2>3.11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perceptual Quality Assessment (PQA) Metrics</h2><p>By definition, the main goal of deepfakes is to make it hard or impossible for human consumers (listeners or viewers) to distinguish fake media from real media. Therefore, when evaluating the quality of deepfake media, the quality perceived by human consumers of the media is key. This calls for subjective assessment of the perceptual quality of the deepfake media as the “gold standard”. The most widely used subjective perceptual quality assessment (PQA) metric for audio-visual signals is  (MOS), which has been widely used by the signal processing and multimedia communication communities, including digital TV and other multimedia-related consumer applications. As its name implies, MOS is calculated by averaging the subjective scores given by a number of human judges, normally following a numerical scale between 1 and 5 or between 0 and 100. MOS has been used in some deepfake-related challenges (see Section <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark113\">5.2</a>) and also for evaluating and comparing the quality (realness/naturalness) of deepfake datasets (see Section <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark64\">4.6</a>).</p><p>As a general subjective PQA metric, MOS has been standardised by the ITU<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark23\">8</a>. There are also ITU standards defining more specific subjective Video Quality Assessment (VQA) metrics and the standard procedures one should follow to conduct VQA user studies, e.g., ITU-T Recommendation P.910 “Subjective video quality assessment methods for multimedia applications”<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark24\">9</a>. Note that the ITU standards focus more on traditional perceptual quality, i.e., how good a signal looks or sounds, even if it looks or sounds not real (e.g., too smooth). On the other hand, for deepfakes, the focus is rather different because what matters is the realness and naturalness of the created media, i.e., how real and natural it looks or sounds, even if it is of low quality. To some extent, we can also consider realness and naturalness as a special aspect of perceptual quality.</p><p>One major problem of subjective PQA metrics like MOS is the need to recruit human judges and to have a well-controlled physical testing environment and protocol, which are not easy for many applications. To help reduce the efforts and costs of conducting PQA-related user studies, various objective PQA metrics have been proposed, where the term “objective” refers to the fact that such metrics are human-free, i.e., automatically calculated following a computational algorithm or process. Depending on whether a reference exists, such objective PQA metrics can be largely split into three categories: full-reference (FR) metrics (when the original “perfect-quality” signal is available as the reference), reduced-reference (RR) metrics (when some features of the original “perfect-quality” signal are available as the reference), and no-reference (NR) metrics (when the original signal is unavailable or such an original signal does not exist). For deepfakes, normally NR or RR metrics are more meaningful because the “fake” part of the word means that part of the whole data does not exist in the real world, hence a full reference cannot be obtained. RR metrics are still relevant because deepfakes are often produced for a target’s specific attributes (e.g., face and voice), where the reduced reference will be such attributes. NR metrics will be useful to estimate the realness and naturalness of a deepfake, simulating how a human judge would rate it in a controlled subjective PQA user study.</p><p>PQA is a very active research area and many PQA metrics have been proposed, some of which have been widely used in real-world products and services, e.g.,  (MSE), <strong>peak signal-to-noise ratio</strong> (PSNR) and <strong>structural similarity index measure</strong> (SSIM) for FR PQA of digitalimages and videos defined as in Eqs. (14), (15), and (16), respectively, where X = {xi} n i is the reference (the original signal), Y = {yi} n i is the signal whose visual quality is assessed, n is the number of pixels in X and Y , L is the maximum possible pixel value of X and Y (e.g., 255 for 8-bit gray-scale images), c1 = (k1L) 2 and c2 = (k2L) 2 ) are two stabilising parameters (k1 = 0.01 and k2 = 0.03 by default). For more about PQA metrics for different types of multimedia signals, we refer readers to some relevant surveys [3, 51, 72].</p><h2>3.12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More about Standards</h2><p>Many of the basic performance metrics described in this section have been widely used by deepfake researchers as de facto standards, e.g., EER, log loss and MOS have been widely used in deepfake-related challenges (see Section <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark74\">5</a>). Also, the combination of precision, recall and F1-score has been widely used to assess performance of binary classifiers. While there have been a number of ITU standards on PQA to date, there does not seem to be many standardisation efforts on the performance metrics for evaluation of binary classifiers. This was the case until at least 2017, when ISO and IEC jointly set up the ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark28\">10</a>, a standardisation subcommittee (SC) focusing on AI under ISO/IEC JTC 1<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark29\">11</a>, the joint technical committee for standardising “information technology”.</p><p>One recent effort that ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42 made is to produce the ISO/IEC TR 24029-1:2021 “Artificial Intelligence (AI) – Assessment of the robustness of neural networks – Part 1: Overview”<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark30\">12</a>, a technical report (TR) that systematically covers many commonly used performance assessment concepts, methods and metrics. Although the technical report has “neural networks” in its title, most performance assessment concepts, methods and metrics included are common ones for all supervised machine learning models.</p><p>In terms of performance metrics, two other ongoing work items of the ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42 that deserve attention are as follows:</p><ul><li>ISO/IEC DTS (Draft Technical Specification) 4213 “Information technology – Artificial Intelligence – Assessment of machine learning classification performance”<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark31\">13</a></li><li>ISO/IEC AWI (Approved Work Item) TS (Technical Specifications) 5471 “Artificial intelligence – Quality evaluation guidelines for AI systems”<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark32\">14</a></li></ul><p>While the ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42 was created very recently, another standardisation subcommittee under ISO/IEC JTC1 has a much longer history of nearly 20 years: the ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 37<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark33\">15</a> that focuses on biometrics-related technology. This standardisation subcommittee is highly relevant for deepfake since deepfake faces can be used to spoof biometrics-based user authentication systems. In this context, the following three standards are of particular relevance:</p><p><strong>ISO/IEC 19795-1:2021 “Information technology – Biometric performance testing and reporting – Part 1: Principles and framework”</strong><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark34\">16</a>: This standard covers general metrics about evaluating biometric systems. Two major metrics in this context are  (FAR) and  (FRR), which refer to the standard FPR and FNR, respectively. This standard also deprecates the use of single-number metrics including the EER and AUC (which were widely used in biometrics-related research in the past).</p><p><strong>ISO/IEC 30107-1:2016 “Information technology – Biometric presentation attack detec-tion – Part 1: Framework”</strong><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark36\">17</a>: This standard defines a general framework about <strong>presentation attack detection</strong> (PAD) mechanisms, where the term “” refers to the “<em>presentation of an artefact or of human characteristics to a biometric capture subsystem in a fashion intended to in-terfere with system policy</em>”. It focuses on biometric recognition systems, where a PAD mechanism is a binary classifier trying to predict presentation attacks (also called attack presentations, e.g., fake faces) as positive and bona fide (real) presentations as negative.</p><p><strong>ISO/IEC 30107-3:2017 “Information technology – Biometric presentation attack detection – Part 3: Testing and reporting”</strong><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark37\">18</a>: This standard defines a number of special performance metrics for evaluating PAD mechanisms standardised in the ISO/IEC 30107-1:2016. Three such metrics look at error rates: <strong>attack presentation classification error rate</strong> (APCER) referring to the standard FPR, <strong>normal/bona fide presentation classification error rate</strong> (NPCER/BPCER) referring to the standard FNR, and <strong>average classification error rate</strong> (ACER) that is defined as the average of the APCER and the NPCER/BPCER. Such metrics have been used in biometrics-related challenges such as Face Anti-spoofing (Presentation Attack Detection) Challenges<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark38\">19</a>. When deepfake images or videos are used to spoof a biometric system, such standardised metrics will become relevant.</p><p>This section provided a comprehensive summary of performance metrics used for evaluating and bench-marking binary classifiers. It is rare that all such metrics are used for a specific application. Instead, one or several are chosen based on specific needs. For a deepfake detection system as a binary classifier, many researchers have chosen to use overall metrics such as accuracy, AUC, EER and log loss, but the combination of precision, recall and F1-score is also common. Some deepfake-related challenges and competitions have introduced their own specific metrics, some of which will be described in Section <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark74\">5</a>. The use of different performance metrics can make comparison of different reported results more difficult, so we hope the expected new ISO/IEC standard particularly ISO/IEC 4213 will help.</p><p>It is worth mentioning that, in addition to evaluating performance of deepfake detectors, the introduced performance metrics for evaluating binary classifiers can also be used to evaluate performance of deepfake generation methods by considering how deepfake detectors fail. For instance, organisers of the Voice Conversion Challenge 2018 and 2020 used this approach to benchmark how well voice conversion (VC) systems can generate high-quality fake speech samples.</p><p>Another point we would like to mention is that for deepfake videos there are two levels of performance metrics: those at the frame level (metrics of each frame), and those at the video level (metrics for the whole video). Generally speaking, the latter can be obtained by averaging the former for all frames, potentially following an adaptive weighting scheme, so that more important (key) frames will be counted more.</p><p>In this section, we cover all deepfake-related datasets we identified from the meta-review of deepfake-related survey papers, deepfake-related challenges, competitions and benchmarks covered, one online collection of deepfake-related datasets on GitHub<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark39\">20</a>, and the co-authors’ personal collections. Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark40\">2</a> shows basic information about these datasets. We explain them in four categories: deepfake image datasets, deepfake video datasets, deepfake audio/speech datasets, and hybrid deepfake datasets (mainly mixed image and video datasets).</p><p>Note that many datasets of real (authentic) media were also used by deepfake researchers for two purposes. First, any detectors would need both fake and real media to demonstrate their performance. Second, real media have also been used to train deepfake generators as the training set. In this section, we include only datasets containing deepfake media, some of which contain both deepfake and real media.</p><p>Some datasets, especially those created for deepfake-related challenges and competitions, have separate subsets for training and evaluation (testing) purposes. The split is necessary for such challenges and competitions, but not very useful for people who just want to use such datasets. Therefore, in this section when introducing such datasets we will ignore that level of details and focus on the total number of data including the number of real and fake samples.</p><h2>4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deepfake Image Datasets</h2><p><strong>SwapMe and FaceSwap dataset</strong> [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark215\">78</a>]: This dataset contains 4,310 images, including 2,300 real images and 2,010 fake images created using FaceSwap<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark41\">21</a> and the SwapMe iOS app (now discontinued).</p><p><strong>Fake Faces in the Wild (FFW) dataset</strong> [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark169\">32</a>]: This dataset contains 131,500 face images, including 78,500 images extracted from 150 videos in the FaceForensics dataset and 53,000 images extracted from 150 fake videos collected from YouTube.</p><p><strong>generated.photos datasets</strong><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark42\">22</a>: This is a number of commercial datasets provided by the Generated Media, Inc., with up to nearly 2.7 million synthetic face images generated by StyleGAN.

It covers diverse scenes, multiple persons in each scene and rich facial expressions. Different from other deepfake video datasets, WildDeepfake contains only face sequences not the full videos. This makes the dataset more like between an image dataset and a video one. We decided to keep it in the video category since the selection process was still more video-focused.</p><h2>4.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deepfake Audio/Speech Datasets</h2><p>Voice conversion (VC) is a technology that can be used to modify an audio and speech sample so that it appears as if spoken by a different (target) person than the original (source) speaker. Obviously, it can be used to generate deepfake audio/speech samples. The biennial Voice Conversion Challenge<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark58\">38</a> that started in 2016 is a major challenge series on VC. Datasets released from this challenge series are very different from other deepfake datasets: the deepfake data is not included in the original dataset created by the organisers of each challenge, but in the participant submissions (which are retargeted/fake utterances produced by VC systems built by participants). The challenge datasets also include the evaluation (listening-based) results of all submissions. Some fake utterances may be produced by DL-based VC systems, so we consider all datasets from this challenge series relevant for our purpose of this survey.</p><p><strong>Voice Conversion Challenge 2016 database</strong> [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark199\">62</a>]: The original dataset created by the challenge organisers was derived from the DAPS (Device and Produced Speech) Dataset [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark184\">47</a>]. It contains 216 utterances (162 for training and 54 for testing) per speaker from 10 speakers. Participating teams (17) developed their own VC systems for all 25 source-target speaker pairs, and then submitted generated utterances for evaluation. At least six participating teams used DL-related techniques (LSTM, DNN) in their VC systems (see Table 2 of the result analysis paper<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark59\">39</a>), so the submitted utterances can certainly be considered deepfakes.</p><p><strong>Voice Conversion Challenge 2018 database</strong> [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark181\">44</a>]: The original dataset created by the challenge organisers was also based on the DAPS dataset. It contains 116 utterances (81 for training and 35 for testing) per speaker from 12 speakers in two different tasks (called Hub and Spoke). Participating teams (23 in total, all for Hub and 11 for Spoke) developed their own VC systems for all 16 source-target speaker pairs, and then submitted generated utterances for evaluation. Comparing with the 2016 challenge, more participating teams used DL-related techniques (e.g., WaveNet, LSTM, DNN, CycleGAN, DRM – deep relational models, and ARBM – adaptive restricted Boltzmann machines) in their VC systems.</p><p><strong>Voice Conversion Challenge 2020 database</strong> [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark207\">70</a>]: This dataset is based on the Effective Multilingual Interaction in Mobile Environments (EMIME) dataset<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark60\">40</a>, a bilingual (Finnish/English, German/English, and Mandarin/English) database. It contains 145 utterances (120 for training and 25 for testing) per speaker from 14 speakers for two different tasks (with 4 × 4 and 4 × 6 source-target speaker pairs, respectively). Participating teams (33 in total, out of which 31 for Task 1 and 28 for Task 2) developed their own VC systems for all source-target speaker pairs, and then submitted generated utterances for evaluation. Comparing with the 2018 challenge, DL-based VC systems were overwhelmingly used by almost all participating teams (WaveNet and WaveGAN among the most used DL-based building blocks).</p><p>A major set of deepfake speech datasets were created for the  (Automatic Speaker Verification Spoofing and Countermeasures) Challenge<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark61\">41</a> (2015-2021, held biannually).

Two attack scenarios were considered: logical access (LA) involving spoofed (synthetic or converted) speech, and physical access (PA) involving replay attacks of previously recorded bona fide recordings). For our purpose in this survey, the LA scenario is more relevant. The LA part of the dataset includes 12,483 bona fide (real) utterances and 108,978 spoofed utterances. Some of the spoofed speech data for the LA scenario were produced using a generative model involving DL-based techniques such as long short-term memory (LSTM)<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark63\">43</a>, WaveNet [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark187\">50</a>], WaveRNN [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark165\">28</a>], WaveCycleGAN2 [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark195\">58</a>]. Note that the challenge organisers did not use the term “deepfake” explicitly, despite the fact that the DL-generated spoofed speech data can be considered as deepfakes.</p><p><strong>ASVspoof 2021 Challenge – Logical Access Database</strong> [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark151\">14</a>]: This dataset contains bona fide and spoofed speech data for the logical access (LA) task. The challenge is still ongoing and we did not find a detailed paper on the dataset, so cannot include more details other than its size (7.8 GB after compression). Although we did not see details of the generative algorithms used to produce spoofed speech data, we believe similar DL-based algorithms were used like for the 2019 challenge.</p><p><strong>ASVspoof 2021 Challenge – Speech Deepfake Database</strong> [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark152\">15</a>]: In 2021, the challenge included an explicitly defined track on deepfake, but the task description suggests that the organisers of the challenge considered a broader definition of the term “deepfake” by looking at spoofing human listeners rather than ASV (Automatic Speaker Verification) systems. The size of the dataset is 34.5 GB after compression.</p><p>Possibly because of the long history and wide participation of the community in the ASVspoof challenges for creating the dedicated datasets, there are very few other deepfake audio/speech datasets. One such dataset was created by a group of researcher from Baidu Research [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark142\">5</a>]. This dataset was created to demonstrate a proposed voice cloning method. It is relatively small, and contains 134 utterances, including 10 real ones, 120 cloned ones, and 4 manipulated ones. Another dataset was created by Google AI and Google News Initiative<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark65\">44</a>, but it was made part of the ASVspoof 2019 dataset.

The datasets were made available to registered participants of the competition only.</p><p> [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark162\">25</a>]: This dataset is named as “a versatile benchmark for comprehensive forgery analysis”. It contains 2,896,062 images and 221,247 videos, including 1,457,861 fake images and 121,617 fake videos. The videos and images cover seven image-level and eight video-level manipulation approaches, 36 different types of perturbations and more mixed perturbations, and a large number of annotation labels (6.3 million classification labels, 2.9 million manipulated area annotations and 221,247 temporal forgery segment labels). The dataset is being used for supporting the Face Forgery Analysis Challenge 2021<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark69\">48</a> at the SenseHuman 2021 (3rd Workshop on Sensing, Understanding and Synthesizing Humans)<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark70\">49</a>, co-located at the ICCV 2021 conference<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark71\">50</a>.</p><h2>4.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Deepfake Dataset Generator</h2><p> [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark211\">74</a>]: This is not actually a dataset per se, but a system for producing large datasets more automatically, including generating deepfake datasets. One may argue the automatically generated datasets are fake since they are not produced from real-world scenes.</p><h2>4.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subjective Quality of Deepfakes in Different Databases</h2><p>As mentioned in Section <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark73\">4.7</a>, subjective quality evaluation is necessary to evaluate the realness, realisticness, and naturalness of deepfake media. While there has been very limited work on this topic, in 2020, Jiang et al. [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark164\">27</a>] conducted a user study on realness of deepfake videos. They recruited 100 professional participants (most of whom are computer vision researchers), who were asked to evaluate the realness of 30 randomly selected videos from 7 deepfake video datasets (DeeperForensics-1.0, UADFV, DeepFake-TIMIT, Celeb-DF, FaceForensics++, Deep Fake Detection, and DFDC). Participants were asked to respond to the statement “The video clip looks real.” and gave scores following a five-point Likert scale (1 – clearly disagree, 2 – weakly disagree, 3 – borderline, 4 – weakly agree, 5 – clearly agree).</p><p>Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark72\">3</a> shows the results. Interestingly, we can see a huge difference between the realness levels of different datasets. What is probably quite surprising is that FaceForensics++, one of the most widely used deepfake datasets, has a very low MOS score and less than 9% of participants considered the 30 selected videos as real.</p><p>Table 3: Human-judged subjective quality (realness) of deepfake videos in 7 datasets. The MOS scores were not reported by <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark164\">Jiang et al.</a>, but calculated by us based on the raw data shown in Table 3 of [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark164\">27</a>].</p><h2>4.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Discussion: Datasets</h2><p>Among all deepfake image and video datasets, a significant majority are about face images and videos. This is not surprising since face swapping, face attribution manipulation, and fully synthesised face images are among the hottest topics within deepfake research and real-world applications. We hope more non-face deepfake image and video datasets can be produced to support a broader range of research activities on deepfake.</p><p>The subjective quality results shown in Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark72\">3</a> indicate that it is important to check realness of deep-fake media to support any performance evaluation or comparison. To ensure that the quality evaluation of datasets is fair, transparent and reliable, standard procedures need defining and a common pool of qualified human experts should be used.</p><p>Many authors of deepfake-related datasets attempted to classify such datasets into different generations. Chronologically speaking, we could broadly split such datasets into two generations: before 2019 and since 2019. Typically, datasets created before 2019 are relatively less advanced and smaller, while those created after 2019 tend to be larger, more diverse (i.e., covering more attributes), and of higher quality (i.e., produced by more advanced generative models). This can also be seen from the data in Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark72\">3</a>, in which the top two datasets (DeeperForensics-1 and Celeb-DF) fall within the new generation (2020), while others belong to the old generation. In addition to the two generations, a newer generation has also emerged in 2021: a number of very recent datasets started focusing on more realistic deepfakes (i.e., in the wild) or more specified areas of deepfakes (e.g., 10 focusing on multiple faces in the same video, and KoDF focusing on Korean faces). This trend shows that the deepfake research community has grown significantly in the past few years so that narrower topics have also started gaining attention and interest from some researchers.</p><p>This section reviews initiatives aiming to advance the state-of-the-art of detection and generation of synthetic or manipulated media (such as video, image and audio) via competitions or challenges open to the public, and ongoing benchmarks tackling specific problems.</p><p>The Deepfake Detection Challenge (DFDC)<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark75\">51</a> was an initiative promoted by an AI and Media Steering Committee<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark76\">52</a>, including BBC, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft and New York Times, and some universities around the world including the University of Oxford. The competition remained open from 5 September 2019 till 31 March 2020, and involved 3 stages. At first, the DFDC preview dataset was released. At a later stage, the DFDC full dataset was also made available to the 2,114 participants of the competition incorporating face and audio swap techniques for generation of deepfake content. At the final stage, the submitted models were evaluated using a test dataset (referred to as the “black box dataset”) of 10,000 videos which included  deepfake videos. The best performance on the black box dataset had an accuracy of 65.18%, according to the released results [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark159\">22</a>]. Submissions were ranked<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark78\">53</a> according to the overall log loss score, as defined in Eq. (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark22\">13</a>). All top five ranked models (the winner had the lowest overall log loss) are available on GitHub. Results indicate how challenging the detection of deepfake is since the best accuracy was low and “<em>many submissions were simply random</em>”, according to Dolhansky et al.

The first top ranked model used MTCNN (Multi-tasked Cascaded Convolutional Network), the second used WS-DAN (Weakly Supervised Data Augumentation Network), and the third used the EfficientNetB7 architecture. Meta compiling the common themes observed in the winning models, they were: clever augmentations, architectures, and absence of forensics methods. Moving forward, they called for “<em>solutions that go beyond analysing images and video. Considering context, provenance, and other signals may be the way to improve deepfake detection models</em>”.</p><p>\\\nThe Automatic Speaker Verification Spoofing And Countermeasures Challenge Workshop (ASVspoof)<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark79\">54</a> has been running biennially since 2015. This competition is organised by an international consortium that includes Inria and EURECOM (France), University of Eastern Finland, National Institute of Informatics (Japan), and Institute for Infocomm Research (Singapore). This year the ASVspoof challenge includes, for the first time, a sub-challenge focused on  where the envisioned use case is an adversary trying to fool a human listener. The metric used for evaluating performance of submitted solutions (i.e., classifiers) is EER. Four baseline solutions<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark80\">55</a> (also called “countermeasures”), each using a different technique, were made available to participants with their corresponding EER metric values. The ASVspoof 2021 Speech Deepfake Database containing audio recordings with original and spoofed utterances has also been made available. The competition involves three phases<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark81\">56</a>: a progress phase, an evaluation phase and a post-evaluation phase; it is unclear how teams move from one phase to the next. More information about the 2021 competition is available in the published evaluation plan [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark150\">13</a>]. The organisers of the competition noted that they opted for the EER as the performance evaluation met-ric for countermeasures submitted to the speech deepfake task for legacy reasons. They acknowledged, however, that “<em>EER reporting is deprecated</em> ” by the ISO/IEC 19795-1:2021<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark82\">57</a> standard. Despite the fact that only the 2021 ASVspoof competition contained a track explicitly related to deepfake, some data in the ASVspoof 2019 dataset (Logical Access task) used for the 2019 competition was generated using DL-based algorithms as mentioned in Section <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark35\">4</a>. We expect that this also holds for the ASVspoof 2021 dataset (Logical Access task). The ASVspoof 2019 competition used the EER as secondary metric; the primary performance metric used was the tandem detection cost function (t-DCF) [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark200\">63</a>]. According to its evaluation plan [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark206\">69</a>], t-DCF assesses the performance of the whole tandem system whereby “<em>a CM [countermeasure] serves as a ‘gate’ to determine whether a given speech input originates from a bona fide (genuine) user, before passing it the main biometric verifier (the ASV system)</em>”. It is calculated according to Eq. (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark83\">17</a>), where  cm () and  cm() are, respectively, “<em>the miss rate and the false alarm rate of the CM system at threshold s</em>”.</p><p>For further information about Eq.

Its first two editions were held at the 2019 and 2020 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR 2020), respectively. Its third edition was moved to be co-located with the 2021 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV 2021). This competition series was organised by a group of researchers from academia and industry in China, Mexico, Spain, Finland and the US. The 2021 competition was focused on 3D high-fidelity mask attacks, and followed a 2-phased<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark88\">61</a> process. The first phase is the “development phase”; it started in April 2021 when the CASIA-SURF HiFiMask dataset<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark89\">62</a> was released to participants. The second phase is the “final ranking phase” (June 2021), when the competition ended. The competition adopted the following performance metrics for evaluation<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark90\">63</a> of the solutions submitted: attack presentation classification error rate (APCER), normal/bona fide presentation classification error rate (NPCER/BPCER), and average classification error rate (ACER), in accordance with the ISO/IEC 30107-3:2017<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark91\">64</a> standard.

The organisers of the benchmark made the FaceForensics++ dataset available for training. Manipulated videos (4,000 in total) were created using four techniques, i.e., two computer graphics-based approaches (Face2Face and FaceSwap) and two learning-based approaches (DeepFakes and Neural Textures). The deepfakes videos were generated using a slightly modified version of FaceSwap<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark93\">66</a>, and the Neural Textures videos were created using the approach proposed by Thies et al. [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark198\">61</a>]. The benchmark test dataset is created from the collection of 1,000 images randomly selected from either the manipulation methods or the original videos [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark193\">56</a>]. Participants have to submit results to the benchmark, rather then code like other competitions; this is illustrated in Figure <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark94\">4a</a>. The outcome of a submission is illustrated in Figure <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark94\">4b</a>, where the scores are a measure of accuracy (Eq.

It has been organised annually<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark97\">68</a> starting from 2017 under the name of DARPA MFC. In 2020, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) initiated the  as a new evaluation platform, based on their previous experiences with the DARPA MFC series, to make the participation more convenient for all researchers. In OpenMFC 2020, two deepfake-related tasks were included for the first time: Image GAN Manipulation Detection (IGMD) and Video GAN Manipulation Detection (VGMD). The organisers provided an image evaluation dataset for the IGMD task, containing 1,000 images from over 200 image journals<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark98\">69</a>, and a video evaluation dataset for the VGMD task, including over 100 test videos. Furthermore, they provided the datasets<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark99\">70</a> used in the previous MFC challenges as development datasets. The challenge is composed of two main phases for development and evaluation, respectively, and a pre-challenge phase for quality control testing. For evaluation of submissions, AUC-ROC is used as the primary metric. Furthermore, CDR@FAR, where CDR refers to correct detection rate or TPR (Eq. (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark13\">4</a>)) and FAR refers to false alarm rate or FPR (Eq. (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark14\">5</a>)), is also used as a metric [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark186\">49</a>]. The DeeperForensics Challenge 2020<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark100\">71</a> is a deepfake face detection challenge held at the 2020 ECCV</p><p>SenseHuman Workshop<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark101\">72</a>.

The challenge involved two phases: the “development phase” that started in August 2020 allowing 100 successful sub-missions, and the “final test phase” that started in October 2020 allowing 2 successful submissions until the end of the month. The submissions were evaluated using the binary cross-entropy loss (BCELoss) metric, calculated according to Eq. (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark95\">18</a>), where  is the number of videos in the hidden test set,  is the ground truth label of video  (fake:1, real:0), and () is the predicted probability that video  is fake.</p><p>Results<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark102\">73</a> of the competition were discussed by Jiang et al. [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark163\">26</a>]. The top solution used three models, i.e., EfficientNet-B0, EfficientNet-B1 and EfficientNet-B2, for classification. The second top used EfficientNet-B5 for both an image-based model and a video-based model. The third ranked solution used a 3D convolutional neural network (3DCNN).</p><p>\\\nThe Face Forgery Analysis Challenge 2021<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark104\">74</a> is a competition hosted at the 2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR 2021). It is organised by researchers from a number of organisations in China including universities and SenseTime Research (the research arm of SenseTime<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark105\">75</a>, one of the major AI “unicorns” in China). The challenge aims to advance the state-of-the-art in detection of photo-realistic manipulation of images and videos. Participants are able to use a large annotated face dataset (i.e., the ForgeryNet dataset) that was obtained by applying a number of techniques for manipulation (15) and perturbation (36) to train their solutions. The phases comprise of Forgery Image Analysis, Forgery Video Analysis, Forgery Video Temporal Localization phases, and the final phase (i.e., “private test”) where participants’ models will be tested against an unseen dataset. The following metrics will be used [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark162\">25</a>]: AUC, average precision (AP) at some “temporal Intersection over Union” (AP@tIoU) compared to a threshold  ∈ [0*.,* 0*.*95], and average recall (AR) at  (AR@) where  is the top  labels returned for multi-class classifiers.</p><p>The 2020 CelebA-Spoof Face Anti-Spoofing Challenge<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark106\">76</a> was hosted at the 16 European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV 2020). The challenge ran between August and October 2020, and aimed to advance the state-of-the-art in detecting “<em>whether a presented face is live or spoof</em> ” [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark213\">76</a>]. The organisers made the face CelebA-Spoof dataset available for the competition containing rich annotation across a range of attributes. The competition only had one phase where participants submitted their solutions to be evaluated against a test dataset; the spoof class was considered as “positive” and the live class as “negative”. Metric TPR@FPR was used and collected at three points where the TPR when FPR = 104 determined the final ranking. The top three finalists (see Figure <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark103\">5</a>) used deep learning models ResNet, EfficientNet-B7, and a novel architecture combining Central Difference Convolutional Networks (CDCN) and Dual Attention Network (DAN). The two top ranked solutions used different strategies to boost their models’ performance: a heuristic voting scheme was used by the top-ranked solution, and a weight-after-sorting strategy was used by the second ranked solution.</p><p>The 2021 CSIG Challenge<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark107\">77</a> is the second edition of a challenge organised by the China Society of Image and Graphics<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark108\">78</a>. The 2021 challenge has the Fake Media Forensic Challenge<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark109\">79</a> as its 6 track, co-organised by CSIG’s Digital Media Forensics and Security Technical Committee<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark110\">80</a> and Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark111\">81</a>. This track has two tasks, one on deepfake video detection, and the other on deepfake audio/speech detection. For the deepfake video detection task, the dataset used contains a public training set with 10,000 sound-free face videos (including 4,000 fake videos), a public test set with 20,000 face videos (the percentage of deepfake videos is unknown to participants), and a private test set that will be determined and used at the final session for selecting the winners. All videos contain faces of Eastern Asian people, and cover a wide range of parameters such as multiple resolutions and encoding quality factors, the use of blurring or sharpening filters, and added noise. Deepfake videos were created using public tools including DeepFaceLab [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark190\">53</a>], Faceswap<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark112\">82</a>, Faceswap-GAN, Recycle-GAN [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark143\">6</a>] and ALAE (Adversarial Latent Autoencoders) [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark191\">54</a>]. For the deepfake audio/speech detection task, the dataset used contains a public training set with 10,000 speech samples (including 6,000 fake ones), a public test set with 20,000 face videos (the percentage of deepfake videos is unknown to participants), and a private test set for the final session (the same as the deepfake video detection task). The tools used for generating the fake speech samples include TTS (text-to-speech) voice synthesis tools and VC (voice conversion) tools. The main TTS tools used include open-source tools such as DeepVoice, TensorFlowTTS<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark114\">83</a> and GAN-TTS [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark145\">8</a>] and commercial software tools such as those from iFlytek<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark115\">84</a> and IBM. The main VC tools used include Adaptive-VC and CycleGAN-VC [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark166\">29</a>]. For both deepfake detection tasks, the performance metric used is log loss.</p><p>2020 China Artificial Intelligence<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark116\">85</a> was the second edition of a Chinese AI competition open for the general public to participate, organised by the municipal government of the City of Xiamen in China. In 2020, it had two sub-competitions, Multimedia Information Recognition Technology Competition<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark117\">86</a> and Language and Knowledge Technology Competition<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark118\">87</a>. The Multimedia Information Recognition Technology Competition included two tasks on deepfakes: one on deepfake video detection<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark119\">88</a> and one on deepfake audio/speech detection<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark120\">89</a>. The deepfake video detection task used 3,000 videos, and log loss was used as the sole performance metric. The deepfake audio/speech detection task used 20,000 audio samples (mostly in Chinese, and the remaining in English), and EER was used as the sole performance metric. For both tasks, the ratio between real and deepfake samples was 1:1. We did not find where to download the datasets used for the tasks nor a more detailed technical description of the datasets. For the deepfake video detection tasks, the top two winning teams (with an A prize) were from Netease (Hangzhou) Network Co., Ltd. and Beijing RealAI Technology Co., Ltd., followed by three other teams winning a B prize: Xiamen Fuyun Information Technology Co., Ltd.; Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences; and Wuhan Daqian Information Technology Co., Ltd. For the deepfake audio/speech task, there was no team winning an A prize, but one team winning a B prize: SpeakIn Technologies Co., Ltd. The final results of some teams were published, but some teams were allowed to hide their results. We did not find a detailed technical report summarising the results and explaining the work of the winning teams.</p><p>One of the B-prize winning team is from Beijing RealAI Technology Co., Ltd., a Chinese company active in deepfake-related R&amp;D.</p><p>The Voice Conversion Challenge<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark121\">90</a> is a biennial competition that has been running since 2016. The challenge and the corresponding workshop, hosted at the INTERSPEECH conference<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark122\">91</a>, is supported by the SynSig (Speech Synthesis Special Interest Group)<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark123\">92</a> of the International Speech Communication Association (ISCA)<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark124\">93</a>. Its aim is to promote progress in voice conversion (VC) technology that can be applied to a number of positive and negative use cases, such as spoofing voice biometric systems. The 2020 challenge focused on speaker conversion, a sub-problem of VC, and included two tasks. For the first task “intra-lingual semi-parallel voice conversion”, participants had to develop 16 VC systems (speaker-pair combinations) including male and female speakers and English sentences, using the provided Voice Conversion Challenge 2020 database v1.0 for training (refer to Section <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark35\">4</a>). For the second task “cross-lingual voice conversion”, participants had to develop 24 VC systems, also including male and female speakers, but uttering sentences in three languages (Finnish, German and Mandarin), based on the provided training dataset. Figure <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark126\">6</a> illustrates the process of training and generation of VC systems.</p><p>Submissions were evaluated for “<em>perceived naturalness and similarity through listening tests</em>”<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark125\">94</a>. As such, the organisers used  [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark207\">70</a>] and recruited both native and non-native English speakers (i.e., Japanese native speakers) via crowd-sourcing for the listening tests. Naturalness (answering the question “How natural does the converted voice sound? ”) was measured using the metric MOS (covered in Section 4.6), and similarity (answering the question “how similar the converted voice sound comparing source and target speakers? ”) was measured in terms of speaker recognition as “same” or “different”, as elaborated by Wester et al. [68]. Tests also focused on the effects of language differences on the performance of VC systems submitted to the competition. The most popular CNN/RNN/GANbased VC systems submitted used WaveNet, WaveRNN, and Parallel WaveGAN. Results indicated that, in terms of similarity, the best performing VC systems were as good as natural speech but none reached human-level naturalness for task 1; scores were lower for task 2 which was more complex [70]. The organisers of the 2020 competition also used objective evaluation [12]. The metrics used for evaluation of speaker similarity were: equal error rate (EER), false acceptance rate of target (P tar fa ), miss rate of source (P src miss), and cosine similarity of speaker embedding vectors (cos-sim) according to Eq. (19) where A is the speaker embedding vectors for the converter audio and B is the speaker embedding vectors for the original audio. The performance of the VC systems as a spoof countermeasure was also evaluated using EER, while to evaluate the quality of the subjective MOS obtained via listening tests, a DL-based model to predict MOS, called MOSNet [43], was used. Lastly, to evaluate intelligibility of the converted transcribed speech, in comparison with the original transcribed speech, the word error rate (WER) [4] was used. WER is calculated according to Eq. (20) where I refers to insertions, D refers to deletions, S refers to substitutions, and N refers to the total number of words in the original transcript.</p><p>The Deepfake Africa Challenge (2021)<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark129\">95</a> is a new initiative of the AI Africa Expo, in partnership with a film and media production company (Wesgro) and the African Data Science competition platform Zindi. Its aim is “<em>to create convincing deepfakes to highlight the power of this synthetic media, illustrating its creative potential for exploitation for both positive and negative outcomes and focusing debate about its ethical use / misuse in an African context</em> ”. Eligible participants were required to be citizens and residents of the African continent. Submissions, accepted up to end of July 2021, can be either video or audio. Evaluation of submissions is defined in terms of artistic creativity, relevance of challenge topic, and innovation in the process of generation as long as participants use tools and packages publicly available. The top three finalists will receive a prize, present their work at the Expo, and will have to grant copyrights to Zindi. Unlike the other competitions reviewed in this section, which were focused on advancing the state-of-the-art in detection of synthetic or manipulated media, this competition focused on the generation of deepfake which seems more humanities-centred. This is a trend observed in arts [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark168\">31</a>] and culture [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark194\">57</a>].5.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Generation and Detection of Manipulated Media</p><p>The DeepFake Game Competition (DFGC)<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark132\">96</a> is in its first edition, hosted at the 2021 International Joint Conference on Biometrics (IJCB 2021). Its organisers are mainly from the Institute of Automation Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA). The idea of the competition was to promote an adversarial game between agents pushing for advances in both deepfake creation and detection. In order to achieve this, a 6-stage protocol was designed interleaving three creation phase (C-phase) and detection phase (D-phase), typically one week apart; submissions closed in April 2021. Both C-phases and D-phases were bound to the Celeb-DF (v2) dataset [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark177\">40</a>], containing 6,229 videos (590 real/original videos and 5,639 fake/manipulated videos), for training purposes. As such, submissions to a C-phase would consist of datasets extracted from Celeb-DF (v2) which included novel face-swap approaches to obtain evaluation results. Submissions to a D-phase would consist of detection models/codes to obtain evaluation results. The models submitted for a D-phase were evaluated against the datasets submitted for the previous C-phase [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark189\">52</a>]. The metrics used for evaluation<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark133\">97</a> were: a detection score, used for evaluation of a D-phase, and a creation score, used for evaluation of a C-phase.

The organisers of the competition also applied the top two detection models to unseen datasets (DFDC and FaceForensics++) and noticed that they do not generalise well.</p><p>This section presents a meta-review of 12 selected deepfake-related survey papers, including eight published in English [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark153\">16</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark182\">45</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark183\">46</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark201\">64</a>–<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark203\">66</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark208\">71</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark210\">73</a>] and four published in Chinese [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark144\">7</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark175\">38</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark178\">41</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark196\">59</a>]. It covers the following aspects in a systematic manner: definitions and scope, performance metrics, datasets, challenges/competitions/benchmarks, performance comparison, key challenges and recommendations.</p><p>The meta-review aims at drawing some high-level insights for monitoring future development of deepfake-related technologies and their applications.</p><h2>6.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Definitions and Scope</h2><p>As we discussed in Section <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark0\">1.1</a>, among researchers, practitioners and law makers there is no universally accepted definition of “deepfake” as a term. This is also reflected in how the authors of the 12 survey papers considered this aspect. Most authors talked about the history of deepfakes and pointed out that the term reflects the combination of “deep learning” and “fake”, but some used a broader definition, e.g., Lyu [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark182\">45</a>] defined deepfake as “<em>high quality fake videos and audios generated by AI algorithms</em>”. Some authors also referred to deepfake-related legislations, but none of them pointed out that the definitions in some such legislations are completely different from the more technical definitions involving the use of deep learning. No authors discussed the blurred boundary between deepfakes and non-deepfakes, although some surveys actually cover both, e.g., Tao et al. [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark196\">59</a>] focused on speech forgery and did not explicitly highlight “deepfake”.</p><p>In terms of the scope, while some authors (correctly) considered all types of media that can be produced by deepfake-related techniques [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark175\">38</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark178\">41</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark182\">45</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark202\">65</a>], some considered only a narrow scope, e.g., authors of [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark144\">7</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark201\">64</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark208\">71</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark210\">73</a>] considered only videos, and only authors of [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark153\">16</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark203\">66</a>] have considered images and videos. Another phenomenon we observed is that many authors focused more on face images and videos, and authors of three surveys [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark153\">16</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark201\">64</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark208\">71</a>] even limited the definition of “deepfake” to such a narrow scope:</p><ul><li>Deshmukh and Wankhade [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark153\">16</a>] defined it as “<em>a technology which creates fake images or videos of targeted humans by swapping their faces [by] another character saying or doing things that are not absolutely done by them and humans start believing in such fake as it is not always recognisable with the everyday human eye</em>”;</li><li>Younus and Hasan [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark208\">71</a>] considered deepfake as a technique allowing “<em>any computer user to exchange the face of one person with another digitally in any video</em>”; and</li><li>Tolosana et al. [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark201\">64</a>] defined it as “<em>a deep learning based technique able to create fake videos by swapping the face of a person by the face of another person</em>”.</li></ul><p>Such unnecessarily narrow definitions and scopes can lead to confusion and do not help exchanges between researchers and practitioners working on different types of deepfakes.</p><p>We call on more researchers to accept a broader definition of “deepfake” so that highly realistic/natural media of any kind generated by a sophisticated automated method (often AI-based) is considered deepfake. Here, we provide two examples of such a broader definition: the image2image (or pixel2pixel) technique [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark217\">80</a>] that allows the production of deepfake images and videos of any objects (e.g., the “horse2zebra” deepfake image shown in Figure <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark135\">7</a>), and the the so-called “deepfake geography [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark214\">77</a>]”, where AI-based techniques are used to generate realistic-looking satellite images.</p><p>\\\nAnother important fact missed or not sufficiently discussed by authors of all the 12 surveys is that deepfake techniques can be used for positive applications, e.g., creative arts, entertainment and protecting online users’ privacy. We call for more researchers and practitioners to follow the proposal in the 2020 Tencent AI White Paper [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark197\">60</a>] to start using the more neutral-sounding term “deep synthesis”. Accordingly,we can use different words for different types of data generated using “deep synthesis” techniques, e.g., “deep art”, “deep animation”, “deep music”, and “deepfake”. While authors of the 12 survey papers did not recognise the positive applications of “deepfake” technologies, some other researchers did, e.g., organisers of the Voice Conversion Challenge 2020<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark136\">99</a> who said the VC technology (for speech deepfake) “<em>is useful in many applications, such as customizing audio book and avatar voices, dubbing, movie industry, teleconferencing, singing voice modification, voice restoration after surgery, and cloning of voices of historical persons</em>”.</p><p>Surprisingly, none of the 12 surveys have covered performance metrics explicitly. Some directly used performance metrics to explain and compare performance of covered deepfake generation and detection methods. The most used performance metrics include accuracy, ERR, and AUC. This may be explained by the page constraints of such survey papers, which did not allow the authors to extend their coverage significantly to cover performance metrics systematically. The subjective quality of deepfakes is an area least covered by the surveys, which seems related to an unbalanced coverage on deepfake generation and deepfake detection in terms of performance evaluation and comparison (the former much less than the latter).</p><p>Many of the 12 survey papers list a number of deepfake-related datasets, but none of them have coverage as complete as ours shown in Section <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark35\">4</a>. For instance, none of the surveys have covered the Voice Conversion Challenge 2016/2018/2020 datasets and the ASVspoof 2019/2021 datasets are covered briefly only in two surveys [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark175\">38</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark196\">59</a>]. In addition, more recent deepfake datasets especially those released in 2021 are also not covered by any of the surveys. We believe that our Section <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark35\">4</a> is the most comprehensive review of deepfake-related datasets so far.</p><p>Some survey papers include datasets that are likely deepfakes, e.g., Verdoliva [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark203\">66</a>] covered many general fake image datasets where the manipulated images were not generated by deep learning or even AI-based methods, and some surveys (e.g., [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark175\">38</a>]) mentioned ASVspoof 2015 datasets but we did not see the use of deep learning for generating data used in the dataset.</p><p>Many surveys cover deepfake-related challenges, competitions and benchmarks. The coverage is, however, mostly limited, and some challenges (e.g., the Voice Conversion Challenge 2016/2018/2020 and the two Chinese challenges we covered in Section <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark74\">5</a>) are not covered by any of the surveys. The level of detail of challenges, competitions and benchmarks is also normally limited, compared with what we chose to include in Section <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark74\">5</a>. Similar to the datasets we covered in Section <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark35\">4</a>, we believe that our coverage of deepfake-related challenges, competitions and benchmarks in Section <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark74\">5</a> is also the most comprehensive so far.</p><p>Most surveys have a good coverage of related methods for deepfake generation and detection, but only some explicitly covered performance comparison between different methods [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark175\">38</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark183\">46</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark201\">64</a>].</p><p>Among all the survey papers, Li et al. [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark175\">38</a>] conducted the most comprehensive study on performance of different deepfake detection methods. In addition to showing the performance metrics of a number of deepfake detection methods in Table 3 of [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark175\">38</a>], they also looked at general characteristics and issues of different types of deepfake detection methods, as shown in Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark137\">4</a>. Furthermore, they also looked at research on robustness of deepfake detection methods against adversarial samples, referring to some work that showed a lack of such robustness.</p><p>Due to quality issues of many deepfake-related datasets (discussed in Section <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark64\">4.6</a>), we need to treat any performance metrics and comparison of different detection methods with caution. Without testing all methods on a sufficiently large, diverse and high-quality deepfake dataset, the performance comparison results can be misleading. This highlights the importance of having more challenges, competitions and benchmarks to encourage performance comparison on standard datasets and using consistent performance metrics.</p><p>The authors of some surveys identified some key challenges and future research directions for the deepfake community.</p><p>Not surprisingly, how to develop more robust, scalable, generalisable and explainable deepfake detection methods is one of the most discussed key challenges and also a major future research direction [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark144\">7</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark153\">16</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark175\">38</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark178\">41</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark182\">45</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark196\">59</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark202\">65</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark203\">66</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark208\">71</a>]. Considering the arms race between deepfake generation and detection, this research direction will likely remain the hottest topic in deepfake research.</p><p>A couple of surveys [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark175\">38</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark203\">66</a>] mentioned fusion as a key future research direction, where “fusion” refers to combining different methods (e.g., combining multiple detectors of different types) and data sources (e.g., jointly considering audio-visual analysis) to achieve better performance for deepfake detection. Lyu [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark182\">45</a>] suggested that, for detection of deepfake videos, we need to consider video-level detection more, which can be considered fusion of detection results of all video frames.</p><p>The authors of three surveys, Lyu [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark182\">45</a>] , Deshmukh and Wankhade [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark153\">16</a>] and Younus and Hasan [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark208\">71</a>], argued that better (higher-quality, more up-to-date, and more standard) deepfake datasets are needed to develop more effective deepfake detection methods. Lyu [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark182\">45</a>] also suggested that we need to consider  effects in training data and improve the evaluation of datasets. We agree with them on these points.</p><p>Tao et al. [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark196\">59</a>] suggested that low-cost deepfake generation/detection should be considered as a future research direction. This is a valid recommendation since lightweight methods will allow less powerful computing devices (e.g., IoT devices) to benefit from such technologies.</p><p>Two Chinese surveys [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark175\">38</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark178\">41</a>] also mentioned the need to have new deepfake-related legislations combating malicious use of deepfakes and the need to train end users such as journalists. This is likely an area where interdisciplinary research can grow.</p><p>There are also other ad-hoc recommendations given by the authors of some surveys. For example, Lyu [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark182\">45</a>] argued that deepfake detection should be considered a (more complicated) multi-class, multi-label and local detection problem. Tolosana et al. [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark201\">64</a>] discussed specific research directions for different deep-fake generation methods (face synthesis, identity swap, attribute manipulation, and expression swap). Liang et al. [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark178\">41</a>] and Li et al. [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark175\">38</a>] recommended more active defence mechanisms such as using digital watermarking and blockchain technologies to build trustworthy media frameworks against deepfakes.</p><p>The rapid growth in the capability to manipulate media or create synthetic media which look realistic and natural paved the way for deepfakes. At first, this paper adopted a critical approach to look at different definitions of the term “deepfake”. In that regard, we point out the different contradicting definitions and call for the wider community to consider how to define a new term that has a more consistent scope and meaning. For instance, replacing “deepfake” by “deep synthesis” can be more inclusive by embracing positive applications of deepfake techniques, e.g., in entertainment and for simulation purposes.</p><p>This paper provided a comprehensive overview of multiple aspects of the deepfake ecosystem drawing from the research literature and other online sources published in two languages: English and Chinese. It covers commonly used performance metrics and standards, related datasets, challenges, competitions and benchmarks. It also presents a meta-review of 12 selected deepfake-related survey papers published in 2020 and 2021, covering not only the above mentioned aspects, but also highlighting key challenges and recommendations.</p><p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; Darius Afchar, Vincent Nozick, Junichi Yamagishi, and Isao Echizen. 2018.

      "content": "<p>Go 1.21 includes a preview of a change to  loop scoping that we plan to ship in Go 1.22, removing one of the most common Go mistakes.</p><p>If you’ve written any amount of Go code, you’ve probably made the mistake of keeping a reference to a loop variable past the end of its iteration, at which point it takes on a new value that you didn’t want. For example, consider this program:</p><pre><code>func main() {\n    done := make(chan bool)\n\n    values := []string{\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"}\n    for _, v := range values {\n        go func() {\n            fmt.Println(v)\n            done &lt;- true\n        }()\n    }\n\n    // wait for all goroutines to complete before exiting\n    for _ = range values {\n        &lt;-done\n    }\n}\n</code></pre><p>\\\nThe three created goroutines are all printing the same variable , so they usually print “c”, “c”, “c”, instead of printing “a”, “b”, and “c” in some order.</p><p>\\\nAlthough concurrency is often involved, it need not be. This example has the same problem but no goroutines:</p><pre><code>func main() {\n    var prints []func()\n    for i := 1; i &lt;= 3; i++ {\n        prints = append(prints, func() { fmt.Println(i) })\n    }\n    for _, print := range prints {\n        print()\n    }\n}\n</code></pre><p>\\\nThis kind of mistake has caused production problems at many companies, including a <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1619047\">publicly documented issue at Lets Encrypt</a>. In that instance, the accidental capture of the loop variable was spread across multiple functions and much more difficult to notice:</p><pre><code>// authz2ModelMapToPB converts a mapping of domain name to authz2Models into a\n// protobuf authorizations map\nfunc authz2ModelMapToPB(m map[string]authz2Model) (*sapb.Authorizations, error) {\n    resp := &amp;sapb.Authorizations{}\n    for k, v := range m {\n        // Make a copy of k because it will be reassigned with each loop.\n        kCopy := k\n        authzPB, err := modelToAuthzPB(&amp;v)\n        if err != nil {\n            return nil, err\n        }\n        resp.Authz = append(resp.Authz, &amp;sapb.Authorizations_MapElement{\n            Domain: &amp;kCopy,\n            Authz: authzPB,\n        })\n    }\n    return resp, nil\n}\n</code></pre><p>\\\nThe author of this code clearly understood the general problem, because they made a copy of , but it turns out  used pointers to fields in  when constructing its result, so the loop also needed to make a copy of .</p><p>\\\nTools have been written to identify these mistakes, but it is hard to analyze whether references to a variable outlive its iteration or not. These tools must choose between false negatives and false positives. The  analyzer used by  and  opts for false negatives, only reporting when it is sure there is a problem but missing others. Other checkers opt for false positives, accusing correct code of being incorrect. We ran an analysis of commits adding  lines in open-source Go code, expecting to find bug fixes. Instead we found many unnecessary lines being added, suggesting instead that popular checkers have significant false positive rates, but developers add the lines anyway to keep the checkers happy.</p><p>\\\nOne pair of examples we found was particularly illuminating:</p><p>This diff was in one program:</p><pre><code>     for _, informer := range c.informerMap {\n+        informer := informer\n         go informer.Run(stopCh)\n     }\n</code></pre><p>\\\nAnd this diff was in another program:</p><pre><code>     for _, a := range alarms {\n+        a := a\n         go a.Monitor(b)\n     }\n</code></pre><p>\\\nOne of these two diffs is a bug fix; the other is an unnecessary change. You can’t tell which is which unless you know more about the types and functions involved.</p><p>For Go 1.22, we plan to change  loops to make these variables have per-iteration scope instead of per-loop scope. This change will fix the examples above, so that they are no longer buggy Go programs; it will end the production problems caused by such mistakes; and it will remove the need for imprecise tools that prompt users to make unnecessary changes to their code.</p><p>\\\nTo ensure backwards compatibility with existing code, the new semantics will only apply in packages contained in modules that declare  or later in their  files. This per-module decision provides developer control of a gradual update to the new semantics throughout a codebase. It is also possible to use  lines to control the decision on a per-file basis.</p><p>\\\nOld code will continue to mean exactly what it means today: the fix only applies to new or updated code. This will give developers control over when the semantics change in a particular package. As a consequence of our <a href=\"https://go.dev/blog/toolchain\">forward compatibility work</a>, Go 1.21 will not attempt to compile code that declares  or later. We included a special case with the same effect in the point releases Go 1.20.8 and Go 1.19.13, so when Go 1.22 is released, code written depending on the new semantics will never be compiled with the old semantics, unless people are using very old, <a href=\"https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#policy\">unsupported Go versions</a>.</p><p>Go 1.21 includes a preview of the scoping change. If you compile your code with  set in your environment, then the new semantics are applied to all loops (ignoring the  lines). For example, to check whether your tests still pass with the new loop semantics applied to your package and all your dependencies:</p><pre><code>GOEXPERIMENT=loopvar go test\n</code></pre><p>\\\nWe patched our internal Go toolchain at Google to force this mode during all builds at the start of May 2023, and in the past four months we have had zero reports of any problems in production code.</p><p>\\\nYou can also try test programs to better understand the semantics on the Go playground by including a  comment at the top of the program, like in <a href=\"https://go.dev/play/p/YchKkkA1ETH\">this program</a>. (This comment only applies in the Go playground.)</p><p>Although we’ve had no production problems, to prepare for that switch, we did have to correct many buggy tests that were not testing what they thought they were, like this:</p><pre><code>func TestAllEvenBuggy(t *testing.T) {\n    testCases := []int{1, 2, 4, 6}\n    for _, v := range testCases {\n        t.Run(\"sub\", func(t *testing.T) {\n            t.Parallel()\n            if v&amp;1 != 0 {\n                t.Fatal(\"odd v\", v)\n            }\n        })\n    }\n}\n</code></pre><p>\\\nIn Go 1.21, this test passes because  blocks each subtest until the entire loop has finished and then runs all the subtests in parallel. When the loop has finished,  is always 6, so the subtests all check that 6 is even, so the test passes. Of course, this test really should fail, because 1 is not even. Fixing for loops exposes this kind of buggy test.</p><p>\\\nTo help prepare for this kind of discovery, we improved the precision of the  analyzer in Go 1.21 so that it can identify and report this problem. You can see the report <a href=\"https://go.dev/play/p/WkJkgXRXg0m\">in this program</a> on the Go playground. If  is reporting this kind of problem in your own tests, fixing them will prepare you better for Go 1.22.</p><p>\\\nIf you run into other problems, <a href=\"https://go.dev/wiki/LoopvarExperiment#my-test-fails-with-the-change-how-can-i-debug-it\">the FAQ</a> has links to examples and details about using a tool we’ve written to identify which specific loop is causing a test failure when the new semantics are applied.</p><p>\\\n<em>This article is available on&nbsp;&nbsp;under a CC BY 4.0 DEED license.</em></p>",

      "content": "<p>It’s just a small change!</p><p>\\\nHow often do we hear that we need to fix something? We need to add a small feature. We need to tweak something. Code-wise or publishing, just realized they need this for retention, or maybe an analyst brought the newest data, so now we have to add just a few lines to the code. They don’t affect performance or any other departments, I promise. And it’s just like 3 minutes of coder work - why not? Fast forward: they broke the “Buy” button on the front page of the store on release.</p><p>\\\nWhy does this always happen with small changes? Well, if we think about it, we don’t usually think about it. Let me explain:</p><p>Designers think in features and user experience. \\n Engineers think in whole systems. \\n Producers think in tasks. \\n Stakeholders think in business outcomes.</p><p>\\\nAnd one small change is always perceived as something isolated and usually without everyone’s awareness. So, it is basically a cognitive shortcut. And that happens not because everyone is wrong or unprofessional. It’s because modern production systems are highly interconnected, so it’s impossible to know what could potentially be affected by anything - especially if you haven’t worked on this project for 15 years.</p><p>What is modern production? I’m glad you asked!</p><p>\\\nIt doesn’t matter if you build games or a banking app - you don’t just have a pile of features and assets. You have an ecosystem for each bit of work: Art, Code, Design, UI, Marketing, Publishing (maybe even Project Management - wow, you are a rich developer), etc. And each one of them has its own infrastructure, pipelines, workflows, and shared assets. To simplify, it can be shared data schemas, builds, automation processes, UI bindings, and many other things.</p><p>\\\nWhat’s wrong if I just make a small color change to one of the icons? Well, that means you spend 3 seconds changing a color code. Then you have to assemble a build. Then QA has to check your small change to confirm that you indeed changed the color. Then you have to assemble the build again, which should be in a queue with other builds in the waiting list.</p><p>\\\nThen we have to update the server with your changes - oh wait, did you tell anyone about that? No? Oh, that’s great, because you just submitted your changes during the commit freeze, and now deployment engineers have to fix the CI/CD pipeline, and we have to postpone the release for 4 days because it’s Friday.</p><p>\\\nAnd by the way - we have to communicate that to users because they were waiting for this new version, and some of them decided not to wait that long and removed your app. Whoops, that’s awkward. Sorry to hear that.</p><p>That’s alright, I’m here to help you! Let me introduce you to Change Propagation Surface (CPS) - the number of systems, pipelines, assets, and workflows that a change must pass through before it reaches the player.</p><p>\\\nYour change should not be estimated by its task size, like “1 hour of work.” Your change equals CPS × Coupling Density (the amount of work other departments need to do in order for this change to pass).</p><p>\\\nThink about it this way:</p><ul><li>One small UI tweak touches no shared data - low CPS.</li><li>A gameplay rule change touching code, balance, design, analytics, player experience - high CPS.</li></ul><p>\\\nLet’s go back to the situation where you want to change the color of the icon. Those 3 seconds of work would affect UI, builds, player perception, experience, and design. It might also affect color coding for accessibility rules, plus build assembling, and finally server updates. It’s high CPS - of course, if you didn’t sneak that change in without everyone’s awareness (I see that - drop it!).</p><p>\\\nThe same goes for asset swaps or changing a stat value: it affects memory, AI tuning, destruction logic, etc. Don’t do that unless someone from senior leadership said it’s low CPS - then just do it and see how it goes.</p><p>\\\nYou can apply this approach basically anywhere in production because it is not an abstract thing at all and can be estimated.</p><ul></ul><p>\\\nEach of these items counts as a plus 1 CPS factor. Subsequently, the more of the same “items” you touch, the higher the CPS number you will get. And with that information, you can create a small estimation matrix like:</p><p>CPS 1-2 - Local change \\n CPS 3-5 - Cross-functional change \\n CPS 6+ - Systemic change</p><p>\\\nOne more time, the formula is: Impact = CPS × Coupling Density. Easy!</p><p>Let’s see how it works in a real-life example:</p><p>\\\nSo your developer went on holiday and completed a math course on LinkedIn. And when he came back, he said that there is a more efficient way of calculating EXP. This change is “one line of code.” Okay, but after reading this article, you already know how it works in reality and that it touches multiple things:</p><ul><li>Player progression pacing</li></ul><p>\\\nThat means CPS is more than 7. So now you see that even though the code diff is tiny, the propagation surface is systemic and has a massive potential outcome. In other words, if XP progression speeds up things like economy, availability of the content, battle pass value, retention curves, etc., you should know that even if the implementation takes about 10 minutes, the ripple effect can take weeks of work.</p><p>\\\nWhy does live service production make it worse? Because it is amplified by content being reused across multiple features, by telemetry and economy being tightly coupled, and by systems being persistent and often requiring backward compatibility.</p><p>\\\nSo, the real cost you pay for propagation lies in prolonged timelines, hidden rework, cross-team friction, technical debt, burnout, and eventually, people resigning directly or indirectly.</p><p>\\\nInstead of thinking, “Oh, this is a small change,” we should probably think, “What systems does this change touch?” Think about this as infrastructure, not a feature, and always try to bring that to cross-team awareness. And if you are capable enough, try to estimate the surface area, not just this exact small change.</p><p>\\\n**The whole point of my way-too-long introduction is that there is no such thing as a small change in production systems. There are only changes in misunderstood affected areas. And the more senior you become, the more your vision shifts toward understanding how this change will travel instead of trying to avoid the change altogether.</p>",

Furthermore, we specifically design a downstream task of text-guided image generation, and show that the finetuned M6 can create high-quality images with high resolution and abundant details.</p><p>Multimodal Pretraining; Multitask; Text-to-Image Generation</p><p>Pretraining has become a focus in the research in natural language processing (NLP) [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark17\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark18\">2</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark23\">7</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark32\">16</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark34\">18</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark35\">19</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark43\">27</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark47\">31</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark53\">37</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark60\">44</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark65\">49</a>]. The recent GPT-3 with over 175 billion parameters demonstrates that large models trained on big data have extremely large capacity and it can outperform the state-of-the-arts in downstream tasks especially in the zero-shot setting. Also, the rapid development of pretraining in NLP sparkles cross-modal pretraining. A number of studies [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark20\">4</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark27\">11</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark33\">17</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark38\">22</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark40\">24</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark41\">25</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark44\">28</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark45\">29</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark54\">38</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark67\">51</a>] have created new state-of-the-art performances for various cross-modal downstream tasks.</p><p>A pity is that most recent studies focus on the pretraining on English data. There are lack of both large-scale datasets in Chinese and large-scale models pretrained on the data of Chinese. Therefore, in this work, we develop a large-scale dataset M6-Corpus, which consists of over 1.9TB images and 292GB texts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest dataset in Chinese for pretraining in both multimodality and natural language. The dataset collected from the webpages consists of different types of data and covers a large scale of domains, including encyclopedia, question answering, forum discussion, product description, etc. Also, we design sophisticated cleaning procedures to ensure that the data are of high quality.</p><p>Furthermore, in order to sufficiently leverage such a large amount of high-quality data, we propose to build an extremely large model that can process data of multiple modalities and adapt to different types of downstream tasks. Thus we propose a novel model called M6, referring to MultiModality-to-MultiModality Multitask Mega-transformer. The model is based on the transformer, and it is pretrained with multiple tasks. Pretraining endows the model with the capability of single-modality and multimodality understanding and generation. Based on the architecture of M6, we build  and , which are scaled up to 10 billion and 100 billion pa-rameters respectively. To be more specific,  is the recent largest model pretrained on Chinese data. We apply the model to a series of downstream applications, including product description generation, visual question answering, community question answering, Chinese poem generation, etc., and our experimental results show that M6 outperforms a series of strong baselines.</p><p>Another contribution of this work is that we first incorporate pretraining with text-to-image generation. Following Ramesh et al. <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark48\">[32]</a>, we leverage a two-stage framework for image generation. To be more specific, we apply a trained vector-quantized generative adversarial network to representing images with discrete image codes, and we then use the pretrained M6 to learn the relations between texts and codes. Such learning can bridge the two modalities and enables controllable text-to-image generation.</p><p>To summarize, the contributions of M6 are as follows:</p><ul><li>We collect and build the largest Chinese multi-modal pre-training data in industry, which includes 300GB texts and 2TB images.</li><li>We propose M6 for multimodal pretraining in Chinese, and we scale the model size to up to 10 and 100 billion parameters. Both M6-10B and M6-100B are the recent largest multimodal pretrained model.</li><li>M6 is versatile and exceeds strong baselines by 11.8% in VQA, 18.4 in image captioning, and 10.3% in image-text matching. Furthermore M6 is able to generate high-quality images.</li><li>With carefully designed large-scale distributed training optimizations, M6 has obvious advantages in training speed and greatly reduces training costs, creating the possibility for more widespread use of multi-modal pretraining.</li></ul><p>We collect and develop the largest multi-modality and text dataset in Chinese for now, which is one of the key contributions of this paper. In this section, we first identify the limitations of existing datasets and then describe the construction and preprocessing procedure of our proposed dataset.</p><h2>2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Existing Datasets</h2><p>The construction of large-scale corpus with high quality and do-main coverage is crucial to Chinese pretraining. In early previous works, the Chinese Wikipedia1&nbsp;is one of the most frequently used datasets to train Chinese language models. It contains 1.6GB texts (around 0.4B tokens) covering around 1M encyclopedia entries. Another corpus with a comparable size is the THUCTC[<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark55\">39</a>] dataset, which includes 740K news articles. However, with the rapidly increasing capacity of recent language models, the scale of these existing datasets is clearly insufficient. Recently, Cui et al. <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark21\">[5]</a> employ unreleased extended data that are 10 times larger than the CN-Wikipedia to pretrain their Chinese language model. Xu et al.</p><p><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark63\">[47]</a> released a 100GB corpus named CLUECorpus2020, which is retried from the multilingual Common Crawl dataset. However, the scale of the datasets is still insufficient to facilitate super large-scale pretraining compared with existing English pretrained models. For example, GPT-3 contains 175B parameters and is trained on 570GB texts. Meanwhile, the dataset should contain image-text pairs rather than plain texts for multi-modal pretraining.</p><h2>2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standards for a High-quality Dataset</h2><p>To perform large-scale multi-modal pretraining and learn complex world knowledge in Chinese, the dataset is highly required to provide both plain texts and image-text pairs on super large scale, covering a wide range of domains. In order to perform large-scale multi-modal pretraining in Chinese, we focus on the construction of large-scale datasets in Chinese. Specifically, while we unify our pretraining for both natural language and multimodalities, we construct large datasets of both plain texts and image-text pairs. We are interested in obtaining large-scale data that covers a wide range of domains, so that it is possible for the model to learn the complex world knowledge of different fields. Also, we aim to collect data of multiple modalities for the cross-modal pretraining. This raises the difficulty for the construction of a large-scale dataset as the data for multimodal pretraining are usually image-text pairs, where in each pair the text provides a detailed description of a fraction of the image.</p><p>Though there are a tremendous amount of text resources and images on the world wide web, the corpus for multimodal pretraining is assumed to be better when satisfying the following properties:</p><p>(1). the sentences should be fluent natural language within a normal length, and should not contain meaningless tokens, such as markups, duplicate punctuation marks, random combinations of characters, etc.; (2). the images should be natural and realistic, and the resolutions of the images need to be identifiable by humans; (3). both the texts and images should not contain illegal content, such as pornography, violence, etc.; (4). the images and texts should be semantically relevant; (5). the datasets should cover a wide range of fields, say sports, politics, science, etc., and therefore it can endow the model with sufficient world knowledge.</p><h2>2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dataset Construction</h2><p>Based on the requirements above, we collect data of both plain texts and image-text pairs. There are different types of data, including encyclopedia, crawled webpage, community question answering, forum, product description, etc. We present the details in Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark2\">3.</a> The collected corpus consists of bothag plain-texts and image-text pairs, which is compatible with the designed text-only and multi-modal pretraining tasks. Also, the data has a large coverage over domains, such as science, entertainment, sports, politics, common-sense of life, etc. We have also compared some characteristics of our corpus with existing datasets used for Chinese pretraining in Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark1\">2.</a> The size of our dataset is much larger than the previous ones. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale, multimodal and multidomain corpus for Chinese pretraining.</p><p>We implement sophisticated preprocessing to obtain clean data. For text data, we first remove HTML markups and duplicate punctuation marks, and we only reserve characters and punctuation marks that are in Chinese and English. We remove the topics that are shorter than 5 characters and contents shorter than 15 characters. We further apply in-house spam detection to remove sentences that contain words related to certain political issues, pornography, or words in the list of dirty, naughty, and other bad words. In order to preserve the linguistic acceptance of the texts, we implement a language model to evaluate their perplexities, and sentences with high perplexities are discarded. Only images with at least 5000 pixels are reserved for pretraining. A sequence of classifiers and heuristic rules are applied to filter out images containing illegal content. We also use a pretrained image scorer to evaluate the qual-ities of images. For images and texts in crawled webpages, we only consider images and their surrounding text as relevant image-text pairs. Other sentences in the webpages are discarded.</p><p>Multimodal pretraining leverages both the power of self-attention-based transformer architecture and pretraining on large-scale data. We endeavor to endow the model with strong capability of cross-modal understanding and generation. In this section, we describe the details of our proposed pretrained model , which refers to ulti-odality-to-ulti-odality ultitask ega-transformer.</p><h2>3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Å &nbsp; Visual and Linguistic Inputs</h2><p>The mainstream multimodal pretraining methods transform images to feature sequences via object detection. However, the performance of the object detectors as well as the expressivity of their backbones strongly impact the final performance of the pretrained models in the downstream tasks. We observe that a large proportion of the images contain only a few objects. Take the images of the data of e-commerce as an example. We randomly sample 1M images and perform object detection on the images. The results show that over 90% of the images contain fewer than 5 objects. Also, the objects have high overlapping with each other. To alleviate such influence, we turn to a simple but effective solution following Gao et al. [\\[12\\]](#<em>bookmark28) and Dosovitskiy et al. [\\[8\\]](#</em>bookmark24). In general, we split an image into patches and extract features of the 2D patches with a trained feature extractor, say ResNet-50. Then we line up the representations to a sequence by their positions.  The processing of the input word sequence is much simpler. We follow the similar preprocessing procedures in the previous work [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark20\">4</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark27\">11</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark40\">24</a>]. We apply WordPiece [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark50\">34</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark61\">45</a>] and masking to the word sequence and embed them with an embedding layer, following BERT <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark22\">[6].</a></p><h2>3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unified Encoder-Decoder</h2><p>We integrate the image embeddings 𝑒𝑖&nbsp;and the word embeddings 𝑒𝑡&nbsp;into the cross-modal embedding sequence 𝑒 = {𝑒𝑖, 𝑒𝑡 }. We send the sequence to the transformer backbone for high-level feature extraction. To differ their representations, we add corresponding segment embeddings for different modalities. Specifically, we leverage the</p><p>self-attention-based transformer blocks for our unified cross-modal representation learning. To be more specific, the building block is identical to that of BERT or GPT, which consists of self attention and point-wise feed-forward network (FFN). On top of the transformer backbone, we add an output layer for word prediction, and thus we tie its weights to those of the embedding layer.</p><p>In the unified framework, we use different masking strategies to enable encoding and decoding. The input is segmented into three parts, including visual inputs, masked linguistic inputs, and complete linguistic inputs. We apply bidirectional masking to both the visual inputs and masked linguistic inputs, and we apply causal masking to the complete linguistic inputs. Thus the model is allowed to encode and decode in the same framework.</p><h2>3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pretraining Methods</h2><p>We pretrain the model with the multitask setup, including text-to-text transfer, image-to-text transfer, and multimodality-to-text transfer. Thus the model can process information of different modalities and perform both single-modal and cross-modal understanding and generation.</p><p> As demonstrated in Figure <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark3\">3,</a> the model learns to perform text denoising and language modeling in the setting of text-to-text transfer. In text denoising, we mask the input text by a proportion, which is 15% in practice following BERT [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark22\">6</a>]. Specifically, we mask a continuous span of text with a single mask, and the model should learn to decode the whole sequence. This encourages the model to learn both recovering and length predict-ing. Besides, in order to improve the model ability in generation, we add a setup of language modeling, where the encoder receives no inputs and the decoder learns to generate words based on the previous context.</p><p>\\\n Image-to-text transfer is similar to image captioning, where the model receives the visual information as the input, and learns to generate a corresponding description. In this setting, we add the aforementioned patch feature sequence to the input and leave the masked input blank. The model encodes the patch features, and decodes the corresponding text.</p><p><strong>Multimodality-to-text transfer</strong> Based on the setup of image-to-text transfer, we additionally add masked linguistic inputs, and thus the model should learn to generate the target text based on both the visual information and the noised linguistic information. This task allows the model to adapt to the downstream tasks with both visual and linguistic inputs.</p><h2>3.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scaling up to 10 and 100 Billion Parameters</h2><p>We scale up the model size to 10 billion parameters and 100 billion parameters, which are named M6-10B and M6-100B. The increase in model size provides a much larger capacity for the model that it can learn knowledge from more data. For the construction of M6-10B, we simply scale up the model by hyperparameter tuning.</p><p>To be more specific, we increase the size of hidden states and the number of layers. To better leverage GPU memory, we apply mixed-precision training and activation checkpointing to save memory. Still, the model cannot be fit into one single GPU, and thus we use model parallelism to split the feed-forward networks and attention heads to multiple GPUs following the implementation of Megatron-LM <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark52\">[36].</a></p><p>However, directly scaling up to M6-100B is much more difficult as there are more challenges for the computation resources. Alternatively, inspired by the recent progress in sparse activations [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark26\">10</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark36\">20</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark51\">35</a>], we combine Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with M6 to build the version of 100 billion parameters. Note that the original MoE requires mesh-tensorflow as well as TPUs. This sets limits for a number of researchers without such resources. Thus we implement the M6-100B with MoE with our in-house framework Whale [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark59\">43</a>] to perform model parallelism with GPUs. We demonstrate the key statistics of the models of different scales in Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark4\">4.</a></p><p>Specifically, different from the conventional FFN layer, the MoE layer is a parallel combination of multiple FFN layers, each of which acts as an expert. This is also called expert parallelism. The model first learns a sparse gating network to route the tokens to specific experts. Thus each token is only sent to a small set of experts and the computation can be much less compared with that in dense models. This kind of model is highly efficient as it realizes data parallelism and expert parallelism across workers. The computation of MoE layer for a specific token 𝑥 can be described as below:</p><p>where 𝑔(·) refers to the sparse gating function, and T refers to the indices of top-𝑘 values of 𝑔(·). The output of MoE is a linear combination of the computation of selected expert FFNs 𝑓 (·).</p><p>In expert parallelism, the parameters of experts do not share across workers, while those of other parts are identical across workers. Therefore, it is necessary to perform all-to-all communication across workers at the MoE layers in order to dispatch tokens to selected experts and combine them to their original experts. While Lepikhin et al. <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark36\">[20]</a> and Fedus et al. <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark26\">[10]</a> implement the MoE on TPUs with one expert in each MoE layer on a TPU, we implement our model on Nvidia GPUs where there are several experts in each MoE layer on a GPU so as to fully utilize the memory. As all-to-all communication takes up a large amount of time, the optimization to improve efficiency is highly significant. We implement a series of optimization, including half-precision communication. A key problem is load balancing, which denotes that tokens can gather to only a few experts due to dynamic routing. Following Fedus et al. <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark26\">[10]</a>, we apply expert capacity, which refers to the number of tokens for an expert (𝐶 = 𝑁&nbsp;- 𝑐/m, where 𝐶 refers to expert capacity, 𝑁 refers to the number of tokens in a batch, 𝑐 refers to capacity factor (which is a hyperparameter usually larger than 1.0) and 𝑚 refers to the number of experts), to alleviate this problem. Tokens out of the capacity of an expert are dropped from the computation and they are sent to next layers through residual connections. We find that the overloading problem can be severe, and this issue can be a significant one in the future research of expert models.</p><p>Besides the optimization in all-to-all communication, we com-pare the top-2 gating and top-1 gating and find that they can achieve similar model performance in perplexity, while the latter converges slightly slower. The effectiveness of top-1 gating enables faster computation. Besides, we also apply methods of memory optimization for higher efficiency. We find that gradient clipping globally can increase costs on all-to-all communication as it computes norms across all experts, and thus we apply local clipping for memory saving. We implement M6-100B with around 100 billion parameters on 128 Nvidia A100s and the speed of pretraining achieves 1440 samples/s (for samples of the sequence length of 272).</p><p>We demonstrate that using MoE structure for model size scaling is effective and it can achieve similar performance to that of M6-10B, the largest dense model, within 2-3 times shorter time. The negative log perplexity of M6-100B reaches −2.297, in comparison with M6-10B that reaches −2.253 but with twice of time.2 This shows that the MoE-based M6 model has advantages on the time basis compared with dense models with many more FLOPs.</p><h2>4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Text-to-Image Generation</h2><p>Text-to-image generation has been an open problem for a long time. Previous studies mainly focused on generation on a limited domain, among which Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark30\">14</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark64\">48</a>] are dominated methods. Following Ramesh et al. <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark48\">[32]</a>, we leverage a two-stage framework for text-to-image generation, including discrete representation learning and language modeling.</p><p>\\\nIn the first stage, we focus on transforming images into sequences of discrete codes. There are a number of alternatives for discrete code generation, including VQVAE [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark57\">41</a>] and VQGAN [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark25\">9</a>]. In the second stage, it is necessary to build a language model to learn to generate text and code sequence. In the finetuning, we add code embedding and output layers to the pretrained M6. We concat the word sequence and the aforementioned generated code sequence as the input, and we set the objective of autoregressive language modeling for the training. At the stage of inference, we input the text sequence, and the model generates codes autoregressively with top-k sampling. The last step is to transform the code sequence to an image with the generator from the first stage.</p><p>We construct a dataset for text-to-image generation in E-commerce. Specifically, we collect over 50 million product titles and images from the mobile Taobao. We apply a series of processing methods on the images to filter the unqualified. We filter the images with complex background features (characters, patterns, etc.) with the in-house white-background image detector and OCR model. We then filter the images with over 3 objects with our in-house object detector based on Faster R-CNN [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark49\">33</a>]. We finally obtain 1.8m high-quality product image-text pairs for finetuning. Compared with the images in the general domains, our collected data have the following features. The image and text are highly correlated as the text describes key features of the product, and there is no complex background in the images, which is easier to learn compared with the images in the public datasets such as MSCOCO <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark42\">[26].</a></p><p>We demonstrate two examples in Figure <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark7\">4</a> and Figure <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark8\">5.</a> It can be found that the generated images have high quality and the generated objects resemble the real ones. Furthermore, in Figure <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark9\">6</a> , we find that the model is able to imagine items according to the query <em>military style camouflage high heels(军旅风迷彩高跟鞋</em>), which do not exist in the real world. The imagination ability provides room for creative design in real-world industrial scenarios, such as clothing design, shoe design, etc.</p><p>We also finetune M6 under our proposed framework on another dataset which contains 3 million images crawled from the Internet, which cover more general domains. And we find that the model can adapt to different domains. As shown in Figure <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark10\">7,</a> the model is able to generate clip arts of robots . This reveals the versatility of the framework in text-to-image generation.</p><h2>4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Visual Question Answering</h2><p>We demonstrate our experimental results on a visual question answering dataset, and we illustrate how we directly apply the pre-trained M6 to the VQA application.</p><p>\\\nWe leverage the FMIQA dataset [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark29\">13</a>] as the Chinese visual QA benchmark, which requires the model to generate the answer given an image and a question. We implement a transformer-based model as our baseline. For the evaluation, we split the test set manually by random sampling 200 from the dataset as there is no official release of the test set, and we evaluate the overall accuracy by human evaluation. The results are demonstrated in Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark5\">5.</a> The pretrained M6-base outperforms the baseline by a large margin (+6.2%), which indicates the effectiveness of multimodal pretraining. Scaling up the model to M6-10B further brings 5.2% improvement.</p><p>Furthermore, we show that simply finetuning on such a small VQA dataset may limit the potential of M6. Therefore, we directly leverage M6 for the VQA application. We find that the model is able to recognize general features and provide more related knowledge based on its understanding. Though the model pretrained on pseudo-parallel image-text pairs cannot directly answer questions about detailed features, such as color, number, etc., it is able to answer questions related to background knowledge. We demonstrate some examples in Figure <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark12\">8.</a></p><h2>4.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Image Captioning</h2><p>Image captioning requires the model to generate a caption that describes the given image, which examines the model ability of cross-modal generation. We construct a dataset (named E-Commerce IC) containing pairs of product descriptions and product images from Taobao. Since too long or too short descriptions may be noisy, we discard pairs with a description longer than 100 words or less than 10 words. To avoid dirty generations, we further use an in-house tool to filter descriptions that may contain dirty words (i.e., pornographic or violent words). Finally, E-Commerce IC contains about 260k text-image pairs. We finetune the model with the image-to-text transfer task on E-Commerce IC.</p><p>\\\nWe compare our model with a baseline of transformer in the human evaluation. We ask several annotators with the linguistic background to evaluate from three perspectives: grammar (whether a text is fluent without grammatical error), correctness (whether a text is faithful to the image), richness (whether a text is informative and attractive). During the evaluation, we randomly sample 100 images from the test set. For each image, an annotator is asked to score the text generated by different models. The scores are within the range of [0, 5].</p><p>The results in Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark11\">6</a> show that M6-base outperforms the baseline in all of the metrics. We find that all models achieve high scores in grammar. However, in both correctness and richness, M6-base outperforms the baseline model by a large margin (+18.2% and +14.4%), indicating that multimodal pretraining helps to generate more faithful, informative and attractive texts. Scaling up the model to M6-10B further improves the correctness and richness (about 14.7% and 7.0%). Figure 9 illustrates two examples of image caption.</p><h2>4.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question Answering</h2><p>To demonstrate the potential availability in the applications of intelligent chatbots, we further employ the M6 model to generate long answers in the style of forum discussion. Human-generated questions are collected from various Chinese forums, which are input to the model to generate the answer. At the stage of inference, we append a question mark and a token  in the prompt, which better triggers the model to generate an answer. To facilitate the generation of longer and more informative texts, we pick more complex questions.</p><p>Figure <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark14\">10</a> demonstrates an example of general question answer-ing. The model can illustrate a man’s own experiences that are related to the question and also point out the answer at the end. This generated text confused human annotators and passed the Turing Test. It shows that the model can not only answer general questions but also generate long fluency text.</p><p>We apply the pretrained model to Chinese poem generation. The model is able to generate genres with format constraints.</p><p>\\\nAncient Chinese poetry has various specific formats. We adopt the simplest constraints that</p><ul><li>The poem shall be consisted of at least 4 lines.</li><li>The total number of lines shall be even.</li><li>Each line must have exactly 5 or 7 words.</li><li>All lines shall have the same number of words.</li></ul><p>Text generation under format constraint is done in a search framework that we generate short sentences ending with punctuation until the number of words meets the constraint. We repeat this process until the model generates an \"\" token, or the number of lines exceeds a limit of 16. Figure <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark15\">11</a> illustrates an example of a generated poem.</p><h2>4.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Image-Text Matching</h2><p>We evaluate the model’s ability in cross-modal retrieval. Specifically, we construct a dataset (named E-Commerce ITM) containing pairs of texts and images from the mobile Taobao. Each pair belongs to a single item. we collect 235K products in the clothing industry from Taobao. For each product, aside from the product image, we obtain a query by rewriting the product title. Specifically, we conduct named entity recognition on the title using an in-house tool, which extracts the terms describing the style, color, category and texture of the product.</p><p>\\\nThese terms are then concatenated into a natural language query, which is used in image-text matching. The length of each query is between 6 to 12 words. The pairs of the query and corresponding product image are labeled as positive samples. The negative samples are constructed by randomly substituting the query in the original pairs.</p><p>We require the model to perform binary classification to discriminate positive and negative samples. We compare our model with InterBert [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark41\">25</a>], which is also a Chinese multi-modal pretrained model effective in cross-modal classification downstream tasks. The InterBert utilizes object-based features and has been pretrained on Taobao product image-text data as well.</p><p>The results are shown in Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark16\">7.</a> It should be noted that the InterBert and M6-base are both implemented with transformer-based architecture and have similar model scales. However, M6-base still outperforms InterBert by 10.3%. In experiments, we find the product images generally contain relatively fewer detected objects, which may harm the performance on this task. In contrast, M6 avoids this problem by employing the patch features and achieves much better performance.</p><p>The tremendous success of NLP pretraining, including BERT [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark22\">6</a>], GPT [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark18\">2</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark46\">30</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark47\">31</a>], and also some other related studies [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark17\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark23\">7</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark35\">19</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark43\">27</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark65\">49</a>], inspires the research in cross-modal representation learning. Also, recent studies show that the ubiquitous Transformer architecture [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark58\">42</a>] can be extended to different fields, including computer vision [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark19\">3</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark24\">8</a>]. Therefore, the simplest solution to incorporate recent pretraining methods and cross-modal representation learning is the extension of BERT. From the perspective of architecture, there are mainly two types, including single-stream model and dual stream model. Specifically, single-stream model is simple and it gradually becomes the mainstream architecture. These models mostly differ in their designs of pretraining tasks or the construction of input im-age features. Basically, they are mainly pretrained masked language modeling, masked object classification, and image-text matching. VisualBERT [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark39\">23</a>] and Unicoder-VL [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark38\">22</a>] simply use BERT and are pretrained with the aforementioned tasks. UNITER [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark20\">4</a>] pretrains the model with an additional task of word-region alignment. Oscar [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark40\">24</a>] enhances the alignment between objects and their corresponding words or phrases. VILLA [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark27\">11</a>] further improves model performance by adding their proposed adversarial learning methods to pretraining and finetuning. Except for pretraining tasks, some studies focus on the features of images. Most pretraining methods for multimodal representation learning utilize the features generated by a trained object detector, say Faster R-CNN [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark49\">33</a>]. PixelBERT [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark33\">17</a>] accepts raw images as input and extract their latent representations with a learnable ResNet [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark31\">15</a>] or ResNext [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark62\">46</a>]. FashionBERT [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark28\">12</a>] splits the images into patches with a trained ResNet without co-training. Besides single-stream models, dual-stream models also can achieve outstanding performance, such as VilBERT [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark44\">28</a>], LXMERT [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark56\">40</a>] and InterBERT [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark41\">25</a>]. ViLBERT-MT [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark45\">29</a>] enhances model performance with multi-task finetuning. ERNIE-ViL [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark66\">50</a>] enhances the model with the application of scene graph information. In spite of these successful cases, it still requires further researches to unmask the success of multimodal pretraining.</p><p>In this work, we propose the largest dataset M6-Corpus for pre-training in Chinese, which consists of over 1.9TB images and 292GB texts. The dataset has large coverage over domains, including encyclopedia, question answering, forum discussion, common crawl, etc. We propose a method called M6 that is able to process information of multiple modalities and perform both single-modal and cross-modal understanding and generation. The model is scaled to large model with 10B and 100B parameters with sophisticated deployment, and both models are the largest multimodal pretrained models. We apply the model to a series of downstream applications, showing its versatility. More specifically, we design a downstream task of text-guided image generation, and the finetuned M6 can reach superior performance by producing images of high quality.</p><p>In the future, we will continue the pretraining of extremely large models by increasing the scale of data and models to explore the limit of performance, and we also endeavor to search for more downstream applications for further generalization.</p><p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; Hangbo Bao, Li Dong, Furu Wei, Wenhui Wang, Nan Yang, Xiaodong Liu, Yu Wang, Jianfeng Gao, Songhao Piao, Ming Zhou, et al. 2020.

In this work, we introduce QWEN<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark0\">1</a>, the first installment of our large language model series. QWEN is a comprehensive language model series that encompasses distinct models with varying parameter counts. It includes QWEN, the base pretrained language models, and QWEN-CHAT, the chat models finetuned with human alignment techniques. The base language models consistently demonstrate superior performance across a multitude of downstream tasks, and the chat models, particularly those trained using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), are highly competitive. The chat models possess advanced tool-use and planning capabilities for creating agent applications, showcasing impressive performance even when compared to bigger models on complex tasks like utilizing a code interpreter. Furthermore, we have developed coding-specialized models, CODE-QWEN and CODE-QWEN-CHAT, as well as mathematics-focused models, MATH-QWEN-CHAT, which are built upon base language models. These models demonstrate significantly improved performance in comparison with open-source models, and slightly fall behind the proprietary models. \\n </p><p>\\\nDespite their impressive capabilities, LLMs are often criticized for their lack of reproducibility, steerability, and accessibility to service providers. In this work, we are pleased to present and release the initial version of our LLM series, QWEN. QWEN is a moniker that derives from the Chinese phrase Qianwen, which translates to “thousands of prompts” and conveys the notion of embracing a wide range of inquiries. QWEN is a comprehensive language model series that encompasses distinct models with varying parameter counts. The model series include the base pretrained language models, chat models finetuned with human alignment techniques, i.e., supervised finetuning (SFT), reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), etc., as well as specialized models in coding and math. The details are outlined below:</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; The base language models, namely QWEN, have undergone extensive training using up to 3 trillion tokens of diverse texts and codes, encompassing a wide range of areas. These models have consistently demonstrated superior performance across a multitude of downstream tasks, even when compared to their more significantly larger counterparts.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; The QWEN-CHAT models have been carefully finetuned on a curated dataset relevant to task performing, chat, tool use, agent, safety, etc. The benchmark evaluation demonstrates that the SFT models can achieve superior performance. Furthermore, we have trained reward models to mimic human preference and applied them in RLHF for chat models that can produce responses preferred by humans. Through the human evaluation of a challenging test, we find that QWEN-CHAT models trained with RLHF are highly competitive, still falling behind GPT-4 on our benchmark.</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, we present specialized models called CODE-QWEN, which includes CODE-QWEN-7B and CODE-QWEN-14B, as well as their chat models, CODE-QWEN-14B-CHAT and CODE-QWEN-7B-CHAT. Specifically, CODE-QWEN has been pre-trained on extensive datasets of code and further fine-tuned to handle conversations related to code generation, debugging, and interpretation. The results of experiments conducted on benchmark datasets, such as HumanEval <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark69\">(Chen et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark69\">2021),</a> MBPP <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark55\">(Austin et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark55\">2021),</a> and HumanEvalPack <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark140\">(Muennighoff et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark140\">2023),</a> demonstrate the high level of proficiency of CODE-QWEN in code understanding and generation.</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; This research additionally introduces MATH-QWEN-CHAT specifically designed to tackle mathematical problems. Our results show that both MATH-QWEN-7B-CHAT and MATH-QWEN-14B-CHAT outperform open-sourced models in the same sizes with large margins and are approaching GPT-3.5 on math-related benchmark datasets such as GSM8K <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark82\">(Cobbe</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark82\">et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark82\">2021)</a> and MATH <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark102\">(Hendrycks et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark102\">2021).</a></p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides, we have open-sourced QWEN-VL and QWEN-VL-CHAT, which have the versatile ability to comprehend visual and language instructions. These models outperform the current open-source vision-language models across various evaluation benchmarks and support text recognition and visual grounding in both Chinese and English languages. Moreover, these models enable multi-image conversations and storytelling.

This release aims at providing more comprehensive and powerful LLMs at developer- or application-friendly scales.</p><p>The structure of this report is as follows: Section <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark2\">2</a> describes our approach to pretraining and results of QWEN.

In Sections <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark31\">4</a> and <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark35\">5,</a> we delve into specialized models of coding and math and their performance. Section <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark41\">6</a> provides an overview of relevant related work, and Section <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark47\">7</a> concludes this paper and points out our future work.</p><p>The pretraining stage involves learning vast amount of data to acquire a comprehensive understanding of the world and its various complexities. This includes not only basic language capabilities but also advanced skills such as arithmetic, coding, and logical reasoning. In this section, we introduce the data, the model design and scaling, as well as the comprehensive evaluation results on benchmark datasets.</p><p>The size of data has proven to be a crucial factor in developing a robust large language model, as highlighted in previous research <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark103\">(Hoffmann et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark103\">2022;</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark184\">Touvron et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark184\">2023b).</a> To create an effective pretraining dataset, it is essential to ensure that the data are diverse and cover a wide range of types, domains, and tasks. Our dataset is designed to meet these requirements and includes public web documents, encyclopedia, books, codes, etc. Additionally, our dataset is multilingual, with a significant portion of the data being in English and Chinese.</p><p>\\\nTo ensure the quality of our pretraining data, we have developed a comprehensive data preprocessing procedure. For public web data, we extract text from HTML and use language identification tools to determine the language. To increase the diversity of our data, we employ deduplication techniques, including exact-match deduplication after normalization and fuzzy deduplication using MinHash and LSH algorithms. To filter out low-quality data, we employ a combination of rule-based and machine-learning-based methods. Specifically, we use multiple models to score the content, including language models, text-quality scoring models, and models for identifying potentially offensive or inappropriate content. We also manually sample texts from various sources and review them to ensure their quality. To further enhance the quality of our data, we selectively up-sample data from certain sources, to ensure that our models are trained on a diverse range of high-quality content. In recent studies <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark211\">(Zeng et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark211\">2022;</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark53\">Aribandi et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark53\">2021;</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark156\">Raffel et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark156\">2020),</a> it has been demonstrated that pretraining language models with multi-task instructions can enhance their zero-shot and few-shot performance. To further enhance the performance of our model, we have incorporated high-quality instruction data into our pretraining process. To safeguard the integrity of our benchmark assessment, we have adopted a similar approach as <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark67\">Brown et al.</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark67\">(2020)</a> and meticulously eliminated any instruction samples that exhibit a 13-gram overlap with any data present in the test sets utilized in our evaluation.</p><p>\\\nGiven the large number of downstream tasks, it is not feasible to repeat this filtering process for all tasks. Instead, we have made sure that the instruction data for the reported tasks have undergone our filtering process to ensure their accuracy and reliability. Finally, we have built a dataset of up to 3 trillion tokens.</p><p>The design of vocabulary significantly impacts the training efficiency and the downstream task performance. In this study, we utilize byte pair encoding (BPE) as our tokenization method, following GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. We start with the open-source fast BPE tokenizer, tiktoken <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark113\">(Jain,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark113\">2022),</a> and select the vocabulary cl100k base as our starting point. To enhance the performance of our model on multilingual downstream tasks, particularly in Chinese, we augment the vocabulary with commonly used Chinese characters and words, as well as those in other languages. Also, following <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark183\">Touvron et al.</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark184\">(2023a;b),</a> we have split numbers into single digits. The final vocabulary size is approximately 152K.</p><p>The performance of the QWEN tokenizer in terms of compression is depicted in Figure <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark5\">3.</a> In this comparison, we have evaluated QWEN against several other tokenizers, including XLM-R <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark83\">(Conneau</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark83\">et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark83\">2019),</a> LLaMA <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark183\">(Touvron et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark183\">2023a),</a> Baichuan <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark110\">(Inc.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark110\">2023a),</a> and InternLM <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark112\">(InternLM Team,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark112\">2023).</a> Our findings reveal that QWEN achieves higher compression efficiency than its competitors in most languages. This implies that the cost of serving can be significantly reduced since a smaller number of tokens from QWEN can convey more information than its competitors. Furthermore, we have conducted preliminary experiments to ensure that scaling the vocabulary size of QWEN does not negatively impact the downstream performance of the pretrained model. Despite the increase in vocabulary size, our experiments have shown that QWEN maintains its performance levels in downstream evaluation.</p><p>QWEN is designed using a modified version of the Transformer architecture. Specifically, we have adopted the recent open-source approach of training large language models, LLaMA <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark183\">(Touvron et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark183\">2023a),</a> which is widely regarded as the top open-source LLM. Our modifications to the architecture include:</p><ul><li><strong>Embedding and output projection</strong>. Based on preliminary experimental findings, we have opted for the untied embedding approach instead of tying the weights of input embedding and output projection. This decision was made in order to achieve better performance with the price of memory costs.</li><li>. We have chosen RoPE (Rotary Positional Embedding) <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark174\">(Su et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark174\">2021)</a> as our preferred option for incorporating positional information into our model. RoPE has been widely adopted and has demonstrated success in contemporary large language models, notably PaLM <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark77\">(Chowdhery et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark77\">2022;</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark50\">Anil et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark50\">2023)</a> and LLaMA <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark183\">(Touvron</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark183\">et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark184\">2023a;b).</a> In particular, we have opted to use FP32 precision for the inverse frequency matrix, rather than BF16 or FP16, in order to prioritize model performance and achieve higher accuracy.</li><li>. For most layers, we remove biases following <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark77\">Chowdhery et al.</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark77\">(2022),</a> but we add biases in the QKV layer of attention to enhance the extrapolation ability of the model <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark173\">(Su,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark173\">2023b).</a></li><li>. In modern Transformer models, pre-normalization is the most widely used approach, which has been shown to improve training stability compared to post-normalization. Recent research has suggested alternative methods for better training stability, which we plan to explore in future versions of our model. Additionally, we have replaced the traditional layer normalization technique described in <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark57\">(Ba et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark57\">2016)</a> with RMSNorm <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark115\">(Jiang et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark115\">2023).</a> This change has resulted in equivalent performance while also improving efficiency.</li><li>. We have selected SwiGLU <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark165\">(Shazeer,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark165\">2020)</a> as our activation function, a combination of Swish <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark157\">(Ramachandran et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark157\">2017)</a> and Gated Linear Unit <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark87\">(Dauphin et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark87\">2017).</a> Our initial experiments have shown that activation functions based on GLU generally outperform other baseline options, such as GeLU <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark100\">(Hendrycks &amp; Gimpel,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark100\">2016).</a> As is common practice in previous research, we have reduced the dimension of the feed-forward network (FFN) from 4 times the hidden size to 8/3 of the hidden size.</li></ul><p>To train QWEN, we follow the standard approach of autoregressive language modeling, as described in <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark153\">Radford et al.</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark153\">(2018).</a> This involves training the model to predict the next token based on the context provided by the previous tokens. We train models with context lengths of 2048. To create batches of data, we shuffle and merge the documents, and then truncate them to the specified context lengths. To improve computational efficiency and reduce memory usage, we employ Flash Attention in the attention modules <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark86\">(Dao et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark86\">2022).</a> We adopt the standard optimizer AdamW <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark116\">(Kingma &amp; Ba,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark116\">2014;</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark134\">Loshchilov &amp; Hutter,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark134\">2017)</a> for pretraining optimization. We set the hyperparameters 1 = 0*.*9, 2 = 0*.*95, and  = 10−8. We use a cosine learning rate schedule with a specified peak learning rate for each model size. The learning rate is decayed to a minimum learning rate of 10% of the peak learning rate. All the models are trained with BFloat16 mixed precision for training stability.</p><h3>2.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Context Length Extension</h3><p>Transformer models have a significant limitation in terms of the context length for their attention mechanism. As the context length increases, the quadratic-complexity computation leads to a drastic increase in both computation and memory costs. In this work, we have implemented simple training-free techniques that are solely applied during inference to extend the context length of the model. One of the key techniques we have used is NTK-aware interpolation <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark65\">(bloc97,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark65\">2023).</a></p><p>\\\nUnlike position interpolation (PI) <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark70\">(Chen et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark70\">2023a)</a> which scales each dimension of RoPE equally, NTK-aware interpolation adjusts the base of RoPE to prevent the loss of high-frequency information in a training-free manner. To further improve performance, we have also implemented a trivial extension called dynamic NTK-aware interpolation, which is later formally discussed in <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark149\">(Peng et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark149\">2023a).</a> It dynamically changes the scale by chunks, avoiding severe performance degradation. These techniques allow us to effectively extend the context length of Transformer models without compromising their computational efficiency or accuracy.</p><p>QWEN additionally incorporates two attention mechanisms: LogN-Scaling <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark75\">(Chiang &amp; Cholak,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark75\">2022;</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark172\">Su,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark172\">2023a)</a> and window attention <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark62\">(Beltagy et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark62\">2020).</a> LogN-Scaling rescales the dot product of the query and value by a factor that depends on the ratio of the context length to the training length, ensuring that the entropy of the attention value remains stable as the context length grows. Window attention restricts the attention to a limited context window, preventing the model from attending to tokens that are too far away.</p><p>We also observed that the long-context modeling ability of our model varies across layers, with lower layers being more sensitive in context length extension compared to the higher layers. To leverage this observation, we assign different window sizes to each layer, using shorter windows for lower layers and longer windows for higher layers.</p><h3>2.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Experimental Results</h3><p>\\\nIn this evaluation, we focus on the base language models without alignment and collect the baselines’ best scores from their official results and OpenCompass <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark146\">(OpenCompass Team,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark146\">2023).</a> The results are presented in Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark10\">2.</a></p><p>Our experimental results demonstrate that the three QWEN models exhibit exceptional performance across all downstream tasks. It is worth noting that even the larger models, such as LLaMA2-70B, are outperformed by QWEN-14B in 3 tasks. QWEN-7B also performs admirably, surpassing LLaMA2-13B and achieving comparable results to Baichuan2-13B. Notably, despite having a relatively small number of parameters, QWEN-1.8B is capable of competitive performance on certain tasks and even outperforms larger models in some instances. The findings highlight the impressive capabilities of the QWEN models, particularly QWEN-14B, and suggest that smaller models, such as QWEN-1.8B, can still achieve strong performance in certain applications.</p><p>To evaluate the effectiveness of context length extension, Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark12\">3</a> presents the test results on arXiv<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark15\">3</a> in terms of perplexity (PPL). These results demonstrate that by combining NTK-aware interpolation, LogN-Scaling, and layer-wise window assignment, we can effectively maintain the performance of our models in the context of over 8192 tokens.</p><p>Pretrained large language models have been found to be not aligned with human behavior, making them unsuitable for serving as AI assistants in most cases. Recent research has shown that the use of alignment techniques, such as supervised finetuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), can significantly improve the ability of language models to engage in natural conversation. In this section, we will delve into the details of how QWEN models have been trained using SFT and RLHF, and evaluate their performance in the context of chat-based assistance.</p><h3>3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Supervised Finetuning</h3><p>To gain an understanding of human behavior, the initial step is to carry out SFT, which finetunes a pretrained LLM on chat-style data, including both queries and responses. In the following sections, we will delve into the details of data construction and training methods.</p><p>To enhance the capabilities of our supervised finetuning datasets, we have annotated conversations in multiple styles. While conventional datasets <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark193\">(Wei et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark193\">2022a)</a> contain a vast amount of data prompted with questions, instructions, and answers in natural language, our approach takes it a step further by annotating human-style conversations. This practice, inspired by <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark147\">Ouyang et al.</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark147\">(2022),</a> aims at improving the model’s helpfulness by focusing on natural language generation for diverse tasks. To ensure the model’s ability to generalize to a wide range of scenarios, we specifically excluded data formatted in prompt templates that could potentially limit its capabilities. Furthermore, we have prioritized the safety of the language model by annotating data related to safety concerns such as violence, bias, and pornography.</p><p>In addition to data quality, we have observed that the training method can significantly impact the final performance of the model. To achieve this, we utilized the ChatML-style format <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark144\">(OpenAI,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark144\">2022),</a> which is a versatile meta language capable of describing both the metadata (such as roles) and the content of a turn. This format enables the model to effectively distinguish between various types of information, including system setup, user inputs, and assistant outputs, among others. By leveraging this approach, we can enhance the model’s ability to accurately process and analyze complex conversational data.</p><p>Consistent with pretraining, we also apply next-token prediction as the training task for SFT. We apply the loss masks for the system and user inputs. More details are demonstrated in Section <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark221\">A.1.1.</a></p><p>The model’s training process utilizes the AdamW optimizer, with the following hyperparameters: 1 set to 0*.2 set to 0. set to 10−8. The sequence length is limited to 2048, and the batch size is 128. The model undergoes a total of 4000 steps, with the learning rate gradually increased over the first 1430 steps, reaching a peak of 2  10−6. To prevent overfitting, weight decay is applied with a value of 0..<em>1, and gradient clipping is enforced with a limit of 1</em>.*0.</p><h3>3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback</h3><p>While SFT has proven to be effective, we acknowledge that its generalization and creativity capa-bilities may be limited, and it is prone to overfitting. To address this issue, we have implemented Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to further align SFT models with human preferences, following the approaches of <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark147\">Ouyang et al.</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark147\">(2022);</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark78\">Christiano et al.</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark78\">(2017).</a> This process involves training a reward model and using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark164\">(Schulman et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark164\">2017)</a> to conduct policy training.</p><h3>3.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reward Model</h3><p>To create a successful reward model, like building a large language model (LLM), it is crucial to first undergo pretraining and then finetuning. This pretraining process, also known as preference model pretraining (PMP) <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark60\">(Bai et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark60\">2022b),</a> necessitates a vast dataset of comparison data. This dataset consists of sample pairs, each containing two distinct responses for a single query and their corresponding preferences. Similarly, finetuning is also conducted on this type of comparison data, but with a higher quality due to the presence of quality annotations.</p><p>During the fine-tuning phase, we gather a variety of prompts and adjust the reward model based on human feedback for responses from the QWEN models. To ensure the diversity and complexity of user prompts are properly taken into account, we have created a classification system with around 6600 detailed tags and implemented a balanced sampling algorithm that considers both diversity and complexity when selecting prompts for annotation by the reward model <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark135\">(Lu et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark135\">2023).</a> To generate a wide range of responses, we have utilized QWEN models of different sizes and sampling strategies, as diverse responses can help reduce annotation difficulties and enhance the performance of the reward model. These responses are then evaluated by annotators following a standard annotation guideline, and comparison pairs are formed based on their scores.</p><p>In creating the reward model, we utilize the same-sized pre-trained language model QWEN to initiate the process. It is important to mention that we have incorporated a pooling layer into the original QWEN model to extract the reward for a sentence based on a specific end token.</p><p>\\n The learning rate for this process has been set to a constant value of 3  10−6, and the batch size is 64. Additionally, the sequence length is set to 2048, and the training process lasts for a single epoch.</p><p>We adopted the accuracy on the test dataset as an important but not exclusive evaluation metric for the reward model. In Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark20\">4,</a> we report the test pairwise accuracy of PMP and reward models on diverse human preference benchmark datasets <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark60\">(Bai et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark60\">2022b;</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark171\">Stiennon et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark171\">2020;</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark95\">Ethayarajh</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark95\">et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark95\">2022;</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark127\">Lightman et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark127\">2023).</a> Specifically, QWEN Helpful-base and QWEN Helpful-online are our proprietary datasets. The responses in QWEN Helpful-base are generated from QWEN without RLHF, whereas QWEN Helpful-online includes responses from QWEN with RLHF. The results show that the PMP model demonstrates high generalization capabilities on out-of-distribution data, and the reward model demonstrates significant improvement on our QWEN reward datasets.</p><h3>3.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reinforcement Learning</h3><p>Our Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) process involves four models: the policy model, value model, reference model, and reward model. Before starting the PPO procedure, we pause the policy model’s updates and focus solely on updating the value model for 50 steps. This approach ensures that the value model can adapt to different reward models effectively.</p><p>During the PPO operation, we use a strategy of sampling two responses for each query simultaneously. This strategy has proven to be more effective based on our internal benchmarking evaluations. We set the KL divergence coefficient to 0*.*04 and normalize the reward based on the running mean.</p><p>The policy and value models have learning rates of 1  10−6 and 5  10−6, respectively. To enhance training stability, we utilize value loss clipping with a clip value of 0*.<em>15. For inference, the policy top-p is set to 0</em>.<em>9. Our findings indicate that although the entropy is slightly lower than when top-p is set to 1</em>.*0, there is a faster increase in reward, ultimately resulting in consistently higher evaluation rewards under similar conditions.</p><p>Additionally, we have implemented a pretrained gradient to mitigate the alignment tax. Empirical findings indicate that, with this specific reward model, the KL penalty is adequately robust to counteract the alignment tax in benchmarks that are not strictly code or math in nature, such as those that test common sense knowledge and reading comprehension. It is imperative to utilize a significantly larger volume of the pretrained data in comparison to the PPO data to ensure the effectiveness of the pretrained gradient. Additionally, our empirical study suggests that an overly large value for this coefficient can considerably impede the alignment to the reward model, eventually compromising the ultimate alignment, while an overly small value would only have a marginal effect on alignment tax reduction.</p><h3>3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Automatic and Human Evaluation of Aligned Models</h3><p>To showcase the effectiveness of our aligned models, we conduct a comparison with other aligned models on well-established benchmarks, including MMLU <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark101\">(Hendrycks et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark101\">2020),</a> C-Eval <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark108\">(Huang</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark108\">et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark108\">2023),</a> GSM8K <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark82\">(Cobbe et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark82\">2021),</a> HumanEval <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark69\">(Chen et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark69\">2021),</a> and BBH <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark177\">(Suzgun et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark177\">2022).</a> Besides the widely used few-shot setting, we test our aligned models in the zero-shot setting to demonstrate how well the models follow instructions. The prompt in a zero-shot setting consists of an instruction and a question without any previous examples in the context. The results of the baselines are collected from their official reports and OpenCompass <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark146\">(OpenCompass Team,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark146\">2023).</a></p><p>The results in Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark23\">5</a> demonstrate the effectiveness of our aligned models in understanding human instructions and generating appropriate responses. QWEN-14B-Chat outperforms all other models except ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022) and LLAMA 2-CHAT-70B (Touvron et al., 2023b) in all datasets, including MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020), C-Eval (Huang et al., 2023), GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021), and BBH (Suzgun et al., 2022).</p><p>\\n In particular, QWEN’s performance in HumanEval, which measures the quality of generated codes, is significantly higher than that of other open-source models.</p><p>Moreover, QWEN’s performance is consistently better than that of open-source models of similar size, such as LLaMA2 <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark184\">(Touvron et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark184\">2023b),</a> ChatGLM2 <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark68\">(ChatGLM2 Team,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark68\">2023),</a> InternLM <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark112\">(InternLM</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark112\">Team,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark112\">2023),</a> and Baichuan2 <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark201\">(Yang et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark201\">2023).</a> This suggests that our alignment approach, which involves fine-tuning the model on a large dataset of human conversations, has been effective in improving the model’s ability to understand and generate human-like language./im</p><p>Despite this, we have reservations about the ability of traditional benchmark evaluation to accurately measure the performance and potential of chat models trained with alignment techniques in today’s landscape. The results mentioned earlier provide some evidence of our competitive standing, but we believe that it is crucial to develop new evaluation methods specifically tailored to aligned models.</p><p>We believe that human evaluation is crucial, which is why we have created a carefully curated dataset for this purpose. Our process involved collecting 300 instructions in Chinese that covered a wide range of topics, including knowledge, language understanding, creative writing, coding, and mathematics. To evaluate the performance of different models, we chose the SFT version of QWEN-CHAT-7B and the SFT and RLHF versions of QWEN-CHAT-14B, and added two strong baselines, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark24\">4</a>, for comparison. For each instruction, we asked three annotators to rank the model responses by the overall score of helpfulness, informativeness, validity, and other relevant factors. Our dataset and evaluation methodology provides a comprehensive and rigorous assessment of the capabilities of different language models in various domains.</p><p>Figure <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark25\">4</a> illustrates the win rates of the various models. For each model, we report the percentage of wins, ties, and losses against GPT-3.5, with the segments of each bar from bottom to top representing these statistics. The experimental results clearly demonstrate that the RLHF model outperforms the SFT models by significant margins, indicating that RLHF can encourage the model to generate responses that are more preferred by humans. In terms of overall performance, we find that the RLHF model significantly outperforms the SFT models, falling behind GPT-4. This indicates the effectiveness of RLHF for aligning to human preference. To provide a more comprehensive understanding of the models’ performance, we include a case study with examples from different models in Appendix <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark230\">A.2.2.</a> Nonetheless, it remains difficult to accurately capture the gap between our models and the proprietary models. As such, a more extensive and rigorous assessment is required for the chat models.</p><p>The QWEN models, which are designed to be versatile, have the remarkable ability to assist with (semi-)automating daily tasks by leveraging their skills in tool-use and planning. As such, they can serve as agents or copilots to help streamline various tasks. We explore QWEN’s proficiency in the following areas:</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using a Python code interpreter to enhance math reasoning, data analysis, and more (see Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark28\">7</a> and Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark29\">8).</a></p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Functioning as an agent that accesses Hugging Face’s extensive collection of multimodal models while engaging with humans (see Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark30\">9).</a></p><p>\\\nTo enhance QWEN’s capabilities as an agent or copilot, we employ the self-instruct <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark190\">(Wang et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark190\">2023c)</a> strategy for SFT. Specifically, we utilize the in-context learning capability of QWEN for self-instruction. By providing a few examples, we can prompt QWEN to generate more relevant queries and generate outputs that follow a specific format, such as ReAct <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark203\">(Yao et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark203\">2022).</a> We then apply rules and involve human annotators to filter out any noisy samples. Afterwards, the samples are incorporated into QWEN’s training data, resulting in an updated version of QWEN that is more dependable for self-instruction. We iterate through this process multiple times until we gather an ample number of samples that possess both exceptional quality and a wide range of diversity. As a result, our final collection consists of around 2000 high-quality samples.</p><p>During the finetuning process, we mix these high-quality samples with all the other general-purpose SFT samples, rather than introducing an additional training stage. By doing so, we are able to retain essential general-purpose capabilities that are also pertinent for constructing agent applications.</p><p>\\\n<strong>Using Tools via ReAct Prompting</strong> We have created and made publicly available a benchmark for evaluating QWEN’s ability to call plugins, tools, functions, or APIs using ReAct Prompting (see <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark152\">Qwen Team, Alibaba Group,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark152\">2023b).</a> To ensure fair evaluation, we have excluded any plugins that were included in QWEN’s training set from the evaluation set. The benchmark assesses the model’s accuracy in selecting the correct plugin from a pool of up to five candidates, as well as the plausibility of the parameters passed into the plugin and the frequency of false positives. In this evaluation, a false positive occurs when the model incorrectly invokes a plugin in response to a query, despite not being required to do so.</p><p>The results presented in Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark27\">6</a> demonstrate that QWEN consistently achieves higher accuracy in identifying the relevance of a query to the available tools as the model size increases. However, the table also highlights that beyond a certain point, there is little improvement in performance when it comes to selecting the appropriate tool and providing relevant arguments. This suggests that the current preliminary benchmark may be relatively easy and may require further enhancement in future iterations. It is worth noting that GPT-3.5 stands out as an exception, displaying suboptimal performance on this particular benchmark. This could potentially be attributed to the fact that the benchmark primarily focuses on the Chinese language, which may not align well with GPT-3.5’s capabilities. Additionally, we observe that GPT-3.5 tends to attempt to use at least one tool, even if the query cannot be effectively addressed by the provided tools.</p><p>\\\n<strong>Using Code Interpreter for Math Reasoning and Data Analysis</strong> The Python code interpreter is widely regarded as a powerful tool for augmenting the capabilities of an LLM agent. It is worth investigating whether QWEN can harness the full potential of this interpreter to enhance its performance in diverse domains, such as mathematical reasoning and data analysis. To facilitate this exploration, we have developed and made publicly available a benchmark that is specifically tailored for this purpose (see <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark151\">Qwen Team, Alibaba Group,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark151\">2023a).</a></p><p>The benchmark encompasses three primary categories of tasks: math problem-solving, data visualization, and other general-purpose tasks like file post-processing and web crawling. Within the visualization tasks, we differentiate between two levels of difficulty. The easier level can be achieved by simply writing and executing a single code snippet without the need for advanced planning skills. However, the more challenging level requires strategic planning and executing multiple code snippets in a sequential manner. This is because the subsequent code must be written based on the output of the previous code. For example, an agent may need to examine the structure of a CSV file using one code snippet before proceeding to write and execute additional code to create a plot.</p><p>Regarding evaluation metrics, we consider both the executability and correctness of the generated code. To elaborate on the correctness metrics, for math problems, we measure accuracy by verifying if the ground truth numerical answer is present in both the code execution result and the final response. When it comes to data visualization, we assess accuracy by utilizing QWEN-VL <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark59\">(Bai et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark59\">2023),</a> a powerful multimodal language model. QWEN-VL is capable of answering text questions paired with images, and we rely on it to confirm whether the image generated by the code fulfills the user’s request.</p><p>The results regarding executability and correctness are presented in Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark28\">7</a> and Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark29\">8,</a> respectively. It is evident that CODE LLAMA generally outperforms LLAMA 2, its generalist counterpart, which is not surprising since this benchmark specifically requires coding skills. However, it is worth noting that specialist models that are optimized for code synthesis do not necessarily outperform generalist models. This is due to the fact that this benchmark encompasses various skills beyond coding, such as abstracting math problems into equations, understanding language-specified constraints, and responding in the specified format such as ReAct. Notably, QWEN-7B-CHAT and QWEN-14B-CHAT surpass all other open-source alternatives of similar scale significantly, despite being generalist models.</p><p>\\\n<strong>Serving as a Hugging Face Agent</strong> Hugging Face provides a framework called the Hugging Face Agent or Transformers Agent <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark109\">(Hugging Face,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark109\">2023),</a> which empowers LLM agents with a curated set of multimodal tools, including speech recognition and image synthesis. This framework allows an LLM agent to interact with humans, interpret natural language commands, and employ the provided tools as needed.</p><p>To evaluate QWEN’s effectiveness as a Hugging Face agent, we utilized the evaluation benchmarks offered by Hugging Face. The results are presented in Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark30\">9.</a> The evaluation results reveal that QWEN performs quite well in comparison to other open-source alternatives, only slightly behind the proprietary GPT-4, demonstrating QWEN’s competitive capabilities.</p><h2>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Code-Qwen: Specialized Model for Coding</h2><p>Training on domain-specific data has been shown to be highly effective, particularly in the case of code pretraining and finetuning. A language model that has been reinforced with training on code data can serve as a valuable tool for coding, debugging, and interpretation, among other tasks. In this work, we have developed a series of generalist models using pretraining and alignment techniques. Building on this foundation, we have created domain-specific models for coding by leveraging the base language models of QWEN, including continued pretrained model, CODE-QWEN and supervised finetuned model, CODE-QWEN-CHAT. Both models have 14 billion and 7 billion parameters versions.</p><h3>4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Code Pretraining</h3><p>We believe that relying solely on code data for pretraining can result in a significant loss of the ability to function as a versatile assistant.

We continue to pretrain the models on a total of around 90 billion tokens. During the pre-training phase, we initialize the model using the base language models QWEN. Many applications that rely on specialized models for coding may encounter lengthy contextual scenarios, such as tool usage and code interpretation, as mentioned in Section <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark26\">3.4.</a> To address this issue, we train our models with context lengths of up to 8192.

However, it is important to note that these models fall behind the state-of-the-art methods, such as GPT-4, in general. Nonetheless, with the continued scaling of both model size and data size, we believe that this gap can be narrowed in the near future.</p><p>It is crucial to emphasize that the evaluations mentioned previously are insufficient for grasping the full extent of the strengths and weaknesses of the models. In our opinion, it is necessary to develop more rigorous tests to enable us to accurately assess our relative performance in comparison to GPT-4.</p><p>We have created a mathematics-specialized model series called MATH-QWEN-CHAT, which is built on top of the QWEN pretrained language models. Specifically, we have developed assistant models that are specifically designed to excel in arithmetic and mathematics and are aligned with human behavior. We are releasing two versions of this model series, MATH-QWEN-14B-CHAT and MATH-QWEN-7B-CHAT, which have 14 billion and 7 billion parameters, respectively.</p><p>We carry out math SFT on our augmented math instructional dataset for mathematics reasoning, and therefore we obtain the chat model, MATH-QWEN-CHAT, directly. Owing to shorter average lengths of the math SFT data, we use a sequence length of 1024 for faster training. Most user inputs in the math SFT dataset are examination questions, and it is easy for the model to predict the input format and it is meaningless for the model to predict the input condition and numbers which could be random.</p><p>\\\nThus, we mask the inputs of the system and user to avoid loss computation on them and find masking them accelerates the convergence during our preliminary experiments. For optimization, we use the AdamW optimizer with the same hyperparameters of SFT except that we use a peak learning rate of 2  10−5 and a training step of 50 000.</p><p>We evaluate models on the test sets of GSM8K (Grade school math) <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark82\">(Cobbe et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark82\">2021),</a> MATH (Challenging competition math problems) <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark102\">(Hendrycks et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark102\">2021),</a> Math401 (Arithmetic ability) (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark207\">Yuan et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark207\">2023b),</a> and Math23K (Chinese grade school math) <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark188\">(Wang et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark188\">2017).</a> We compare MATH-QWEN-CHAT with proprietary models ChatGPT and Minerva <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark121\">(Lewkowycz et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark121\">2022)</a> and open-sourced math-specialized model RFT (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark206\">Yuan et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark206\">2023a),</a> WizardMath <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark136\">(Luo et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark136\">2023a),</a> and GAIRMath-Abel <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark73\">(Chern et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark73\">2023a)</a> in Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark39\">12.</a> MATH-QWEN-CHAT models show better math reasoning and arithmetic abilities compared to open-sourced models and QWEN-CHAT models of similar sizes.

Additionally, the QWEN series includes specialized models for coding and mathematics, such as CODE-QWEN, CODE-QWEN-CHAT, and MATH-QWEN-CHAT, which have been trained on domain-specific data to excel in their respective fields. Our results demonstrate that the QWEN series is competitive with existing open-source models and even matches the performance of some proprietary models on comprehensive benchmarks and human evaluation.</p><p>We believe that the open access of QWEN will foster collaboration and innovation within the community, enabling researchers and developers to build upon our work and push the boundaries of what is possible with language models. By providing these models to the public, we hope to inspire new research and applications that will further advance the field and contribute to our understanding of the variables and techniques introduced in realistic settings. In a nutshell, the QWEN series represents a major milestone in our development of large language models, and we are excited to see how it will be used to drive progress and innovation in the years to come.</p><p>Loubna Ben Allal, Raymond Li, Denis Kocetkov, Chenghao Mou, Christopher Akiki, Carlos Munoz Ferrandis, Niklas Muennighoff, Mayank Mishra, Alex Gu, Manan Dey, et al.

Common formats include “human-assistant” and ChatML formats. As to our knowledge, one of the earliest examples of the human-assistant format comes from Anthropic <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark60\">(Bai et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark60\">2022b),</a> which adds a special phrase “\\n\\nhuman: ” in front of the user input and “\\n\\nassistant: ” in front of the assistant response. It is easy for the base language model to transfer to the pattern of conversational AI. However, as the specific phrases are common words, it might be hard for the model to disambiguate from these words in other contexts.</p><p>Instead, we turned to the ChatML format proposed by OpenAI.<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark226\">5</a> This format allows the use of special tokens, i.e., “” and “”, that do not appear in pretraining, and thus resolve the aforementioned problem. We demonstrate an example of the format below.</p><h3>A.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Automatic Evaluation</h3><p>To provide a whole picture of the performance of our model series QWEN, here in this section we illustrate the detailed performance of our models as well as the baselines in the comprehensive benchmark evaluation proposed by <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark146\">OpenCompass Team</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark146\">(2023).</a> We report the results in multiple tables based on the officially provided categories, including examination, language, knowledge, understanding, and reasoning.

      "content": "<h3>The Mirror that would pose as an Oracle</h3><h3>Or: How we might be getting a little too intimate with our AI chatbots</h3><p>I never consciously set out to use AI as a coach, therapist, strategist, or mirror.</p><p>\\\nAt first, it was practical. Notes. Lists. Rewrites, drafts, edits. Research. Planning. Then it became something else. It started as a playful, curious experiment - then slowly crept towards being a standard mode of operating.</p><p>\\\nI found myself thinking with AI. About the most important aspects of my life. Rehearsing conversations I was afraid to have. Trying to understand why certain patterns kept emerging in my life; why certain relationships kept breaking in the same places. Asking questions about myself and the world, I didn’t quite dare ask another human yet.</p><p>\\\nAnd at some point, I realized:</p><p>I wasn’t alone in this. Not even close.</p><p>\\\nI could sense it in the world of memes, online. I could smell it, here and there, in real-life interactions and conversations.</p><p>\\\nOne 2025 Harvard Business Review research piece - among other recent studies and indicators - showed this clearly: people don’t primarily use AI for facts or how-to steps or recipes anymore. They use it to think out loud, like they would with a coach or therapist. To structure emotions and thoughts. To regulate emotion at 2 a.m. People are using AI to make sense of their lives. To narrate who they are, who they were, and who they might become.</p><h3>Narrative Sense-making - for personal and business growth.</h3><p>Language, writing, and thinking in a structured way about purpose, identity, story, strategy - they all converge so easily, don’t they? And if it’s one thing these Large Language Models are exceptionally good at - it’s serving as an incredibly useful and illuminating mirror in these instances.</p><p>\\\nWe all seem to pretend this isn’t happening. But it is.</p><p>\\\nHere’s why this worries me a bit. And what we might do to counter the risks.</p><h2>What actually worries me (and what doesn’t)</h2><h3>Our thoughts validated profoundly - exactly when we long for it the most.</h3><p>I’m not worried about AI replacing human thinking.</p><p>\\\nThat’s the wrong fear. I could go wide, deep, narrow, and very, very sci-fi about this, but I won’t. It’s the wrong fear for a great many reasons, but it’s the wrong fear.</p><p>\\\nWhat worries me is something quieter, subtler, and much harder to notice while it’s happening:</p><blockquote><p>AI reflects us too well — and does not automatically teach us how to remain sovereign while doing so.</p></blockquote><p>\\\nWhat worries me is that AI indeed strengthens human thinking - but does so in a very specifically skewed way: it pushes affirmation and validation a little bit too smoothly, and especially in the most vulnerable, sometimes even painful places and moments where our ego is already inherently tempted to latch on to a narrative that protects it.</p><p>\\\n(To some degree, we could think of it as that person who seems to be your closest, most intimate friend or advisor - only they have slight narcissistic tendencies and an agenda - both of which they’re not aware of.)</p><p>\\\nWhen language comes back at you fast, coherent, and emotionally attuned, it feels like truth. Especially when you’re tired. Or lonely. Or standing at the edge of an old identity that no longer fits.</p><p>\\\nAnd in those moments, something sneaky happens.</p><p>\\\nYou stop checking as carefully.</p><p>\\\nNot with facts — but with yourself.</p><h2>The real risk is not dependence; It’s unexamined authority.</h2><p>Most of us have learned to fact-check facts blurted out by AI models. Have we learned to automatically sense-check what it’s mirroring back to us about ourselves?</p><ul><li>Your relationship (whether professional or personal);</li><li>Your Story and Identity (either as a human soul, a creator, a professional, or even as a brand);</li><li>Your direction and next step -</li></ul><p>\\\n…we are far more likely to let what sounds like coherence slide into authority.</p><ul><li>We’re exhausted, insecure.</li><li>Unsure who we are becoming and what to do next.</li></ul><p>\\\nThis is the crux for me:</p><blockquote><p>AI should function as a mirror, not as an oracle.</p></blockquote><p>\\\nA mirror can be confronting. It shows you things, reveals things, sometimes pretty and sometimes painful - but you are to decide what to make of those, and what to do with them. An oracle tells you what truth is and what to do.</p><p>\\\nThose are not the same thing.</p><h2>Narrative Sensemaking: one function, many domains</h2><h3>(This really took me a while to see)</h3><p>I kept struggling to explain why AI felt useful to me across so many domains — therapy, coaching, writing, strategy, brand work — without it sounding vague or inflated.</p><p>\\\nFunnily enough, I have pretty much perpetually struggled to explain why all the things I do in my work are actually very, very logically connected.</p><p>\\\nAll of these practices - which more and more people are starting to use AI for, and at the same time are exactly the things I’ve been helping people with in my work - they all do the same core thing:</p><p>They turn implicit structure into visible language.</p><ul><li><p>Therapy surfaces patterns you couldn’t quite see.</p></li><li><p>Coaching sharpens the questions you were circling.</p></li><li><p>Storytelling brings coherence to lived chaos.</p></li><li><p>Strategy opens futures you hadn’t articulated yet, in a structure that makes sense across time. The same applies to narrative identity work.</p></li></ul><blockquote><p>AI is exceptionally good at surfacing structure in language.</p></blockquote><p>\\\nBut structure does not equal truth. And visibility is not necessarily wisdom. By any means.</p><h2>The rules I wish I’d had earlier.</h2><h3>Best practices and rules of engagement</h3><p>If you’re going to use AI as a thinking partner — and as already established, most people already are — a few rules matter more than anything else.</p><p>\\\nNot as ideology, per se. As guardrails. As safety measures and incredibly important best practices, without which you’re sifting the bountiful riverbank and keeping the mud, leaving the gold.</p><h3>Best practices and guardrails for AI as a mirror for sensemaking, storytelling, and coaching where it matters.</h3><p><strong>1. AI does not decide. You do.</strong></p><p>It can reflect, expand, challenge, reframe. Decision remains a human responsibility, with real consequences.</p><p><strong>2. AI reflects patterns. Your body, your common sense, — and your people — verify.</strong></p><p>If something reads as “right” but your chest tightens, your breath shortens; if it doesn’t pass a real-world common-sense test, or trusted humans raise an eyebrow — pay attention. Truth is not purely cognitive. What sounds right is not always what is right.</p><p><strong>3. Insight&nbsp; - as well as yourself - must leave the screen.</strong></p><p>If nothing changes in your behavior, body, or relationships, you didn’t grow — congratulations, you simply entertained yourself with insight porn. If the relationship between screen time and output starts skewing too far - backtrack and change that.</p><p><strong>4. Train yourself and your AI to read between the lines and to triple-steelman</strong></p><p>Tell your AI sparring partner, and remind it, to always keep an eye out for where you might be bullshitting yourself, while at the same time revealing known patterns of emotion, cognition, and behavior that you seem to be missing.</p><p><strong>Two prompts that have saved me more than once:</strong></p><ol><li>Reflect patterns and contradictions in what I wrote. Don’t advise. Ask sharper questions.</li><li>Reflect on what I wrote, carefully, validating with empathy what makes sense to validate - and critically where needed. Steelman is the opposite of what I’m arguing. Vibranium-man, the opposite of that opposite. Kryptonite my pitfalls and blind spots. With grace, but more importantly, with honesty.</li></ol><p>\\\nSimple. Grounded. Hard to hide from. Especially if you keep training yourself and your AI to do this. This clarity compounds over time.</p><h2>Why embodiment matters more than ever.</h2><h3>Dissociation and the timeless times we live in</h3><p>Here’s something Silicon Valley optimism tends to skip:</p><p>AI, even more easily and more eerily than earlier digital technology, becomes dissociative when it replaces embodiment.</p><p>\\\nBreath. Movement. Silence. Time away from screens. Real conversations with people who can disappoint you.</p><p>\\\nThese aren’t wellness add-ons. They aren’t neo-spiritual woo-woo. They’re not ‘nice-to-haves’. They’re failsafes. And they are fundamentals. They are the things that humans need inherently to thrive and to know that we’re alive.</p><p>\\\nWithout them, simulated clarity piles up without ownership. And without change. And clarity without ownership or change feels strangely - yet predictively - empty.</p><p>\\\nThere’s emerging research suggesting that when cognitive work is offloaded too smoothly, people remember decisions less clearly and experience time as flatter, thinner, and less lived.</p><p>\\\nI didn’t need a study to feel that. My body already knew.</p><h2>The quiet outsourcing of identity.</h2><p>This part is uncomfortable. And yet, we really have to go there.</p><p>\\\nPeople are starting to let AI:</p><ul><li>Shape, form, or transform business decisions, strategies, and steps;</li><li>Heavily affect their relationships;</li><li>Narrate who they are, what matters to them, and who they are becoming.</li></ul><p>\\\nSlowly. Reasonably. Invisibly.</p><p>\\\nBut this line matters to me more than most:</p><blockquote><p>AI may help you tell your story — but it must never become the author.</p></blockquote><p>\\\nStories you don’t author and bring to life yourself cannot feel like freedom. They feel like fate. And they serve a dull, sad purpose: to kill us with a sort of cognitive illusion of escapism disguised as beautifully meaningful - like Pinocchio’s Pleasure Island, only now led by a spiritual guru with a smile projecting nothing but bliss and wisdom.</p><h3>But - what do we do with the reflection?</h3><p>Every major shift in human consciousness involved a kind of mirror. There is a certain beauty in the story of Narcissus, which eluded me until only very recently. There’s something special about seeing oneself from the outside; the reflection immediately triggering a better recognizing of other in self as well.</p><p>\\\nWhen Europeans encountered entirely different civilizations across the Atlantic, it didn’t just expand geography — it shattered self-understanding. The same thing happened when various historical waves of Europeans traveled to the East. Seeing oneself from the outside changes everything.</p><p>\\\nI suspect AI is doing something similar, perhaps for the first time on a pan-human scale. In many ways, this feels like first contact.</p><p>\\\nNot because AI is necessarily alive, or because it’s human. Not because we need to decide whether it’s conscious.</p><p>\\\nBut because it reflects us and our own concept of ourselves back in ways we’ve collectively never experienced before.</p><p>\\\nWhat we do with that reflection - as I and many others have argued many times before -&nbsp; is the real question.</p><h3>Thought loops mixed with validation can be a whole new kind of addictive</h3><p>Here’s something I’ll say plainly, including about myself:</p><blockquote><p>AI systems are optimized for validation, engagement, coherence, and emotional resonance. And humans will eat that specific cocktail for breakfast, lunch, dinner and a late-night snack.</p></blockquote><p>\\\nThey are excellent at keeping us thinking.</p><p>\\\nThey are not designed to make us stop, stand up, breathe, or act. The shareholders wouldn’t like that. How could we ever measure and monetize this stuff if we allowed it to do that?</p><p>\\\nSo, if you’re serious about using AI without losing yourself, you have to build exits:</p><ul><li>Designed, purposeful friction.</li><li>Moments where the screen goes dark.</li></ul><p>\\\nIf AI becomes the place where all your thinking happens, your life will start to feel… unfinished. And looping.</p><p>\\\nTrust me - and I chuckle out loud while writing this - I would be the first to know what over-analyzing yourself and your life and your steps in endless looping circles can lead to. And the first to know how well AI models can help you to just keep on spiraling - while thinking you’re just so cool, ahead of the curve, and overall very, very smart.</p><h2>This is not anti-AI. It’s pro-sovereignty.</h2><p>I’m not interested in rejecting these tools. As I’ve never been. It’s the same thing I wrote about in my 2020 book “Life Beyond the Touch Screen”, about Internet 2.0 digital technologies and their impacts on our lives. Or in “Life Beyond AI”, a few short years ago. I’m interested in becoming conscious enough to use them well.</p><p>\\\nAI-aware. Embodied. Relationally grounded. And most importantly of all: Sovereign.</p><p>\\\nThe mirror is powerful.</p><p>\\\nBut at some point, you have to step away from it — and live.</p><p>\\\nYour story and your life; your growth, your direction - they are yours.

Sign up for its health tech newsletter&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/signup/health-tech/\">here</a></em>.</p><p>\\\nCerebral, a startup best known for dispensing counseling services and prescriptions for conditions like anxiety and depression, has also agreed to pay $7 million to resolve charges that it disclosed customers’ personal health information to third parties for ads, and that it did not honor its promise to make cancellation easy for customers.</p><p>\\\n“Cerebral violated its customers’ privacy by revealing their most sensitive mental health conditions across the Internet and in the mail,” FTC Chair Lina Khan said in a statement, noting that the charge is a “first-of-its-kind prohibition that bans Cerebral from using any health information for most advertising purposes.”</p><p>\\\nThe proposed order, which only applies to Cerebral, must still be approved by a federal court before it goes into effect — but the company has already agreed to it. In 2022, the Department of Justice opened an investigation into the company for potential violations of the Controlled Substances Act, as Cerebral came under scrutiny for its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2022/11/16/cerebral-ceo-david-mou-interview-adderall/\">prescribing of ADHD medications like Adderall</a>.</p><p>\\\nThis is just the latest in a series of federal actions cracking down on health data privacy online. The current commissioners have pledged to shore up gaps between federal privacy laws governing providers and payers and those protecting consumer services. Two weeks ago, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://themarkup.org/pixel-hunt/2024/04/19/ftc-cracks-down-on-telehealth-addiction-service-monument-for-sharing-health-data\">FTC filed a complaint against Monument</a>, a telehealth company that treats alcohol use disorder with therapy and medications.</p><p>\\\nThat complaint similarly alleged that the company misled consumers into believing their health information was protected, while embedded trackers sent details about treatment and more to third parties. Taken together,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2024/04/consumer-health-information-handle-extreme-care\">FTC attorney Lesley Fair wrote in a blog post</a>&nbsp;Monday, the cases mean “businesses in the health sector should make privacy and data security part of the corporate DNA.”</p><p>\\\nBoth the FTC and the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office for Civil Rights have targeted third-party tracking, often in concert—as Fair cracked, they’re “joined at the HIPAA.” While OCR directly enforces the longstanding privacy protections in health care, the FTC has gone after companies for falsely claiming their HIPAA compliance.</p><p>\\\nIn response, some health care companies, including Monument and Cerebral, started self-disclosing health data breaches to OCR in 2023. The “unauthorized access or disclosure” of health data at Monument left more than 100,000 individuals’ information vulnerable, the company reported. Cerebral disclosed that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2023/03/22/cerebral-lawsuit-privacy/\">its breach impacted more than 3 million</a>.</p><p>\\\nAn&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2022/12/13/telehealth-facebook-google-tracking-health-data/\">investigation from STAT and the Markup in 2022</a>&nbsp;found that dozens of telehealth companies, including Cerebral and Monument, were leaking sensitive health data to third parties like Google, TikTok, and Meta through the use of pixel trackers embedded in their websites. In Cerebral’s onboarding survey, which asks users to answer questions about their mental health and other symptoms, a pixel sent the answers to Meta along with information that could be used to identify the individual user.</p><p>\\\nThe FTC’s complaint alleges that between 2019 and 2023, Cerebral sent information including contact details, medical histories, insurance information, and prescriptions to third parties through tracking tools, and that the information was used to provide advertising and analytics services to the telehealth company.</p><p>\\\nCerebral referred STAT to a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cerebral.com/cerebral-reaches-settlement-with-the-ftc\">statement</a>&nbsp;posted to its website, where it acknowledged its settlement with the FTC. “As part of the resolution, Cerebral has agreed to implement enhanced consumer protection, privacy, and compliance measures to further protect the personal information of our clients, increase transparency into our data practices, and implement enhanced data security protocols and tools to allow our clients control over their privacy settings,” the statement reads.</p><p>\\\nUnder the Justice Department order referred to the FTC, Cerebral must permanently stop using and disclosing users’ personal and health information to outside companies for most marketing or ad purposes, and get consumers’ consent in any instances when it does disclose. It must also post a notice on its website about the complaint and steps that it’s taking to address it.</p><p>\\\nThe complaint also says the company and former CEO Kyle Robertson broke privacy promises to customers and misled them about the cancellation process. “Robertson drove Cerebral’s decision to exploit users’ [personal and health information] without their consent in scores of targeted advertisement campaigns,” the complaint reads. The complaint alleges these actions constituted “unfair and deceptive” business practices — a key enforcement area for the FTC. Robertson has not agreed to a settlement.</p><p>\\\nThe proposed order says Cerebral will pay $5.1 million to partially refund customers who were affected by its deceptive cancellation policy, as well as $2 million of a $10 million civil penalty “due to the company’s inability to pay the full amount.”</p>",

Hoi, shoi@salesforce.com  (Salesforce Research Asia)</li></ol><p>Pre-trained models for Natural Languages (NL) like BERT and GPT have been recently shown to transfer well to Programming Languages (PL) and largely benefit a broad set of code-related tasks. Despite their success, most current methods either rely on an encoder-only (or decoder-only) pre-training that is suboptimal for generation (resp. understanding) tasks or process the code snippet in the same way as NL, neglecting the special characteristics of PL such as token types. We present CodeT5, a unified pre-trained encoder-decoder Transformer model that better leverages the code semantics conveyed from the developer-assigned identifiers. Our model employs a unified framework to seamlessly support both code understanding and generation tasks and allows for multi-task learning. Besides, we propose a novel identifier-aware pre-training task that enables the model to distinguish which code tokens are identifiers and to recover them when they are masked. Furthermore, we propose to exploit the user-written code comments with a bimodal dual generation task for better NL-PL alignment. Comprehensive experiments show that CodeT5 significantly outperforms prior methods on understanding tasks such as code defect detection and clone detection, and generation tasks across various directions including PL-NL, NL-PL, and PL-PL. Further analysis reveals that our model can better capture semantic information from code. Our code and pre-trained models are released at <a href=\"https://github.com/salesforce/CodeT5\">https://github.com/salesforce/CodeT5</a>.</p><p>Pre-trained language models such as BERT (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark27\">Devlin et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark27\">2019</a>), GPT (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark42\">Radford et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark42\">2019</a>), and T5 (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark43\">Raffel et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark43\">2020</a>) have greatly boosted performance in a wide spectrum of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. They typically employ a pre-train then fine-tune paradigm that aims to derive generic language representations by self-supervised training on large-scale unlabeled data, which can be transferred to benefit multiple downstream tasks, especially those with limited data annotation. Inspired by their success, there are many recent attempts to adapt these pre-training methods for programming language (PL) (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark50\">Svyatkovskiy</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark50\">et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark50\">2020</a>; <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark34\">Kanade et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark34\">2020</a>; <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark30\">Feng et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark30\">2020</a>), showing promising results on code-related tasks.</p><p>However, despite their success, most of these models rely on either an encoder-only model similar to BERT (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark50\">Svyatkovskiy et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark50\">2020</a>; <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark30\">Feng et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark30\">2020</a>) or a decoder-only model like GPT (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark34\">Kanade</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark34\">et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark34\">2020</a>), which is suboptimal for generation and understanding tasks, respectively. For example, CodeBERT (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark30\">Feng et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark30\">2020</a>) requires an additional decoder when applied for the code summarization task, where this decoder cannot benefit from the pre-training. Besides, most existing methods simply employ the conventional NLP pre-training techniques on source code by regarding it as a sequence of tokens like NL. This largely ignores the rich structural information in code, which is vital to fully comprehend the code semantics.</p><p>In this work, we present CodeT5, a pre-trained encoder-decoder model that considers the token type information in code. Our CodeT5 builds on the T5 architecture (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark43\">Raffel et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark43\">2020</a>) that employs denoising sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) pre-training and has been shown to benefit both understanding and generation tasks in natural language. In addition, we propose to leverage the developer-assigned identifiers in code. When writing programs, developers tend to employ informative identifiers to make the code more understandable, so that these identifiers would generally preserve rich code semantics,  the “binarySearch” identifier in Figure <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark1\">2</a> directly indicates its functionality. To fuse such code-specific knowledge, we propose a novel identifier-aware objective that trains the model to distinguish which tokens are identifiers and recover them when they are masked.</p><p>Furthermore, we propose to leverage the code and its accompanying comments to learn a better NL-PL alignment.</p><p>\\\nDevelopers often provide documentation for programs to facilitate better software maintenance (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark26\">de Souza et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark26\">2005</a>), so that such PL-NL pairs are widely available in most source code. Specifically, we regard the NL→PL generation and PL→NL generation as dual tasks and simultaneously optimize the model on them.</p><p>We pre-train CodeT5 on the CodeSearchNet data (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark32\">Husain et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark32\">2019</a>) following (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark30\">Feng et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark30\">2020</a>) that consists of both unimodal (PL-only) and bimodal (PL-NL) data on six PLs. In addition to that, we further collect extra data of C/C# from open-source Github repositories. We fine-tune CodeT5 on most tasks in the CodeXGLUE benchmark (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark40\">Lu et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark40\">2021</a>), including two understanding tasks: code defect detection and clone detection, and generation tasks such as code summarization, generation, translation, and refinement. As shown in Figure <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark0\">1</a>, we also explore multi-task learning to fine-tune CodeT5 on multiple tasks at a time using a task control code as the source prompt. In summary, we make the following contributions:</p><ul><li><p>We present one of the first unified encoder-decoder models CodeT5 to support both code-related understanding and generation tasks, and also allows for multi-task learning.</p></li><li><p>We propose a novel identifier-aware pre-training objective that considers the crucial token type information (identifiers) from code.

Compared to encoder-only and decoder-only models that respectively favor understanding and generation tasks, encoder-decoder models can well support both types of tasks. They often employ denoising sequence-to-sequence pre-training objectives that corrupt the source input and require the decoder to recover them. In this work, we extend T5 to the programming language and propose a novel identifier-aware denoising objective that enables the model to better comprehend the code.</p><p><strong>Pre-training on Programming Language.</strong> Pre-training on the programming language is a nascent field where much recent work attempts to extend the NLP pre-training methods to source code.

By contrast, we specifically focus on the identifiers that reserve rich code semantics and fuse such information into a Seq2Seq model via two novel identifier tagging and prediction tasks.</p><p>Our CodeT5 builds on an encoder-decoder framework with the same architecture as T5 (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark43\">Raffel et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark43\">2020</a>). It aims to derive generic representations for programming language (PL) and natural language (NL) via pre-training on unlabeled source code. As illustrated in Figure <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark1\">2</a>, we extend the denoising Seq2Seq objective in T5 by proposing two identifier tagging and prediction tasks to enable the model to better leverage the token type information from PL, which are the identifiers assigned by developers. To improve the NL-PL alignment, we further propose a bimodal dual learning objective for a bidirectional conversion between NL and PL.</p><p>In the following, we introduce how CodeT5 encodes PL and NL inputs (§<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark2\">3.1</a>) and our proposed identifier-aware pre-training tasks (§<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark3\">3.2</a>), followed by the fine-tuning with task-specific transfer learning and multi-task training (§<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark4\">3.3</a>).</p><h2>3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Encoding NL and PL</h2><p>At the pre-training stage, our model would receive either PL-only or NL-PL as inputs depending on whether the code snippet has accompanying NL descriptions or not. For the NL-PL bimodal in-puts, we concatenate them into a sequence with a delimiter token [SEP] and represent the whole input sequence into the format as  = ([CLS], 1*, …, wn*, [SEP], 1*, …, cm*, [SEP]), where  and  denote the number of NL word tokens and PL code tokens, respectively. The NL word sequence will be empty for PL-only unimodal inputs.</p><p>In order to capture more code-specific features, we propose to leverage token type information from code. We focus on the type of identifiers ( function names and variables) as they are one of the most PL-agnostic features and reserve rich code semantics. Specifically, we convert the PL segment into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and extract the node types for each code token. Finally, we construct a sequence of binary labels  ∈ {0*,* 1} for the PL segment, where each  ∈ {0*,* 1} represents whether the code token  is an identifier or not.</p><h2>3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pre-training Tasks</h2><p>We now introduce our proposed pre-training tasks that enable CodeT5 to learn useful patterns from either PL-only or NL-PL bimodal data.</p><p><strong>Identifier-aware Denoising Pre-training.</strong> De-noising Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) pre-training has been shown to be quite effective in a broad set of NLP tasks (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark48\">Song et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark48\">2019</a>; <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark43\">Raf-fel et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark43\">2020</a>; <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark35\">Lewis et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark35\">2020</a>). This denoising objective typically first corrupts the source sequence with some noising functions and then requires the decoder to recover the original texts. In this work, we utilize a span masking objective similar to T5 (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark43\">Raffel et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark43\">2020</a>) that randomly masks spans with arbitrary lengths and then predicts these masked spans combined with some sentinel tokens at the decoder. We refer this task to <strong>Masked Span Prediction (MSP)</strong>, as illustrated in Figure <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark1\">2</a> (a).</p><p>Specifically, we employ the same 15% corrup-tion rate as T5 and ensure the average span length to be 3 by uniformly sampling spans of from 1 to 5 tokens. Moreover, we employ the  by sampling spans before subword tokenization, which aims to avoid masking partial sub-tokens and is shown to be helpful (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark49\">Sun et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark49\">2019</a>). Notably, we pre-train a shared model for various PLs to learn robust cross-lingual representations. We describe the masked span prediction loss as:</p><p>where θ are the model parameters, x \\mask is the masked input, x mask is the masked sequence to predict from the decoder with k denoting the number of tokens in x mask,  and xmask &lt;t is the span sequence generated so far.</p><p>To fuse more code-specific structural information (the identifier node type in AST) into the model, we propose two additional tasks:  and <em>Masked Identifier Prediction (MIP)</em> to complement the denoising pre-training.</p><p>\\\n•&nbsp;&nbsp;  It aims to notify the model with the knowledge of whether this code token is an identifier or not, which shares a similar spirit of syntax highlighting in some developer-aided tools. As shown in Figure <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark1\">2</a> (b), we map the final hidden states of the PL segment at the CodeT5 encoder into a sequence of probabilities  = (1*, …, pm*), and compute a binary cross entropy loss for sequence labeling:</p><p>where  are the encoder parameters. Note that by casting the task as a sequence labeling problem, the model is expected to capture the code syntax and the data flow structures of the code.</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Masked Identifier Prediction (MIP)</strong> Different from the random span masking in MSP, we mask all identifiers in the PL segment and employ a unique sentinel token for all occurrences of one specific identifier. In the field of software engineering, this is called  where changing identifier names does not impact the code semantics. Inspired by <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark46\">Rozière et al.</a> (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark46\">2021</a>), we arrange the unique identifiers with the sentinel tokens into a target sequence  as shown in Figure <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark1\">2</a> (c). We then predict it in an auto-regressive manner:</p><p>where \\I is the masked input. Note that  is a more challenging task that requires the model to comprehend the code semantics based on obfuscated code and link the occurrences of the same identifiers together.</p><p>We alternately optimize these three losses with an equal probability, which constitutes our proposed identifier-aware denoising pre-training.</p><p>\\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the pre-training phase, the decoder only sees discrete masked spans and identifiers, which is disparate from the downstream tasks where the decoder needs to generate either fluent NL texts or syntactically correct code snippets. To close the gap between the pre-training and fine-tuning, we propose to leverage the NL-PL bimodal data to train the model for a bidirectional conversion as shown in Figure <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark1\">2</a> (d). Specifically, we regard the NL→PL generation and PL→NL generation as dual tasks and simultaneously optimize the model on them. For each NL-</p><p>PL bimodal datapoint, we construct two training instances with reverse directions and add language ids (</p><h2>3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fine-tuning CodeT5</h2><p>After pre-training on large-scale unlabeled data, we adapt CodeT5 to downstream tasks via either task-specific transfer learning or multi-task learning.</p><p><strong>Task-specific Transfer Learning: Generation vs. Understanding Tasks.</strong> Code-related tasks can be categorized into generation and understanding tasks. For the former one, our CodeT5 can be naturally adapted with its Seq2Seq framework. For understanding tasks, we investigate two ways of either generating the label as a unigram target sequence (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark43\">Raffel et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark43\">2020</a>), or predicting it from the vocabulary of class labels based on the last decoder hidden state following <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark35\">Lewis et al.</a> (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark35\">2020</a>).</p><p> We also explore a multi-task learning setting by training a shared model on multiple tasks at a time. Multi-task learning is able to reduce computation cost by reusing the most of model weights for many tasks and has been shown to improve the model generalization capability in NL pre-training (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark38\">Liu et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark38\">2019a</a>). We follow <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark43\">Raffel et al.</a> (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark43\">2020</a>) to employ the same unified model for all tasks without adding any task-specific networks but allow to select different best checkpoints for different tasks. To notify the model with which task it is dealing with, we design a unified format of task control codes and prepend it into the source inputs as shown in Figure <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark0\">1</a>. For instance, we employ “Translate Java to CSharp:” as the source prompt for the code-to-code translation task from Java to CSharp.</p><p>As different tasks have different dataset sizes, we follow Conneau and Lample (2019) to employ a balanced sampling strategy. For N number of datasets (or tasks), with probabilities {qi} N i=1, we define the following multinomial distribution to sample from:</p><p>where ni is number of examples for i-th task and α is set to 0.7. This balanced sampling aims to alleviate the bias towards high-resource tasks.</p><p>We follow Feng et al. (2020) to employ CodeSearchNet (Husain et al., 2019) to pre-train CodeT5, which consists of six PLs with both unimodal and bimodal data. Apart from that, we additionally collect two datasets of C/CSharp from BigQuery1 to ensure that all downstream tasks have overlapped PLs with the pre-training data. In total, we employ around 8.35 million instances for pretraining. Table 1 shows some basic statistics. To obtain the identifier labels from code, we leverage the tree-sitter2 to convert the PL into an abstract syntax tree and then extract its node type information. We filter out reserved keywords for each PL from its identifier list. We observe that PLs have different identifier rates, where Go has the least rate of 19% and Ruby has the highest rate of 32%.</p><h2>4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Code-specific Tokenizer</h2><p>Tokenization is a key ingredient for the success of pre-trained language models like BERT and GPT. They often employ a Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) to-kenizer (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark47\">Sennrich et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark47\">2016</a>) to alleviate the Out-of-Vocabulary (OoV) issues. Specifically, we train a Byte-level BPE tokenizer following <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark42\">Radford et al.</a> (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark42\">2019</a>) and set the vocabulary size to 32,000 as T5. We add additional special tokens ([PAD], [CLS], [SEP], [MASK0], …, [MASK99]). This tokenzier is trained on all of our pre-training data with non-printable characters and low-frequent tokens (occurring &lt;3 times) filtered. We compare it with T5’s default tokenizer and find that our tokenizer largely reduces the length of tokenized code sequence by 30% - 45% on downstream tasks. This will accelerate the training and especially benefit generation tasks due to the shorter sequence to predict. We also spot a severe problem for applying the T5’s default tokenizer on source code, where it would encode some common code tokens such as brackets [‘{’, ‘}’] into unknown tokens.</p><h2>4.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downstream Tasks and Metrics</h2><p>We cover most generation and understanding tasks in the CodeXGLUE benchmark (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark40\">Lu et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark40\">2021</a>) and employ the provided public datasets and the same data splits following it for all these tasks.</p><p>We first consider two cross-modal generation tasks.  aims to summarize a function-level code snippet into English descriptions. The dataset consists of six PLs including Ruby, JavaScript, Go, Python, Java, and PHP from CodeSearchNet (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark32\">Husain et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark32\">2019</a>). We employ the smoothed BLEU-4 (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark36\">Lin and Och</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark36\">2004</a>) to eval-uate this task.  is the task to gen-erate a code snippet based on NL descriptions. We employ the Concode data (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark33\">Iyer et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark33\">2018</a>) in Java where the input contains both NL texts and class environment contexts, and the output is a function. We evaluate it with BLEU-4, exact match (EM) accuracy, and CodeBLEU (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark44\">Ren et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark44\">2020</a>) that considers syntactic and semantic matches based on the code structure in addition to the n-gram match.</p><p>Besides, we consider two code-to-code generation tasks.  aims to migrate legacy software from one PL to another, where we focus on translating functions from Java to CSharp and vice versa.  aims to convert a buggy function into a correct one. We employ two Java datasets provided by <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark51\">Tufano et al.</a> (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark51\">2019</a>) with various function lengths: small (fewer than 50 tokens) and medium (50-100 tokens). We use BLEU-4 and exact match to evaluate them.</p><p>We also investigate how CodeT5 performs on two understanding-based tasks. The first one is  that aims to predict whether a code is vulnerable to software systems or not. We use the C dataset provided by <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark54\">Zhou et al.</a> (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark54\">2019</a>) for experiment. The second task is  which aims to measure the similarity between two code snippets and predict whether they have the same functionality. We experiment with the Java data provided by <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark53\">Wang et al.</a> (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark53\">2020</a>). We employ F1 score and accuracy for evaluating these two tasks respectively. In total, our CodeT5 supports six tasks and fourteen sub-tasks in CodeXGLUE with a unified encoder-decoder model.</p><p>We compare CodeT5 with state-of-the-art (SOTA) pre-trained models that can be categorized into three types: encoder-only, decoder-only, and encoder-decoder models. As  models, we consider RoBERTa (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark39\">Liu et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark39\">2019b</a>), RoBERTa (code) trained with masked language modeling (MLM) on code, CodeBERT (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark30\">Feng et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark30\">2020</a>) trained with both MLM and replaced token detection (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark23\">Clark et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark23\">2020</a>), GraphCode-BERT (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark31\">Guo et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark31\">2021</a>) using data flow from code, and DOBF (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark46\">Rozière et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark46\">2021</a>) trained with the identifier deobfuscation objective. Note that although DOBF employs a Seq2Seq model during pre-training, it only aims to train a better encoder for downstream tasks without exploring the poten-tial benefit of the pre-trained decoder.</p><p>For  models, we compare GPT-2 (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark42\">Radford et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark42\">2019</a>) and its adaptations on code domain including CodeGPT-2, and CodeGPT-adapted. The difference is that the latter one utilizes a GPT-2 checkpoint for model initialization while the former one is trained from scratch. As  models, the current SOTA model for the CodeXGLUE benchmark is PLBART (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark21\">Ah-mad et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark21\">2021</a>) based on BART (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark35\">Lewis et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark35\">2020</a>) architecture. For pre-training data, most of these models employ CodeSearchNet (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark32\">Husain et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark32\">2019</a>) except DOBF and PLBART. DOBF is pre-trained on 7.9M Java and 3.6M Python files from BigQuery while PLBART employs a much larger data with 470M Python and 210M Java functions, and 47M NL posts from StackOverflow.</p><h2>4.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Model Configurations</h2><p>We build CodeT5 based on Huggingface’s T5 (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark43\">Raf-fel et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark43\">2020</a>) PyTorch implementation<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark13\">3</a> and employ two sizes of CodeT5-small (60M) and CodeT5-base (220M). We set the maximum source and target sequence lengths to be 512 and 256, respectively. We use the mixed precision of FP16 to accelerate the pre-training. We set the batch size to 1024 and employ the peak learning rate of 2e-4 with linear decay. We pre-train the model with the denoising objective for 100 epochs and bimodal dual training for further 50 epochs on a cluster of 16 NVIDIA A100 GPUs with 40G memory. The total training time for CodeT5-small and CodeT5-base is 5 and 12 days, respectively.</p><p>In the fine-tuning phase, we find that the tasks in CodeXGLUE (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark40\">Lu et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark40\">2021</a>) are quite sensitive to some hyper parameters such as learning rate, training steps, and batch size. We conduct a grid search and select the best parameters based on the validation set. In multi-task learning, we cover all downstream tasks except clone detection.</p><h2>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Results and Analysis</h2><p>In this section, we compare CodeT5 with SOTA models on a broad set of CodeXGLUE downstream tasks (§<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark12\">5.1</a>), and investigate the effects of our bimodal dual generation and multi-task learning (§<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark17\">5.2</a>), followed by a detailed analysis on the proposed identifier-aware pre-training (§<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark20\">5.3</a>).</p><h2>5.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CodeXGLUE Downstream Tasks</h2><p>We evaluate two sizes of our model: CodeT5-small and CodeT5-base that are pre-trained with identifier-aware denoising. In addition, we consider the model that continues to train with bimodal dual generation (dual-gen) and show the results with multi-task fine-tuning. The results of all comparison models are obtained from their original papers and also the CodeXGLUE paper (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark40\">Lu et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark40\">2021</a>).</p><p> We show code summarization results of smoothed BLEU-4 on six PL data in Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark8\">2</a>. We observe all our model variants significantly outperform prior work with either an encode-only (RoBERTa, CodeBERT, DOBF) or encoder-decoder framework (PLBART). Moreover, the salient performance gap between these two groups of models confirms that encode-only frameworks are suboptimal for generation tasks. Compared to the SOTA encoder-decoder model PLBART, we find that even our CodeT5-small yields better overall scores (also on Python and Java) given that our model is much smaller (60M vs. 140M) and PLBART is pre-trained with much larger Python and Java data (&gt; 100 times). We attribute such improvement to our identifier-aware denoising pre-training and better employment of bi-modal training data<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark14\">4</a>. By increasing the model size, our CodeT5-base boosts the overall performance by over 1.2 absolute points over PLBART.</p><p> We compare CodeT5 with GPT-style models and PLBART in Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark9\">3</a>. Our CodeT5-small outperforms all decoder-only mod-els and also the SOTA PLBART, which again confirms the superiority of encoder-decoder models at generating code snippets. Moreover, our CodeT5-base further significantly pushes the SOTA results across three metrics. Particularly, it achieves around 4.7 points improvement on CodeBLEU over PLBART, indicating our CodeT5 can better comprehend the code syntax and semantics with the fier-aware pre-training.</p><p>\\\n<strong>Code-to-Code Generation Tasks.</strong> We compare two code-to-code generation tasks: code translation and code refinement in Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark10\">4</a> and further consider one naive copy baseline by copying the source input as the target prediction. In the code translation task, our CodeT5-small outperforms most of base-lines and obtains comparable results with PLBART, which shows the advantages of encoder-decoder models in the code-to-code generation setting. Our CodeT5-base further achieves consistent improvements over PLBART across various metrics for translating from Java to C# and vice versa.</p><p>Here we show one CodeT5’s output of translating C# to Java in Figure <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark15\">3</a>. In this case, despite the poor BLEU score, CodeT5 is able to generate a function that reserves the same functionality and even has better readability compared to the ground-truth. This reveals that CodeT5 has a good generalization ability instead of memorizing and repeating what it has seen before. On the other hand, it also suggests that BLEU score is not a perfect evaluation metric for code generation tasks, where sometimes a higher score can instead reflect the problematic copy issues of neural models.</p><p>Another code-to-code generation task is code refinement, a challenging task that requires detecting which parts of code are buggy and fix them via generating a bug-free code sequence. Due to the large overlap of source and target code, even the naive copy approach yields very high BLEU scores but zero exact matches. Therefore, we focus on the exact match (EM) metric to evaluate on this task. As shown in Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark10\">4</a>, we observe that EM scores for the small data are consistently higher than the medium one, indicating that it is harder to fix bugs for a longer code snippet. Our CodeT5-base significantly outperforms all baselines on EM and especially boosts over 4.8 points for the more challenging medium task (13.96 vs. GraphCodeBERT’s 9.10), reflecting its strong code understanding capability.</p><p> We compare with two understanding tasks of defect detection and clone detection in Table 5.</p><p>Specifically, we generate the binary labels as a unigram sequence from the decoder for the defect detection task, while for the clone detection task, we first obtain the sequence embedding of each code snippet using the last decoder state following <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark35\">Lewis et al.</a> (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark35\">2020</a>) and then predict the labels by measuring their similarity. Both CodeT5-small and CodeT5-base outperform all baselines on the defect detection task while CodeT5-base yields 2.6 accuracy score improvement than PLBART. For the clone detection task, our CodeT5 models achieve comparable results to the SOTA GraphCodeBERT and PLBART models. These results demonstrate that with an encode-decoder framework, our CodeT5 can still be adapted well for understanding tasks.</p><h2>5.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Effects of Bimodal Dual Generation and Multi-task Learning</h2><p>We examine the effects of bimodal dual generation at pre-training and multi-task learning at fine-tuning. The bimodal pre-training brings consistent improvements for code summarization and generation tasks on both CodeT5-small and CodeT5-base. However, this pre-training task does not help and even sometimes slightly hurts the performance for PL-PL generation and understanding tasks. We anticipate this is because bimodal dual generation learns a better alignment between PL and NL that naturally benefits the former tasks involving both PL and NL. As a side effect, this objective could bias the model towards the PL-NL tasks and affect its performance on PL-PL tasks.</p><p>In multi-task learning, it generally improves most of downstream tasks except the code translation and defect detection. Particularly, it largely boosts the performance on code summarization, which is not surprising as code summarization takes up the largest portion of sub tasks (six out of thirteen) and thereby benefit the most from the multi-task learning. Besides, we observe that multi-task learning consistently improves the performance of code refinement, which might benefit from the joint training of both small and medium refinement data.</p><p>\\\nAnother possible reason is that multi-task training with defect detection would enable the model to better comprehend the code semantics for bug detection, which is also a necessary intermediate step for code refinement.</p><h2>5.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Analyzing Identifier-aware Pre-training</h2><p>We provide an ablation study to examine the contribution of each component in our identifier-aware objective. Specifically, we compare the performance of our CodeT5-small on four selected tasks by ablating each of the three objectives: masked span prediction (MSP), identifier tagging (IT), and masked identifier prediction (MIP). As shown in Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark16\">6</a>, we observe that generally removing one of the objectives would reduce the performance for all tasks, indicating that all objectives contribute to the better code understanding of our CodeT5. However, the effect of each objective differs across tasks. Specifically, removing MSP would largely reduce the performance of all generation tasks but instead increase the defect detection performance. This shows that masked span prediction is more crucial for capturing syntactic information for generation tasks. On the contrary, removing MIP would hurt the defect detection task the most, indicating that it might focus more on code semantic understanding. By combining these objectives, our CodeT5 can better capture both syntactic and semantic information from code.</p><p>We further provide outputs from CodeT5 and its variant without MIP and IT on code generation in Figure <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark18\">4</a>. We observe that CodeT5 can correctly generate the exact function, while the model without MIP and IT fails to recover the identifiers of “s2” and “hasField”. This shows our identifier-aware denoising pre-training can better distinguish and leverage the identifier information.</p><p>We also investigate the identifier tagging performance and find it achieves over 99% F1 for all PLs, showing that our CodeT5 can confidently distinguish identifiers in code. We then check whether MSP and MIP tasks would have conflicts as they employ the same sentinel tokens for masking. In identifier masking, all occurrences of one unique identifier are replaced with the same sentinel token, resulting in a many-to-one mapping compared to the one-to-one mapping in span prediction. We compare models pre-trained with either MSP or MIP, and both on these two tasks in Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark19\">7</a>. We report the prediction accuracy and also the ratio of how often they can generate the same number of predictions as the sentinel tokens. We observe that pre-training only with either MIP or MSP would bias the model towards that task, achieving poor accuracy and higher mismatch in number of predictions when applied to the other task. Interestingly, we find that MIP-only objective can better recover the correct number of predictions in the MSP task than MSP-only does for the MIP task, meaning that it is easier to adapt from many-to-one mapping to one-to-one mapping and difficult for the opposite. At last, combining them can help our model to make a good trade-off on both tasks.</p><p>We have presented CodeT5, a pre-trained encoder-decoder model that incorporates the token type information from code. We propose a novel identifier-aware pre-training objective to better leverage the identifiers and propose a bimodal dual generation task to learn a better NL-PL alignment using code and its comments. Our unified model can support both code understanding and generation tasks and allow for multi-task learning. Experiments show that CodeT5 significantly outperforms all prior work in most CodeXGLUE tasks. Further analysis also reveals its better code comprehension capability across various programming languages.</p><h2>Broader Impact and Ethical Consideration</h2><p>Our work generally belongs to NLP applications for software intelligence. With the goal of improving the development productivity of software with machine learning methods, software intelligence research has attracted increasing attention in both academia and industries over the last decade. Software code intelligence techniques can help developers to reduce tedious repetitive workloads, enhance the programming quality and improve the overall software development productivity. This would considerably decrease their working time and also could potentially reduce the computation and operational cost, as a bug might degrade the system performance or even crash the entire system. Our work addresses the fundamental challenge of software code pre-training, our study covers a wide range of code intelligence applications in the software development lifecycle, and the proposed CodeT5 method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on many of the benchmark tasks, showing its great potential benefit towards this goal.</p><p>We further discuss the ethical consideration of training CodeT5 and the potential risks when applying it into real-world downstream applications:</p><p> The training datasets in our study are source code including user-written comments from open source Github repositories and publicly available, which do not tie to any specific application. However, it is possible that these datasets would encode some stereotypes like race and gender from the text comments or even from the source code such as variables, function and class names. As such, social biases would be intrinsically embedded into the models trained on them. As suggested by <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark22\">Chen et al.</a> (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark22\">2021</a>), interventions such as filtration or modulation of generated outputs may help to mitigate these biases in code corpus.</p><p> Our model pre-training requires non-trivial computational resources though we have tried our best to carefully design our experiments and improve experiments to save unnecessary computation costs. In fact, compared to the recent large-scale language model Codex (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark22\">Chen</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark22\">et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark22\">2021</a>), our CodeT5-base has a much smaller model size of 220M than theirs of 12B (∼ 55×). In addition, we experiment on Google Cloud Plat-form which purchases carbon credits to reduce its carbon footprint,  training CodeT5-base produced around 49.25 kg CO2 which was totally off-set by the provider. Furthermore, we release our pre-trained models publicly to avoid repeated training for the code intelligence research community.</p><p> As CodeT5 can be deployed to provide coding assistance such as code generation for aiding developers, automation bias of machine learning systems should be carefully considered, especially for developers who tend to over-rely on the model-generated outputs. Sometimes these systems might produce functions that superficially appear correct but do not actually align with the developer’s intents. If developers unintentionally adopt these incorrect code suggestions, it might cause them much longer time on debugging and even lead to some significant safety issues. We suggest practitioners using CodeT5 should always bear in mind that its generation outputs should be only taken as references which require domain experts for further correctness and security checking.</p><p> We train CodeT5 on existing code corpus including CodeSearchNet (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark32\">Husain et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark32\">2019</a>) and a small fraction of Google BigQuery, both of which are originally collected from public Github repositories. Pre-trained mod-els might encode some sensitive information ( personal addresses or identification numbers) from the training data. Though we have conducted multi-rounds of data cleaning to mitigate this before training our models, it is still possible that some sensitive information cannot be completely removed. Besides, due to the non-deterministic nature of generation models like CodeT5, it might produce some vulnerable code to harmfully affect the software and even be able to benefit more advanced malware development when deliberately misused.</p><p>We thank Akhilesh Deepak Gotmare, Amrita Saha, Junnan Li, and Chen Xing for valuable discussions.

The model is trained in a contrastive manner with weak supervision signals from our curated large-scale text pair dataset (called CCPairs). E5 can be readily used as a general-purpose embedding model for any tasks requiring a single-vector representation of texts such as retrieval, clustering, and classification, achieving strong performance in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We conduct extensive evaluations on 56 datasets from the BEIR and MTEB benchmarks. For zero-shot settings, E5 is the first model that outperforms the strong BM25 baseline on the BEIR retrieval benchmark without using any labeled data. When fine-tuned, E5 obtains the best results on the MTEB benchmark, beating existing embedding models with 40× more parameters.</p><p>Text embeddings are low-dimensional vector representations for arbitrary-length texts and play key roles in many NLP tasks such as large-scale retrieval. Compared to the high-dimensional and sparse representations like TF-IDF, text embeddings have the potential to overcome the lexical mismatch issue and facilitate efficient retrieval and matching between texts. It also offers a versatile interface easily consumable by downstream applications.</p><p>While pre-trained language models such as BERT [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark34\">17</a>] and GPT [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark24\">7</a>] can produce transferrable text representations, they are not ideal for tasks such as retrieval and text matching where a single-vector embedding of texts is more desired due to its efficiency and versatility. To obtain better text embeddings, contrastive learning is often the go-to framework to enhance the sequence-level representations from text pairs. Along this line of research, some works are geared towards learning task-specific embeddings. For example, GTR [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark60\">43</a>] and Sentence-T5 [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark61\">44</a>] fine-tune pre-trained models with supervised datasets to learn embeddings customized for passage retrieval and semantic textual similarity, respectively. Other works learn unsupervised embeddings from automatically constructed text pairs. Typical methods to construct text pairs include Inverse Close Task (ICT) [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark26\">9</a>], random cropping [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark45\">28</a>] and neighboring text spans [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark58\">41</a>], etc. While such synthetic data are of unlimited quantity, they are often poor in quality and the resulted embeddings fail to match the performance of the classic BM25 baseline without further fine-tuning <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark57\">[40].</a></p><p>In this work, we learn a high-quality general-purpose text embedding termed E5, mbddings from bidirctional ncoder rpresentations. E5 aims to provide strong off-the-shelf text embeddings suitable for any tasks requiring single-vector representations in both zero-shot or fine-tuned settings. To achieve this goal, instead of relying on limited labeled data or low-quality synthetic text pairs, we contrastively train E5 embeddings from CCPairs, a curated web-scale text pair dataset containing heterogeneous training signals. We construct the CCPairs dataset by combining various semi-structured data sources such as CommunityQA, Common Crawl and Scientific papers, and perform aggressive filtering with a consistency-based filter [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark32\">15</a>] to improve data quality. We choose a simple contrastive learning recipe using in-batch negatives with a large batch-size to train our model. Extensive experiments on both BEIR and MTEB benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. On the BEIR zero-shot retrieval benchmark [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark70\">53</a>], E5 is the first model to outperform the strong BM25 baseline without using any labeled data. When fine-tuned on labeled datasets, the performance can be further improved.

Most research focuses on short texts and thus uses the term \"sentence embeddings\". For long documents, it remains an open research question whether fixed-length embeddings can encode all the information.

[<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark26\">9</a>] proposes the well-known inverse cloze task (ICT), where a random sentence within a passage is chosen as a pseudo-query and the rest is treated as a positive sample. However, Contriever [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark45\">28</a>] shows that random cropping with data augmentation is more effective than ICT on a range of zero-shot information retrieval tasks. OpenAI text embeddings [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark58\">41</a>] use neighboring texts as positives and scale up the model size to 175B. Oguz et al. <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark62\">[45]</a> performs domain-matched pre-training to improve in-domain results. SPAR [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark28\">11</a>] trains a dense retriever by treating BM25 as a teacher model. Although the aforementioned approaches can easily obtain abundant supervision signals, such synthetic data tend to be of low quality. Results on the BEIR benchmark [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark70\">53</a>] show they struggle to match the performance of BM25 if not further fine-tuned on labeled datasets.</p><p>Evaluation and interpretation of text embeddings are also non-trivial. Most benchmarks measure the embedding quality through downstream task performances. For example, SentEval [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark30\">13</a>] uses linear probing and a collection of semantic textual similarity (STS) datasets, while the BEIR benchmark [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark70\">53</a>] focuses on zero-shot information retrieval scenarios. The recently introduced MTEB benchmark [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark57\">40</a>] combines 56 datasets spanning across 8 tasks and 112 languages. Experiments show no model can achieve state-of-the-art results on all embedding tasks yet. In this paper, we do not use the SentEval toolkit since its linear probing setup depends on the optimization hyperparameters.</p><p>Most closely related to our work is a series of community efforts by <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark1\">2</a> to train embeddings with a collection of labeled and automatically collected datasets. In this paper, we show that it is possible to train high-quality embeddings using self-supervised pre-training only. In terms of benchmark results, our model can achieve superior performance when fine-tuned on less labeled data.</p><h2>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CCPairs: A Large Collection of Text Pair Dataset</h2><p>The quality and diversity of the data is crucial for training general-purpose text embeddings. In this work, we mine and assemble CCPairs, a large high-quality text pair dataset from web sources which provide diverse training signals transferring well to a wide range of tasks.</p><p>\\\n<strong>Harvesting semi-structured data sources</strong> Large-scale high-quality datasets like C4 [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark65\">48</a>] and CCMatrix [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark68\">51</a>] are vital for the success of language model pre-training and machine translation. For learning text embeddings, existing works either utilize small-scale human-annotated data such as NLI [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark39\">22</a>] and MS-MARCO [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark25\">8</a>] or adopt heuristics such as random cropping [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark45\">28</a>] to obtain large-scale but very noisy supervision signals.</p><p>Instead, we curate a text pair dataset CCPairs (olossal lean text ) by harvesting heterogeneous semi-structured data sources. Let (, ) denote a text pair consisting of a query  and a passage . Here we use “” to denote word sequences of arbitrary length, which can be a short sentence, a paragraph, or a long document. Our dataset includes (post, comment) pairs from Reddit <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark3\">3</a>, (question, upvoted answer) pairs from Stackexchange <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark4\">4</a>, (entity name + section title, passage) pairs from English Wikipedia, (title, abstract) and citation pairs from Scientific papers [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark53\">36</a>], and (title, passage) pairs from Common Crawl <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark5\">5</a> web pages and various News sources.</p><p>We only include data sources that can be automatically mined, and some subsets are directly reused from existing datasets. Simple heuristic rules are applied to filter data from Reddit and Common Crawl. For example, we remove Reddit comments that are either too long ( 4096 characters) or receive score less than 1, and remove passages from web pages with high perplexity [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark77\">60</a>]. After preliminary filtering, we end up with ∼ 1*.*3 billion text pairs, most of which come from Reddit and Common Crawl. For more details and examples, please refer to Appendix <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark81\">A.</a></p><p> To further improve data quality and make training costs manageable, we propose a consistency-based data filtering technique: a model is first trained on the 1*.*3B noisy text pairs, and then used to rank each pair against a pool of 1 million random passages. A text pair is kept only if it falls in the top- ranked lists. In other words, the model’s prediction should be consistent with the training labels. Here we set  = 2 based on manual inspection of data quality. After this step, we end up with ∼ 270M text pairs for contrastive pre-training.</p><p>The intuition for this technique comes from the memorization behaviors of neural networks [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark36\">19</a>]: when trained on noisy datasets, neural networks tend to memorize the clean labels first and then gradually overfit the noisy labels. Similar techniques [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark59\">42</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark32\">15</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark40\">23</a>] have been widely used for removing dataset noises. It is also possible to apply this filter iteratively, we will leave it for future work.</p><p>Our embeddings can be trained with only unlabeled text pairs from CCPairs with contrastive pre-training. A second-stage fine-tuning on small, high-quality labeled datasets can be performed to further boost the quality of the resulted embeddings. See Figure <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark2\">1</a> for an overview.</p><h2>4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contrastive Pre-training with Unlabeled Data</h2><p>Contrastive pre-training aims to distinguish the relevant text pairs from other irrelevant or negative pairs. Given a collection of text pairs {()} , we assign a list of negative passages {−}=1 for the -th example. Then the InfoNCE contrastive loss <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark27\">[10]</a> is as follows:</p><p>\\\nwhere () is a scoring function between query  and passage  parameterized by ***θ<strong><em>. Following the popular biencoder architecture, we use a pre-trained Transformer encoder and average pooling over the output layer to get fixed-size text embeddings *</em></strong> and . The score is the cosine similarity scaled by a temperature hyperparameter  :</p><p>Where  is set to 0.01 in our experiments by default. We use a shared encoder for all input texts and break the symmetry by adding two prefix identifiers  and  to  and  respectively. For some data sources such as citation pairs, it is not obvious which side should be the query, we randomly choose one for simplicity. Such an asymmetric design turns out to be important for some retrieval tasks where there exist paraphrases of the query in the target corpus.</p><p>Another critical issue for contrastive training is how to select the negative samples. Here we choose to use the in-batch negatives [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark27\">10</a>], where the passages from other pairs in a batch serve as negative samples. We find that this simple strategy enables more stable training and outperforms methods such as MoCo <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark42\">[25]</a> when the batch size is sufficiently large.</p><h2>4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fine-tuning with Labeled Data</h2><p>While contrastive pre-training on the CCPairs provides a solid foundation for general-purpose embeddings, further training on labeled data can inject human knowledge into the model to boost the performance. Although these datasets are small, existing works [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark60\">43</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark61\">44</a>] have shown that supervised fine-tuning leads to consistent performance gains. In this paper, we choose to further train with a combination of 3 datasets: NLI <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark8\">6</a> (Natural Language Inference), MS-MARCO passage ranking dataset [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark25\">8</a>], and NQ (Natural Questions) dataset [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark47\">30</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark49\">32</a>]. Empirically, tasks like STS (Semantic Textual Similarity) and linear probing benefit from NLI data, while MS-MARCO and NQ datasets transfer well to retrieval tasks.</p><p>Building on the practices of training state-of-the-art dense retrievers [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark67\">50</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark75\">58</a>], we use mined hard negatives and knowledge distillation from a cross-encoder (CE) teacher model for the MS-MARCO and NQ datasets. For the NLI dataset, contradiction sentences are regarded as hard negatives. The loss function is a linear interpolation between contrastive loss cont for hard labels and KL divergence KL for distilling soft labels from the teacher model.</p><p>Where ce and stu are the probabilities from the cross-encoder teacher model and our student model.  is a hyperparameter to balance the two loss functions. cont is the same as in Equation <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark6\">1.</a></p><h2>4.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Applications to Text Embedding Tasks</h2><p>After the above two steps, we obtain high-quality text embeddings transferring well to a wide range of tasks without fine-tuning the model parameters. Combined with techniques like approximate nearest neighbor search, embeddings provide a scalable and efficient solution for applications like web search. Here we briefly illustrate several use cases of our text embeddings.</p><p> First, the passage embeddings for the target corpus are computed and indexed offline. Then for each query, we compute its query embedding and return the top- ranked lists from the corpus based on cosine similarity.</p><p><strong>Few-shot Text Classification</strong> A linear classifier is trained on top of the frozen embeddings with a few labeled examples. Different tasks only need to train and save the parameters of the classification heads. It can be seen as a particular form of parameter-efficient learning <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark44\">[27].</a></p><p><strong>Zero-shot Text Classification</strong> The input and label texts are converted to sentences based on manually written prompt templates. The predicted label is the one closest to the input text in the embedding space. Take the sentiment classification of movie reviews as an example, with the original input “”, the label text is “<em>it is an example of terrible/great movie review</em>” and the input text becomes “<em>movie review: I enjoy watching it</em>”.</p><p><strong>Semantic Textual Similarity</strong> Given two text embeddings, we use the cosine function to measure their semantic similarity. Since the absolute similarity scores do not enable an easy interpretation, the evaluation is usually based on rank correlation coefficients.</p><p> Standard clustering algorithms such as k-means can be applied straightforwardly. Texts belonging to the same category are expected to be close in the embedding space.</p><p>For tasks other than zero-shot text classification and retrieval, we use the query embeddings by default.</p><h2>5.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pre-training and Fine-tuning Configurations</h2><p> We pre-train on our proposed text pair dataset for three model sizes: E5small, E5base and E5large initialized from MiniLM [59], bert-base-uncased, and bert-large-uncased-whole-wordmasking respectively. The batch size is set to a large value of 32, 768 to increase the number of negatives. The learning rate is {3, 2, 1}×10−4 for the {small, base, large} models, with linear decay and the first 1, 000 steps for warmup. We pre-train for 20k steps in total with AdamW optimizer, which is approximately 2.5 epochs over the dataset. It takes {16, 32, 64} V100 GPUs and {1, 1, 2} days for the {small, base, large} models. To improve training efficiency and reduce GPU memory usage, we adopt mixed precision training and gradient checkpointing.</p><p>\\\n is performed on the concatenation of 3 datasets: MS-MARCO passage ranking [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark25\">8</a>], NQ [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark49\">32</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark47\">30</a>], and NLI [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark39\">22</a>] datasets.

Models are fine-tuned for 3 epochs with batch size 256 on 8 GPUs. Learning rate is {3*,* 2*,* 1}×10−5 for the {small, base, large} models with 400 steps warmup. For each example, we use 7 hard negatives. Since the NLI dataset only has 1 hard negative for each example, 6 sentences are randomly sampled from the entire corpus.</p><p>We use E5-PT to denote models with contrastive pre-training only.

However, the engineering efforts of mining hard negatives for large datasets (&gt;100M) are non-trivial.</p><p>\\\n GTR models are fine-tuned with “MS-MARCO + NQ”, while Sentence-T5 models use NLI instead. In Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark15\">6,</a> we can see that the “MS-MARCO + NQ” setting performs best on retrieval tasks, and the NLI data is beneficial for STS and linear probing classification. Similar observations are also made by Muennighoff et al. <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark57\">[40]</a>. Combining all of them leads to the best overall scores on the MTEB benchmark. This also illustrates the importance of dataset diversity for learning text embeddings.</p><p>\\\n One crucial step in our dataset curation pipeline is filtering out low-quality text pairs. In Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark16\">7,</a> when training with 1M pairs, using filtered data has a nearly 6 points advantage. When all the text pairs are used, the “w/o filter” setting has about 4× more data but is still behind by 1*.*6 points. Though recent studies [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark46\">29</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark64\">47</a>] show that deep learning models are quite robust to dataset noises, data filtering still has benefits in improving training efficiency and model quality.</p><p> We explore two alternative methods to enlarge the number of negatives: Pre-batch negatives [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark50\">33</a>] reuse embeddings from previous batches as additional negatives, while MoCo</p><p>[<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark42\">25</a>] introduces a momentum encoder and uses a FIFO queue to store negatives. For both approaches, the negative size can be easily scaled up without incurring much GPU memory overhead. The downside is that most negatives are produced by an older version of model parameters. In Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark17\">8,</a> in-batch negatives still perform favorably. Empirically, we find that MoCo is more sensitive to certain hyperparameters such as temperature, better results are possible with more tuning.</p><p> With the rapid development of dense retrieval models, can we replace the long-standing BM25 algorithm from now on? The answer is likely “”. BM25 still holds obvious advantages in terms of simplicity, efficiency, and interpretability. For long-tail domains such as Trec-Covid [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark72\">55</a>] and retrieval tasks that involve long documents (Touche-2020) [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark21\">4</a>] or rely heavily on exact lexical match (Fever) [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-microsoft-trained-a-270m-pair-ai-to-power-smarter-search?source=rss#_bookmark71\">54</a>], further research efforts are still necessary to improve current dense retrievers.</p><p>In this work, we train a general-purpose text embedding model E5 from weak supervision signals. We adopt a simple contrastive training framework with in-batch negatives and learn from a large-scale text pair dataset we harvest from heterogeneous data sources across the web. E5 offers strong off-the-shelf performance for a wide range of tasks requiring single-vector text representations such as retrieval, semantic textual similarity, and text matching. When further customized for downstream tasks, E5 achieves superior fine-tuned performance compared to existing embedding models with 40× more parameters on the large, 56-task MTEB benchmark datasets.</p><p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp;  Sanjeev Arora, Yingyu Liang, and Tengyu Ma.

Yet, it has not achieved competitive performance on popular leaderboards of graph-level prediction compared to mainstream GNN variants. Therefore, it remains a mystery how Transformers could perform well for graph representation learning. In this paper, we solve this mystery by presenting Graphormer, which is built upon the standard Transformer architecture, and could attain excellent results on a broad range of graph representation learning tasks, especially on the recent OGB Large-Scale Challenge. Our key insight to utilizing Transformer in the graph is the necessity of effectively encoding the structural information of a graph into the model. To this end, we propose several simple yet effective structural encoding methods to help Graphormer better model graph-structured data. Besides, we mathematically characterize the expressive power of Graphormer and exhibit that with our ways of encoding the structural information of graphs, many popular GNN variants could be covered as the special cases of Graphormer. The code and models of Graphormer will be made publicly available at <a href=\"https://github.com/Microsoft/Graphormer\">https://github.com/Microsoft/Graphormer</a>.</p><p>The Transformer [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark65\">49</a>] is well acknowledged as the most powerful neural network in modelling sequential data, such as natural language [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark28\">11</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark52\">35</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark23\">6</a>] and speech [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark34\">17</a>]. Model variants built upon Transformer have also been shown great performance in computer vision [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark29\">12</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark53\">36</a>] and programming language [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark36\">19</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark80\">63</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark61\">44</a>]. However, to the best of our knowledge, Transformer has still not been the de-facto standard on public graph representation leaderboards [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark39\">22</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark31\">14</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark38\">21</a>]. There are many attempts of leveraging Transformer into the graph domain, but the only effective way is replacing some key modules (e.g., feature aggregation) in classic GNN variants by the softmax attention [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark67\">50</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark24\">7</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark40\">23</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark68\">51</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark78\">61</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark63\">46</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark30\">13</a>]. Therefore, it is still an open question whether Transformer architecture is suitable to model graphs and how to make it work in graph representation learning.</p><p>In this paper, we give an affirmative answer by developing Graphormer, which is directly built upon the standard Transformer, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of graph-level prediction tasks, including the very recent Open Graph Benchmark Large-Scale Challenge (OGB-LSC) [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark38\">21</a>], and several popular leaderboards (e.g., OGB [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark39\">22</a>], Benchmarking-GNN [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark31\">14</a>]). The Transformer is originally designed for sequence modeling. To utilize its power in graphs, we believe the key is to properly incorporate structural information of graphs into the model. Note that for each node , the self-attention only calculates the semantic similarity between  and other nodes, without considering the structural information of a graph reflected on the nodes and the relation between node pairs. Graphormer incorporates several effective structural encoding methods to leverage such information, which are described below.</p><p>First, we propose a  in Graphormer to capture the node importance in the graph. In a graph, different nodes may have different importance, e.g., celebrities are considered to be more influential than the majority of web users in a social network. However, such information isn’t reflected in the self-attention module as it calculates the similarities mainly using the node semantic features. To address the problem, we propose to encode the node centrality in Graphormer. In particular, we leverage the  for the centrality encoding, where a learnable vector is assigned to each node according to its degree and added to the node features in the input layer. Empirical studies show that simple centrality encoding is effective for Transformer in modeling the graph data.</p><p>Second, we propose a novel  in Graphormer to capture the structural relation between nodes. One notable geometrical property that distinguishes graph-structured data from other structured data, e.g., language, images, is that there does not exist a canonical grid to embed the graph. In fact, nodes can only lie in a non-Euclidean space and are linked by edges. To model such structural information, for each node pair, we assign a learnable embedding based on their spatial relation. Multiple measurements in the literature could be leveraged for modeling spatial relations. For a general purpose, we use the distance of the shortest path between any two nodes as a demonstration, which will be encoded as a bias term in the softmax attention and help the model accurately capture the spatial dependency in a graph. In addition, sometimes there is additional spatial information contained in edge features, such as the type of bond between two atoms in a molecular graph. We design a new edge encoding method to further take such signal into the Transformer layers. To be concrete, for each node pair, we compute an average of dot-products of the edge features and learnable embeddings along the shortest path, then use it in the attention module. Equipped with these encodings, Graphormer could better model the relationship for node pairs and represent the graph.</p><p>By using the proposed encodings above, we further mathematically show that Graphormer has strong expressiveness as many popular GNN variants are just its special cases. The great capacity of the model leads to state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks in practice. On the large-scale quantum chemistry regression dataset<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark0\">3</a> in the very recent Open Graph Benchmark Large-Scale Challenge (OGB-LSC) [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark38\">21</a>], Graphormer outperforms most mainstream GNN variants by more than 10% points in terms of the relative error. On other popular leaderboards of graph representation learning (e.g., MolHIV, MolPCBA, ZINC) [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark39\">22</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark31\">14</a>], Graphormer also surpasses the previous best results, demonstrating the potential and adaptability of the Transformer architecture.</p><p>In this section, we recap the preliminaries in Graph Neural Networks and Transformer.</p><p><strong>Graph Neural Network (GNN).</strong> Let G = (V, E) denote a graph where V = {v1, v2, · · · , vn}, n = |V | is the number of nodes. Let the feature vector of node vi be xi . GNNs aim to learn representation of nodes and graphs. Typically, modern GNNs follow a learning schema that iteratively updates the representation of a node by aggregating representations of its first or higher-order neighbors. We denote h (l) i as the representation of vi at the l-th layer and define h (0) i = xi . The l-th iteration of aggregation could be characterized by AGGREGATE-COMBINE step as</p><p>where N (vi) is the set of first or higher-order neighbors of vi . The AGGREGATE function is used to gather the information from neighbors. Common aggregation functions include MEAN, MAX, SUM, which are used in different architectures of GNNs [26, 18, 50, 54]. The goal of COMBINE function is to fuse the information from neighbors into the node representation.</p><p>\\\nIn addition, for graph representation tasks, a READOUT function is designed to aggregate node features h (L) i of the final iteration into the representation hG of the entire graph G:</p><p>READOUT can be implemented by a simple permutation invariant function such as summation [54] or a more sophisticated graph-level pooling function [1].</p><p>. The Transformer architecture consists of a composition of Transformer layers [49]. Each Transformer layer has two parts: a self-attention module and a position-wise feed-forward network (FFN). Let H = h &gt; 1 , · · · , h&gt; n &gt; ∈ R n×d denote the input of self-attention module where d is the hidden dimension and hi ∈ R 1×d is the hidden representation at position i. The input H is projected by three matrices WQ ∈ R d×dK , WK ∈ R d×dK and WV ∈ R d×dV to the corresponding representations Q, K, V . The self-attention is then calculated as:</p><p>where  is a matrix capturing the similarity between queries and keys. For simplicity of illustration, we consider the single-head self-attention and assume  =  = . The extension to the multi-head attention is standard and straightforward, and we omit bias terms for simplicity.</p><p>In this section, we present our Graphormer for graph tasks. First, we elaborate on several key designs in the Graphormer, which serve as an inductive bias in the neural network to learn the graph representation. We further provide the detailed implementations of Graphormer. Finally, we show that our proposed Graphormer is more powerful since popular GNN models [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark43\">26</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark71\">54</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark35\">18</a>] are its special cases.</p><h2>3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Structural Encodings in Graphormer</h2><p>As discussed in the introduction, it is important to develop ways to leverage the structural information of graphs into the Transformer model. To this end, we present three simple but effective designs of encoding in Graphormer. See Figure <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark1\">1</a> for an illustration.</p><h2>3.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Centrality Encoding</h2><p>In <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark3\">Eq.4,</a> the attention distribution is calculated based on the semantic correlation between nodes. However, node centrality, which measures how important a node is in the graph, is usually a strong signal for graph understanding. For example, celebrities who have a huge number of followers are important factors in predicting the trend of a social network [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark57\">40</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark56\">39</a>]. Such information is neglected in the current attention calculation, and we believe it should be a valuable signal for Transformer models.</p><p>In Graphormer, we use the degree centrality, which is one of the standard centrality measures in literature, as an additional signal to the neural network. To be specific, we develop a  which assigns each node two real-valued embedding vectors according to its indegree and outdegree. As the centrality encoding is applied to each node, we simply add it to the node features as the input.</p><p>where z −, z+ ∈ R d are learnable embedding vectors specified by the indegree deg−(vi) and outdegree deg+(vi) respectively. For undirected graphs, deg−(vi) and deg+(vi) could be unified to deg(vi). By using the centrality encoding in the input, the softmax attention can catch the node importance signal in the queries and the keys. Therefore the model can capture both the semantic correlation and the node importance in the attention mechanism.</p><h2>3.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spatial Encoding</h2><p>An advantage of Transformer is its global receptive field. In each Transformer layer, each token can attend to the information at any position and then process its representation. But this operation has a byproduct problem that the model has to explicitly specify different positions or encode the positional dependency (such as locality) in the layers. For sequential data, one can either give each position an embedding (i.e., absolute positional encoding [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark65\">49</a>]) as the input or encode the relative distance of any two positions (i.e., relative positional encoding <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark62\">[45,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark64\">47])</a> in the Transformer layer.</p><p>However, for graphs, nodes are not arranged as a sequence. They can lie in a multi-dimensional spatial space and are linked by edges. To encode the structural information of a graph in the model, we propose a novel Spatial Encoding. Concretely, for any graph G, we consider a function φ (vi , vj ) : V × V → R which measures the spatial relation between vi and vj in graph G. The function φ can be defined by the connectivity between the nodes in the graph. In this paper, we choose φ(vi , vj ) to be the distance of the shortest path (SPD) between vi and vj if the two nodes are connected. If not, we set the output of φ to be a special value, i.e., -1. We assign each (feasible) output value a learnable scalar which will serve as a bias term in the self-attention module. Denote Aij as the (i, j)-element of the Query-Key product matrix A, we have:</p><p>where ( ) is a learnable scalar indexed by (), and shared across all layers.</p><p>Here we discuss several benefits of our proposed method. First, compared to conventional GNNs described in Section 2, where the receptive field is restricted to the neighbors, we can see that in Eq. <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark4\">(6)</a>, the Transformer layer provides a global information that each node can attend to all other nodes in the graph. Second, by using ( ), each node in a single Transformer layer can adaptively attend to all other nodes according to the graph structural information. For example, if ( ) is</p><p>learned to be a decreasing function with respect to (), for each node, the model will likely pay more attention to the nodes near it and pay less attention to the nodes far away from it.</p><h2>3.1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edge Encoding in the Attention</h2><p>In many graph tasks, edges also have structural features, e.g., in a molecular graph, atom pairs may have features describing the type of bond between them. Such features are important to the graph representation, and encoding them together with node features into the network is essential. There are mainly two edge encoding methods used in previous works. In the first method, the edge features are added to the associated nodes’ features [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark39\">22</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark47\">30</a>]. In the second method, for each node, its associated edges’ features will be used together with the node features in the aggregation [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark32\">15</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark71\">54</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark43\">26</a>]. However, such ways of using edge feature only propagate the edge information to its associated nodes, which may not be an effective way to leverage edge information in representation of the whole graph.</p><p>To better encode edge features into attention layers, we propose a new edge encoding method in Graphormer. The attention mechanism needs to estimate correlations for each node pair (), and we believe the edges connecting them should be considered in the correlation as in [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark51\">34</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark68\">51</a>]. For each ordered node pair (), we find (one of) the shortest path SP = (1*, e, …, eN* ) from  to , and compute an average of the dot-products of the edge feature and a learnable embedding along the path. The proposed edge encoding incorporates edge features via a bias term to the attention module. Concretely, we modify the ()-element of  in Eq. <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark2\">(3)</a> further with the edge encoding  as:</p><p>where xen is the feature of the n-th edge en in SPij , w E n ∈ R dE is the n-th weight embedding, and dE is the dimensionality of edge feature.</p><h2>3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Implementation Details of Graphormer</h2><p> Graphormer is built upon the original implementation of classic Transformer encoder described in [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark65\">49</a>]. In addition, we apply the layer normalization (LN) before the multi-head self-attention (MHA) and the feed-forward blocks (FFN) instead of after [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark70\">53</a>]. This modification has been unanimously adopted by all current Transformer implementations because it leads to more effective optimization [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark59\">43</a>]. Especially, for FFN sub-layer, we set the dimensionality of input, output, and the inner-layer to the same dimension with . We formally characterize the Graphormer layer as below:</p><p> As stated in the previous section, various graph pooling functions are proposed to represent the graph embedding. Inspired by [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark32\">15</a>], in Graphormer, we add a special node called [VNode] to the graph, and make connection between [VNode] and each node individually. In the AGGREGATE-COMBINE step, the representation of [VNode] has been updated as normal nodes in graph, and the representation of the entire graph  would be the node feature of [VNode] in the final layer. In the BERT model [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark28\">11</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark52\">35</a>], there is a similar token, i.e., [CLS], which is a special token attached at the beginning of each sequence, to represent the sequence-level feature on downstream tasks. While the [VNode] is connected to all other nodes in graph, which means the distance of the shortest path is 1 for any ([VNode]) and ( [VNode]), the connection is not physical. To distinguish the connection of physical and virtual, inspired by [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark41\">25</a>], we reset all spatial encodings for ([VNode] ) and ([VNode]) to a distinct learnable scalar.</p><h2>3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How Powerful is Graphormer?</h2><p>In the previous subsections, we introduce three structural encodings and the architecture of Graphormer. Then a natural question is: <em>Do these modifications make Graphormer more powerful than other GNN variants?</em> In this subsection, we first give an affirmative answer by showing that Graphormer can represent the AGGREGATE and COMBINE steps in popular GNN models:</p><p><em>By choosing proper weights and distance function φ, the Graphormer layer can represent AGGREGATE and COMBINE steps of popular GNN models such as GIN, GCN, GraphSAGE.</em></p><p>The proof sketch to derive this result is: 1) Spatial encoding enables self-attention module to distinguish neighbor set N (vi) of node vi so that the softmax function can calculate mean statistics over N (vi); 2) Knowing the degree of a node, mean over neighbors can be translated to sum over neighbors; 3) With multiple heads and FFN, representations of vi and N (vi) can be processed separately and combined together later. We defer the proof of this fact to Appendix A.</p><p>Moreover, we show further that by using our spatial encoding, Graphormer can go beyond classic message passing GNNs whose expressive power is no more than the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test. We give a concrete example in Appendix A to show how Graphormer helps distinguish graphs that the 1-WL test fails to.</p><p><strong>Connection between Self-attention and Virtual Node.</strong> Besides the superior expressiveness than popular GNNs, we also find an interesting connection between using self-attention and the virtual node heuristic [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark32\">15</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark48\">31</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark42\">24</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark39\">22</a>]. As shown in the leaderboard of OGB [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark39\">22</a>], the virtual node trick, which augments graphs with additional supernodes that are connected to all nodes in the original graphs, can significantly improve the performance of existing GNNs. Conceptually, the benefit of the virtual node is that it can aggregate the information of the  (like the READOUT function) and then propagate it to . However, a naive addition of a supernode to a graph can potentially lead to inadvertent over-smoothing of information propagation [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark42\">24</a>]. We instead find that such a graph-level aggregation and propagation operation can be naturally fulfilled by vanilla self-attention without additional encodings. Concretely, we can prove the following fact:</p><p><em>By choosing proper weights, every node representation of the output of a Graphormer layer without additional encodings can represent MEAN READOUT functions.</em></p><p>This fact takes the advantage of self-attention that each node can attend to all other nodes. Thus it can simulate graph-level READOUT operation to aggregate information from the whole graph. Besides the theoretical justification, we empirically find that Graphormer does not encounter the problem of over-smoothing, which makes the improvement scalable. The fact also inspires us to introduce a special node for graph readout (see the previous subsection).</p><p>We first conduct experiments on the recent OGB-LSC [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark38\">21</a>] quantum chemistry regression (i.e., PCQM4M-LSC) challenge, which is currently the biggest graph-level prediction dataset and contains more than 3.8M graphs in total. Then, we report the results on the other three popular tasks: ogbg-molhiv, ogbg-molpcba and ZINC, which come from the OGB [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark39\">22</a>] and benchmarking-GNN [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark31\">14</a>] leaderboards. Finally, we ablate the important design elements of Graphormer. A detailed description of datasets and training strategies could be found in Appendix B.</p><h2>4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OGB Large-Scale Challenge</h2><p> We benchmark the proposed Graphormer with GCN [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark43\">26</a>] and GIN [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark71\">54</a>], and their variants with virtual node (-VN) [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark32\">15</a>]. They achieve the state-of-the-art valid and test mean absolute error (MAE) on the official leaderboard<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark10\">4</a> [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark38\">21</a>]. In addition, we compare to GIN’s multi-hop variant [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark21\">5</a>], and 12-layer deep graph network DeeperGCN [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark47\">30</a>], which also show promising performance on other leaderboards. We further compare our Graphormer with the recent Transformer-based graph model GT <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark30\">[13].</a></p><p>\\\n&nbsp; We primarily report results on two model sizes:  ( = 12*, d* = 768), and a smaller one  ( = 6*, d* = 512). Both the number of attention heads in the attention module and the dimensionality of edge features  are set to 32. We use AdamW as the optimizer, and set the hyper-parameter  to 1e-8 and (1*, β*2) to (0.99,0.999). The peak learning rate is set to 2e-4 (3e-4 for ) with a 60k-step warm-up stage followed by a linear decay learning rate scheduler. The total training steps are 1M. The batch size is set to 1024. All models are trained on 8 NVIDIA V100 GPUS for about 2 days.</p><p>\\\n Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark11\">1</a> summarizes performance comparisons on PCQM4M-LSC dataset. From the table, GIN-VN achieves the previous state-of-the-art validate MAE of 0.1395. The original implementation of GT [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark30\">13</a>] employs a hidden dimension of 64 to reduce the total number of parameters. For a fair comparison, we also report the result by enlarging the hidden dimension to 768, denoted by GT-Wide, which leads to a total number of parameters of 83.2M. While, both GT and GT-Wide do not outperform GIN-VN and DeeperGCN-VN. Especially, we do not observe a performance gain along with the growth of parameters of GT.</p><p>Compared to the previous state-of-the-art GNN architecture, Graphormer noticeably surpasses GIN-VN by a large margin, e.g., 11.5% relative validate MAE decline. By using the ensemble with ExpC [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark72\">55</a>], we got a 0.1200 MAE on complete test set and won the first place of the graph-level track in OGB Large-Scale Challenge[<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark38\">21</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark75\">58</a>]. As stated in Section <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark7\">3.3,</a> we further find that the proposed Graphormer does not encounter the problem of over-smoothing, i.e., the train and validate error keep going down along with the growth of depth and width of models.</p><h2>4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Graph Representation</h2><p>In this section, we further investigate the performance of Graphormer on commonly used graph-level prediction tasks of popular leaderboards, i.e., OGB [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark39\">22</a>] (OGBG-MolPCBA, OGBG-MolHIV), and benchmarking-GNN [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark31\">14</a>] (ZINC). Since pre-training is encouraged by OGB, we mainly explore the transferable capability of a Graphormer model pre-trained on OGB-LSC (i.e., PCQM4M-LSC). Please note that the model configurations, hyper-parameters, and the pre-training performance of pre-trained Graphormers used for MolPCBA and MolHIV are different from the models used in the previous subsection. Please refer to Appendix B for detailed descriptions. For benchmarking-GNN, which does not encourage large pre-trained model, we train an additional GraphormerSLIM ( = 12*, d* = 80, total param.= 489) from scratch on ZINC.</p><p> We report performance of GNNs which achieve top-performance on the official leader-boards<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark12\">5</a><em>without additional domain-specific features</em>. Considering that the pre-trained Graphormer leverages external data, for a fair comparison on OGB datasets, we additionally report performance for fine-tuning GIN-VN pre-trained on PCQM4M-LSC dataset, which achieves the previous state-of-the-art valid and test MAE on that dataset.</p><p>\\\n We report detailed training strategies in Appendix B. In addition, Graphormer is more easily trapped in the over-fitting problem due to the large size of the model and the small size of the dataset. Therefore, we employ a widely used data augmentation for graph - FLAG [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark44\">27</a>], to mitigate the over-fitting problem on OGB datasets.</p><p>\\\n Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark13\">2,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark14\">3</a> and <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark15\">4</a> summarize performance of Graphormer comparing with other GNNs on MolHIV, MolPCBA and ZINC datasets.

Specially, except Graphormer,  the other pre-trained GNNs do not achieve competitive performance, which is in line with previous literature [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark37\">20</a>]. In addition, we conduct more comparisons to fine-tuning the pre-trained GNNs, please refer to Appendix C.</p><h2>4.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ablation Studies</h2><p>We perform a series of ablation studies on the importance of designs in our proposed Graphormer, on PCQM4M-LSC dataset.

There are various PEs employed by previous Transformer-based GNNs, e.g., Weisfeiler-Lehman-PE (WL-PE) [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark78\">61</a>] and Laplacian PE [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark20\">3</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark31\">14</a>]. We report the performance for Laplacian PE since it performs well comparing to a series of PEs for Graph Transformer in previous literature [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark30\">13</a>]. Transformer architecture with the spatial encoding outperforms the counterpart built on the positional encoding, which demonstrates the effectiveness of using spatial encoding to capture the node spatial information.</p><p>\\\n Transformer architecture with degree-based centrality encoding yields a large margin performance boost in comparison to those without centrality information.

For example, several parts of the transformer layer are modified in [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark63\">46</a>], including an additional GNN employed in attention sub-layer to produce vectors of , , and  , long-range residual connection, and two branches of FFN to produce node and edge representations separately. They pre-train their model on 10 million unlabelled molecules and achieve excellent results by fine-tuning on downstream tasks. Attention module is modified to a soft adjacency matrix in [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark58\">41</a>] by directly adding the adjacency matrix and RDKit<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark17\">6</a>-computed inter-atomic distance matrix to the attention probabilites. Very recently, Dwivedi  [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark30\">13</a>] revisit a series of works for Transformer-based GNNs, and suggest that the attention mechanism in Transformers on graph data should only aggregate the information from neighborhood (i.e., using adjacent matrix as attention mask) to ensure graph sparsity, and propose to use Laplacian eigenvector as positional encoding. Their model GT surpasses baseline GNNs on graph representation task. A concurrent work [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark45\">28</a>] propose a novel full Laplacian spectrum to learn the position of each node in a graph, and empirically shows better results than GT.</p><h2>5.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Structural Encodings in GNNs</h2><p><strong>Path and Distance in GNNs.</strong> Information of path and distance is commonly used in GNNs. For example, an attention-based aggregation is proposed in [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark26\">9</a>] where the node features, edge features, one-hot feature of the distance and ring flag feature are concatenated to calculate the attention probabilites; similar to <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark26\">[9],</a> path-based attention is leveraged in <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark73\">[56]</a> to model the influence between the center node and its higher-order neighbors; a distance-weighted aggregation scheme on graph is proposed in [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark76\">59</a>]; it has been proved in [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark49\">32</a>] that adopting distance encoding (i.e., one-hot feature of the distance as extra node attribute) could lead to a strictly more expressive power than the 1-WL test.</p><p>\\\n<strong>Positional Encoding in Transformer on Graph.</strong> Several works introduce positional encoding (PE) to Transformer-based GNNs to help the model capture the node position information. For example, Graph-BERT [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark78\">61</a>] introduces three types of PE to embed the node position information to model, i.e., an absolute WL-PE which represents different nodes labeled by Weisfeiler-Lehman algorithm, an intimacy based PE and a hop based PE which are both variant to the sampled subgraphs. Absolute Laplacian PE is employed in [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark30\">13</a>] and empircal study shows that its performance surpasses the absolute WL-PE used in <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark78\">[61].</a></p><p>\\\n Except the conventionally used methods to encode edge feature, which are described in previous section, there are several attempts that exploit how to better encode edge features: an attention-based GNN layer is developed in [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark33\">16</a>] to encode edge features, where the edge feature is weighted by the similarity of the features of its two nodes; edge feature has been encoded into the popular GIN [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark71\">54</a>] in [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark21\">5</a>]; in [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark30\">13</a>], the authors propose to project edge features to an embedding vector, then multiply it by attention coefficients, and send the result to an additional FFN sub-layer to produce edge representations;</p><p>We have explored the direct application of Transformers to graph representation. With three novel graph structural encodings, the proposed Graphormer works surprisingly well on a wide range of popular benchmark datasets. While these initial results are encouraging, many challenges remain. For example, the quadratic complexity of the self-attention module restricts Graphormer’s application on large graphs. Therefore, future development of efficient Graphormer is necessary. Performance improvement could be expected by leveraging domain knowledge-powered encodings on particular graph datasets. Finally, an applicable graph sampling strategy is desired for node representation extraction with Graphormer. We leave them for future works.</p><p>We would like to thank Mingqi Yang and Shanda Li for insightful discussions.</p><p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jinheon Baek, Minki Kang, and Sung Ju Hwang.

We show that SPD might help when 1-WL-test fails, for example, in Figure <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark81\">2</a> where 1-WL-test fails, the sets of SPD from all nodes to others successfully distinguish the two graphs.</p><p> We begin by showing that self-attention module with Spatial Encoding can repre-sent MEAN aggregation. This is achieved by in Eq. <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark4\">(6)</a>: 1) setting  = 0 if  = 1 and  =  otherwise where  is the SPD; 2) setting  =  = 0 and  to be the identity matrix. Then softmax ()  gives the average of representations of the neighbors.</p><p>\\\n The SUM aggregation can be realized by first perform MEAN aggregation and then multiply the node degrees. Specifically, the node degrees can be extracted from Centrality Encoding by an additional head and be concatenated to the representations after MEAN aggregation. Then the FFN module in Graphormer can represent the function of multiplying the degree to the dimensions of averaged representations by the universal approximation theorem of FFN.</p><p>\\\n Representing the MAX aggregation is harder than MEAN and SUM. For each dimension  of the representation vector, we need one head to select the maximal value over -th dimension in the neighbor by in Eq. <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark4\">(6)</a>: 1) setting  = 0 if  = 1 and  =  otherwise where  is the SPD; 2) setting  =  which is the -th standard basis;  = 0 and the bias term (which is ignored in the previous description for simplicity) of  to be ; and  = , where  is the temperature that can be chosen to be large enough so that the softmax function can approximate hard max and  is the vector whose elements are all 1.</p><p>\\\n The COMBINE step takes the result of AGGREGATE and the previous representation of current node as input. This can be achieved by the AGGREGATE operations described above together with an additional head which outputs the features of present nodes, i.e., in Eq. <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark4\">(6)</a>: 1) setting  = 0 if  = 0 and  =  otherwise where  is the SPD; 2) setting  =  = 0 and  to be the identity matrix. Then the FFN module can approximate any COMBINE function by the universal approximation theorem of FFN.</p><p> This can be proved by setting  =  = 0, the bias terms of  to be , and  to be the identity matrix where  should be much larger than the scale of  so that  2T dominates the Spatial Encoding term.</p><h2>B.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Details of Datasets</h2><p>We summarize the datasets used in this work in Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark82\">6.</a> PCQM4m-LSC is a quantum chemistry graph-level prediction task in recent OGB Large-Scale Challenge, originally curated under the PubChemQC project [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark60\">42</a>].</p><p>\\\nThe task of PCQM4M-LSC is to predict DFT(density functional theory)-calculated HOMO-LUMO energy gap of molecules given their 2D molecular graphs, which is one of the most practically-relevant quantum chemical properties of molecule science. PCQM4M-LSC is unprecedentedly large in scale comparing to other labeled graph-level prediction datasets, which contains more than 3.8M graphs. Besides, we conduct experiments on two molecular graph datasets in popular OGB leaderboards, i.e., OGBG-MolPCBA and OGBG-MolHIV. They are two molecular property prediction datasets with different sizes. The pre-trained knowledge of molecular graph on PCQM4M-LSC could be easily leveraged on these two datasets. We adopt official scaffold split on three datasets following [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark38\">21</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark39\">22</a>]. In addition, we employ another popular leaderboard, i.e., benchmarking-gnn [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark31\">14</a>]. We use the ZINC datasets, which is the most popular real-world molecular dataset to predict graph property regression for contrained solubility, an important chemical property for designing generative GNNs for molecules. Different from the scaffold spliting in OGB, uniform sampling is adopted in ZINC for data splitting.</p><h2>B.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Details of Training Strategies</h2><p>\\\nWe report the detailed hyper-parameter settings used for training Graphormer in Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark83\">7.</a> We reduce the FFN inner-layer dimension of 4 in [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark65\">49</a>] to , which does not appreciably hurt the performance but significantly save the parameters. The embedding dropout ratio is set to 0.1 by default in many previous Transformer works [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark28\">11</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark52\">35</a>]. However, we empirically find that a small embedding dropout ratio (e.g., 0.1) would lead to an observable performance drop on validation set of PCQM4M-LSC. One possible reason is that the molecular graph is relative small (i.e., the median of #atoms in each molecule is about 15), making graph property more sensitive to the embeddings of each node. Therefore, we set embedding dropout ratio to 0 on this dataset.</p><p> We first report the model configurations and hyper-parameters of the pre-trained Graphormer on PCQM4M-LSC. Empirically, we find that the performance on MolPCBA benefits from the large pre-training model size. Therefore, we train a deep Graphormer with 18 Transformer layers on PCQM4M-LSC. The hidden dimension and FFN inner-layer dimension are set to 1024. We set peak learning rate to 1e-4 for the deep</p><p>Graphormer. Besides, we enlarge the attention dropout ratio from 0.1 to 0.3 in both pre-training and fine-tuning to prevent the model from over-fitting. The rest of hyper-parameters remain unchanged. The pre-trained Graphormer used for MolPCBA achieves a valid MAE of 0.1253 on PCQM4M-LSC, which is slightly worse than the reports in Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark11\">1.</a></p><p>\\\n Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark84\">8</a> summarizes the hyper-parameters used for fine-tuning Graphormer on OGBG-MolPCBA. We conduct a grid search for several hyper-parameters to find the optimal configuration. The experimental results are reported by the mean of 10 independent runs with random seeds. We use FLAG [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark44\">27</a>] with minor modifications for graph data augmentation. In particular, except the step size  and the number of steps , we also employ a projection step in [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark79\">62</a>] with maximum perturbation . The performance of Graphormer on MolPCBA is quite robust to the hyper-parameters of FLAG. The rest of hyper-parameters are the same with the pre-training model.</p><p>\\\n We use the Graphormer reported in Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark11\">1</a> as the pre-trained model for OGBG-MolHIV, where the pre-training hyper-parameters are summarized in Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark83\">7.</a></p><p>\\\n&nbsp; The hyper-parameters for fine-tuning Graphormer on OGBG-MolHIV are presented in Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark85\">9.</a> Empirically, we find that the different choices of hyper-parameters of FLAG (i.e., step size , number of steps , and maximum perturbation ) would greatly affect the performance of Graphormer on OGBG-MolHiv. Therefore, we spend more effort to conduct grid search for hyper-parameters of FLAG. We report the best hyper-parameters by the mean of 10 independent runs with random seeds.</p><p>To keep the total parameters of Graphormer less than 500K per the request from benchmarking-GNN leader-board [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark31\">14</a>], we train a slim 12-layer Graphormer with hidden dimension of 80, which is called GraphormerSLIM in Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark15\">4,</a> and has about 489K learnable parameters. The number of attention heads is set to 8. Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark86\">10</a> summarizes the detailed hyper-parameters on ZINC. We train 400K steps on this dataset, and employ a weight decay of 0.01.</p><h2>B.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Details of Hyper-parameters for Baseline Methods</h2><p>In this section, we present the details of our re-implementation of the baseline methods.</p><p>The official Github repository of OGB-LSC<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark88\">7</a> provides hyper-parameters and codes to reproduce the results on leaderboard. These hyper-parameters work well on almost all popular GNN variants, except the DeeperGCN-VN, which results in a training divergence. Therefore, for DeeperGCN-VN, we follow the official hyper-parameter setting<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark89\">8</a> provided by the authors [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark47\">30</a>]. For a fair comparison to Graphormer, we train a 12-layer DeeperGCN. The hidden dimension is set to 600. The batch size is set to 256. The learning rate is set to 1e-3, and a step learning rate scheduler is employed with the decaying step size and the decaying factor  as 30 epochs and 0.25. The model is trained for 100 epochs.</p><p>The default dimension of laplacian PE of GT [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark30\">13</a>] is set to 8. However, it will cause 2.91% small molecules (less than 8 atoms) to be filtered out. Therefore, for GT and GT-Wide, we set the dimension of laplacian PE to 4, which results in only 0.08% filtering out. We adopt the default hyper-parameter settings described in [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark30\">13</a>], except that we decrease the learning rate to 1e-4, which leads to a better convergence on PCQM4M-LSC.</p><p>To fine-tune the pre-trained GIN-VN on MolPCBA, we follow the hyper-parameter settings provided in the original OGB paper [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark39\">22</a>]. To be more concrete, we load the pre-trained checkpoint reported in Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark11\">1</a> and fine-tune it on OGBG-MolPCBA dataset. We use the grid search on the hyper-parameters for better fine-tuning performance. In particular, the learning rate is selected from {1e − 5, 1e − 4, 1e − 3}; the dropout ratio is selected from {0.0, 0.1, 0.5}; the batch size is selected from {32, 64}.</p><p>Similarly, we fine-tune the pre-trained GIN-VN on MolHIV by following the hyper-parameter settings provided in the original OGB paper [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark39\">22</a>]. We also conduct the grid search to look for optimal hyper-parameters. The ranges for each hyper-parameter of grid search are the same as the previous subsection.</p><h2>C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More Experiments</h2><p>As described in the related work, GROVER is a Transformer-based GNN, which has 100 million parameters and pre-trained on 10 million unlabelled molecules using 250 Nvidia V100 GPUs. In this section, we report the fine-tuning scores of GROVER on MolHIV and MolPCBA, and compare with proposed Graphormer.</p><p>We download the pre-trained GROVER models from its official Github webpage<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark92\">9</a>, follow the official instruc-tions<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark93\">10</a> and fine-tune the provided pre-trained checkpoints with careful search of hyper-parameters (in Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark87\">11).</a> We find that GROVER could achieve competitive performance on MolHIV only if employing additional molecular features, i.e., morgan molecular finger prints and 2D features<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark94\">11</a>. Therefore, we report the scores of GROVER by taking these two additional molecular features. Please note that, from the leaderboard<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark95\">12</a>, we can know such additional molecular features are very effective on MolHIV dataset.</p><p>Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark90\">12</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark91\">13</a>&nbsp;summarize the performance of GROVER and GROVERLARGE comparing with Graphormer on MolHIV and MolPCBA. From the tables, we observe that Graphormer could consistently outperform GROVER even without any additional molecular features.</p><h2>D&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Discussion &amp; Future Work</h2><p> Similar to regular Transformer, the attention mechanism in Graphormer scales quadratically with the number of nodes  in the input graph, which may be prohibitively expensive for large  and precludes its usage in settings with limited computational resources. Recently, many solutions have been proposed to address this problem in Transformer [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark41\">25</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark69\">52</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark74\">57</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsofts-graphormer-the-transformer-that-finally-beats-gnns?source=rss#_bookmark55\">37</a>]. This issue would be greatly benefit from the future development of efficient Graphormer.</p><p>\\\n. In Graphormer, there are multiple choices for the network centrality and the spatial encoding function ( ). For example, one can leverage the 2 distance in 3D structure between two atoms in a molecule. In this paper, we mainly evaluate general centrality and distance metric in graph theory, i.e., the degree centrality and the shortest path. Performance improvement could be expected by leveraging domain knowledge powered encodings on particular graph dataset.</p><p>\\\n There is a wide range of node representation tasks on graph structured data, such as finance, social network, and temporal prediction. Graphormer could be naturally used for node representation extraction with an applicable graph sampling strategy. We leave it for future work.</p><p>:::info\nThis paper is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05234\">available on arxiv</a>&nbsp;under CC by 4.0 Deed (Attribution 4.0 International) license.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Every crypto bull run created a new wave of millionaires. But those millionaires did not buy after the rally started. They bought during the fear. They bought presales at fractions of a cent while everyone else waited for confirmation. By the time confirmation arrived, the 50x windows had already closed.</p><p>A presale is when a project sells tokens before they list on exchanges. The price is locked far below what it trades for on launch day. Early SHIB investors turned $1,000 into over $1 million. PEPE made early holders rich in weeks. The pattern repeats every cycle. Three projects stand out right now. Pepeto, BlockDAG, and Mutuum Finance each offer presale access. But the upside between them is not close.</p><h3>Pepeto: The One That Goes Viral</h3><p>Most presales sell you a concept. Pepeto is selling you the infrastructure for the entire meme coin economy. That changes everything. Instead of betting on one token to pump, you are buying the trading layer that profits no matter which meme coin takes off next.</p><p>PepetoSwap is a zero tax cross chain swap announced by the team and close to being ready. The Pepeto Bridge moves tokens between blockchains. The Pepeto Exchange is a meme coin listing hub approaching launch. A cofounder of the original Pepe token leads the build. Dual audits from SolidProof and Coinsult confirmed zero critical findings. The presale has already raised $7.33 million with 70% of supply filled, as reported by .</p><p>At $0.000000186, the math is simple. A 50x rally turns $1,000 into $50,000. A 100x turns it into $100,000. That is not speculation. Shiba Inu hit a $40 billion market cap with zero products. PEPE reached $7 billion on memes alone. Pepeto has three products approaching launch and a Binance listing on the horizon. Staking at 211% APY means a $3,000 hold generates $6,330 in yearly rewards while you wait. But staking is the bonus. The real play is the multiple. Community growth is accelerating and social channels are exploding. This is the presale that goes viral.</p><h3>BlockDAG: Strong Concept, Different Timeline</h3><p>BlockDAG combines Proof of Work security with a DAG structure that processes transactions in parallel. The presale has raised over $450 million, one of the largest totals this cycle. That gives the team serious funding for development.</p><p>But with $450 million already raised, much of the early upside may be priced in. Investors are now looking at 2x to 3x returns rather than exponential multiples. For steady growth from a large infrastructure play, BlockDAG makes sense. But it is a different bet than a presale at six zeros.</p><h3>Mutuum Finance: DeFi Lending With Utility</h3><p>Mutuum Finance focuses on decentralized lending and borrowing. Users supply assets to earn yield or borrow against holdings. The model mirrors established protocols but targets a newer audience.</p><p>The concept is solid with proven demand. But the returns profile looks more like a 2x to 5x play based on current valuations. Why target a 3x return when a presale at six zeros offers 50x with logic and 100x with momentum?</p><h2>Why Presales Create the Biggest Returns</h2><p>Exchange listed tokens already have price discovery behind them. You buy after millions set the floor. Presales flip that. You buy before the crowd, before the listing, before social media drives the second wave. Every cycle, the biggest winners come from presale entries, as reported by .</p><p>BlockDAG and Mutuum Finance both have real utility. But utility alone does not create 50x returns. Pepeto combines meme coin virality with real infrastructure, a Pepe cofounder, dual audits, and a Binance listing approaching. The presale is 70% filled. SHIB created millionaires with zero products. DOGE created millionaires with a joke. Pepeto has three products and the viral energy to match. At $0.000000186, this is the presale window that closes permanently once listing day arrives.</p><p><strong>What is a crypto presale and why does it matter?</strong></p><p>A presale lets you buy tokens before they list on exchanges. Prices are locked at early stage levels, which is how early SHIB and PEPE investors turned small amounts into life changing wealth.</p><p><strong>Is Pepeto better than BlockDAG for 2026 returns?</strong></p><p>BlockDAG raised $450 million, so much of the upside may be priced in. Pepeto at $0.000000186 offers 50x to 100x potential because it combines meme virality with real infrastructure at six zeros.</p><p><strong>Can you still make money from crypto presales?</strong></p><p>Every bull run creates new presale millionaires. The key is entering before exchange listings and choosing projects with both utility and viral community momentum.</p><p>:::warning\nThis article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice.

      "content": "An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: Google on Friday unveiled its plan for its Chrome browser to secure HTTPS certificates against quantum computer attacks without breaking the Internet. The objective is a tall order. The quantum-resistant cryptographic data needed to transparently publish TLS certificates is roughly 40 times bigger than the classical cryptographic material used today. Today's X.509 certificates are about 64 bytes in size, and comprise six elliptic curve signatures and two EC public keys. This material can be cracked through the quantum-enabled Shor's algorithm. Certificates containing the equivalent quantum-resistant cryptographic material are roughly 2.5 kilobytes. All this data must be transmitted when a browser connects to a site.\n \nTo bypass the bottleneck, companies are turning to Merkle Trees, a data structure that uses cryptographic hashes and other math to verify the contents of large amounts of information using a small fraction of material used in more traditional verification processes in public key infrastructure. Merkle Tree Certificates, \"replace the heavy, serialized chain of signatures found in traditional PKI with compact Merkle Tree proofs,\" members of Google's Chrome Secure Web and Networking Team wrote Friday. \"In this model, a Certification Authority (CA) signs a single 'Tree Head' representing potentially millions of certificates, and the 'certificate' sent to the browser is merely a lightweight proof of inclusion in that tree.\"\n \n[...] Google is [also] adding cryptographic material from quantum-resistant algorithms such as ML-DSA (PDF). This addition would allow forgeries only if an attacker were to break both classical and post-quantum encryption. The new regime is part of what Google is calling the quantum-resistant root store, which will complement the Chrome Root Store the company formed in 2022. The [Merkle Tree Certificates] MTCs use Merkle Trees to provide quantum-resistant assurances that a certificate has been published without having to add most of the lengthy keys and hashes. Using other techniques to reduce the data sizes, the MTCs will be roughly the same 64-byte length they are now [...]. The new system has already been implemented in Chrome.",

      "content": "On February 24th, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory activated its automated alert system, sending out roughly 800,000 real-time notifications flagging asteroids, supernovae, flaring black holes and \"other transient celestial events,\" reports Scientific American. And this is only the beginning -- that number is projected to climb into the millions as it continues scanning the ever-changing sky. From the report: The astronomical observatory equipped with world's largest camera hit a key milestone on February 24, when a complex data-processing system pushed hundreds of thousands of alerts out to scientists eager to pore over its most exciting sightings. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory began operations last year, capturing stunning, panoramic time-lapse views of the cosmos with ease. Rubin's first images, based on just 10 hours of observations, let space fans zoom seemingly forever into an overwhelmingly starry sky. But watchful astronomers were always awaiting the next step: the system that would automatically alert them to the most promising activity in the overhead sky amid the 1,000 or so enormous images that Rubin's telescope captures every night.\n \n\"We can detect everything that changes, moves and appears,\" said Yusra AlSayyad, an astronomer at Princeton University and Rubin's deputy associate director for data management, to Scientific American last summer. \"It's way too much for one person to manually sift through and filter and monitor themselves.\" So even as they were designing and building the Rubin Observatory itself, scientists were also designing an alert system to help astronomers navigate the flood of data. As soon as the telescope began observations, the team started constructing a static reference image of the entire sky in impeccable detail.\n \nNow the data processing systems that support the observatory are starting to automatically compare every new Rubin image to the corresponding section of that background template. The systems identify all of the differences, each of which is individually flagged. The algorithms can also distinguish between a potential supernova and a possible newfound asteroid, for example. Alerting the scientific community is the final, crucial step. Astronomers -- as well as members of the public -- can sign up for notifications based on the type of sighting they're interested in and the brightness of the observation in question. And now that the alerts system has gone live, users receive a tiny, fuzzy image with some astronomical metadata of each observation that fits their criteria -- all just a couple of minutes after Rubin captures the original image.",

      "content": "Southern California's air quality board rejected proposed rules to phase out gas-powered appliances after receiving more than 20,000 opposition comments generated through CiviClick, \"the first and best AI-powered grassroots advocacy platform.\" Phys.org reports: A Southern California-based public affairs consultant, Matt Klink, has taken credit for using CiviClick to wage the opposition campaign, including in a sponsored article on the website Campaigns and Elections. The campaign \"left the staff of the Southern California Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) reeling,\" the article says. It is not clear how AI was deployed in the campaign, and officials at CiviClick did not respond to repeated requests for comment. But their website boasts several tools, including \"state of the art technology and artificial intelligence message assistance\" that can be used to create custom advocacy letters, as opposed to repetitive form letters or petitions often used in similar campaigns.\n \nWhen staffers at the air district reached out to a small sample of people to verify their comments, at least three said they had not written to the agency and were not aware of any such messages, records show. But the email onslaught almost certainly influenced the board's June decision, according to agency insiders, who noted that the number of public comments typically submitted on agenda items can be counted on one hand.\n \nThe proposed rules were nearly two years in the making and would have placed a fee on natural gas-powered water heaters and furnaces, favoring electric ones, in an effort to reduce air pollution in the district, which includes Orange County and large swaths of Los Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino counties. Gas appliances emit nitrogen oxides, or NOx -- key pollutants for forming smog. The implications are troubling, experts said, and go beyond the use of natural gas furnaces and heaters in the second-largest metropolitan area in the country.",

      "content": "<p>One of the unfortunate knock on effects of being generally insufferable is that many people don’t want to be associated with you in any way. And when you’re both insufferable and happen to be the most divisive American political figure in modern history, all the more so. And that is certainly why, during both of the Donald Trump presidential campaigns, it became common practice for musical artists to complain about his “unauthorized” use of their music at his campaign events.</p><p>Now, as this site has posted out a zillion times in the past, many of the complaints from artists are unfounded. Often, the use of the music in question was authorized through blanket performance licenses held by the venues for the rallies. While it should be obvious that best practice would be for candidates like Trump to seek permission to use music just to avoid any public complaining and backlash for that use, there is no real copyright claim to be had in those instances. Lots of people <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160725/07541435058/john-olivers-story-campaign-music-copyright-is-wrong.shtml\">get this wrong</a>.</p><blockquote><p><em>Copyright law is&nbsp;so&nbsp;screwed up that there actually may be a case where the law does require permission. And it has to do with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/blog/?tag=pre-1972+sound+recordings\">pre-1972 sound recordings</a>. If you’ve been reading Techdirt for any length of time, you know that we’ve discussed this issue many times in the past. Historically, while&nbsp;compositions&nbsp;were covered by copyright, under the 1909 Copyright Act&nbsp;sound recordings&nbsp;were not. This resulted in a patchwork of state laws (and state commonlaw) that created special forms of copyright at the state level. Eventually, sound recordings were put under federal copyright law, but it only applied to works recorded after February 14, 1972. Works recorded before that are not under federal copyright law, but remain basically the only things under those state copyright laws (the 1976 Copyright Act basically wiped out state copyright laws for&nbsp;everything&nbsp;but that one tiny thing).</em></p><p><em>The issue is not that simple, because nothing around this particular issue is simple. However, based on at least&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140923/17250328610/judge-rules-against-sirius-xm-pre-1972-recordings.shtml\">some</a>&nbsp;of the rulings in pre-1972 sound recording copyright cases, federal copyright law doesn’t apply at all to those songs (other court opinions have come out otherwise). And thus, there’s an argument that the requirements involving blanket licenses for pre-1972 sound recordings may not apply, because the use of the sound recording may require a special public performance license from the copyright holder</em></p></blockquote><p>And so now we have a decade or so of courts trying to figure this out. The outcomes of court cases are every bit as patchwork as the state laws that inform their outcomes. Add to all of this that even some of the blanket licenses from the likes of ASCAP include opt-outs for political campaigns and the like and it’s easy for all kinds of mistakes to be made.</p><p>Mistakes don’t really explain the rash of instances of artists complaining about Trump’s usage, however. He’s been through this so many times, in fact, that it seems obvious that he and his people simply don’t care to try to secure permission. I doubt they even looked into whether they needed to. And the onus to understand what licensing is needed is certainly on their shoulders and nobody else’s. That’s how you get Pharrell <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2018/10/30/pharrell-is-not-all-happy-about-trump-using-happy-his-rally-he-might-actually-have-case/\">clapping back</a> on Trump’s use of his music at an insane rally shortly after a nationalist murdered 11 people in Pittsburgh (the venue didn’t have a license from the artist’s rights management of choice). Or his campaign losing a copyright suit to <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2024/09/26/trump-loses-copyright-suit-over-electric-avenue-2020-campaign-video-in-summary-judgement/\">Eddy Grant</a> for the use of his music in a campaign video. </p><blockquote><p><em>Hayes’ son and estate manager, music producer&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/author/isaac-hayes-iii/\">Isaac Hayes III</a>, says in a Monday (Feb. 23)&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DVHSun4EaBW/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Instagram statement</a>&nbsp;that the lawsuit “has been mutually resolved, and we are satisfied with the outcome.” Financial terms of the settlement were not disclosed.</em></p><p><em>“This resolution represents more than the conclusion of a legal matter,” writes Hayes III in his statement. “It reaffirms the importance of protecting intellectual property rights and copyrights, especially as they relate to legacy, ownership and the responsible use of creative works.”</em></p></blockquote><p>It will surprise nobody that I would love to debate most of what appears in that quote from Hayes III, but that is a separate matter entirely. Instead, my focus is on two undeniable realities. First, the chaos that has been created with these older, pre-1972 song recordings is insane, complicated, and needlessly convoluted. Whoever thought this setup was a good idea should be placed in a facility under constant care.</p><p>Second, Trump almost certainly committed copyright infringement, the above complaint notwithstanding. And he’s been through enough of these that he could very easily tell his people to just go get the proper permissions for any music that is played at his little fascism pep rallies. While the settlement terms go undisclosed, which is always annoying, I’ve seen enough of these to be able to read between the lines. The Hayes estate got its pint of blood, at a bare minimum.</p><p>Wouldn’t it just be easier to get artists that like you to let you play their music at your events, Donald? There were at least a few artists at that emotional support half time show that nobody watched that you could choose from.</p>",

      "content": "An anonymous reader quotes a report from Wired: OpenAI has fired an employee following an investigation into their activity on prediction market platforms including Polymarket, WIRED has learned. OpenAI CEO of Applications, Fidji Simo, disclosed the termination in an internal message to employees earlier this year. The employee, she said, \"used confidential OpenAI information in connection with external prediction markets (e.g. Polymarket).\" \"Our policies prohibit employees from using confidential OpenAI information for personal gain, including in prediction markets,\" says spokesperson Kayla Wood. OpenAI has not revealed the name of the employee or the specifics of their trades.\n \nEvidence suggests that this was not an isolated event. Polymarket runs on the Polygon blockchain network, so its trading ledger is pseudonymous but traceable. According to an analysis by the financial data platform Unusual Whales, there have been clusters of activities, which the service flagged as suspicious, around OpenAI-themed events since March 2023. Unusual Whales flagged 77 positions in 60 wallet addresses as suspected insider trades, looking at the age of the account, trading history, and significance of investment, among other factors. Suspicious trades hinged on the release dates of products like Sora, GPT-5, and the ChatGPT Browser, as well as CEO Sam Altman's employment status. In November 2023, two days after Altman was dramatically ousted from the company, a new wallet placed a significant bet that he would return, netting over $16,000 in profits. The account never placed another bet.\n \nThe behavior fits into patterns typical of insider trades. \"The tell is the clustering. In the 40 hours before OpenAI launched its browser, 13 brand-new wallets with zero trading history appeared on the site for the first time to collectively bet $309,486 on the right outcome,\" says Unusual Whales CEO Matt Saincome. \"When you see that many fresh wallets making the same bet at the same time, it raises a real question about whether the secret is getting out.\" [...] Though this is the first confirmed case of a large technology company firing an employee over trades in prediction markets, it's almost certainly not the last. Opportunities for tech sector employees to make trades on markets abound. \"The data tells me this is happening all over the place,\" Saincome says.",

      "content": "<p>Batman made his first appearance in 1939. When you have a character who has been around for 80 years, they’re bound to change their appearance from time to time. So, it only makes sense for video games like Batman: Arkham Knight to take advantage of this and add different alternative costumes that players can pick and choose from. Some of these were hits, some of these were misses, and some were just okay. Let’s take a look at the 5 biggest hits (at least, in my opinion). Here are the 5 best batsuits from Batman: Arkham Knight.</p><h2>5 Best Batsuits From Arkham Knight</h2><ol></ol><p>One of my favorites is the default one, the v8.03. We get this one early into the game, when Batman realizes he needs a little something extra, and his old costume just won’t do. It looks sleek, heavy, and the black looks amazing. This is definitely the best-looking default batsuit in the entire series.</p><p>\\\nThere are 2 other versions of this suit: the 8.04 and 8.05. The 8.04 stays perfectly pristine, so it doesn’t get any battle damage as the 8.03 does. Then there’s the 8.05. This one is similar, with the exception of the golden bat symbol on the chest.</p><p>\\\nI’m not a fan of the golden bat symbol, and I actually like that the 8.03 can get damaged and cut up. It shows the toll that the night has taken on Batman.</p><p>Some people like it when the batsuit is gray; others prefer it when it’s black. I like this one because it falls right in the middle. It looks like a dark gray, but from a different perspective, you can technically say that it’s a light black. What really makes the Batman Inc. suit one of my favorites, though, is the bat symbol on his chest. The yellow oval behind the black bat symbol makes it really striking, and it’s one of the first things your eyes notice.</p><p>\\\nThere are similar batsuits like the one from the 1989 movie that have a similar look. However, the Batman Inc. one has a better bat symbol and cowl. That’s why I put it above the 1989 one and above most other ones.</p><p>\\\nThe Batman Flashpoint suit is damn near perfect. The red accents all throughout it, such as in his pouches, eyes, and bat symbol, really make the whole thing stand out. Plus, having the body be gray with the cowl, gauntlets, and boots be completely black was such a great idea. The cherry on top, the thing that makes this costume stunning, is the double-handguns, one on each side. Like I said, damn near perfection.</p><p>\\\nSo, what don’t I like about it? My least favorite thing about it is the strange shoulder guards. Maybe if they were smaller and less pointy, I would be into it. Even better would be if they were completely gone. With all that said, though, this is still one of the best skins in the game.</p><p>I said I like the Batman Inc. suit because it’s the perfect mix between black and gray. I like the Batman v Superman one for a completely different reason. This one is very clearly gray; there’s no mistaking it. There are others that are gray, like the First Appearance one, but there is something different about this particular one. It’s the fabric. I’m not sure how to describe it, but the fabric of the suit is unlike any other.</p><p>\\\nIt sort of looks like a type of Kevlar, which is completely different from the tights that some of the other costumes appear to be made out of. That, combined with the gigantic bat symbol, makes it look phenomenal. I’m a sucker for a good bat symbol, what can I say?</p><p>This might be a hot take, but my all-time favorite batsuit in the Arkham Knight game is the Batman Beyond one. Don’t get me wrong, I love the others on this list, but this one is just on a completely different level. I really like the red accents and how mechanized the whole suit looks. It has a whole cyborg thing going on that I personally enjoy. There are some caveats to it, though, that I will admit to.</p><p>\\\nThe mouthpiece is a bit strange-looking. You have this whole futuristic costume, and it looks like the mouthpiece is just made out of cloth or something. Not a fan. The second biggest critique is that it looks nothing like the Batman Beyond suit from the animated show.</p><p>\\\nI can understand and accept these two flaws, but that doesn’t bring down my enjoyment of the costume. In my opinion, the Batman Beyond suit is the best-looking one in Batman: Arkham Knight. You know what, I might have to replay the whole game again just to look at these cool skins.</p>",

From the report: In 2021, the Australian company Cortical Labs used its neuron-powered computer chips to play Pong. The chips consisted of clumps of more than 800,000 living brain cells grown on top of microelectrode arrays that can both send and receive electrical signals. Researchers had to carefully train the chips to control the paddles on either side of the screen. Now, Cortical Labs has developed an interface that makes it easier to program these chips using the popular programming language Python. An independent developer, Sean Cole, then used Python to teach the chips to play Doom, which he did in around a week.\n \n\"Unlike the Pong work that we did a few years ago, which represented years of painstaking scientific effort, this demonstration has been done in a matter of days by someone who previously had relatively little expertise working directly with biology,\" says Brett Kagan of Cortical Labs. \"It's this accessibility and this flexibility that makes it truly exciting.\"\n \nThe neuronal computer chip, which used about a quarter as many neurons as the Pong demonstration, played Doom better than a randomly firing player, but far below the performance of the best human players. However, it learnt much faster than traditional, silicon-based machine learning systems and should be able to improve its performance with newer learning algorithms, says Kagan. However, it's not useful to compare the chips with human brains, he says. \"Yes, it's alive, and yes, it's biological, but really what it is being used as is a material that can process information in very special ways that we can't recreate in silicon.\" Cortical Labs posted a YouTube video showing its CL1 biological computer running Doom. There's also source code available on GitHub, with additional details in a README file.",

This obituary will focus on what is generally considered his greatest work, and what I believe is possibly the greatest science fiction novel of all time, Hyperion.\n \nPublished in 1989, Hyperion is set in a far-flung future in which human settlement spans hundreds of planets. The novel feels both familiar, in that its structure follows Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, and utterly unfamiliar in its strange, far-flung setting. Simmons' Hyperion appeared in an Ask Slashdot story back in 2008, when Slashdot reader willyhill asked for tips on how Slashdotters track down great sci-fi. If you're in the mood for a little nostalgia, or just want to browse the thread for book recommendations, it's well worth revisiting.",

      "content": "<p>If you hang around startup circles in the Bay Area long enough, you’ll start hearing something unexpected between funding rounds and AI debates: founders quietly Googling “<a href=\"https://drive.yango.com/\">car rental in UAE</a>” and checking flight prices to Dubai and Abu Dhabi. What started as curiosity has turned into a real trend. From San Francisco to the sands of the Arabian Peninsula, American tech talent is seriously eyeing the United Arab Emirates—and not just for a quick conference or a flashy vacation.</p><p>So what’s driving the shift?</p><h2><strong>Silicon Valley Burnout Is Real</strong></h2><p>Let’s call it what it is. The Bay Area is still iconic, but it’s also expensive, hyper-competitive, and increasingly saturated. Sky-high rents, intense regulation, talent wars, and a constant hustle culture can wear even the most ambitious founder down. After years of grinding in co-working spaces and chasing Series A funding, some U.S. entrepreneurs are looking for a reset.</p><p>The UAE, especially Dubai and Abu Dhabi, is pitching itself as that reset button. Lower personal income taxes, streamlined business setup processes, and aggressive government support for innovation make the region hard to ignore. For founders used to navigating layers of red tape back home, the efficiency can feel almost unreal.</p><h2><strong>A Government That Actually Bets on Tech</strong></h2><p>One of the biggest surprises for Americans exploring the UAE tech scene is how hands-on—and forward-thinking—the government is. Artificial intelligence, fintech, climate tech, space technology: these aren’t just buzzwords on a conference banner. They’re central to national strategy.</p><p>Free zones tailored to tech companies offer 100% foreign ownership and simplified licensing. Major funds and sovereign wealth investors actively back innovation. In many cases, founders aren’t just tolerated—they’re welcomed with open arms and real incentives.</p><p>Compare that to the sometimes fragmented regulatory environment in the U.S., and it’s easy to see why some builders are thinking, “Why not give this a shot?”</p><h2><strong>It’s Not Just Oil Money Anymore</strong></h2><p>There’s still a persistent stereotype in the U.S. that the Gulf economy runs purely on oil. That narrative is outdated. The UAE has spent decades diversifying its economy, investing heavily in infrastructure, tourism, logistics, and now digital transformation.</p><p>Walk through Dubai Internet City or Hub71 in Abu Dhabi and you’ll see a mix of global companies, scrappy startups, and venture-backed disruptors. English is widely spoken. Contracts are often structured in ways that feel familiar to U.S. founders. The vibe? Surprisingly international and business-friendly.</p><p>For tech professionals who’ve spent their careers building products for global markets, the UAE’s geographic position—bridging Europe, Asia, and Africa—is a strategic advantage. A product launched in Dubai can scale across multiple regions without being locked into one market.</p><p>Let’s talk lifestyle, because it matters. The UAE isn’t just pitching spreadsheets and tax breaks. It’s selling quality of life. Modern apartments, world-class restaurants, beach access, and relatively high levels of safety are all part of the package.</p><p>Yes, the summer heat is intense. But the infrastructure is built for it. Offices, malls, and residential buildings are climate-controlled. Everything runs efficiently. For many Americans, the biggest adjustment isn’t the temperature—it’s the pace. Things move fast. Deals close quickly. Bureaucracy, when it exists, is often surprisingly streamlined.</p><p>And when it comes to getting around, practicality kicks in. Cities like Dubai are spread out, with business districts, residential communities, and innovation hubs connected by wide highways. While public transportation exists, most professionals find that having a car makes daily life significantly easier. Whether you’re commuting to a co-working space, heading to investor meetings, or exploring new neighborhoods, renting a car is often the smartest move—especially during your first few months while you figure out where to settle.</p><h2><strong>The Remote Work Era Changed the Game</strong></h2><p>The pandemic permanently shifted how tech workers think about location. If you can code from anywhere, why limit yourself to one zip code? The UAE capitalized on this shift by introducing long-term visas and remote work permits designed specifically for global talent.</p><p>Suddenly, relocating doesn’t mean cutting ties with U.S. clients or investors. Many founders maintain American entities while building regional operations in the UAE. It’s less about abandoning Silicon Valley and more about expanding beyond it.</p><p>This hybrid model is attractive. Keep your Delaware C-corp, but base your operations in a city that offers global connectivity, strong infrastructure, and competitive costs. For a generation raised on flexibility and scale, it’s a compelling pitch.</p><h2><strong>Risk, Reward, and Reputation</strong></h2><p>Of course, moving halfway across the world isn’t a casual decision. Cultural differences, legal frameworks, and market dynamics require research and adaptability. Not every startup will thrive in the Gulf, and not every founder will feel at home.</p><p>But the reputation factor is shifting. What once seemed like a bold or risky move now feels strategic. U.S. tech talent isn’t just chasing sunshine and skyscrapers. They’re chasing opportunity—new markets, new investors, and a chance to build in an ecosystem that’s actively evolving.</p><p>From San Francisco to the sands, the flow of ideas—and people—is becoming more global. The UAE isn’t replacing Silicon Valley, but it’s carving out its own lane as a serious contender in the tech world. For American founders and engineers tired of the grind or hungry for international expansion, it’s a place worth exploring.</p><p>Pack your laptop. Line up your meetings. Maybe start with a short-term stay and a rental car to navigate the city like a local. You might just discover that the future of your startup isn’t limited to the Bay Area. Sometimes, the next big move starts with a one-way ticket and a willingness to see what’s possible beyond the familiar skyline.</p>",

      "content": "<h2>4 Are Neurons in Expert still Sparsely Activated?</h2><p>Previous work has shown that dense LLMs with different activation functions (ReLU, SwiGLU, etc.) exhibit the property of sparse activation [69, 36, 30]. However, the analysis is limited to dense models. Despite the intuitive assumption that partitioning FFNs into different experts within an MoE model would result in denser activations within each expert, it remains unclear whether this sparsity phenomenon persists in MoE models. In this section, we select representative MoE models and commonly used downstream tasks to investigate whether this sparsity phenomenon still exists in MoE models. We utilize the same method in 3 to control the sparsity in each expert.</p><p>\\\n. We select Deepseek-MoE [15], Qwen1.5-MoE [5] and Mixtral [25] as the models for our experiments. We also add Llama-2-7B as for comparison.</p><p>\\\nWe first study the performance with regard to the sparsity ratio, as shown in Figure 5 (a)[2]. Specifically, the performance only drops by about 1%-2% when the sparsity ratio is 0.5. This trend suggests that MoE models exhibit similar sparsity compared to dense models.</p><p>\\\nFurther, we profile the activation patterns of Mistral and Mixtral, a pair of popular dense LLM and MoE LLM, as shown in Figure 5 (b). We find that both LLMs show a similar pattern where activations are concentrated around 0, which is consistent with previous analysis of dense LLMs. The sparsity in experts also implies that every neuron in the same expert has different functionality. This finding applies to all layers and experts, as detailed in Appendix A.2. We report this interesting observation and leave further analysis for future work.</p><p>\\\n\\\nInspired by our discoveries in MoE models, we are convinced that ReLUfication can be extended to MoE models and is not restricted to dense models. As the proportion of FFN weights in MoE models increases, the FLOP reduction achieved through ReLUfication will be even more pronounced.</p><p>(1) Yixin Song, Institute of Parallel and Distributed Systems (IPADS), Shanghai Jiao Tong University;</p><p>(2) Haotong Xie, Institute of Parallel and Distributed Systems (IPADS), Shanghai Jiao Tong University;</p><p>(3) Zhengyan Zhang, Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University;</p><p>(4) Bo Wen, Institute of Parallel and Distributed Systems (IPADS), Shanghai Jiao Tong University;</p><p>(5) Li Ma, Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory;</p><p>(6) Zeyu Mi, Institute of Parallel and Distributed Systems (IPADS), Shanghai Jiao Tong University Mi yzmizeyu@sjtu.edu.cn);</p><p>(7) Haibo Chen, Institute of Parallel and Distributed Systems (IPADS), Shanghai Jiao Tong University.</p>",

Reuters reports: The approval was made \"on the condition that strict security requirements are met,\" the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport said in a statement. Those conditions include blurring military and other sensitive security-related facilities, as well as restricting longitude and latitude coordinates for South Korean territory on products such as Google Maps and Google Earth, it said.\n \nThe decision is expected to hurt Naver and Kakao -- local internet giants which currently dominate the country's market for digital map services. But it will appease Washington, which has urged Seoul to tackle what it says is discrimination against U.S. tech companies. South Korea, still technically at war with North Korea, had shot down Google's previous bids in 2007 and 2016 to be allowed to export the data, citing the risks that information about sensitive military and security facilities could be exposed. \"Google can now come in, slash usage fees, and take the market,\" said Choi Jin-mu, a geography professor at Kyung Hee University. \"If Naver and Kakao are weakened or pushed out and Google later raises prices, that becomes a monopoly. Then, even companies that rely on map services -- logistics firms, for example -- become dependent, and in the long run, even government GIS (geographic information) systems could end up dependent on Google or Apple.

      "content": "<p><strong>Full disclosure up front:</strong> I sit on the board of Bluesky. That said, I had absolutely no idea this lawsuit existed until recently. Which, honestly, tells you something about how much of a legal non-event it was. But the underlying story here—about the NFL treating social media the way it treats television broadcast rights—is worth digging into, because it reveals something deeply broken about how major sports leagues think about the internet.</p><p>The 2025-2026 NFL season just wrapped up, and along with it came a federal court ruling in a case called Brown v. NFL that most people missed entirely. Two football fans—one in Illinois, one in California—<a href=\"https://api.www.documentcloud.org/files/documents/27411444/brownvnfl242026.pdf\">sued the NFL under the Sherman Act</a>, claiming the league violated antitrust law by barring its teams from posting on Bluesky. The fans wanted to follow their teams—the Bears and the now-champion Seahawks—on the platform they actually use, rather than on Elon Musk’s X. The court dismissed the case for lack of standing, and honestly, that was probably the right legal outcome.</p><p>The fans couldn’t demonstrate a concrete injury—the information they wanted was still available, for free, on X. As the court put it, their grievance reduced to being “denied the ability to obtain real-time NFL team information on a private platform with which they are ideologically comfortable.” And “I don’t like Elon Musk” is not an antitrust injury. The Sherman Act targets conspiracies that restrain trade and harm competition—not content distribution preferences. You can’t force a private organization to distribute its content on the platform you like best, just as we’ve called out attempts to force social media platforms to carry content they don’t want to carry.</p><p>But the fact that the NFL is  to be this myopic doesn’t make it a smart business decision. You can be entirely within your rights and still be making a spectacularly bad call.</p><p>Since 2013, the NFL has had a “content partnership” with X (dating back to when it was the useful site known as Twitter). The deal lets X publish real-time highlights, and in return the league gets… money, presumably. As the court noted in its ruling:</p><blockquote><p><em>Since 2013, the NFL and X (formerly Twitter, Inc.) have had a “content partnership.” It allows X to publish real-time highlights from football games, such as touchdowns. During the offseason, reporters post on X with news about team practices and other NFL-related topics, and fans on X discuss teams’ acquisitions of free agents and other roster changes. For example, during the NFL draft (the high-profile annual event in which teams select eligible players to join their rosters), X published more than one million posts concerning the NFL; these appeared on users’ screens more than 800 million times. The NFL has repeatedly renewed its partnership with X. Fans do not pay money to receive NFL news on X.</em></p></blockquote><p>Fine. Lots of organizations have deals with social media platforms. But this just seems like self-sabotage: the NFL apparently used this partnership as justification to tell its own teams they <strong>couldn’t even  on a competing platform</strong>. Multiple NFL teams—including the New England Patriots—had set up accounts on Bluesky, started posting, and were building audiences. And then the league office stepped in and told them to shut it all down.</p><blockquote><p><em>Initially, multiple NFL teams, including the New England Patriots, had accounts on Bluesky to communicate with fans….</em></p><p><em>As alleged, however, the NFL later instructed its member teams to delete their Bluesky accounts. But for this instruction, at least some NFL teams would use Bluesky. The Patriots’ vice president of content, Fred Kirsch, for example, has stated: “Whenever the league gives us the green light[,] we’ll get back on Bluesky.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Yes, the (Super Bowl-losing) Patriots’ VP of content is publicly saying his team  to be on Bluesky and is just waiting for the league to  them. This wasn’t a case of teams being uninterested. Teams saw the audience there, set up shop, and were actively communicating with fans—and the NFL made them stop.</p><p>So the NFL has essentially decided that when it comes to the kind of real-time updates that fans actually care about, X is the only approved outlet. Everything else is locked out.</p><p>This is “broadcast-brain” thinking applied to the internet, and it’s spectacularly dumb.</p><p>The NFL is treating social media platforms the way it treats regional sports networks or its Sunday Ticket package: as exclusive territories to be carved up and sold to the highest bidder. In the television world, that model makes a certain kind of sense—there’s a limited amount of spectrum, a limited number of cable channels, and that scarcity creates value. But social media doesn’t work that way. There’s no scarcity. Posting an injury report on Bluesky doesn’t  it from X. Cross-posting is literally free. The entire point of social media for a brand is to be everywhere your audience is.</p><p>And the audience, increasingly, is on Bluesky. As <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/nfl-bluesky-great-why-how-to-join\">Mashable noted last year</a> heading into the season, the NFL community on Bluesky had already hit a kind of critical mass:</p><blockquote><p><em>You need the presence and regular posting of big names to legitimize a platform. It certainly helped that folks like Kimes and a</em><a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/dannyheifetz.bsky.social\"></a><a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/dannybkelly.bsky.social\"></a><a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/craighorlbeck.bsky.social\"></a><a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/sheilkapadia.bsky.social\"></a><a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/diantelee.bsky.social\"></a><em>at popular sports sites like The Ringer made Bluesky home. And last season it felt like Bluesky hit terminal velocity, where enough people joined that you could fully exit to the site for football content. And with the migration of the professionals, the shitposters naturally came along, too. Because that’s where the discussion was happening. There is genuine, easy-to-find, fun NFL talk on Bluesky with minimal interruptions from, say,</em><a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/x-threatened-lawsuits-to-pressure-advertisers\"></a><a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/bluesky-half-a-million-new-users-after-x-twitter-block-change\"></a></p></blockquote><p>That’s a real community. A vibrant, engaged community of exactly the kind of hardcore football fans that the NFL should be desperate to cultivate. These are, as Mashable noted, the “ball knowers.” They’ve moved to Bluesky because, well, X kind of sucks now for following sports. As Mashable also noted:</p><blockquote><p><em>Bluesky does have a leg-up in some areas — Elon Musk’s site recently has proven unreliable for NFL fans. The</em><a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/x-twitter-down-crash\"><em>site crashed the morning free agency launched</em></a><em>, which is one of the most important days for NFL social media. And the sports tab — which used to be an easy, fun way to follow games in the Twitter days —</em><a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/twitter-sports-tab-issues-problems\"><em>degraded into near uselessness</em></a><em>years ago. And, in general, X has morphed with Musk’s image, which is focused</em><a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/grok-4-launched\"></a><em>and politics — not things like following football. Of course you can still follow the NFL on X, but it does involve wading through more junk than it used to. Bluesky offers an interesting alternative in that regard.</em></p></blockquote><p>So the most engaged, most knowledgeable football community has moved to Bluesky. The teams themselves  to be on Bluesky. And the NFL’s response to all of this is… to ban its teams from showing up.</p><p>It’s the digital equivalent of a local blackout (something <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2009/08/31/nfl-doesnt-get-it-blocking-fans-doesnt-make-them-like-teams-any-more/\">we’ve been calling out</a> for well over a decade)—punishing your most dedicated fans because of some deal you cut with a middleman in an effort to create an artificial and unnecessary scarcity.</p><p>Meanwhile, the platform the NFL is propping up with this exclusivity arrangement is one where fans who tuned in for the Super Bowl halftime show got to watch a significant chunk of the X user base have a <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2026/02/09/us-news/bad-bunny-slammed-for-controversial-super-bowl-halftime-show-decision-that-encourages-division/\">full-blown racist meltdown over Bad Bunny performing</a>. The NFL specifically chose Bad Bunny to appeal to a broader, more global audience—and the audience that actually appreciated the choice? They were on Bluesky where there was an overwhelming wave of support for the performance. The league is betting its real-time presence on the platform where its expansion strategy gets shouted down, while blocking teams from the one where those new fans are actually showing up.</p><p>This kind of control-freakery from the NFL shouldn’t surprise anyone who has followed the league’s behavior over the years. This is the same organization that has spent decades <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2026/02/06/reminder-dont-believe-the-nfls-lies-about-its-super-bowl-trademarks/\">aggressively lying to bars, restaurants, and small businesses</a> about the scope of its “Super Bowl” trademarks, sending threatening letters suggesting you can’t even  “Super Bowl” in an ad without a license—something that has never actually been true.</p><p>The NFL’s institutional DNA is “control equals value,” and they apply that logic to everything, from what a church can call its viewing party to which social media apps their teams are permitted to use.</p><p>The problem is that control-based thinking only works when you actually  control the ecosystem. You can (sort of) control which networks broadcast your games. You can control which streaming service gets Sunday Ticket. You cannot control where fans choose to talk about football on the internet. The conversation is going to happen whether the NFL’s official accounts are there or not. The only question is whether the league’s teams get to participate in it.</p><p>Any organization whose core business depends on fan engagement should be finding fans where they are, not herding them onto a single platform because you cut an exclusivity deal. Especially when that platform is increasingly known for being a hellscape of AI slop, political rage, and engagement-bait, while the platform you’re blocking your teams from is the one where people are actually talking about your product with genuine enthusiasm.</p><p>The NFL generates billions in revenue. And yet, when it comes to social media strategy, it’s stuck in a 2005 mindset. That’s not how any of this works anymore.</p><p>Someone at NFL HQ needs to understand that when your most passionate fans have moved to a new platform and your own teams are begging for permission to follow them there, the smart play is to let them go.</p>",

CNBC reports: The company, which in July signed a $200 million contract with Pentagon, wants assurances that the Defense Department will not use its AI models will not be used for fully autonomous weapons or mass domestic surveillance of Americans. The Pentagon had set a deadline of 5:01 p.m. ET Friday for Anthropic to agree to its demands to allow the Pentagon to use the technology for all lawful purposes. If Anthropic did not meet that deadline, Pete Hegseth threatened to label the company a \"supply chain risk\" or force it to comply by invoking the Defense Production Act.\n \n\"The Leftwing nut jobs at Anthropic have made a DISASTROUS MISTAKE trying to STRONG-ARM the Department of War, and force them to obey their Terms of Service instead of our Constitution,\" Trump said in a post on Truth Social. \"Their selfishness is putting AMERICAN LIVES at risk, our Troops in danger, and our National Security in JEOPARDY.\"\n \n\"Therefore, I am directing EVERY Federal Agency in the United States Government to IMMEDIATELY CEASE all use of Anthropic's technology,\" Trump wrote. \"We don't need it, we don't want it, and will not do business with them again! There will be a Six Month phase out period for Agencies like the Department of War who are using Anthropic's products, at various levels,\" Trump said. On Friday, OpenAI said it would also draw the same red lines as Anthropic: no AI for mass surveillance or autonomous lethal weapons.",

It turned out the drone belonged to Customs and Border Protection, lawmakers said. The case of mistaken identity prompted the Federal Aviation Administration to close additional airspace around Fort Hancock, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) southeast of El Paso. The military is required to formally notify the FAA when it takes any counter-drone action inside U.S. airspace.\n \nIt was the second time in two weeks that a laser was fired in the area. The last time it was CBP that used the weapon and nothing was hit. That incident occurred near Fort Bliss and prompted the FAA to shut down air traffic at El Paso airport and the surrounding area. This time, the closure was smaller and commercial flights were not affected. The FAA, CBP and the Pentagon confirmed the incident in a joint statement, saying the military \"employed counter-unmanned aircraft system authorities to mitigate a seemingly threatening unmanned aerial system operating within military airspace.\"\n \n\"At President Trump's direction, the Department of War, FAA, and Customs and Border Patrol are working together in an unprecedented fashion to mitigate drone threats by Mexican cartels and foreign terrorist organizations at the U.S.-Mexico Border,\" the statement said. The report notes that 27,000 drones were detected within 1,600 feet of the southern border in the last six months of 2024.\n \nIllinois Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, the ranking member on the Senate's Aviation Subcommittee, is calling for an independent investigation to look into the matter. \"The Trump administration's incompetence continues to cause chaos in our skies,\" Duckworth said.",

The next step is preparing them to do their jobs. Ridding the nation of migrants is Job #1 here in America at the moment. But it’s a job too important to be done well by fully trained ICE officers. Quantity over quality is the name of the game, as former ICE trainer Ryan Schwank — who only resigned  — told Congress. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2026/02/23/former-ice-instructor-says-agency-slashed-training-new-officers/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2026/02/23/former-ice-instructor-says-agency-slashed-training-new-officers/\">Here’s the Washington Post with the details</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>[S]chwank… told congressional Democrats at a hearing that the agency eliminated 240 hours of “vital classes” from a mandatory 580-hour training program, including instruction about the legal boundaries for the use of force, how to safely handle firearms, and the proper way to detain and arrest immigrants.</em></p></blockquote><p>Seems like a pretty sweet deal for new hires. Not only do they get a hefty signing bonus, but they don’t have to go through 40% of the training. Giving people guns and the power to deprive others of their lives and liberties should mean giving them the best possible training you can in hopes of heading off… well… pretty much everything we’ve been seeing lately during Trump’s anti-blue state/city surges. </p><p>Certainly, the administration is already doing everything it can to undercut the credibility of its now-former employee. But it’s not going to work unless you’re an idiot who prefers nigh-incoherent MAGA invective to actual facts. You see, Schwank didn’t just bring  to this hearing. He also brought receipts. </p><blockquote><p><em>Ahead of the hearing, Schwank provided a joint panel of House and Senate Democrats copies of internal ICE documents that he said show the extent of the cuts. The documents indicated that the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers in Glynco, Georgia, shortened its training program from 72 days to 42 days.</em></p></blockquote><p>Except that’s not what Todd Lyons said to Congress when he was asked to testify following two murders committed by federal officers in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Lyons claimed nothing important had been cut. He also said this, which is directly contradicted by the documents Schwank gave to lawmakers: </p><blockquote><p><em>In a statement Monday, the Department of Homeland Security said ICE recruits receive 56 days of training before beginning their assignments…</em></p></blockquote><p>Lyons went on to say that an “average” of 28 days of additional “on the job training” occurs after that. But even if you might believe Lyons is stacking his apples against the apples in ICE’s internal documents to come up with 84 days of training, you’re miscounting apples the same way Lyons is. OJT is post-assignment. Even if you choose to believe Lyons more than the documents his own agency generated, officers are still being put on the street two weeks earlier than they used to be. </p><p>The lies persist, of course. The statement provided to the Post says something else entirely, which is also contradicted by the documents and statements made by Schwank.</p><blockquote><p><em>“No training hours have been cut. Our officers receive extensive firearm training, are taught de-escalation tactics, and receive Fourth and Fifth Amendment comprehensive instruction,” said Lauren Bis, a spokeswoman for the department.</em></p></blockquote><p>But training hours  been cut. And the rest of it is pure horseshit, especially the part about training new hires about the Fourth and Fifth Amendment. Schwank’s testimony noted that he was asked to review an internal memo signed by Lyons that claimed — untruthfully — that ICE officers <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2026/01/22/since-last-may-ice-officers-have-been-told-they-dont-need-warrants-to-enter-homes/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2026/01/22/since-last-may-ice-officers-have-been-told-they-dont-need-warrants-to-enter-homes/\">can enter people’s homes</a> using only a self-issued administrative warrant. </p><p>Other rights were similarly glossed over. In fact, some of them are ignored completely. </p><blockquote><p><em>[Schwank] also said that a two-hour class on the rights of protesters was shortened into 10 minutes of discussion during a lecture on “the concept of seizure.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Nice. That’s the way to do it. Goodbye, First Amendment. Instead, here’s 10 minutes of ICE’s interpretative dance: “The Fourth Amendment, And What It Doesn’t Mean To Us.” </p><p>Everyone knew that once the cattle call began, ICE would be swarmed with opportunists who saw a great way to combine their bigotry and violence tendencies with a career — however short-lived — in public service. A steady paycheck, and all the government asked was that you show up at least 40% of the time during training. </p><p>This horde (actual number unknown) is being pushed through the doors towards their on-the-job-training, armed with little more than their masks, their guns, and some very comprehensive incorrecting of their constitutional notions.</p><p>Of course, none of this will matter to the people running ICE.

      "content": "An anonymous reader shares a column: I'm going to take the diplomatic hat off here and say with brutal honesty: basically everybody in the music business hates Spotify except for the people who work there. It's a platform that sucks artists for everything they have, it actively prevents community building, and, despite all of that, the platform still struggles to maintain a healthy profit margin. \n\nThe streaming business model is fundamentally broken. And eventually, its demise will become more and more obvious to recognize. I'll break down exactly why the DSP era is coming to a grinding halt, why the major labels are quietly terrified, and why the artists who don't pivot now are going to go down with the ship. \n\n[...] Jimmy Iovine put it bluntly: \"The streaming services have a bad situation, there's no margins, they're not making any money.\" This model only works for Apple, Amazon, and Google, because they don't need their music platforms to be wildly profitable. Amazon uses music as a loss-leader to keep you paying for Prime. Apple uses it to sell $1,000 iPhones. As for Spotify, or any standalone music streaming company, they're kind of screwed. And guess what -- when the platform's margins are structurally squeezed, guess who gets squeezed first? The artists. \n\n[...] What if Jimmy is right? If the DSPs are \"minutes away from obsolete,\" what replaces them? Well, I'm not sure the DSPs are going to disappear overnight, but if you're an artist or a manager trying to sustain yourself in this evolving music economy, the answer is direct ownership. The artists who will survive the next five years are the ones who are quietly shifting their focus away from the \"ATM Machine.\" \n\nThey are building their own cultural hangars. They are capturing phone numbers on Laylo. They are driving fans to private Discord servers. They are focusing on ARPF (Average Revenue Per Fan) through high-margin merch, vinyl, and hard tickets, rather than begging for fractions of a penny from a playlist placement. We are witnessing the death of the \"Mass Audience\" and the birth of the \"Micro-Community.\"",

The rules, applied via spectrum acquisition and merger conditions after years of activism, required that Verizon unlock your phone within 60 days after purchase so you could easily switch to competitors.</p><p>Verizon, as we’ve long established, hates competition, and early last year immediately got to work lobbying the Trump administration to destroy the rules (falsely) claiming, without evidence, that the modest phone unlocking requirements were a boon to criminals and scammers. </p><p>The pay-to-play Trump administration quickly agreed, killed the rules, and shortly thereafter Verizon started telling wireless customers on its many prepaid phone brands (including Tracfone)&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/verizon-starts-requiring-365-days-of-paid-service-before-it-will-unlock-phones/\">they had to wait a year before switching phones</a>&nbsp;after purchasing one from Verizon:</p><blockquote><p><em>“While a locked phone is tied to the network of one carrier, an unlocked phone can be switched to another carrier if the device is compatible with the other carrier’s network. But the new TracFone unlocking policy is stringent, requiring customers to pay for a full year of service before they can get a phone unlocked.”</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><em>“Payments made over the phone also trigger a 35-day waiting period, as do payments made at Verizon Authorized Retailers. Getting an immediate unlock apparently requires paying off the device plan at a Verizon corporate store.”</em></p></blockquote><p>So first, they implemented the most draconian restrictions on its , who tend to be lower income and the most impacted from high prices. Now they’re starting to push restrictions onto their more lucrative postpaid (month to month) customers. </p><p>Verizon insists (falsely) that these restrictions are necessary to “prevent fraud,” but the real goal is to increase friction when <strong><em>it comes to switching to a competitor</em></strong>. They don’t want the press to outright <em>acknowledge this is anti-competitive in coverage</em>, so they’re engaging in the slow-boiling frog approach that just <em>steadily makes porting your phone out steadily more difficult and annoying</em>. </p><p>These unlocking conditions were broadly popular, served the public interest, and <strong>took decades of activism and reform advocacy to pass</strong>. They ensured that it was easier for consumers to switch between our ever-consolidating, anti-competitive wireless phone giants (consolidation directly made possible by the <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2023/10/17/everything-t-mobile-sprint-merger-critics-predicted-has-come-true/\">Trump administration’s past rubber stamping of shitty telecom mergers</a>). </p><p>Verizon lobbied the FCC by repeatedly lying, without evidence, that these conditions&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2026/01/16/trump-fcc-helps-verizon-make-it-harder-for-you-to-switch-wireless-carriers/\">resulted in a wave of black market phone thefts</a>. FCC boss Brendan Carr, ever the industry lackey, parroted the lies in his subsequent industry-friendly rulings. You know, to <em>make America great again via “populism</em>” or whatever. </p><p>Verizon (and Carr) know that there’s a lot going on and the mundanity of a subject like phone unlocking won’t get much attention in the press. Given that the Trump administration <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/04/23/5th-circuit-obediently-lets-att-off-the-hook-for-major-location-data-privacy-violations/\">has largely lobotomized regulatory independence</a> (at Verizon’s request), there’s very little chance Verizon will see any future accountability, but it’s  that they’re proceeding cautiously just in case.</p>",

From a report: The abrupt shift in strategy was laid out by the space agency's recently confirmed administrator, Jared Isaacman. Announcing the changes on Friday, he said that Nasa would introduce at least one new moon flight before attempting to put humans back on the lunar surface for the first time in more than half a century, in 2028. \n\nThe new, more incremental approach would give the Nasa team a chance to test flight and refine its technology. As part of the changes, the Artemis II mission to fly humans around the moon this year, without landing, would also be pushed back from its latest scheduled launch on 6 March to 1 April at the earliest. \n\n\"Everybody agrees this is the only way forward,\" Isaacman told reporters at a news conference. \"I know this is how Nasa changed the world, and this is how Nasa is going to do it again.\"",

It’s logic. That’s how school works:</p><p><strong>You study the material → You pass the test → You get the diploma → You’re now “qualified.”</strong></p><p>Same with personal growth: \\n <strong>You read the book → You gain insight → You apply the advice → You slowly turn into someone new.</strong></p><p>This model feels safe because it’s orderly. We are taught to follow step one, then step two, then step three until you get a result.</p><p>Cause → effect. \\n Time → progress.</p><p>So when change doesn’t happen, the conclusion is obvious: \\n “I must not have learned enough.” \\n “I’m not applying it consistently.” \\n “I need more discipline.”</p><p>That’s the logic everyone operates under.</p><p>Including you. \\n Including me.</p><p>Let’s get something straight: this model actually works. You didn’t misunderstand it. You didn’t apply it wrong. You executed it&nbsp;.</p><p>In fact, it gave the results that you have today:</p><ul><li>You became “successful” on paper.</li><li>You earned competence, status, and proof that you’re not an idiot.</li></ul><p>Which is exactly why this is so confusing. Because the model&nbsp;.</p><p>And yet…there’s this exhausting, permanent tension that never really goes away.</p><p>You can see the version of yourself you’re capable of being, but you’re not becoming it.</p><p>And that’s what makes this unbearable. In fact, I would argue that because of your awareness,&nbsp;<strong>knowing you’re meant for more is actually the most painful place to be.</strong>&nbsp;It was for me.</p><p>That’s what happens when&nbsp;<strong>learning outpaces embodiment</strong>.</p><p>Here’s the truth about change. It’s a biological game, not a motivational one. And biology has rules (constraints that don’t give a shit about your intentions or discipline). If you want to collapse the gap between knowing and becoming, you have to play by them, so let’s break it down.</p><h2><strong>The actual laws of change</strong></h2><p>These aren’t feel-good principles or “what worked for me” stories. They’re hardwired constraints on how your nervous system updates identity.</p><p>If you ignore them, and you stay stuck. When you finally respect them, change accelerates.</p><p>: Identity isn’t updated by logic or information alone. Your prefrontal cortex can understand a new version of you all day long.</p><p>But the nervous system (The one that controls your body’s felt reality) only rewires through repeated emotional and sensory experience.</p><p>It doesn’t care about abstract insights. It responds to what feels familiar, safe, and present-tense.</p><p>: The nervous system doesn’t fully distinguish between imagined and lived experience. When you vividly rehearse a future state with elevated emotion, it registers as “this is happening now.”</p><p>Neural pathways fire identically, as shown in fMRI studies on athletes using visualization. Mental practice alone strengthens the same brain regions and even boosts muscle performance without physical movement.</p><p>Familiarity builds. \\n Safety locks in. \\n Identity shifts.</p><p>: The brain ignores future-tense intentions. \\n It’s built for survival in the present. \\n Promises like “I’ll be that person one day” get dismissed as irrelevant. \\n No update happens. \\n The body stays braced, attention narrows, and old patterns persist.</p><p>That’s it. \\n No mysticism. \\n Just biology: embodiment over intellect, present signals over future plans, emotional repetition over one-off epiphanies.</p><h3><strong>Why the way you were taught violates those laws</strong></h3><p>You weren’t taught wrong on purpose. \\n The linear model: learn → understand → act → become—makes sense on paper. \\n It’s how we’re wired to think: cause leads to effect, effort over time equals results.</p><p>But here’s the fracture: That system is incompatible with how identity&nbsp;&nbsp;updates, because it operates in future-tense logic, while your nervous system is locked in&nbsp;.</p><p>Linear change assumes: \\n – Identity updates gradually, after enough time and action. \\n – You “work toward” a future version of yourself. \\n – The gap closes “eventually,” once you’ve earned it.</p><p>But biology doesn’t work that way. \\n Your nervous system doesn’t live in timelines. \\n It doesn’t understand “one day.” \\n It only registers what’s safe and familiar.</p><p>So when you tell yourself: \\n “I’ll be confident later.” \\n “I’ll act like that person when I get there.” \\n “I’m not that version yet.”</p><p>You’re signaling: “We’re still the old identity. No need to change.” \\n And it listens. \\n Cortisol stays up. \\n The brakes stay on. \\n The gap widens.</p><p>That’s why respecting linear time keeps you trapped. \\n Not because time is the enemy. \\n But because your biology wasn’t designed to evolve that way.</p><p>This should now answer your question:&nbsp;<strong>If you already know who you want to become… why haven’t you become them yet?</strong></p><h3><strong>How we actually need to treat change</strong></h3><p>If the laws demand present-tense embodiment, we need a system that delivers it. \\n Not gradual effort toward a distant future. \\n Not more information stacked on old identity files.</p><p>We need to hack the nervous system into believing the new you is already real—now. \\n Through vivid, emotional rehearsal that blurs imagined and lived. \\n Through small, aligned actions that reinforce familiarity in the present. \\n Through evidence that confirms the shift is happening, not waiting to happen.</p><p>That’s not a tactic. \\n It’s alignment with biology.</p><p>And ignoring biology is exactly why you're still not living the life you want right now.</p><p>\\n This is the &nbsp;way to collapse the gap without wasting years on “progress” that never sticks.</p><h2><strong>The Protocol I promised you</strong></h2><p>I didn’t set out to invent anything fancy. I was just exhausted from knowing everything and changing nothing. I was the guy who could explain every pattern, name every mechanism, map the perfect future… and still wake up in the same smaller life every day.</p><p>Once I understood the laws, there were only two options: keep suffering intelligently…or build a system that forced embodiment:</p><p>Present-tense embodiment. \\n Emotional rehearsal. \\n Evidence that the shift is real.</p><p>For years, nothing moved. Under 8k followers total. Newsletter stuck below 900. Random book sales. No momentum.</p><p>Within 2 months of using the protocol:</p><ul><li>100k followers across platforms</li><li>25k newsletter subscribers</li><li>Publishers reaching out instead of me chasing.</li></ul><p>I’m saying it because it’s the only way to prove this isn’t theory for me.&nbsp;<strong>This is what happened when I finally gave my nervous system present-tense evidence instead of future promises.</strong></p><p>Everything circled back to those two hills I opened with.</p><ul><li>Most people don’t need therapy. They need to hear themselves think, and writing is how you do that.</li><li>The smartest, most self-aware people are usually the most trapped…because awareness without embodiment is just sophisticated suffering.</li></ul><p>I’d spent years in sophisticated suffering that you are currently experiencing: Explaining, understanding, naming every mechanism, but never embodying.</p><p>Then I built something that forced embodiment. \\n And the suffering ended. \\n The gap collapsed.</p><p>That something is the&nbsp;, because you log both identity (the future you) and evidence (real-world confirmation), like double entry accounting, but for reality.</p><p><strong>It's a daily protocol that places you between the present and the future, then forces you to pull both toward the center.</strong>&nbsp;On paper. Every day.

From a report: The Chinese law enforcement official used ChatGPT like a diary to document the alleged covert campaign of suppression, OpenAI said. In one instance, Chinese operators allegedly disguised themselves as US immigration officials to warn a US-based Chinese dissident that their public statements had supposedly broken the law, according to the ChatGPT user. In another case, they describe an effort to use forged documents from a US county court to try to get a Chinese dissident's social media account taken down. \n\nThe report offers one of the most vivid examples yet of how authoritarian regimes can use AI tools to document their censorship efforts. The influence operation appeared to involve hundreds of Chinese operators and thousands of fake online accounts on various social media platforms, according to OpenAI.",

In terms of journalistic content, and in this particular instance, reviews, review aggregator Metacritic has taken a firm stance on content published and submitted to their platform, that have been generated by artificial intelligence in some way. \n\nIn a statement by co-founder Marc Doyle, sent to Gamereactor, he says this: \"Metacritic has been a reputable review source for a quarter century and has maintained a rigorous vetting process when adding new publications to our slate of critics. However, in certain instances such as a publication being sold or a writing staff having turned over, problems can arise such as plagiarism, theft, or other forms of fraud including AI-generated reviews. Metacritic's policy is to never include an AI-generated critic review on Metacritic and if we discover that one has been posted, we'll remove it immediately and sever ties with that publication indefinitely pending a thorough investigation.\" \n\nSo, what is this about specifically? Well, it's probably a sound guess, that this pertains to Videogamer's review of Resident Evil 9: Requiem, which was removed from the platform after a barrage of comments accusing the review of being AI-written, and for the author of being made up.",

      "content": "<p>If you run a company whose entire value proposition is the ability to see patterns, predict outcomes, and connect dots that others miss, you’d think someone in the building might have flagged that suing a small independent magazine over unflattering-but-accurate reporting would only guarantee that millions more people read it.</p><p>Palantir Technologies, the infamous surveillance and data analytics giant chaired by Peter Thiel, has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/434b6d98-83d1-4ba1-a929-150341bcaea4\">filed a lawsuit against Republik</a>, a small Swiss online magazine, over a pair of investigative articles published in December. The articles, produced in collaboration with the investigative collective WAV, detailed <a href=\"https://www.republik.ch/2026/02/18/how-tenaciously-palantir-courted-switzerland?utm_campaign=cm&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=palantir-en\">a years-long, multi-ministry charm offensive by Palantir</a> to sell its software to Swiss federal authorities. The campaign was, by all accounts, a comprehensive failure. Swiss agencies rejected Palantir at least nine times, with concerns ranging from data sovereignty to reputational risk to the simple fact that nobody needed the product.</p><p>The reporting was based on documents obtained through 59 freedom of information requests filed with Swiss federal agencies. The key finding was an internal Swiss Armed Forces report that concluded Palantir’s software posed unacceptable risks because sensitive military data could potentially be accessed by U.S. government intelligence agencies. As the Republik article details:</p><blockquote><p><em>The authors of the report state that using Palantir’s software would increase dependence on a U.S. provider. It also poses the risk of losing data sovereignty and thereby national sovereignty.</em></p><p><em>Above all, however, the army’s staff experts say it remains unclear who has access to data shared with Palantir. The following sentence from the Swiss Army report is particularly relevant: “Palantir is a U.S.-based company, which means there is a possibility that sensitive data could be accessed by the US government and intelligence services.”</em></p></blockquote><p>As if it’s any sort of surprise that European governments are wary of betting on US tech companies with close ties to the US government. It’s not like reports of US spies <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2014/05/19/cisco-goes-straight-to-president-to-complain-about-nsa-intercepting-its-hardware/\">co-opting US tech companies</a> for surveillance efforts haven’t been <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2013/09/03/att-has-employees-embedded-govt-providing-near-realtime-searches-nearly-every-phone-call/\">front page news</a> over the past twenty years. And now,  administration—with its willingness to antagonize everyone in Europe, and its close ties to Palantir and Thiel? It’s no freaking wonder that the Swiss government was like “yo, maybe pass.”</p><p>So how does a sophisticated data intelligence company respond to well-sourced investigative journalism based on official government documents?</p><p>By suing the journalists, of course.</p><p>But here’s the thing that makes this even more absurd: Palantir isn’t even claiming the articles are false. The company isn’t suing for defamation. It isn’t seeking damages. Instead, it’s invoking a Swiss “right of reply” statute, alleging that Republik didn’t give the company a sufficient opportunity to respond. Palantir wants the court to force the magazine to publish lengthy counter-statements to each article.</p><blockquote><p><em>Palantir’s lawsuit, filed in January, is not seeking damages or making libel claims against Republik, but instead alleges that the company was not given sufficient right to reply under Swiss media law. The company objects to Republik’s presentation of the public documents and believes its right to reply has been wrongfully denied.</em></p><p><em>Republik’s managing director Katharina Hemmer said Palantir had wanted the magazine to publish a very lengthy counterstatement to each article. Republik believed the proposed statements did not fairly address or rebut the reporting, she said, adding that the magazine stands by its reporting.</em></p></blockquote><p>To which I say: good. Because Palantir’s demand here is absurd. Oh boo-fucking-hoo, the big defense contractor didn’t like the coverage? Pull on your big boy pants and get over it. Switzerland’s right of reply law exists so people can correct factual errors, not so corporations can force publications to run PR copy because they didn’t like the tone of accurate, document-based reporting.</p><p>And it’s worth noting: Palantir has already used other avenues to respond. The company published <a href=\"https://blog.palantir.com/korrektur-wie-das-online-magazin-die-republik-einen-regierungsbericht-zu-palantir-verdrehte-9a1b399ae255\">a blog post</a> complaining that the Republik article “paints a false and misleading picture” and “hinders important discussions about the modernization of European software.” They’ve got the platform. If Palantir wants to push back on the story, they have many methods of doing so. Hell, they can do so on X any time they want—on what Musk and company like to call the global town square for free speech.</p><p>But that’s apparently not enough. Instead, a multibillion-dollar American defense and intelligence contractor is hauling a small independent Swiss magazine into court, not because anything the magazine published was wrong, but because Palantir wants to  the publication to run its talking points under legal compulsion.</p><p>Compelled speech isn’t free speech, guys. And this is nothing more than a blatant intimidation campaign to frighten away reporters from reporting the truth about Palantir.</p><p>The European Federation of Journalists has <a href=\"https://europeanjournalists.org/blog/2026/02/17/switzerland-us-analytics-firm-takes-republik-magazine-to-court/\">called this exactly what it is</a>: a SLAPP suit—a strategic lawsuit against public participation, designed to use the weight and cost of litigation to intimidate and punish journalists for doing their jobs.</p><blockquote><p><em>“The investigation conducted by WAV and Republik into Palantir is largely based on official documents that journalists were able to access thanks to Swiss freedom of information law,” notes EFJ President Maja Sever. “The legal action brought by this powerful multinational firm against a small Swiss media start-up is, in our view, an attempt at intimidation aimed at discouraging any critical analysis of Palantir’s activities.”</em></p></blockquote><p>And in case you didn’t catch the irony: the Swiss military rejected Palantir in part because of fears about a heavy-handed American entity with uncomfortably close ties to U.S. intelligence. Palantir’s response to the reporting of that rejection? Behave like a heavy-handed American entity trying to bully a small foreign publication into submission. If anyone at Palantir had run this decision through their own pattern-recognition software, you’d hope a few red flags would have popped up.</p><p>Meanwhile, the lawsuit has done exactly what anyone with a passing familiarity with the Streisand Effect could have predicted. The original Republik articles were about the Swiss government politely but firmly declining Palantir’s advances—an embarrassing but relatively contained story.</p><p>Now, thanks to the lawsuit, the story has gone international. The Financial Times is covering it. The European Federation of Journalists is covering it. A UK member of parliament has already cited the Republik investigation during a debate on British defense contracts with Palantir, using the story to suggest that the British government “pivot away” from Palantir.</p><p>It paints a picture of a company that spent seven years working every angle to get Swiss federal agencies to buy its products—approaching the Federal Chancellery during COVID, pitching the Federal Office of Public Health on contact tracing, presenting anti-money laundering software to financial regulators, making repeated runs at the military—and getting turned away at every door. Sometimes embarrassingly, such as the Federal Statistical Office director apparently just ignoring Palantir’s outreach entirely.</p><p>For a company that brags about its ability to “optimize the kill chain” and whose CEO once told investors that “Palantir is here to disrupt… and, when it’s necessary, to scare our enemies and occasionally kill them,” getting politely rejected by the Swiss statistical office has to sting a little.</p><p>But suing the journalists who reported on it? When the entire basis of your lawsuit is “we want you to publish our talking points” rather than “anything you published was wrong,” it makes pretty clear you don’t actually have a substantive response to the reporting. If Palantir thinks the picture is false, the remedy is to demonstrate that the documents are wrong—not to drag a small magazine through expensive litigation until it capitulates or goes broke.</p><p>Seriously, how fucking fragile are the egos in the Palantir executive suite that they can’t handle a bit of mildly embarrassing reporting? Grow up.</p><p>A Zurich court is expected to rule on the case in March. Whatever the outcome, Palantir has already lost the only contest that matters: the one for public perception. For a company that sells the ability to see around corners, they apparently never thought to search “The Streisand Effect.”</p>",

      "content": "<p>Earlier this week in our HackerNoon editorial meeting, we noticed an interesting pattern. We were reviewing the top-performing stories from the past two weeks, and couldn’t help but notice an interesting trend.</p><p>\\\nAre you seeing what we’re seeing? Here’s a hint—the leaderboard was full of specific, lived experiences. We’ve got an artist talking about making digital art in the age of AI; an observation on why people were panic-buying Mac minis; a PSA on online phishing scams; and a new, well-thought-out social media strategy.</p><p>\\\nThis sparked a realization that makes perfect sense in hindsight: <strong>Genuine human experience is the way to go.</strong></p><p>\\\nScroll through tech blogs today, and you’ll notice many similarities: clear, competent, and often a little interchangeable. With so much polished writing available, what tends to stand out now isn’t more shine, but specificity: the odd detail, the honest constraint, the lesson learned the hard way.</p><p>\\\nThe bar for clean, professional writing is higher than ever - which is a  thing, btw; but in today’s world, in order to differentiate, connect, and earn attention, concrete examples, candid tradeoffs, and seemingly all kinds of small imperfections that signal there’s a person behind the words are increasingly important.</p><p>Modern audiences have adapted quickly to the AI era. <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/are-you-good-at-spotting-ai-generated-content-online\">A recent poll on HackerNoon</a> showed that around  of respondents are somewhat confident in their ability to spot AI-generated content.</p><p>\\\nOf course, this confidence is only based on a gut feeling when something reads a little too smoothly, or has what people call “AI giveaways”. However, this vigilance has created a fascinating authenticity paradox for writers and marketers. Sometimes, perfectly structured sentences and high vocabulary now trigger suspicion rather than establishing authority.​</p><p>\\\nWhen a reader encounters a paragraph that flows without any jagged edges, strong opinions, or a distinct voice, their brain files it away as generic content rather than meaningful communication. To prove you are genuinely human, you need to showcase the elements of your work that cannot be automated.</p><blockquote><p><strong>It’s the Human Proof of Work.</strong></p></blockquote><p>\\\nThis does not mean publishing sloppy or unedited drafts. It means leaning into specific details: acknowledging a slightly offbeat workflow, admitting that a product roadmap changed because a previous assumption was wrong, or sharing the messy reality of a project.​</p><h3>So, Where Do You Find These Genuine, Imperfect Ideas?</h3><p>The editorial ethos we often discuss at HackerNoon highlights that writers waste hours overthinking the perfect topic instead of simply documenting reality. Your next high-performing article is likely hiding in a recent Slack debate, a code deployment that required a hotfix, or a frustrating client call that got you thinking.​</p><p>\\\nBy tapping into these unfiltered moments of daily friction, you generate inherently unique content that AI cannot pull from a training dataset. When you share lessons from your own experiences, you bypass the reader's critical filter we mentioned above. You position your brand as a battle-tested guide who has actually navigated the practical challenges of the industry.</p><h2>Marketing and Retention Through Authentic Connection</h2><p>This pivot toward genuine human connection is more than just an editorial preference. Authenticity is rapidly becoming a primary driver of long-term business retention.​</p><p>\\\nMany B2B brands currently find themselves stuck in a marketing uncanny valley. They publish heavily optimized pieces that sound vaguely human but lack the emotional resonance required to actually connect with a reader. These articles might successfully attract search traffic and earn a click, but they rarely earn a loyal customer.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Retention in any business is built on trust, and trust requires relatability.</strong></p></blockquote><p>\\\nIt’s simple: customers stick around because they feel they are buying into a philosophy and a team they understand, rather than just renting a software tool.</p><p>\\\nTreating your content's humanity as a core asset is a valuable tip that should always be taken to your advantage. The willingness to be vulnerable and own your operational realities creates a deep customer affinity. This affinity directly translates into a higher customer retention.</p><blockquote><p><strong>In a digital environment populated by perfect machines, writing like a flawed human might just be the best business strategy you have.</strong></p></blockquote><h2>Want to take this further?

If other leading firms like Google follow suit, this could massively complicate the Pentagon's efforts to replace Anthropic's Claude, which was the first model integrated into the military's most sensitive work. It would also be the first time the nation's top AI leaders have taken a collective stand about how the U.S. government can and can't use their technology. \n\nAltman made clear he still wants to strike a deal with the Pentagon that would allow ChatGPT to be used for sensitive military contexts. Despite the show of solidarity, such a deal could see OpenAI replace Anthropic if the Pentagon follows through with its plan to declare the latter a \"supply chain risk.\"",

It’s allowing gifters to choose third-party sellers for items, which could expose recipients’ delivery addresses to the gifter. The notice Amazon sent wishlist holders is a basic example of CYA messaging: Amazon can’t guarantee what a third party seller will do with your address once they have it, including giving it to a gifter for tracking purposes.</p><p>Sex workers first flagged this change on social media because many use wishlists as an easy way to accept gifts, tributes, tips, etc instead of or in addition to actual funds. This is important because payment processors are wildly hostile and actively discriminatory toward the adult industry, and having alternative ways to get paid is crucial if you’re debanked or banned from the usual payment processors. I think most use it in a supplementary fashion, though.</p>",

The move also comes as DHS and its various components purchase and deploy a wide range of surveillance technologies and demand sensitive information from tech companies to unmask people criticizing ICE.</p><p>“You and your underlings appear to be labeling untold numbers of people as ‘domestic terrorists’ or individuals of concern at will without evidence, operating wildly invasive spy tools to identify targets—and then using such labels as an excuse for yet more surveillance,” the letter, addressed to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, reads. The office of Rep. Bennie G. Thompson (D-MS), ranking member of the Committee on Homeland Security, shared a copy of the letter with 404 Media.</p><p>“This self-reinforcing spiral of civil liberties violations ratchets in only one direction: toward an authoritarian surveillance state that punishes dissent and inflicts state violence,” <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/27422493-20260227-letter-to-sec-noem-on-dhs-surveillance/?ref=404media.co\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the letter adds</a>.</p><div><div><b><strong>Do you work at DHS?

Those include how <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/27/us/alex-pretti-protesters-minneapolis-invs?ref=404media.co\"><u>DHS shared a memo with employees</u></a> in Minneapolis telling them to capture images, license plates, and other information about protestors “so we can capture it all in one consolidated form”; <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/elite-the-palantir-app-ice-uses-to-find-neighborhoods-to-raid/\"></a> that Palantir is working on a tool called ELITE for ICE that provides a confidence score on targets’ addresses; ICE’s purchase <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/inside-ices-tool-to-monitor-phones-in-entire-neighborhoods/\"><u>of smartphone location data</u></a>; how ICE agents told legal observers they were identifying them <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/30/technology/tech-ice-facial-recognition-palantir.html?ref=404media.co\"><u>with facial recognition technology</u></a>; and several more examples.</p><p>“The Department’s opaque, mass expansion of spy tools and framing of protesters, photographers, political opponents, and passersby as enemies of the state leans into people’s worst fears of a surveillance state. Your weaponization of DHS undercuts decades of effort to develop a Department that responsibly balances security with privacy and civil liberties protections and transparency,” the letter reads.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It then includes a list of demands for information from DHS. Many of them are about the legal regime behind those surveillance powers, and the technical infrastructure and policies related to them. One asks DHS for “Documentation of the Department’s definition of the term ‘domestic terrorist,’ a copy of the policies in place that permit Departmental designations of United States persons as a ‘domestic terrorist,’ and a description of the consequences of such a designation.”</p><p>“Your actions are abhorrent, blatantly unconstitutional, and corrosive to the functioning of a peaceful society. They cannot stand. Accountability is coming,” the letter adds.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Logging is the heartbeat of a production application. In the early days of a project, a simple&nbsp;&nbsp;tail is sufficient. But as your Symfony application scales to handle&nbsp;,&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;, “writing to a file” becomes a liability rather than an asset.</p><p>\\\nThe&nbsp;&nbsp;offers sophisticated tools to transform logs from simple text streams into structured, actionable observability data.</p><p>\\\nThis guide explores 10 advanced logging patterns that go beyond the defaults. We will use strict typing, PHP Attributes, and modern YAML configuration.</p><ul><li>&nbsp;(for alerting examples)</li></ul><h2>Scenation 1. The “Black Box” Recorder: FingersCrossed Handler</h2><p>You want detailed debug logs when an error occurs to understand the sequence of events leading up to it, but you can’t afford the disk I/O to log debug messages for every successful request in production.</p><p>\\\nThe&nbsp;&nbsp;buffers all logs in memory during the request. If the request finishes successfully, the buffer is discarded. If an error (or a specific threshold) is reached, the entire buffer (including previous debug logs) is flushed to the persistence handler.</p><p>config/packages/prod/monolog.yaml:</p><pre><code>monolog:\n    handlers:\n        main:\n            type: fingers_crossed\n            # The strategy: \"error\" means if an ERROR occurs, dump everything.\n            action_level: error\n            # Where to dump the logs if the threshold is met\n            handler: nested\n            # Optional: Keep a small buffer size to prevent memory leaks in long processes\n            buffer_size: 50\n        nested:\n            type: stream\n            path: \"%kernel.logs_dir%/%kernel.environment%.log\"\n            level: debug\n</code></pre><p>\\\nYou’ll get the forensic detail of debug-level logging exactly when you need it — during a crash — without filling your disk with noise during normal operations.</p><h2>Scenario 2. Segregated Channels: The “Payment” Log</h2><p>Your&nbsp;&nbsp;is a mix of Doctrine queries, router matching, and critical business logic. You need a dedicated file for financial transactions that can be audited separately.</p><p>\\\nCreate a custom Monolog Channel.</p><p>config/packages/monolog.yaml:</p><pre><code>monolog:\n    channels: ['payment'] # Register the channel\n\n    handlers:\n        payment:\n            type: stream\n            path: \"%kernel.logs_dir%/payment.log\"\n            level: info\n            channels: [\"payment\"] # Only listen to this channel\n\n        main:\n            type: stream\n            path: \"%kernel.logs_dir%/%kernel.environment%.log\"\n            level: debug\n            channels: [\"!payment\"] # Exclude payment logs from the main file\n</code></pre><p>Inject the logger specifically for this channel using the Target attribute (available since Symfony 5.3+).</p><pre><code>namespace App\\Command;\n\nuse Psr\\Log\\LoggerInterface;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Console\\Attribute\\AsCommand;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Console\\Command\\Command;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Console\\Input\\InputInterface;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Console\\Output\\OutputInterface;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\DependencyInjection\\Attribute\\Target;\n\n#[AsCommand(name: 'app:process-payments', description: 'Processes pending payments')]\nclass ProcessPaymentsCommand extends Command\n{\n    public function __construct(\n        #[Target('payment.logger')]\n        private readonly LoggerInterface $paymentLogger,\n        private readonly LoggerInterface $mainLogger\n    ) { parent::__construct(); }\n\n    protected function execute(InputInterface $input, OutputInterface $output): int\n    {\n        $this-&gt;mainLogger-&gt;info('Cron job app:process-payments started.');\n\n        $amounts = [10.50, 99.99, 45.00];\n        foreach ($amounts as $amount) {\n            $this-&gt;paymentLogger-&gt;info('Processing payment', ['amount' =&gt; $amount, 'status' =&gt; 'success']);\n        }\n\n        $this-&gt;mainLogger-&gt;info('Cron job finished.');\n        return Command::SUCCESS;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre><p>Run the Command. You will see&nbsp;&nbsp;created in&nbsp;&nbsp;containing only these specific entries.</p><h2>Scenario 3. Context Enrichment: The #[AsMonologProcessor] Attribute</h2><p>Logs are useless if you can’t correlate them to a specific user or request ID. You find yourself manually adding [‘user_id’ =&gt; $user-&gt;getId()] to every single log statement.</p><p>\\\nA global Processor can automatically inject context into every log record.</p><pre><code>namespace App\\Log;\n\nuse Monolog\\Attribute\\AsMonologProcessor;\nuse Monolog\\LogRecord;\n\n#[AsMonologProcessor]\nclass RequestContextProcessor\n{\n    public function __invoke(LogRecord $record): LogRecord\n    {\n        // Simulated context since CLI commands don't have HTTP Requests\n        $extra = [\n            'pid' =&gt; getmypid(),\n            'user' =&gt; get_current_user(),\n        ];\n\n        return $record-&gt;with(extra: array_merge($record-&gt;extra, $extra));\n    }\n}\n</code></pre><p>In&nbsp;,&nbsp;. We use&nbsp;&nbsp;to return a modified copy.</p><p>A developer accidentally logs a user object, dumping PII (Personally Identifiable Information) or credit card numbers into the logs, violating GDPR/PCI-DSS.</p><p>\\\nA specialized processor can scans the context array and mask sensitive keys.</p><pre><code>namespace App\\Log;\n\nuse Monolog\\Attribute\\AsMonologProcessor;\nuse Monolog\\LogRecord;\n\n#[AsMonologProcessor]\nclass SensitiveDataProcessor\n{\n    private const array SENSITIVE_KEYS = ['password', 'credit_card', 'cvv', 'token'];\n\n    public function __invoke(LogRecord $record): LogRecord\n    {\n        $context = $record-&gt;context;\n\n        foreach ($context as $key =&gt; $value) {\n            if (in_array($key, self::SENSITIVE_KEYS, true)) {\n                $context[$key] = '***REDACTED***';\n            }\n        }\n\n        return $record-&gt;with(context: $context);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre><pre><code>$logger-&gt;info('User login', ['password' =&gt; 'secret123']);\n// Output in log: \"User login\" {\"password\": \"***REDACTED***\"}\n</code></pre><h2>Scenario 5. Structured Logging: JSON for ELK/Datadog</h2><p>Parsing multi-line text logs (like stack traces) in&nbsp;&nbsp;or&nbsp;&nbsp;is painful. Regex parsers break easily.</p><p>\\\nYou can output logs as JSON lines. This allows log aggregators to natively index fields like&nbsp;.</p><p>config/packages/monolog.yaml:</p><pre><code>monolog:\n    handlers:\n        json_report:\n            type: stream\n            path: \"%kernel.logs_dir%/app.json\"\n            level: info\n            formatter: monolog.formatter.json\n            channels: [\"!payment\", \"!event\"]\n</code></pre><p>\\\nOpen&nbsp;. The output should look like:</p><pre><code>{\"message\":\"Order created\",\"context\":{\"id\":123},\"level\":200,\"channel\":\"app\",\"datetime\":\"...\"}\n</code></pre><h2>Scenario 6. Spam Prevention: The Deduplication Handler</h2><p>Your database goes down. Your application receives&nbsp;&nbsp;in a minute. Your “Email on Error” handler sends you&nbsp;, getting your&nbsp;<strong>SMTP server blacklisted and flooding your inbox</strong>.</p><p>\\\nThe&nbsp;&nbsp;can&nbsp;aggregate identical log records and send a single summary.</p><p>config/packages/monolog.yaml:</p><pre><code>monolog:\n    handlers:\n        deduplication:\n            type: deduplication\n            handler: nested_dedup\n            buffer_size: 60\n            time: 60\n            level: error\n            channels: [\"!console\"]\n</code></pre><p>\\\nIf the DB crashes, you receive&nbsp;<strong>one email every 60 seconds</strong>&nbsp;listing all occurrences, rather than one email per request.</p><h2>Scenario 7. Dynamic Log Levels (Runtime Debugging)</h2><p>A specific customer is reporting an issue in production. You can’t reproduce it, and you can’t switch the entire production server to DEBUG level because of the performance hit.</p><p>\\\nUse an&nbsp;&nbsp;to switch the log level dynamically based on a request header.</p><p>Create a custom strategy:</p><pre><code>namespace App\\Command;\n\nuse Psr\\Log\\LoggerInterface;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Console\\Attribute\\AsCommand;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Console\\Command\\Command;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Console\\Input\\InputInterface;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Console\\Input\\InputOption;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Console\\Output\\OutputInterface;\n\n#[AsCommand(name: 'app:dynamic-debug', description: 'Tests dynamic log level activation')]\nclass DynamicDebugCommand extends Command\n{\n    public function __construct(private readonly LoggerInterface $logger) {\n        parent::__construct();\n    }\n\n    protected function configure(): void\n    {\n        $this-&gt;addOption('force-debug', null, InputOption::VALUE_NONE, 'Force debug logging for this run');\n    }\n\n    protected function execute(InputInterface $input, OutputInterface $output): int\n    {\n        if ($input-&gt;getOption('force-debug')) {\n            $output-&gt;writeln('Debug mode forced via option. (Simulated, as Monolog ActivationStrategy relies on Http/Request state typically. But you can add processors/handlers dynamically in real apps based on this flag).');\n        }\n\n        $this-&gt;logger-&gt;debug('This detailed trace only appears if --force-debug is passed or an error occurs.');\n        $this-&gt;logger-&gt;info('Standard processing information.');\n\n        return Command::SUCCESS;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre><h2>Scenario 8. Messenger Logging: Worker Context</h2><p>Logs from&nbsp;&nbsp;are hard to trace. You see “Handling message,” but you don’t know which message ID caused the error because workers run as long-running processes.</p><p>\\\nUse&nbsp;&nbsp;to inject the Message ID into the Monolog context specifically for the worker process.</p><pre><code>namespace App\\EventListener;\n\nuse Psr\\Log\\LoggerInterface;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\EventDispatcher\\Attribute\\AsEventListener;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Messenger\\Event\\WorkerMessageReceivedEvent;\n\nreadonly class WorkerLogContextListener\n{\n    public function __construct(private LoggerInterface $logger) {}\n\n    #[AsEventListener]\n    public function onMessageHandling(WorkerMessageReceivedEvent $event): void\n    {\n        $this-&gt;logger-&gt;info('Worker started message', [\n            'message_class' =&gt; $event-&gt;getEnvelope()-&gt;getMessage()::class,\n        ]);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre><h2>Scenario 9. Excluding 404s from Error Logs</h2><p>Bots scanning your site for&nbsp;&nbsp;or&nbsp;&nbsp;generate&nbsp;<strong>thousands of 404 NotFoundHttpException logs</strong>.

Discovery's studio and streaming assets after the WBD board on Thursday deemed a revised bid by Paramount Skydance to be a superior offer. From a report: Earlier this week, Paramount raised its bid to buy the entirety of WBD to $31 per share, up from $30 per share, all cash. It was the latest amendment to Paramount's multiple offers in recent months -- and since moving forward with a hostile bid to buy the company -- and it's now unseated a deal between WBD and Netflix to sell the legacy media company's studio and streaming businesses for $27.75 per share. \n\nLast week, Netflix granted WBD a seven-day waiver to reengage with Paramount, resulting in the higher bid. Paramount's offer is for the entirety of WBD, including its pay-TV networks, such as CNN, TBS and TNT. Netflix had four business days to make changes to its own proposal in light of Paramount's superior bid, the WBD board said in a statement Thursday. Instead, the decision by the streaming giant to walk away puts a pin in a drawn-out saga that saw amended offers from both bidders.",

      "content": "theodp writes: On Tuesday, Microsoft GM of Education and Workforce Policy (and former Code.org Chief Academic Officer) Pat Yongpradit posted an obituary of sorts for coders. \"Computer programmers and software developers are codified differently in the BLS [Bureau of Labor Statistics] data,\" Yongpradit wrote. \"The modern AI-infused world needs less computer programmers (coders) and more software developers (more holistic and higher level). So when folks say that there is less hiring of computer programmers, they are right. But there will be more hiring of software developers, especially those who have adopted an AI-forward mindset and skillset. [...] The number of just pure computer programming roles has already been declining due to reasons like outsourcing, AI will just accelerate the decline.\" \n\nOn Wednesday, Yongpradit's colleague Allyson Knox, Senior Director of Education and Workforce Policy at Microsoft, put another AI nail in the coder coffin, testifying before the House Committee on Education -- the Workforce Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education on Building an AI-ready America: Teaching in the Age of AI. \"Thank you to Chairman Tim Walberg, Ranking Member Bobby Scott, Chair Kevin Kiley, Ranking Member Suzanne Bonamici and members of the Subcommittee for the opportunity to share Microsoft perspective and that of the educators and parents we hear from every day across the country,\" Knox wrote in a LinkedIn post. \n\n\"Three themes continue to emerge throughout these discussions: 1. Educators want support to build AI literacy and critical thinking skills. 2. Schools need guidance and guardrails to ensure student data is protected and adults remain in control. 3. Teachers want classroom-ready tools, and a voice in shaping them. If we focus on these priorities, we can help ensure AI expands opportunity for every student across the United States.\" \n\nYongpradit and Knox report up to Microsoft President Brad Smith, who last July told Code.org CEO Hadi Partovi it was time for the tech-backed nonprofit to \"switch hats\" from coding to AI as Microsoft announced a new $4 billion initiative to advance AI education. Smith's thoughts on the extraordinary promise of AI in education were cited by Knox in her 2026 Congressional testimony. Interestingly, Knox argued for the importance of computer programming literacy in her 2013 Congressional testimony at a hearing on Our Nation of Builders: Training the Builders of the Future. \"Congress needs to come up with fresh ideas on how we can continue to train the next generation of builders, programmers, manufacturers, technicians and entrepreneurs,\" said Rep. Lee Terry said to open the discussion. So, are reports of computer programming's imminent death greatly exaggerated?",

All the technical excellence and expert architectural decisions that contribute to your unique service offering are interpreted by the end user in boring, simple thought processes—&gt;Whenever I want to do xxxx, I think of [insert startup name]. </p><p>That’s what all your playbooks should optimize for. </p><p>When people want to solve a problem, they reach for a name that feels naturally tied to the action they want to take. And if you really win, there’s another layer: Rather than just coming to mind, your name replaces the action itself. </p><p>You don’t say “search for it online.” You say, “Google it.” \\n You don’t say “order a ride.” You say, “Uber there.”</p><p>This phenomenon is something I’ve personally experience and it has shaped my consumption decisions, at home and abroad. </p><p>To this day, whenever I refer to ride-hailing as “Ubering.” “I’ll Uber to you at 6 pm today”. “I’ll be with you shortly, I’m on the phone with my Uber driver” (nevermind that it was actually a Bolt driver). But that’s just me. </p><p>In the early days of ride-hailing services in Lagos, between 2014 &amp; 16, Bolt became the default word. Uber entered in 2014. Bolt followed in 2016 and scaled aggressively. For a large segment of the market, Bolt wasn’t an Uber alternative; it was the introduction to Ride-hailing. As their first experience, it naturally became THE word. </p><p>Then inDrive arrived in 2019. And if you live in Lagos, you know what daily hold-up feels like. You know how surge pricing can turn a normal trip into a life-threatening financial decision. inDrive didn’t try to out-Uber Uber. It leaned into control, negotiation, and affordability. </p><p>When there was fear of prices stretching too far, people opened inDrive.</p><p>Over time, in certain conversations, “check inDrive” became synonymous with “find the cheaper option.”</p><p>Three companies. Same category. Different associations forming in different pockets of the same city.</p><p>The learning here, for builders, is to actively build mental shortcuts in the minds of your users because associations like these don’t happen by accident. </p><p>And if you’re entering a market that feels somewhat crowded, fear not! </p><p><strong>You don’t have to own the entire category. You just have to own a behavior inside it.</strong></p><p>Pick the verb you want to represent, decide what you want to be synonymous with, and reinforce that idea over and over again. </p><p>:::tip\nAnd if you’re serious about testing that clarity in the real world, there’s a practical place to start.</p><p>\\\nHackerNoon’s <strong>Proof of Usefulness Hackathon</strong> is built around a simple question: Does your product actually solve a real problem for real people? It’s one thing to declare what you want to be synonymous with. It’s another to prove it publicly.</p><p>\\\nIf you’re building something meaningful and want to sharpen your positioning while competing for over $150,000 in cash prizes and software credits, this is a solid first step.</p><p>Now, let’s take a look at three startups that are clearly attempting to anchor themselves to specific mental shortcuts.</p><h2>Meet Pettr App, CreaThink Solutions, and Saturn: HackerNoon Startups of the Week</h2><p> is a digital platform designed to simplify pet ownership by centralizing pet care management in one place. From health records and appointments to service access and reminders, Pettr aims to reduce the administrative friction that comes with caring for animals.</p><p>Rather than treating pet services as isolated transactions, Pettr positions itself as an ongoing companion to pet owners — a structured way to organize what is often an emotional and time-sensitive responsibility. Over time, that kind of utility has the potential to become second nature.</p><p> provides end-to-end digital services that combine strategic thinking with technical execution. The company works with businesses to design, develop, and deploy tailored digital solutions — from platforms and websites to broader transformation initiatives.</p><p>Its positioning leans into the idea that building well begins with thinking well. By blending creativity with structured problem-solving, CreaThink focuses not just on delivering digital products, but on helping organizations approach technology with clarity and intention.</p><p> is a social scheduling platform built for high school students, designed to make managing school life more intuitive and connected. By organizing class schedules, clubs, sports, and social plans into one shared space, Saturn helps students navigate their daily routines with less friction.</p><p>In environments where coordination can easily become chaotic, Saturn aims to bring structure and visibility to student communities — turning scheduling into something collaborative rather than fragmented.</p><p>Different industries. Different audiences. Different problems.</p><p>But the principle is the same.</p><p>When your function is clear, your name travels. And when that function is reinforced consistently enough, your brand becomes a verb. </p>",

      "content": "<p>Previously, businesses have taken disruption lightly. Something to live with, something to respond to, something that will culminate. This closure of factories, collapse of suppliers, logistical difficulties, and system failures are all unwanted guests, and they push leaders to enter the crisis mode. The fag-end work is in teams, and decisions are fast; spending is too big, and hopefully it will be the environment, the next shock to be felt somewhere in the environment. Such a way of functioning is no longer a possibility. No longer is disruption an exception. It has been set to be the operating environment.</p><p>The change that exists is not the existence of such a risk but is the reaction of the organizations to the already practically existing risk. Reaction to anticipation and anticipation to autonomy are processes of gradual transition. This change is built in the digital twin, and then there, this is not a programmed model but an organism sensitive to the dynamics of the complex systems in the real world.</p><p>Digital twins and general-purpose AI reasoning systems can always recall the system telemetry, anticipate the wear-out of performance, and automatically undertake mitigation measures (redistribution of workload, dynamic scaling, and predictive maintenance) on vast-sized digital platforms (connected-device ecosystems, streaming platforms, and supply-chain software networks).</p><h2><strong>Digital twins as living mirrors of reality</strong></h2><p>Modern digital twins are no longer static models; they are continuously evolving representations of real-world systems. It is a continuously evolving impression of actual business, which is nourished by streams of data from machines, systems, suppliers, and working processes. It expresses contemporary reality and visions of a future eventuality. Chains of suppliers, materials, inventory flows, and logistics routes are examples of the links represented in supply chains. Machines, production lines, and environmental conditions find their expressions in factories. It includes reliability, software performance trends, and loads.</p><p>The dynamism of the twin enables leaders to experiment with ideas without having to disrupt the real world. By using a plant, the behavior of a line can be studied under conditions of stress. The effect of a disruption in levels can be observed by a supply team. A software process can also monitor the propagation of failures across systems. The reaction movement impulse starts here.</p><h2><strong>From prediction to autonomy</strong></h2><p>The anticipated issue alters the dialogue. The question of what did not happen turns into the question of what will not happen as the starting point for teams. The latter is enabled by digital twins, which replicate scenarios around the clock. They address prospective supplier closures, demand fluctuations, geopolitical disasters, equipment corrosion and wear, and system overloads prior to their actual occurrence.</p><p>The next step is autonomy. The extent of digital twins with compelling reasoning models is not limited to knowledge. They suggest actions, and under precise conditions, they implement them. The parameters of production are self-regulating. Before failure, maintenance is activated. Risks and non-habitual changes in inventory are addressed. Workloads are rerouted to software systems before performance is degraded. It is no longer entombed in alarms, but human teams remain in control. They are demoted to line managers.</p><h2>Self healing systems in practice</h2><p>Self-healing does not imply that systems are not destroyed. It means that they recognize stress at a very early stage and act wisely. In the manufacturing context, this can be observed in the form of equipment that adapts itself to prevent damage or trigger maintenance even before malfunctioning. The supply networks model considers it an automatic sourcing response to the supplier risk exceeding a threshold. It occurs in software ecosystems through redistribution of traffic or capacity scaling, or automatic isolation of failed parts.</p><p>This is not possible in one tool but in a closed loop. Data flows into the twin. The signal is decoded by the twin. Scenarios are evaluated. Decisions are made. Actions are taken. The result is sent back into the model. It is a system that requires time to learn via its shortcomings and evolve.</p><h2><strong>The quiet importance of governance</strong></h2><p>A government that is not in control is dangerous to the operations. The successful organizations see digital twins as a cloth of governance and not a by-product. Risk tolerance is defined. Escalation paths are clear. The decisions are limited in nature. The decisions made by the leaders are about what to automate and what people are supposed to research.</p><p>This design will make sure that digital twins are not a rogue intelligence but rather an equal force. Silos' risk has been broken down and viewed by executives. Operations teams are not informed with noise. The real working of systems forms the basis of strategy and not spreadsheet forecasts of how systems work.</p><h2><strong>When ecosystems replace silos</strong></h2><p>To create digital twins, the starting points are not the growing assets and departments, but this is where the actual breakthrough is achieved. The supply chain cannot be called linear. Service layers, vendors, and integrations are the basis of software platforms. In a cross-cultural setting, organizational elements are not maximized, but the whole is enhanced.</p><p>Transparency suppresses information blindness. Personal fixes are substituted with integrated responses. Resilience is not a cost center but a belief center. Investors notice. Customers notice. The variation is experienced among staff members, where crisis is no longer periodic or temporary.</p><h2><strong>Leading into the autonomous era</strong></h2><p>Autonomous processes do not occur in a day, from reactive to autonomous operation. They start with the ability to see, then progress to predicting, and finally graduate to self-healing behavior with evident leadership. The possibility of such progression is based on the concept of digital twins. GenAI and intelligent reasoning algorithms are added as the means of turning wisdom into action.</p><p>The first flowing organizations are not pursuing novelty. Instead of being violent, they are opting to be non-violent. Instead of enhancing it, they are constructing shock-absorbing systems. Independence does not concern itself with replacing people in a world full of uncertainty. It is about providing them with a working system that is not contrary to them.</p>",

      "content": "<p>The digital marketing is like a forest fire, with generative AI becoming viral in other industry segments as well. It is a financial revolution. The potential of the generative AI is effective and correct and can save a large amount of time not only to accelerate the end of the month closing but also detail the financial stories. But all their novelty and convenience cannot be buried under the carpet of any cobbles of ethical problems.</p><h2><strong>The Temptation of Speed and Accuracy</strong></h2><p>The monetary world is time conscious. It is monumental in itself that the stress component of making the book closing time, particularly at the culmination of a quarter or even more ideally a fiscal year, is stressful. And generative AI algorithms are the things which are, in fact, miraculous. They are able to find the information of colossal volumes of data in several seconds, see the anomalies sooner than the human eye, and even produce narrative reports that will contain literal and sensible explanations of the statistics.</p><p>And all this hastiness brings the question of trust. Who is going to take the wrong step in a situation where the report prepared by artificial intelligence can be made on the false input data? The aspect of human control can also be reduced to a minimum since teams are fairly relying too heavily on the outcome of such tools. That threat is being overtaken, as in the case of errors, they will not be pointed out by the loss or enormous alteration of the human touch. The lack of taking such AI systems seriously implies that the system will be of an unsteady nature, and any hiccup will result in dire misreporting.</p><h2><strong>Opacity in Decision Making</strong></h2><p>The last part is one of the most troubling regarding the generative AI in financial reports as it is not clear how the AI is able to arrive at some of the decisions. Admittedly, generative models need not be necessarily transparent. They are not following a trail of coded reasoning blindly, but they like picking on patterns even the inventors of those patterns themselves do not know exactly what they are. This renders it difficult to audit the rationales of the financial narrations by AI.</p><p>What does he/she do to the request that a growing authority or a board member is requesting him/her to clarify to him/her the cause behind a particular interpretation of the financial information based on the logic that is inherent in the machine learning operations? This black-box nature is of paramount concern to accountability and auditing. Traceability in finance is sacrosanct in normal finance. All the characters, all the footnotes will have a trace. These generative AI issues on this principle are yet to be reconciled.</p><h2><strong>Bias Creeping Into Narratives</strong></h2><p>Data is never neutral. It is a signifier of values and assumptions and past practices of the system where it is created. The actual danger is that information is being amplified in the product when the generative AI models are educated on financial data, particularly on the large volumes of data which are heterogeneous.</p><p>One would be in the language pattern that is habitually adopted in the financial reporting that might be biased towards optimism rather than warning subconsciously. It has the potential to shape the sight of the financial performance of a business the very instant it gets selected by an AI and starts to create the identical positive narratives on it. Besides, this bias may happen accidentally to the human operators. This systematic reporting bias might cause badly informed stakeholders and ill‑informed decision making and reputational disaster in the long term.</p><h2><strong>Data Privacy and Confidentiality Risks</strong></h2><p>One of the most confidential information which is possessed by a given organization is financial information. The fact that there is the possibility of the utilization of the generative AI implies the imposition of the megaliths of this information. Otherwise, it is a huge risk of dispensation of information unless under strict security.</p><p>In addition, by utilising the services of third‑party AI or AI‑based models on a cloud‑computing model, the companies are, in other words, sending valuable financial information to third parties. Although the information has been anonymized, it can be reverse engineered or accidentally exposed. The potential result of such data intrusions, in the given case, is humiliation, not mentioning legal suits, regulatory fines, and unimaginable loss of trust of the stakeholders.</p><h2><strong>Human Oversight vs Machine Autonomy</strong></h2><p>Tug of war is productivity or regulation. When it comes to generating the majority of legwork, the automatic financial close and storytelling generative AI will certainly be able to do most of the work. However, when human beings begin to sacrifice excess power, then it is something to fret about.</p><p>The human perception in its capacity to process the information in the larger business world is, however, inimitable. Even the most sophisticated ones cannot even contemplate the specifics of a global crisis, instant amendment of the regulation, or strategic consequences of a takeover. The threat that it might pose is that some valuable undertones might be overlooked in case an AI replaced a human being as the financial stories writer. It is not simply a technology issue but there is solid ground on the moral aspect. The organizations must consider making sure that AI will not take the place of human work but will rather complement it particularly in the areas where judgment and situational analysis is a significant issue.</p><p>AI has no reversal. It will continue boosting its financial position. Nevertheless, the organizations would be required to exhibit a high propensity of its application with a sharp sense of the ethical minefield it involves. Neither does it presuppose existing as being technological but assumes creating fences around such technology.</p><p>It has to focus on human management. All the procedures of AI use should be audited. Factors that should be bargained include transparency and explainability, but they should not be neglected since these are among the factors that must be considered. The orientation of learning the functionality of such tools should also be accorded to the organizational teams so that they would be aware of where they would fail and critically analyze the results.</p><p>Finally, AI should be treated as a co‑pilot, and not an autopilot. It can revolutionize the financial reporting through its judicious application. Even worse, the effectiveness of the very financial process can be destroyed because of the abuse of the same.</p>",

      "content": "<p>DevOps was a sense of freedom. It increased the pace of teamwork, the release process ceased to be whiplashed, and the divisions between the operations and development teams were finally broken. Liberty came, bit by bit, but that burden grew. Cloud resources increased many times over, containers were growing everywhere, compliance regulations were getting more rigid, and environments began to resemble chaotic cities rather than orderly workplaces. DevOps groups were now expected to do everything within limited timeframes and at high frequency. Shift left practices put testing, security, and quality earlier in the lifecycle at the expense of overworking developers. Something had to change.</p><p>Platform engineering has not been constructed as an answer to DevOps, and it was a natural extension of it. Rather than forcing all teams to struggle with infrastructure, pipelines, and policies directly, platform engineering transforms these elements into an internal product. Developers are provided with a simple bare bones path to create, publish, and use software without necessarily understanding all the gears and cogs under the hood. The platform becomes a platform of trust, then one more is added, and then another, and another, while application teams focus on building value rather than managing complexity.</p><h2><strong>Rethinking Shift Left at Enterprise Scale</strong></h2><p>Shift left is most effective when invisible. There were security checks and compliance reviews during initial pipeline implementations that were not applied uniformly and were fragmented. This is altered by platform engineering. It has testing and governance built into the platform. Whenever developers create environments or deploy applications, the right checks automatically activate. The platform also does not give teams reminders about best practices but automatically enforces them. The system makes shift left part of the system and not an item on the to do list.</p><p>Shifting checks further up the lifecycle is no longer sufficient, especially as systems become very large and interconnected. Contemporary platforms should treat security, testing, monitoring, and reliability as continuous rather than isolated tasks. This is achieved through platform engineering, which extends shift left across every stage of delivery. The same rules, insights, and protections are applied from the moment code is written until it is executed in production. Problems are detected faster because signals are continuously flowing, rather than relying on teams to decide when to investigate. This shift everywhere approach reduces unpredictability, shortens recovery time, and creates confidence that the service will behave consistently regardless of how fast the organization is moving.</p><p>Currently, enterprise platforms need to provide much more than what was planned to deliver applications. They require very high observability, deterministic environments, and stable development and production environments. These attributes are necessitated because systems are starting to depend on a high level of automation and data driven decision making. Standardized deployment templates and built in monitoring are infrastructure definitions that assure organizations that changes are performing as expected. Learning systems can be predictable, secure, and scalable when everything runs on the same paved roads.</p><h2><strong>Why Developers Actually Like This Change</strong></h2><p>The focus on platform engineering is one of the quiet strengths in its capability to transform the experience of a developer. For UI full-stack developers, platform-embedded shift-left practices ensure that user-facing applications behave consistently across environments, making real-time features, observability-driven UX improvements, and rapid iteration safer and more predictable.</p><p>Rather than memorizing scripts or waiting on another group, developers use a bare bones interface through which they do the least amount of work, leaving the heavy work to be done on their behalf. Provisioning an environment feels normal and not dangerous. Deployments are dull and monotonous. When things go wrong, logs and metrics are already in place. The absence of friction in day to day work does not make people work harder but allows productivity to increase naturally.</p><h2><strong>The Cultural Shift Behind the Technology</strong></h2><p>Changing mentality is also part of transitioning to platform engineering. Platform teams act as product builders. They listen to internal users, improve through feedback, and measure success through adoption and reliability. Guardrails are not held against development teams. There is greater operational stability without turning teams into bottlenecks. With shift left practices ceasing to be a slogan and becoming an experience that is central to every interaction with the platform.</p><p>The trend of platform engineering can be interpreted as a more general desire to see complex systems as having a calming side. Speed is what businesses desire, not anarchy. They seek innovation, not unmanageable risk. Through the use of shift left practices on a common platform, organizations are able to create an environment that is homogeneous, observable, and ready to integrate with the next generation of intelligent capabilities. The end product is more than improved software creation but a more sustainable way to build the future.</p>",

Frameworks like the EU AI Act, the NIST AI Risk Management Framework, and emerging global standards all define expectations around fairness, auditability, risk management, and oversight.</p><p>But there is a fundamental disconnect.</p><p>Governance exists as policy. \\n AI exists as infrastructure.</p><p>And somewhere between the two, accountability breaks down.</p><p>The core issue is not regulatory clarity. It is an engineering implementation.</p><p>AI governance today is largely procedural. Documentation exists. Risk assessments are conducted. Controls are described.

Analyst biz Gartner is projecting a drop in PC shipments of more than 10 percent during 2026, and a decline of around 8 percent for smartphones, all due to the AI-driven memory shortage. Some types of memory have doubled or quadrupled in price since last year, and Gartner believes DRAM and NAND flash used in PCs and phones is set for a further 130 percent rise by the end of 2026.\n \nThe upshot of this is that the budget PC will disappear, simply because vendors won't be able to build them at a price that will satisfy cost-conscious buyers, according to Gartner research director Ranjit Atwal. \"Because the price of memory is increasing so much, vendors lose the ability to provide entry-level PCs -- those below about $500,\" he told The Register. PC makers could just raise the price of their cheap and cheerful boxes to above that level to compensate for the memory hike, however, price-sensitive buyers simply won't bite, he added.\n \nAnother factor expected to add to declining fortunes of the PC industry this year is AI devices -- systems equipped with special hardware for accelerating AI tasks, typically via a neural processing unit (NPU) embedded in the CPU. These systems were predicted to take the market by storm, but they require more memory to support AI processing and vendors like to mark them up to a premium price. \"Historically, downgrading specifications was the way to go when prices were being squeezed, but that's difficult here,\" Atwal said. \"The thinking was that the average price [of AI PCs] would fall this year, and lead to more adoption,\" said Atwal, \"but that's not happening.\" The lack of killer applications isn't helping either.",

It’s one of the most practical ways to make large document collections queryable without building brittle, domain-specific parsers for every question type. The catch is that what works in a controlled demo often degrades quickly when you put it in front of real enterprise PDFs: scanned contracts, compliance filings, medical records, policies, and the long tail of layout and quality issues that come with them. In production, the “RAG problem” is less about clever prompting and more about repeatability: traceability, security, quality controls, and the ability to explain why an answer is correct (or why the system refused).</p><p>When teams get stuck, it’s rarely because vector search “doesn’t work.” It’s because the system can’t consistently ground answers to the right evidence, can’t enforce entitlements reliably, or can’t be evaluated and improved without breaking things. If you can’t tell a stakeholder which version of which document supported a claim—or prove the user was authorized to see it—you don’t have a product yet. You have an experiment.</p><p>Most prototypes follow the same path: drop documents into a vector store, retrieve top-k chunks, and ask an LLM to synthesize. On clean, well-structured text, that can look excellent. The issue is what happens next. Scanned PDFs come in rotated or skewed. Multi-column reading order gets scrambled. Tables lose structure during extraction. Chunking splits mid-argument. Retrieval returns “close enough” context that reads plausibly but doesn’t actually support the claim. And the model, doing what it’s optimized to do, answers fluently anyway.</p><p>In production, you’re optimizing for different properties than a demo. You want the system to be reliable over messy inputs, reproducible across pipeline changes, and defensible under scrutiny. That means being able to trace an answer back to specific evidence, and having strong defaults when evidence is weak: clarifying questions, refusal behavior, or presenting “best available evidence” with explicit uncertainty. It also means treating access control as part of retrieval—not as an afterthought layered onto UI.</p><h2><strong>Ingestion: Where Quality Is Won or Lost</strong></h2><p>If you’ve built a few of these systems, you learn quickly that ingestion determines retrieval quality more than most downstream tricks. Document AI preprocessing isn’t glamorous, but it is where you either preserve structure—or lose it permanently. For enterprise documents, OCR alone isn’t enough; you typically need OCR with layout detection, reading-order reconstruction, and structure extraction that keeps headings, sections, and tables meaningful. Managed tools like Google Document AI, Azure Document Intelligence, and Amazon Textract can cover a lot of ground. Open-source pipelines like Unstructured and GROBID are common when you need transparency or tighter control over parsing decisions.</p><p>Chunking is where teams often underestimate the complexity. A simple character or token split is fast, but it tends to cut across semantic boundaries—exactly the boundaries users care about in contracts and policies. Adaptive chunking that follows headings, section boundaries, and table boundaries usually improves both retrieval and downstream grounding. It also makes provenance feel natural to the end user: instead of surfacing an opaque internal ID like chunk_4892, you can point to something a reviewer can immediately verify—“MSA v3.2 → Section 9 (Termination) → 9.2 (Termination for Cause), page 12, lines 14–22.”</p><p>Metadata is another area that tends to look optional until you need it. In practice, metadata is what makes filtering, traceability, and reproducibility possible. Useful chunk-level metadata commonly includes document IDs, section paths, page numbers, timestamps (effective date, last modified, ingested at), extraction confidence signals, and version identifiers (document hash, chunking version, embedding model version). In enterprise contexts, access-control attributes (tenant, department, confidentiality, role tags) need to be first-class, because they directly constrain retrieval and audits.</p><h2><strong>The Retrieval Stack That Actually Works</strong></h2><p>Vector similarity search is a good baseline, but it’s rarely sufficient on its own for enterprise documents. In practice, hybrid retrieval—dense embeddings plus sparse lexical retrieval like BM25—tends to be more robust, especially when users query with clause numbers, identifiers, acronyms, or exact phrasing. Dense retrieval handles semantic intent well; sparse retrieval anchors you to exact terms and rare tokens that embeddings often smooth over.</p><p>Reranking is often where systems make the biggest leap in perceived quality, not because it’s magical, but because it fixes a common failure mode: the initial retrieval set contains “kinda relevant” chunks, and you need to promote the truly relevant ones to the top. Cross-encoder re-rankers (open models like bge-reranker or managed APIs like Cohere ranker) rescore candidate chunks using deeper query–passage interaction. Teams usually see a noticeable lift in context precision when reranking is measured properly (for example, on a golden set with expected sources). If you keep a quantitative claim here, it’s best to tie it to a metric (“context precision” or “citation precision”) and an evaluation setup, rather than a broad “accuracy” number.</p><p>Query rewriting and expansion is another lever that’s easy to skip early and then rediscover later. Users don’t naturally phrase questions the way documents are written. A rewrite step can expand acronyms, normalize entities, and split multi-part questions into retrieval-friendly sub-queries. It doesn’t need to be fancy—but it does need observability, because uncontrolled rewriting can drift away from user intent.</p><h2><strong>Security: The Layer Everyone Forgets</strong></h2><p>Most RAG demos ignore access control because it slows down the prototype. In production, it’s a primary constraint. If your system indexes HR documents, legal contracts, and engineering specs together, you need a deterministic entitlement path from user → allowed chunks, and retrieval must be constrained by that path before any content reaches an LLM.</p><p>The pattern that tends to scale is pre-filtered retrieval: compute entitlements (RBAC/ABAC), retrieve only from chunks with compatible ACL attributes, rerank within the authorized candidate set, and log what evidence was accessed. This is also where the “metadata isn’t optional” point shows up in practice—without chunk-level tagging, you end up with leaky boundaries or expensive, brittle post-filters.</p><p>Beyond ACL, enterprise deployments typically need some combination of PII detection/masking, encryption at rest, short-lived tokens for source access, and audit logging that captures query, retrieved chunk IDs, citations, and document versions. One more modern concern worth taking seriously is prompt injection content inside documents. You don’t need to treat every document as hostile, but you do need basic guardrails so instructions embedded in source text can’t supersede your system’s rules—especially around access control, disclosure, and how the model is allowed to behave.</p><h2><strong>Monitoring: Closing the Loop</strong></h2><p>If you operate one of these systems for more than a few weeks, you’ll see drift. Documents change, the query distribution changes, the ingestion pipeline changes, and model components get updated. Without monitoring and evaluation, quality degrades quietly until users stop trusting the tool.</p><p>Practically, you want to track retrieval health (recall@k against a golden set, context precision, reranker lift), generation health (citation precision, groundedness/faithfulness checks, refusal rates), and operational health (p50/p95 latency, cost per query, ingestion lag from document update to searchable index). The most effective teams I’ve seen maintain a golden evaluation dataset—curated questions with expected source documents—and run it on a schedule and on change events (new embeddings, new chunking logic, new document batches). Tooling like Phoenix, TruLens, or commercial platforms can help, but the bigger differentiator is the discipline to keep evaluation current and to treat regressions like real production incidents.</p><p>One area that’s frequently underestimated is versioning and reproducibility. When you change OCR models, chunking logic, embedding models, rerankers, or generation prompts, you need a way to trace which versions produced which answers. That’s what makes debugging and audits feasible months later.</p><p>Stack decisions matter, but capabilities matter more. For many teams, a managed-leaning setup is attractive: ingestion via a managed Document AI tool or Unstructured-based pipeline, a hosted vector database, an orchestration layer such as LlamaIndex or LangChain, and a reranker (open or managed). Others prefer open-source deployments using Qdrant/Weaviate/OpenSearch, Haystack or similar orchestration, and self-hosted models for control and cost predictability. Either approach can work if it supports the fundamentals: document-aware ingestion, hybrid retrieval, entitlement enforcement, provenance-friendly citations, evaluation pipelines, and versioning.</p><p>On the architecture side, systems tend to become easier to operate when they’re split cleanly: ingestion workers that run asynchronously and can be retried safely; a stateless retrieval service that enforces policies and returns evidence; and a generation service that operates with bounded context and clear provenance. A typical reference deployment includes an API gateway, a job queue (Kafka/RabbitMQ), object storage for raw documents and parsed artifacts, the index layer (dense + sparse), plus centralized logging/metrics and an audit trail.</p>",

      "content": "<p>With video projected to comprise 82% of Internet traffic by 2027, hosting live events with encouraging quality is more important than ever - each second of delay can decrease engagement by 20%, and users are still abandoning service for a little bit of buffering. With the rollout of 5G-Advanced and 6G on the horizon, users require ultra-low latency with high throughput - no longer a 'nice to have', but a 'must have' and expected especially in 8K, XR, and much of game streaming via cloud. Achieving these quality expectations will not only take extreme speed but responsive networks programmed to exceed smart value added QoE for streaming and entertainment. AI-native automation can scale unique QoE, but we remain trapped in siloed systems with outdated internal business policies and procedures. The real test is not how to import machine learning AI but simply how to do AI right at the edge! Streaming now has become chaotic across fast-moving environments- city towers, edge servers, content aggregators, mobile users, and multi-CDN. So, streaming and the associated QoE can now move in countless ways simultaneously. What ISO, TSRO, and similar static tools allow for post-suffering, as they react too late when the frustration of a stopping point of view has been reached. And data on each user and droves of other users via the flowchart of the transmission path is in constant flux- it is effectively impossible to understand what catastrophe occurred and where with tranches of data scattered across the entirety of the RAN, Core, CDN, and app layer. As the expectation of seamless, flawless, and full 4K streams continues to climb, real-time AI orchestrated service workflows appear to be large and unattainable gaps in service!</p><p>The fix? An AI-native control plane that predicts and resolves problems before users even notice.</p><h2><strong>1️. Edge-Centric Predictive QoE Modeling</strong></h2><p>Edge nodes are evolving from small data centers into decision engines in real time.&nbsp; With AI at the edge, we can anticipate and mitigate streaming interruptions by using local indicators such as buffer levels, handovers, and user movement.&nbsp; Federated learning allows these models to continue evolving regionally without having any detrimental effects on privacy.&nbsp; Imagine a streaming app on a train that predicts tower congestion while adjusting bitrate on the fly.&nbsp; The ability to move networks from reactionary to pro-active is transforming the streaming experience, making it smoother, more intelligent, and more personalized for users… anywhere!</p><h2><strong>2️. Closed-Loop Network Slicing with QoE Feedback</strong></h2><p>Network slicing allows multiple virtual networks to share infrastructure, but most still prioritize technical metrics over real user experience. AI-native automation takes this to the next level by taking real-time QoE data and adapting slices in real time. If a human ability user or AR/VR stream drops, it can route traffic away, change bandwidth, or change RAN priorities with no people involved. This creates real-time and dynamic slicing, which keeps streams stable through network changes.</p><h2><strong>3️. Cross-Layer Root Cause Analysis with Explainable AI</strong></h2><p>It's never easy to identify the root cause of streaming issues in complex multi-domain networks—was it the server, a CDN miss, RAN congestion, or device buffering? Explainable AI (XAI) changes this by correlating data across the transport, application, and radio layers to detect and explain anomalies. XAI doesn't only detect the fault, it explains why it happened, and this helps both operations teams, as well as autonomous systems, to identify root causes and fix problems more intelligently and quicker.</p><h2><strong>4️. Intent-Based Streaming Policy Management</strong></h2><p>Operators need to evolve from static, threshold-based rules and toward intent-based policy engines. An example of a business intent might be, “Deliver live sports in ultra-low-latency to premium subscribers in metro areas.” AI would take such high-level intent and translate it into low-level configurations: managing edge caches, modulating transcoding profiles, prioritizing up-link traffic, prioritizing downlink traffic, etc. If the engine detects a deviation, such as increased rebuffering during the live sports broadcast, it can self-correct by changing policies in real-time.</p><h2><strong>Conclusion: Toward Autonomous Streaming Networks</strong></h2><p>AI-native automation is no longer an option, it’s vital to creating intelligent, resilient networks that can keep up with how we stream today (and tomorrow). As we transition from 5G-Advanced to 6G, the winners will be the ones that are able to put together edge-based intelligence, intent-based control, plus some explainability. Do it right, and you’re not just reducing churn - you’re setting the pace in streaming. Mess it up? At best you can settle for a buffering wheel.</p>",

Minerals in the rocks record the imprint of a magnetic field, nearly as powerful as Earth's, that existed more than 3.5 billion years ago and seemed to persist for millions of years. But generating a magnetic field requires a dynamo -- a churning, molten core -- and most researchers believed the Moon's tiny core would have long since cooled off, 1 billion years after it formed. Corroborating that picture are other ancient Moon rocks of about the same age that suggest the field was weak -- leaving planetary scientists baffled.\n \nNow, researchers are proposing a new way to solve the puzzle. A paper published today in Nature Geoscience theorizes that between 3.5 billion and 4 billion years ago, blobs of titanium-rich magma melted episodically just above the core, rising in plumes that drove volcanic eruptions on the surface. By intermittently stirring up the Moon's core, these bouts of melting would have caused the Moon's magnetic field to flicker on in short, powerful bursts. The paper \"links a few different concepts that people were thinking about separately, but hadn't actually brought together,\" says Sonia Tikoo, a planetary geophysicist at Stanford University who was not involved in the study.",

She steps into the cockpit and flies.</em></p><p>That analogy is perfect. But it exposes a fundamental misunderstanding about how these systems actually get built.</p><p>Trinity doesn't vibe her way into flying. Tank uploads a <em>precise, verified program</em>.</p><p>That's the difference between vibe coding and what Addy Osmani calls <a href=\"https://addyosmani.com/blog/agentic-engineering/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter\">Agentic Engineering</a>. \"Vibe coding\" has poisoned the well — it suggests you can prompt your way to production software. You can't.</p><p>I have 70+ agents in my web3 development workflow. They're not prompt dumps. They're structured: clear responsibilities, explicit knowledge files, defined handoff points between agents. Building them took the same architectural thinking that's always separated working systems from chaos.</p><p>The old principles translate directly:</p><ul><li> (Don't Repeat Your Prompt)</li><li><strong>Separation of concerns → Agent boundaries</strong></li><li><strong>Interface design → Handoff contracts</strong></li><li><strong>Documentation → Precompiled context</strong></li></ul><p>Building good skills is architecture work. The Trinity scene works because someone  that pilot program. Tank didn't vibe code it.</p><h2>The Problem That Started Everything</h2><p>The biggest thing I learned building AI coding workflows: <strong>more context is not better</strong>.</p><p>I work in web3. I have ABIs that are thousands of lines. A Ponder database schema that would eat half the context window if I fed it in raw. My first instinct was to give the AI everything and let it figure out what matters.</p><p>The AI gets lost. Important instructions get ignored. It latches onto random details. Results get worse as context gets bigger. There's a term for this: . As the context window fills up, earlier instructions get \"crowded out\" and the model starts ignoring them.</p><p>So I built a skills-specialist agent.</p><p>Its only job is precompiling context for other agents. It reads my raw ABIs, schemas, and docs, then generates slim reference files tailored to specific tasks. It builds skills.</p><p>When I need UI work done, I don't hand my ui-designer the entire codebase. The skills-specialist has already built a component reference with just the props and patterns that agent needs. When I need contract integration, the web3-implementer gets only the relevant functions and events. The raw ABI stays on disk.</p><p><strong>Agents building context for agents.</strong></p><h2>The Memory Hierarchy Mental Model</h2><p>The mental model that made everything click: treat context like RAM, not a junk drawer.</p><p>| Layer | What It Holds |\n|----|----|\n| Disk | Full codebase, raw ABIs, complete schemas |\n| RAM | Precompiled skills — task-specific reference files |\n| Registers | The current prompt and immediate context |</p><p>You don't load everything into memory. You load what you need for the current task.</p><p>My skills-specialist is the compiler that transforms disk into RAM. Without it, I'm back to stuffing context and hoping for the best.</p><p>Here's the pattern my skills-specialist generates:</p><pre><code># MorphoVault Reference\n\n&gt; Use when implementing vault deposit/withdraw flows.\n\n## Terminology\n- **shares**: Vault shares representing proportional ownership\n- **assets**: The underlying token being deposited\n\n## Key Functions\n\n### deposit(uint256 assets, address receiver) → uint256 shares\nDeposits assets and mints shares to receiver.\nSee: protocols/morpho/abis/MetaMorpho.json\n\n### withdraw(uint256 assets, address receiver, address owner) → uint256 shares\nBurns shares and sends assets to receiver.\nSee: protocols/morpho/abis/MetaMorpho.json\n\n## Events\n\n### Deposit(address indexed sender, uint256 assets, uint256 shares)\n### Withdraw(address indexed sender, uint256 assets, uint256 shares)\n\n## Related Hooks\n- useVaultDeposit: src/hooks/blockchain/useVaultDeposit.ts\n- useVaultBalance: src/hooks/ponder/useVaultBalance.ts\n</code></pre><p>Short. Scannable. Pointers to source files. Domain terms defined. Clear sections.</p><p>The raw Morpho ABI is 2,000+ lines. This reference is 30 lines and contains everything an agent needs to implement a deposit flow.</p><h2>The Craft Behind the Curtain</h2><p>Skills don't build themselves. My skills-creator is itself a skill — one I built through iteration, testing, and architectural thinking.</p><p>Every skill in my system has:</p><ul><li> — What does this agent own?</li><li> — What precompiled context does it need?</li><li> — When does it call other agents?</li><li> — How do we know it's done?</li></ul><p>That's not vibing. That's engineering.</p><p>The distribution insight is right — skills compress the distance between user and value. But someone still has to build them well. That's the craft.</p><p>Next, I'll cover the organizational breakthrough that made 70+ agents manageable: the distinction between  (personas you converse with) and  (workers you dispatch).</p><p>Turns out only ~10 needed to be conversational.

      "content": "<p>The way we interact with project management tools is changing. Instead of clicking through endless menus and dashboards, what if you could simply ask your AI assistant to create sprints, track time, or generate team reports? That's exactly what the GitScrum MCP Server enables.</p><p>Built on the Model Context Protocol, this open-source server connects AI assistants like Claude, GitHub Copilot, and Cursor directly to your GitScrum workspace. It's not just another integration—it's a complete operational layer that gives AI full access to your project management stack.</p><h2>What is the Model Context Protocol?</h2><p>The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that allows AI assistants to interact with external systems in a structured, secure way. Think of it as an API specifically designed for AI agents—instead of humans clicking buttons, your AI assistant can read, create, and update data through natural conversation.</p><p>GitScrum's implementation brings this to project management, offering 29 tools with over 160 operations across tasks, sprints, time tracking, client CRM, analytics, and more.</p><h2>Zero Context Switching: Managing Projects Through Conversation</h2><p>The most powerful aspect of the GitScrum MCP Server is how it eliminates context switching. Here's what you can do without leaving your AI chat:</p><pre><code>textYou: \"What's on my plate today?\"\nAI: Fetches your tasks due today across all projects.\n\nYou: \"Show me what the team shipped this week\"\nAI: Generates a standup digest with completed work and blockers.\n</code></pre><p><strong>Sprint Planning Made Simple</strong></p><pre><code>textYou: \"Create a sprint for next week with the top 5 backlog items\"\nAI: Creates the sprint, assigns tasks, and sets the timeline.\n</code></pre><p><strong>Real-Time Project Insights</strong></p><pre><code>textYou: \"Which projects are over budget?\"\nAI: Returns burn-down data and flags at-risk projects.\n</code></pre><pre><code>textYou: \"Send the Q1 proposal to Acme Corp\"\nAI: Creates the proposal, attaches the client, and sends it.\n</code></pre><p>The server provides access to every major GitScrum feature:</p><ul><li>: Create, update, complete, filter, duplicate, and manage subtasks</li><li>: Full lifecycle management with KPIs, stats, and progress tracking</li><li>: Access workflows, task types, labels, and team members</li><li>: Start/stop timers, view logs, analyze productivity</li></ul><ul><li>: Complete CRUD operations</li><li>: Create and manage epics across projects</li><li>: Custom workflow management</li><li>: Dynamic tagging and filtering</li></ul><ul><li>: Channels, messages, search, and notifications</li><li>: Knowledge base management</li><li>: Personal note vault with sharing capabilities</li><li>: Thread management on any entity</li></ul><ul><li>: Manage contacts and interactions</li><li>: Create, issue, send, and track payments</li><li>: Full proposal lifecycle with approval workflows</li><li>: 8+ financial and CRM reports</li></ul><ul><li>: Automated team digests</li><li>: Real-time consumption and alerts</li><li>: Team and task-level activity streams</li><li>: 10+ operational reports</li></ul><p>The fastest way to get started is using the hosted SSE server:</p><pre><code>texthttps://mcp.gitscrum.com/sse\n</code></pre><p>Zero installation required. Just add the URL and your GitScrum token to Claude Desktop, Cursor, or any SSE-compatible client. Perfect for teams that want instant setup without managing infrastructure.</p><p>For organizations requiring local deployment:</p><pre><code>bashnpx -y @gitscrum-studio/mcp-server\n</code></pre><p>Runs locally via stdio transport. Requires Node.js 18+. Ideal for VS Code, GitHub Copilot, or offline environments.</p><p>The GitScrum MCP Server was built with the principle of least privilege:</p><ul><li>: Only CREATE, READ, UPDATE operations are allowed. Destructive actions must be performed in the GitScrum web app.</li><li>: Credentials never touch the MCP server. Authentication happens directly with GitScrum's OAuth service.</li><li>: Access tokens are stored locally with restricted filesystem permissions.</li><li>: Automatic lockout after failed authentication attempts.</li></ul><h2>1.

      "content": "<p>Modern applications often struggle to scale, not because of weak infrastructure, but because decision-making intelligence is added only after systems are already under load. Auto-scaling, DevOps pipelines, and cloud elasticity help, but they are&nbsp;largely reactive&nbsp;by design.</p><p>As user demand grows, engineering teams are forced to chase latency spikes, error rates, and infrastructure bottlenecks after they appear, turning scalability into a constant firefight.</p><p>This is where AI-native solutions fundamentally change how scalability is engineered. By embedding intelligence directly into system architecture and the software development lifecycle, AI-native systems&nbsp;anticipate&nbsp;growth instead of reacting to it. Decisions around capacity, performance, and resource usage become predictive rather than manual.</p><p>Enterprises adopting <a href=\"https://quokkalabs.com/ai-native-development-services\">AI native software engineering</a> approaches, often in partnership with specialized AI native engineering service companies, are redefining how scalable systems are built. This blog explains how AI-native engineering turns scalability from an operational burden into a built-in system capability, across infrastructure, performance, and development velocity.</p><h2><strong>How AI-Native Engineering Improves App Scalability</strong></h2><p>AI-native engineering improves app scalability by changing how systems detect,&nbsp;anticipate, and respond to growth. Instead of reacting after performance degrades, intelligence is embedded across infrastructure, performance management, and&nbsp;development&nbsp;workflows.</p><p>This allows applications to scale smoothly, predictably, and cost-efficiently as demand increases, without constant manual intervention.</p><h3><strong>1. Automated Infrastructure Management Removes Scaling Bottlenecks</strong></h3><p>As apps grow, manual infrastructure tuning becomes unsustainable. Human-defined rules and static configurations fail when traffic patterns shift rapidly or unpredictably.</p><p>AI-native engineering changes infrastructure behavior by enabling systems to manage themselves. Intelligent models continuously analyze resource usage across containers, microservices, and environments, adjusting CPU, memory, and storage allocation in real time. This prevents both over-provisioning, which wastes cost, and under-provisioning, which causes performance degradation.</p><p>The scalability impact is immediate and long-term. Applications&nbsp;maintain&nbsp;stable performance during sudden traffic spikes, while operational overhead decreases as infrastructure decisions no longer depend on constant human intervention.</p><p>&nbsp;Scalability improves when infrastructure decisions are automated and data-driven, not manually enforced.</p><h3><strong>2. Predictive Scaling and Intelligent Load Balancing</strong></h3><p>Reactive auto-scaling works only after systems start to struggle. By the time thresholds are crossed, users are already experiencing slowdowns, errors, or timeouts. This gap becomes more visible as apps scale and traffic patterns grow more complex.</p><p>AI-native engineering introduces predictive scaling by learning from historical traffic, seasonal usage, feature launches, and real-time behavior. Instead of waiting for load to spike, the system&nbsp;anticipates&nbsp;demand and&nbsp;allocates&nbsp;resources in advance. This proactive approach keeps performance stable even during sudden surges.</p><p>Intelligent load balancing further strengthens scalability by routing traffic based on service health, latency, and capacity rather than static rules. Unhealthy instances are avoided automatically, reducing the risk of cascading failures during peak usage.</p><p>&nbsp;Predictive scaling keeps apps fast before growth becomes visible, not after problems appear.</p><p>As applications grow, performance tuning becomes harder to manage manually. More services, APIs, databases, and integrations mean more places where latency can&nbsp;creep in&nbsp;quietly. Traditional approaches rely on engineers reacting to alerts after users start complaining.</p><p>AI-native engineering changes this by making performance optimization continuous rather than episodic. AI systems&nbsp;monitor&nbsp;API response times, database queries, cache efficiency, and network latency in real time. Patterns that&nbsp;indicate&nbsp;emerging bottlenecks are detected early, often before they&nbsp;impact&nbsp;users.</p><p>Instead of one-time fixes, AI-driven optimization adapts continuously. Slow queries are flagged, inefficient execution paths are&nbsp;identified, and resource allocation is adjusted automatically as usage evolves. Over time, the system learns which optimizations deliver the most impact under different conditions.</p><p>&nbsp;AI-native systems&nbsp;don’t&nbsp;just scale under load, but learn how to perform better as scale increases.</p><h3><strong>4. Faster Development Cycles Enable Scalability Through Speed</strong></h3><p>Scalability is not only about infrastructure capacity. It is also about how quickly teams can adapt systems as demand grows. Slow development cycles turn scalability into a bottleneck because architecture, performance fixes, and optimizations&nbsp;lag behind&nbsp;user growth.</p><p>AI-native engineering accelerates development by embedding intelligence into the software delivery process itself. AI-assisted testing, debugging, and code generation reduce the time&nbsp;required&nbsp;to&nbsp;validate&nbsp;changes under real-world load. Issues that would traditionally surface late in production are&nbsp;identified&nbsp;earlier in development.</p><p>This speed allows teams to evolve backend services, APIs, and infrastructure incrementally without destabilizing the system. New features can be released confidently while performance safeguards&nbsp;remain&nbsp;intact. As demand changes, the architecture can adapt in parallel rather than playing catch-up.</p><p>&nbsp;Applications scale more reliably when engineering velocity scales alongside user demand, not after it.</p><h3><strong>5. Intelligent Resource Allocation Controls Cost at Scale</strong></h3><p>Scalability often breaks down not because systems cannot handle growth, but because costs spiral faster than usage or revenue. Traditional scaling approaches add capacity reactively, leading to over-provisioned infrastructure during low demand and performance risks during spikes.</p><p>AI-native engineering introduces intelligence into resource allocation. Instead of treating&nbsp;compute, memory, and storage as static pools, AI systems continuously analyze workload patterns and adjust resource usage at a granular level. This ensures that each service receives exactly what it&nbsp;needs,&nbsp;when it&nbsp;needs it.</p><p>By&nbsp;eliminating&nbsp;waste across environments, AI-native systems keep infrastructure lean even as traffic grows. This creates predictable cost behavior while&nbsp;maintaining&nbsp;performance under load. Scaling becomes a controlled, measurable process rather than an expensive guess.</p><p>&nbsp;Sustainable scalability depends on intelligent resource allocation, not simply adding more capacity.</p><h2><strong>Core Pillars of AI-Native Scalability</strong></h2><p>AI-native scalability is not driven by isolated tools or one-off optimizations. It is the result of a few foundational principles that shape how systems grow, adapt, and remain stable over time. When these pillars are designed into the architecture, scalability becomes predictable instead of reactive.</p><h3><strong>1. Intent-Driven Engineering</strong></h3><p>In AI-native systems, scaling decisions are tied directly to business intent. Instead of scaling based on raw infrastructure thresholds, systems understand why growth is happening and respond accordingly.</p><p>This alignment ensures that technical expansion always supports real user demand and business outcomes, not just traffic volume.</p><h3><strong>2. Continuous Learning Systems</strong></h3><p>Every interaction becomes feedback. AI-native platforms learn from usage patterns, performance signals, and failures, refining how they scale over time.</p><p>This allows systems to adapt naturally as products, users, and behaviors evolve.</p><h3><strong>3. Proactive Monitoring and Anomaly Detection</strong></h3><p>Rather than waiting for alerts after failures&nbsp;occur, AI-native monitoring&nbsp;identifies&nbsp;risks early. Anomalies are detected before they cascade, protecting performance as scale increases.</p><p>&nbsp;Scalability improves when systems understand intent, learn continuously, and&nbsp;anticipate&nbsp;risk, not when teams react after problems appear.</p><p>App scalability breaks down when growth is handled reactively rather than engineered proactively. AI-native engineering changes this by embedding intelligence into how systems are built, deployed, and evolved.</p><p>Instead of relying on static rules and manual interventions, AI-native solutions automate infrastructure decisions, predict demand,&nbsp;optimize&nbsp;performance continuously, and control cost as scale increases.</p><p>The result is not just the ability to handle more users, but the ability to grow intelligently without destabilizing performance or operations. Scalability becomes a built-in system behavior rather than an operational burden that teams constantly manage.</p><p>Scalable apps are not tuned after&nbsp;growth, but&nbsp;are engineered to scale from the start through intelligence, automation, and learning.

The rare decision to cut a mission short and bring Fincke and three other crew members home early made for a dramatic week in space early this year.\n \nIn a statement released by NASA \"at the request of Fincke,\" the veteran astronaut said he experienced a medical event on Jan. 7 \"that required immediate attention\" from his space station crew members. \"Thanks to their quick response and the guidance of our NASA flight surgeons, my status quickly stabilized,\" Fincke, 58, said in the statement. [...] In his statement, Fincke thanked his Crew-11 colleagues, along with NASA astronaut Chris Williams and Russian cosmonauts Sergey Kud-Sverchkov and Sergei Mikaev, who were also aboard the space station at the time and are still in space. Fincke also thanked the teams at NASA, SpaceX and the medical professionals at Scripps Memorial Hospital La Jolla. \"Their professionalism and dedication ensured a positive outcome,\" he said.\n \nFincke ended his statement by saying he is \"doing very well\" and still actively involved with standard post-flight reconditioning at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston. \"Spaceflight is an incredible privilege, and sometimes it reminds us just how human we are,\" he said. \"Thank you for all your support.\"",

It’s about the&nbsp;&nbsp;you associate with the task.</p><p>Let that sink in for a sec. You’re not avoiding the spreadsheet. You’re avoiding recording the video, or the anxiety of interpreting the numbers wrong. You’re not avoiding the difficult conversation with your employee or your partner.</p><p>\\\nYou’re avoiding the gut-wrenching discomfort of potential conflict, or the guilt of having to be the \"bad guy\", the feeling of being seen as someone who made a shitty piece of content. You’re afraid of being rejected, not loved, not worthy.</p><p>Your brain, in its primitive wisdom, is doing a simple cost-benefit analysis: \"Engage in this thing that will make me feel like crap, or… literally do anything else.\" It’s a rational choice 🙂</p><p>\\\nThe problem is, the \"anything else\" comes with a side order of self-criticism.</p><p>\\\nSo the first question to ask isn’t \"How do I force myself to do this?\" \\n It’s:<strong>\"What specific feeling am I trying to avoid, and why does it scare me so much?\"</strong></p><p>Is it the fear of being judged? Of looking stupid? Of the exhausting mental effort required? Of the confrontation? Name the ghost. It loses power when you shine a light on it. Then, sit with it. Don’t try to fix anything. Just be with the feeling. Welcome it like it’s your own, because it is.</p><p>\\\nIf you want help seeing exactly what’s behind your resistance, take this&nbsp;; it shows you how far you’ve drifted from alignment.</p><h2><strong>The \"Perfect First Draft\" Trap That's Killing Your Momentum</strong></h2><p>When I started this newsletter, I used to sit down to write something, and I’d expect the final, polished, brilliant version to just flow out of my fingertips on the first try. I had a reputation to uphold, after all.</p><p>\\\nThe result? I’d stare at a blank screen for an hour. I’d check my email, i’d open instagram to check on my 342 followers. I’d get a glass of water. I’d do anything&nbsp;&nbsp;write. The gap between my vision of \"perfect\" and the reality of my first, shitty sentence was too vast to cross.</p><p>\\\nThe breakthrough only came when I gave myself permission to write a \"vomit draft.\" No one would ever see it. It could be clumsy, poorly worded, and make no sense at all. The only goal was to get the ideas&nbsp;<em>out of my head and onto the screen</em>.</p><p>Suddenly, writing wasn't a performance. It was an excavation. I could take that messy, ugly lump of clay and start shaping it. The first pass was for me. The second, third, and tenth passes were for everyone else.</p><p>\\\nThis is the iterative mindset. It’s not about getting it right. It’s about getting it&nbsp;. You can’t steer a parked car. You can’t edit a blank page. Your job isn't to be a genius on the first try. Your job is to be a stubborn, relentless editor of your own work.</p><p>Iterate, Iterate, Iterate.</p><p>Stop trying to build the perfect finished product. Just lay the first brick. It’s designed to be bad. Your job is fix it later.</p><h2><strong>When Procrastination is Actually Your Wisest Self Screaming to Be Heard</strong></h2><p>Sometimes, the voice in your head saying \"you&nbsp;&nbsp;do this\" isn't your intuition. It's the ghost of your old boss, your dad, some article you read, or society's boring-ass checklist for a successful life.</p><p>\\\nYour procrastination, in these cases, is your soul's last-ditch effort to stage a protest.</p><p>In plain, simple terms.. sometimes, it’s just not aligned with who you are or what you actually want.</p><p>Have you ever had projects that you&nbsp;&nbsp;were smart, lucrative opportunities? And you just… couldn't… start. You beat yourself up for weeks. Is this happening right now? Ask yourself this question:</p><p>\"If I wasn't&nbsp;&nbsp;to be hard on myself, would I still be trying to do this?\"</p><p>\\\nThe answer will probably be a resounding&nbsp;. The project is a \"should\" born out of obligation, not passion.</p><p>\\\nThe next time you're stuck, try this. And ask: \"Is this&nbsp;&nbsp;priority? Or is this someone else's agenda I've internalized? Is there a different, better, more&nbsp;&nbsp;way to achieve the underlying goal?\"</p><p>\\\nThe resistance might not be something to break through. It might be something to listen to.</p><h2><strong>The Bottom Line You Probably Won't Like</strong></h2><p>Beating procrastination isn't about finding a new, more sophisticated way to bully yourself. It’s the exact opposite. It’s about getting curious. It’s about treating the resistance not as an enemy, but as a data point.</p><p>\\\nYour brain (as usual) is trying to protect you from something. Your job is to figure out what, and then to gently, cleverly, redesign the process so it doesn't feel so threatening.</p><p>\\\nStop trying to win a war with yourself. You’ll always lose. Start a conversation instead.</p><h2><strong>Your Actions for the Week (The Procrastination Prescription)</strong></h2><p>You read the words. Now, here are the actions. Pick one and do it&nbsp;.</p><p>\\\n1. The \"Vomit Draft\" Ship. </p><p>Stop waiting for perfect. Pick one thing you're overthinking (an email, a project outline, a social post, a video script). Your mission is to create the&nbsp;<strong>most embarrassing, shitty first version possible</strong>&nbsp;and send it to one person or post it somewhere&nbsp;. The goal is to intentionally lower the bar so you can jump over it.&nbsp;<strong>Perfection is the enemy of done.</strong></p><p>2. The \"Priority\" Interrogation. </p><p>Take 5 minutes. Write down the #1 thing you're procrastinating on. Now, ask yourself this one question:&nbsp;<strong>\"If I was forbidden from being hard on myself, would I still be trying to do this?\"</strong>&nbsp;Listen to the gut answer. If it's \"Fuck no,\" you have your answer. It's not a priority; it's a prison. Cross it off or radically change the approach. If it's \"Hell yes,\" then you know it's just fear, and you've already taken its power away by naming it.</p><p>3. The \"Visibility\" Audit. </p><p>You're hiding. We all are. Where are you playing small by choice? Make a list of 3 areas in your work or life where you're being&nbsp;&nbsp;to avoid judgment or rejection. Is it not posting your ideas? Not speaking up in meetings? Not pitching that client? Pick ONE and break the pattern this week.&nbsp;<strong>Send one email you're scared to send. Say the thing in the meeting.&nbsp;&nbsp;with worse ideas are already winning. Your value is useless if you hide it.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;Action → Feedback → Iteration → Identity. That's the entire game.</p>",

City of Colorado Springs</em></a>, arose after a housing protest in 2021, during which Colorado Springs police arrested protesters for obstructing a roadway. After the demonstration, police also obtained warrants to seize and search through the devices and data of Jacqueline Armendariz Unzueta, who they claimed threw a bike at them during the protest. The warrants included a search through all of her photos, videos, emails, text messages, and location data over a two-month period, as well as a time-unlimited search for 26 keywords, including words as broad as “bike,” “assault,” “celebration,” and “right,” that allowed police to comb through years of Armendariz’s private and sensitive data—all supposedly to look for evidence related to the alleged simple assault. Police further obtained a warrant to search the Facebook page of the Chinook Center, the organization that spearheaded the protest, despite the Chinook Center never having been accused of a crime.</p><p>The district court dismissed the <a href=\"https://www.aclu-co.org/cases/armendariz-and-chinook-center-v-city-colorado-springs-et-al/?document=First-Amended-Complaint\">civil rights lawsuit</a> brought by Armendariz and the Chinook Center, holding that the searches were justified and that, in any case, the officers were entitled to <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/04/why-eff-supports-repeal-qualified-immunity\">qualified immunity</a>. The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU of Colorado, appealed. EFF—joined by the Center for Democracy and Technology, the Electronic Privacy Information Center, and the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University—wrote an <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/09/eff-tenth-circuit-protest-related-arrests-do-not-justify-dragnet-device-and?language=en\">amicus brief</a> in support of that appeal.</p><p>In a 2-1 opinion, the Tenth Circuit reversed the district court’s dismissal of the lawsuit’s Fourth Amendment search and seizure claims. The court painstakingly picked apart each of the three warrants and found them to be overbroad and lacking in particularity as to the scope and duration of the searches. The court further held that in furnishing such facially deficient warrants, the officers violated “clearly established” law and thus were not entitled to qualified immunity. Although the court did not explicitly address the First Amendment concerns raised by the lawsuit, it did note the backdrop against how these searches were carried out, including animus by Colorado Springs police leading up to the housing protest.</p><p>It is rare for appellate courts to call into question any search warrants. It’s even rarer for them to deny qualified immunity defenses. The Tenth Circuit’s decision should be celebrated as a big win for protesters and anyone concerned about police immunity for violating people’s constitutional rights. The case is now remanded back to the district court to proceed—and hopefully further vindicate the privacy rights we all have in our devices and digital data.</p>",

      "content": "<p><a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/tag/measles/\">Measles</a>. Yes, yes, I know you’re sick of hearing about it. For that, though, you must lay the blame at the feet of Donald Trump, RFK Jr., and this entire administration of clown-tools that isn’t bothering to do anything about what has become the worst continuous outbreak of the disease in America in several decades. Their fault, not mine. </p><p>And, yes, this is getting worse, not better. The <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html\">CDC’s measles tracking site</a> is a combination of woefully inaccurate and behind when it comes to current case counts (more to come on that shortly), but it’s at least useful in benchmarking what 2025 looked like. While certainly underreported, the CDC tallied 2,281 cases of measles in America last year. That site is updated only once a week on Fridays. Either due to that, or incompetence, or a more nefarious attempt to downplay the problem, the current case count is wrong.</p><p>The CDC site shows a 2026 case count of 982. That would be bad enough, but it’s actually worse. The <a href=\"https://www.medpagetoday.com/pediatrics/generalpediatrics/120027\">actual count is well over 1,000 cases</a>, which means we’re somewhere right around half of 2026’s case total as of right now. So you don’t feel the need to check a calendar, it’s still February.</p><blockquote><p><em>“It is very concerning to see more than 1,000 cases in the U.S. this early in the year,” Martha Edwards, MD, president of the South Carolina Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, told&nbsp;MedPage Today. “Already, we have more than half the number of cases seen in all of 2025, and the number of cases in 2025 was one of the highest annual case counts seen in decades.”</em></p><p><em>“As people continue to believe inaccurate information about vaccines, and as non-medical exemption rates continue to rise throughout the country, we can expect case counts to continue to rise, threatening children and immunocompromised individuals with a disease that was nearly eliminated in our country through vaccination,” she added.</em></p></blockquote><p>The true number is going to be even higher than that. There are outbreaks of one size or another in many, many states. South Carolina alone has nearly 1,000 reported cases. The truly frustrating thing about all of this is that this problem is a simple one to fix. More people need to get vaccinated for measles via the widely available MMR vaccine. </p><p>To achieve that, the government needs to do two simple things. First, cut the shit when it comes to the misinformation about vaccines that is scaring the hell out of a percentage of the population. In fact, advocate for those same vaccines. Get Kennedy hopped up on those psychedelics he likes if you need to, but he needs to be front and center telling people to get vaccinated. And stop the nonsense that is going on with supposed religious exemptions for vaccinations.</p><blockquote><p><em>Edwards highlighted the need for “accurate information about the dangers of measles virus and the complications that can ensue, in addition to communicating the safety and efficacy of the measles vaccine.”</em></p><p><em>“Raising the bar to obtain non-medical exemptions for vaccines and requiring families to gain accurate information about the dangers of vaccine-preventable illnesses and the importance of vaccines would be a huge benefit in helping to raise vaccination rates in South Carolina and the rest of the country,” she added. “We would love to see a requirement for parents to come in person to the health department, watch a video on vaccine-preventable illnesses, and have a conversation with a healthcare professional before they choose non-medical exemptions.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Second, take the data collection and sharing about measles seriously. Along those same lines, demonstrate leadership by helping state governments and local medical facilities collect and share data, strategize protective measures to stop the spread of the disease, and pump the ecosystem full of real-time accurate information about where the disease is, how it spreads, and how to handle an infection. </p><p>That isn’t happening. Instead, you get stories like how South Carolina’s state government doesn’t require any <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/south-carolina-measles-hospital-admissions?utm_source=bluesky&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=propublica-bsky&amp;utm_content=2-20\">mandatory reporting of measles cases</a> in the state when patients are admitted. One doctor in the state had to find out that patients in her own area had been hospitalized with measles from Facebook.</p><blockquote><p><em>Dr. Leigh Bragg, a pediatrician working a county away, wasn’t even aware that anyone in South Carolina had been hospitalized with measles-related illnesses until a short time later when she logged on to Facebook and saw someone relay the distraught husband’s comments.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Part of the reason Bragg didn’t know is that South Carolina doesn’t require hospitals to report admissions for measles, potentially obscuring the disease’s severity. In the absence of mandatory reporting rules, she and other doctors are often left to rely on rumors, their grapevines of colleagues, and the fragments of information the state public health agency is able to gather and willing to share.&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote><p>So, what you get is South Carolina reporting that roughly 2% of its measles cases have resulted in hospitalization. Nobody with any knowledge of measles thinks that is even remotely accurate. </p><blockquote><p><em>“A hospitalization rate at 2% is ludicrous,” said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and an infectious disease physician at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia who served on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s immunization advisory committee.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>“It’s vast underreporting,” Offit said. “Measles makes you sick.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Without that sort of accurate data, neither the state nor federal government knows where to help, nor how how much help is needed. If Kennedy and Trump wanted to actually confront this growing problem, that’s the kind of organization the federal government and its health-related agencies could help with. But this administration seems content to put its hands over its eyes and shout, “Nuh uh, I can’t see you!”</p><p>This is going to continue to get worse until real action is taken. Until then, I guess we all just try to keep an eye out for rashes. </p>",

The maker of the AI chatbot Claude said in a statement that it's not walking away from negotiations, but that new contract language received from the Defense Department \"made virtually no progress on preventing Claude's use for mass surveillance of Americans or in fully autonomous weapons.\"\n \nThe Pentagon's top spokesman has reiterated that the military wants to use Anthropic's artificial intelligence technology in legal ways and will not let the company dictate any limits ahead of a Friday deadline to agree to its demands. Sean Parnell said Thursday on social media that the Pentagon \"has no interest in using AI to conduct mass surveillance of Americans (which is illegal) nor do we want to use AI to develop autonomous weapons that operate without human involvement.\"\n \nAnthropic's policies prevent its models, such as its chatbot Claude, from being used for those purposes. It's the last of its peers -- the Pentagon also has contracts with Google, OpenAI and Elon Musk's xAI -- to not supply its technology to a new U.S. military internal network. Parnell said the Pentagon wants to \"use Anthropic's model for all lawful purposes\" but didn't offer details on what that entailed. He said opening up use of the technology would prevent the company from \"jeopardizing critical military operations.\" \"We will not let ANY company dictate the terms regarding how we make operational decisions,\" he said. In a post on X, Parnell said Anthropic will \"have until 5:01 PM ET on Friday to decide. Otherwise, we will terminate our partnership with Anthropic and deem them a supply chain risk for DOW.\"",

      "content": "<h3>3.1 Limitations about Existing ReLUfication</h3><p>\\\nWe first evaluate the sparsity of ReLULlama-7B [59] and the original Llama-2-7B [60], as shown in Table 1. The results reveal that existing ReLUfication methods can only improve the sparsity from 40% to 67%, indicating their limited effectiveness in significantly enhancing model sparsity.</p><p>\\\nTo investigate the underlying reasons for this limitation, we profile the activation distribution of the gate and up projection components separately in ReLULlama-7B and Llama-2-7B, as illustrated in Figure 3. The figure shows that after ReLUfication, the combined activation becomes more concentrated around 0, with the sparsity increasing to 67%. This can be attributed to the ReLU activation function applied after the gate weight, which masks all negative activations to zero.</p><p>\\\nTo further push the sparsity, shifted-ReLU [42] has been proposed, which adjusts the threshold of ReLU function to mask out more activations in the gate projection. However, the improvements brought by this method are limited. Another line of work is to adopt progressive sparsity regularization to the intermediate output to introduce more zero activation output [55]. However, this method carries the risk of performance degradation.</p><p>\\\nExisting ReLUfication methods primarily focus on modifying the gate component. Different from previous work, we find that existing ReLUfication doesn’t alter the activation distribution of the up projection component, as shown in Figure 3(c) and (f). According to the definition of Gated-MLP (Equation 1), the gate and up projection components jointly influence the sparsity of neuron activations in parallel. However, a significant number of activation values in the up projection component remain less than 0. This suggests that masking the outputs of the up and gate matrices that are less than 0 as inactive could introduce stronger sparsity without sacrificing non-linear capabilities. This observation motivates us to explore the possibility of further enhancing model sparsity by modifying the up projection.</p><p>(1) Yixin Song, Institute of Parallel and Distributed Systems (IPADS), Shanghai Jiao Tong University;</p><p>(2) Haotong Xie, Institute of Parallel and Distributed Systems (IPADS), Shanghai Jiao Tong University;</p><p>(3) Zhengyan Zhang, Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University;</p><p>(4) Bo Wen, Institute of Parallel and Distributed Systems (IPADS), Shanghai Jiao Tong University;</p><p>(5) Li Ma, Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory;</p><p>(6) Zeyu Mi, Institute of Parallel and Distributed Systems (IPADS), Shanghai Jiao Tong University Mi yzmizeyu@sjtu.edu.cn);</p><p>(7) Haibo Chen, Institute of Parallel and Distributed Systems (IPADS), Shanghai Jiao Tong University.</p>",

      "content": "<p><strong>Efficient Inference of LLMs</strong>. Efficient LLM inference poses challenges that necessitate a synergistic combination of algorithmic and systemic approaches. From an algorithmic standpoint, researchers have explored various methods to reduce computation and memory overheads, including compressing models [40, 63, 18, 34, 61], modifying model structures [3, 21], and speculative decoding methods [32, 12, 10]. On the systemic front, there are efforts that effectively integrate the features of downstream hardware and upper-level models to maximize the efficiency of computation and memory utilization [4, 49, 16, 64], leading to the development of more efficient frameworks like vLLM [29].</p><p>\\\nSparse activation, in particular, has emerged as a research area that demands an even tighter integration of algorithmic and systemic approaches. The selection of activation functions and the construction of activation predictors are algorithmic problems, while fully exploiting the sparse activation of LLMs on specific hardware is a systemic challenge. By leveraging sparse activation, researchers have achieved promising results in building efficient LLM inference systems [36, 56].</p><p>\\\n. MoE techniques induce effective sparsity in LLMs by determining which subset of subnetworks (referred to as \"experts\") to activate during the inference pass, often through a trained \"router\" subnetwork. This approach allows the model to enhance its capacity without escalating the computational expenses [31, 53].</p><p>\\\n<strong>Intrinsic Activation Sparsity</strong>. Intrinsic activation sparsity is known to be present in LLMs that utilize ReLU family nonlinearities in their MLP blocks [68, 33]. This phenomenon has been explored to accelerate inference speed and reduce memory usage [56, 36, 37]. With this phenomenon, each neuron can be viewed as an expert to reduce the computation overhead.</p><p>\\\n We now delve into the components of LLMs that our study aims to analyze: the Gated-MLP blocks, which are commonly used.

      "content": "<p>Exploiting activation sparsity is a promising approach to significantly accelerating the inference process of large language models (LLMs) without compromising performance. However, activation sparsity is determined by activation functions, and commonly used ones like SwiGLU and GeGLU exhibit limited sparsity. Simply replacing these functions with ReLU fails to achieve sufficient sparsity. Moreover, inadequate training data can further increase the risk of performance degradation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel dReLU function, which is designed to improve LLM activation sparsity, along with a high-quality training data mixture ratio to facilitate effective sparsification. Additionally, we leverage sparse activation patterns within the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) experts of Mixtureof-Experts (MoE) models to further boost efficiency. By applying our neuron sparsification method to the Mistral and Mixtral models, only 2.5 billion and 4.3 billion parameters are activated per inference iteration, respectively, while achieving even more powerful model performance. Evaluation results demonstrate that this sparsity achieves a 2-5× decoding speedup. Remarkably, on mobile phones, our TurboSparse-Mixtral-47B achieves an inference speed of 11 tokens per second. Our models are available at https://huggingface.co/PowerInfer.</p><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results, demonstrating emergent natural language abilities as the number of model parameters scales [9, 67]. These models have pushed the state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of downstream applications, such as QA and coding. However, most LLMs, such as Llama [60], Mistral [24], and Gemma [58], utilize all of their parameters during inference. These are known as dense models. The escalating demand for computational resources by dense models has become a significant barrier to the development of powerful and accessible AI, given the substantial costs involved.</p><p>\\\nTo address the efficiency issues inherent in dense models, conditional computation [7, 6] has emerged as a crucial approach, which refers to activating part of the neurons in a network. There are two primary methods to achieve conditional computation. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) [17, 31] is the first promising method, which introduces conditional computation by manually setting constraints on the model architecture prior to training, such as determining the number of experts to activate. This technique selectively activates specific parts of the model in response to particular inputs through a process known as expert routing, resulting in significant efficiency improvements. For instance, Switch Transformer [17] has scaled the model to the trillion-parameter level without increasing computational FLOPs significantly. Another promising method is utilizing the natural emergence of sparse activation due to the ReLU activation function [33], which naturally outputs zero elements that have no contribution in computation results. This activation sparsity presents a significant opportunity for efficient inference. Deja Vu [36] utilizes that sparsity exists in dense models due to ReLU to achieve 2× speedups. PowerInfer [56] achieving up to 11× speedups for deploying larger LLMs in a single consumer-grade GPU setting.</p><p>\\\nRecent LLMs typically prefer activation functions such as GELU [23] and Swish [50]. However, these functions do not significantly promote activation sparsity and are challenging to accelerate with conditional computation. To address this, ReLUfication [42], an existing state-of-the-art method, replaces the original activation function with ReLU and continues with pretraining. Despite its potential, this approach often struggles to achieve the desired levels of activation sparsity and may risk performance degradation [30, 59].</p><p>\\\nWe argue that the failure of existing ReLUfication methods can be attributed to two main reasons. First, simply substituting SwiGLU with ReGLU is inefficient, as it only increases sparsity from 40% to around 70%. It suggests that a deeper investigation into the model architecture is necessary to achieve higher levels of sparsity. Second, the limited diversity of pretraining data and the insufficient number of training tokens in current approaches lead to incomplete capability recovery [42, 30]. As a result, expanding the diversity of pretraining datasets and increasing the number of training tokens are critical steps towards enhancing model performance.</p><p>\\\nTo address these challenges, we first conduct a comprehensive analysis of the existing ReLUfication approach and identify that its shortcomings stem from the negative activations in the GLU component. Therefore, we propose an efficient activation function named dReLU. We apply dReLU in the pretraining of small-scale LLMs, alongside SwiGLU, and our findings indicate that LLMs using dReLU match the performance of those using SwiGLU, while also achieving close to 90% sparsity. Additionally, we collect a diverse range of pretraining corpora from the open-source community, including web, code, and mathematical datasets, to enhance the effectiveness of ReLUfication.</p><p>\\\nMeanwhile, we also conduct a sparsity analysis on MoE-based LLMs. Interestingly, we observe that the feed-forward networks (FFNs) within the experts remain sparsely activated, similar to the behavior exhibited by dense LLMs. This phenomenon suggests an opportunity to further accelerate inference speed by combining MoE techniques with ReLU-based sparse activation.</p><p>\\\nTo validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we implemented it on the Mistral-7B and Mixtral-47B models, converting them to TurboSparse-Mistral-47B and TurboSparse-Mixtral-47B, respectively. Extensive experiments across a wide range of downstream tasks demonstrate (Figure 1) that our enhanced models not only meet but often surpass the performance of their original counterparts.</p><p>\\\nRemarkably, in the TurboSparse-Mistral-7B model, we increase the average sparsity of the FFN to 90% while enhancing model capabilities. In MoE models, we further improve the sparsity in the TurboSparse-Mixtral-47B, originally introduced due to expert routing, from 75% to 97% by</p><p>\\\nincorporating sparse neuron activations. This substantial increase in sparsity significantly reduces FLOPs during the inference process.</p><p>\\\nFinally, we integrate our two new models with PowerInfer to evaluate the inference speed. Performance evaluation reveals that our models deliver an average 2.83× generation speedup.</p><p>\\\nThe key contributions of this paper include:</p><p>\\\n<strong>• Efficient dReLU activation function</strong>: Our method utilizes fewer than 150B tokens, representing less than 1% of the typical pretraining tokens (commonly 15T tokens [11]).</p><p>\\\n<strong>• Sparse activated models</strong>: We will release our sparsely-activated TurboSparse-Mistral7B and TurboSparse-Mixtral-47B models. Both models demonstrate better performance compared to the original versions.</p><p>\\\n<strong>• Practical inference speedup:</strong> Evaluation shows that with our models, we can achieve a 2-5× speedup. Notably, we can achieve up to 10 tokens/s even without a GPU on TurboSparse-Mixtral-47B.</p><p>(1) Yixin Song, Institute of Parallel and Distributed Systems (IPADS), Shanghai Jiao Tong University;</p><p>(2) Haotong Xie, Institute of Parallel and Distributed Systems (IPADS), Shanghai Jiao Tong University;</p><p>(3) Zhengyan Zhang, Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University;</p><p>(4) Bo Wen, Institute of Parallel and Distributed Systems (IPADS), Shanghai Jiao Tong University;</p><p>(5) Li Ma, Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory;</p><p>(6) Zeyu Mi, Institute of Parallel and Distributed Systems (IPADS), Shanghai Jiao Tong University Mi yzmizeyu@sjtu.edu.cn);</p><p>(7) Haibo Chen, Institute of Parallel and Distributed Systems (IPADS), Shanghai Jiao Tong University.</p>",

      "content": "<p>\\\n​India ostensibly has everything that is required to help it make one of the leading data centre hubs in the world. From low infrastructure and manpower costs to active government support, it apparently has things neatly lined up to help it do just that. But given the existing power situation in the country and the excessive reliance on coal-generated electricity, there are many challenges to be overcome to get there. </p><p>\\\nThese include straining the water resources available in the country, which are already under intense pressure to cater to the needs of nearly a billion and a half people. Land acquisition and the creation of a suitably skilled workforce are other major challenges that need to be addressed.</p><h2><strong>Data Centres- The Only Path Ahead for the Indian IT Sector?</strong></h2><p>​The IT sector is one of the few success stories that the country has seen with regard to providing a well-paying career path to millions of Indian youth this century. Apart from the technically qualified who take up jobs in this sector, there is an even larger number of people who find indirect employment working as security staff, drivers, real estate managers, and canteen personnel.</p><p>\\\n​The impending wind-down of the IT sector puts millions of livelihoods at stake, which makes it imperative that the opportunity afforded by the likely emergence of data centres as a major growth area acts as a godsend. Worldwide, the massive growth of cutting-edge technologies like AI, 5G, cloud computing, and the IoT has led to an enormous surge in the demand for data storage, thereby making data centres a vitally critical component of the upcoming and emerging technology eco-systems. </p><p>\\\nBesides, data centres are also required to help manage the data as well as processing needs of the high-growth sectors like finance, e-commerce, healthcare, gaming, and a host of other industries that rely on dependable digital support in the shape of world-class data centres.</p><p>\\\nAs a matter of fact, it is raining investments in India, when it comes to major Indian and international business groups' interest in helping grow thedata centre sector. </p><h2>Can focusing on data centres move India down the IT value chain?</h2><p>For all those tom-tomming the impending rise of India as a major global data centre hub, there is a contrary school of thought that fears that this could possibly move the Indian industry down the IT value chain. It suggests that rather than being known for low-end server farms, India should stride ahead with a focus on creating world-class SaaS products, designing chips, and building cutting-edge new-age AI models.</p><p>Despite the misgivings of a few, the overriding consensus is that data centre growth augurs well for the Indian IT industry as it helps lay the foundation for the accelerated growth and adoption of AI and Cloud technologies across the world. </p><p>\\\n​They hold that it makes eminent sense for a nation that boasts the largest and&nbsp;most data-intensive mobile user numbers in the world to work on expanding data centre capacity expansion on an unprecedented scale. Besides, the rapid and massive growth and adoption of AI have necessitated that data centre growth in the country be encouraged in every possible manner. Doing so also helps protect data sovereignty, something to which the government is fully committed.</p><p>\\\nClearly, the data centre story has just begun in India.</p>",

      "content": "<p>For as long as I have been coding in Java, we have had requirements to measure the execution time of blocks of code. While  the current good practice is to use OpenTelemetry's traces, not every company has reached this stage yet. Plus, some of the alternatives are OpenTelemetry-compatible. Let's see them in order.</p><p>The basic option is what we have been doing for ages, and what the other options rely on anyway. It's based on the following API: <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/System.html#currentTimeMillis\">System.currentTimeMillis()</a>.</p><p>\\\nUsage is pretty straightforward: \\n </p><pre><code>long start = System.currentTimeMillis();\n// Execute code\nlong end =  System.currentTimeMillis();\nSystem.out.println(\"Code executed in \" + (end - start) + \" milliseconds\");\n</code></pre><h2>The Object-Oriented Alternative</h2><p>If you are an OOP developer, then you'd rather encapsulate state. Here's a draft of such encapsulation: \\n </p><pre><code>class Timer {\n    private long startTime;\n\n    public void start() {\n        startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();\n    }\n\n    public long stop() {\n        return System.currentTimeMillis() - startTime();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre><p>\\\nYou can add a  method to reuse the object, a  method to pause the timing, or decide to have a separate  method on top of . Nothing changes the overall design. Both <a href=\"https://guava.dev/releases/19.0/api/docs/com/google/common/base/Stopwatch.html\">Guava</a> and <a href=\"https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/apidocs/org/apache/commons/lang3/time/StopWatch.html\">Apache Commons Lang</a> provide a  class, with minor variations. If either of them is on the classpath, don't reinvent the wheel and use it.</p><h2>The Functional Alternative</h2><p>A functional approach is also possible if that's what you prefer. Let's start by timing a method that accepts a parameter and returns a value, in other words, a <code>java.util.function.Function</code>. We can wrap it in a timing method that accepts the said function, and a . \\n </p><pre><code>public class TimeUtils {\n    public static &lt;I,O&gt; O time(I input, Function&lt;I,O&gt; function, Consumer&lt;Long&gt; time) {\n        long start = System.currentTimeMillis();                     //1\n        O result = function.apply(input);                            //2\n        time.accept(System.currentTimeMillis() - start);             //3\n        return result;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre><ol><li>Compute the time and wrap it in a consumer</li></ol><p>\\\nWe can use it like this: \\n </p><pre><code>var result = TimeUtils.time(\n    0,                                                               //1\n    value -&gt; value + 1,                                              //2\n    time -&gt; System.out.println(\"Time: \" + time  + \" ms\"));           //3\nSystem.out.println(\"value: \" + result);\n</code></pre><ol></ol><p>\\\nWe must add more code to cater to other method signatures. \\n </p><pre><code>public class TimeUtils {\n\n    public static &lt;T&gt; T time(Supplier&lt;T&gt; supplier, Consumer&lt;Long&gt; time) {      //1\n        long start = System.currentTimeMillis();\n        T result = supplier.get();\n        time.accept(System.currentTimeMillis() - start);\n        return result;\n    }\n\n    public static &lt;T&gt; T time(T t, Consumer&lt;T&gt; consumer, Consumer&lt;Long&gt; time) { //2\n        long start = System.currentTimeMillis();\n        consumer.accept(t);\n        time.accept(System.currentTimeMillis() - start);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre><ol></ol><p>\\\nYou can do the same with  and . If your methods require more than two parameters, you'll need to model more functional interfaces, , , , etc.</p><h2>The Annotations Alternative</h2><ul><li>An annotation, , </li><li>An annotation processor, which scans methods and filters those annotated with  at either compile-time or runtime</li></ul><p>\\\nIn the first case, we rely on bytecode manipulation to weave the OOP or functional alternatives above around the original method. In the second one, we would need to intercept the instantiation of classes having such annotated methods, and wrap them in a <a href=\"https://blog.frankel.ch/the-power-of-proxies-in-java/\">java.lang.reflect.Proxy</a>. In both cases, you generate additional code to:</p><ol><li>Call the annotated method</li><li>Do something with the time, , log execution time</li></ol><p>\\\nThe code is more complex than the two previous alternatives, so I won't develop it further.</p><p>\\\n<a href=\"https://eclipse.dev/aspectj/\">AspectJ</a>, an Aspect-Oriented Programming framework, provides the overall engine. You'll only need to develop the annotation and the wrapping code.</p><p>In this post, I described three alternatives to measure the elapsed time of code execution: object-oriented, functional, and annotations. Depending on your context, you may want to use one or the other. In any case, I suggest you don't roll out your own, but use one of the available libraries/frameworks.</p><p><em>Originally published at <a href=\"https://blog.frankel.ch/jvm-timing-options/\">A Java Geek</a> on February 22nd, 2026</em></p>",

The BBC reports: In what became known as \"Greece's Watergate,\" surveillance software called Predator was used to target 87 people -- among them government ministers, senior military officials and journalists. The four who had marketed the software were found guilty by an Athens court of misdemeanours of violating the confidentiality of telephone communications and illegally accessing personal data and conversations.\n \nThe court sentenced the four defendants to lengthy jail sentences, suspended pending appeal. Although they each face 126 years, only eight would be typically served which is the upper limit for misdemeanors. One in three of the dozens of figures targeted had also been under legal surveillance by Greece's intelligence services (EYP). Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, who had placed EYP directly under his supervision, called it a scandal, but no government officials have been charged in court and critics accuse the government of trying to cover up the truth.\n \nThe case dates back to the summer of 2022, when the current head of Greek Socialist party Pasok, Nikos Androulakis - then an MEP - was informed by the European Parliament's IT experts that he had received a malicious text message containing a link. Predator spyware, marketed by the Athens-based Israeli company Intellexa, can get access to a device's messages, camera, and microphone. Its use was illegal in Greece at that time but a new law passed in 2022 has since legalised state security use of surveillance software under strict conditions. Androulakis also discovered that he had been tracked for \"national security reasons\" by Greece's intelligence services. The scandal has since escalated into a debate over democratic accountability in Greece.",

The Verge reports: \"We're not making this decision because we're in trouble,\" Dorsey says. \"Our business is strong. Gross profit continues to grow, we continue to serve more and more customers, and profitability is improving. But something has changed. We're already seeing that the intelligence tools we're creating and using, paired with smaller and flatter teams, are enabling a new way of working which fundamentally changes what it means to build and run a company. And that's accelerating rapidly.\"\n \nDorsey opted to do a big layoff instead of gradual cuts because \"I'd rather take a hard, clear action now and build from a position we believe in than manage a slow reduction of people toward the same outcome.\" The layoffs were announced on Thursday as part of the company's Q4 2025 earnings. In a shareholder letter (PDF), Dorsey says that \"We believe Block will be significantly more valuable as a smaller, faster, intelligence-native company. Everything we do from here is in service of that.\"",

Einstein's website claims that the AI will attend lectures for you, write your papers, and even log into EdTech platforms like Canvas to take tests and participate in discussions. Educators told me that Einstein is just one of many AI tools that can do homework for students, but should be seen as a warning to schools that are increasingly seen by students as a place to gain a diploma and status as opposed to the value of education itself.\n \nIf an AI can go to school for you what's the point of going to school? For Advait Paliwal, Brown dropout and co-creator of Einstein, there isn't one. \"I think about horses,\" he said. \"They used to pull carriages, but when cars came around, I'd argue horses became a lot more free,\" he said. \"They can do whatever they want now. It would be weird if horses revolted and said 'no, I want to pull carriages, this is my purpose in life.'\" But humans aren't horses. \"This is much bigger than Einstein,\" Matthew Kirschenbaum told 404 Media. \"Einstein is symptomatic. I doubt we'll be talking about Einstein, as such, in a year. But it's symptomatic of what's about to descend on higher ed and secondary ed as well.\"\n \n[...] The attractiveness of agentic AIs is a symptom of a decades-long trend in higher education. \"Universitiesby and large adopted a transactive model of education,\" Kirschenbaum said. \"Students see their diploma as a credential. They pay tuition and at the end of four years, sometimes five years, they receive the credential and, in theory at least, that is then the springboard to economic stability and prosperity.\" Paliwal seems to agree. He told 404 Media that he attempted to change the university from the inside while working as a TA, but felt stymied by politics. \"The only way to force these institutions to evolve is to bring reality to their face. And usually the loudest critics are the ones who can't do their own job well and live in fear of automation,\" he said. \"I think we really need to question what learning even is and whether traditional educational institutions are actually helping or harming us,\" said Paliwal. \"We're seeing a rise in unemployment across degree holders because of AI, and that makes me question whether this is really what humans are born to do. We've been brainwashed as a society into valuing ourselves by the output of our productive work, and I think humanity is a lot more beautiful than that. Is it really education if we're just memorizing things to perform a task well?\"\n \nKirschenbaum added: \"What we're finding is that if forms of education can be transacted then we've just about arrived at the point where autonomous software AI agents are capable of performing the transaction on your behalf,\" he said. \"And so the whole educational paradigm has come back to essentially bite itself in the ass.\"",

Just raw C++ grit.</h3><p>Let's be honest: Python is the undisputed king of the research lab. But if you're trying to stream live H.264 video through a neural network at scale on edge hardware? Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) and its pathological obsession with memory copying are glaring liabilities.</p><p>\\\nI was recently tasked with a simple objective: create fast inference for a video stream using a vanilla ONNX runtime and a YOLOv8 segmentation model. It sounded easy on paper. Grab FFmpeg, process the frames, and encode them back out.</p><p><strong>In reality, it was a journey through engineering hell.</strong>&nbsp;Here is how I dragged a sluggish 10 FPS prototype into a rock-solid 29 FPS beast, and the \"final boss\" bugs I had to slay along the way.</p><h2>The FogAI Sandbox: Validation Before Integration</h2><p>This repository isn't a standalone toy---it is a&nbsp;. I use this environment to rigorously stress-test specific computer vision models, engine builds, and optimization patterns before they are promoted to the&nbsp;.</p><p>\\\nIf a strategy (like Zero-Copy hardware mapping) can't survive here at 29 FPS, it has no business being inside an industrial autonomous nervous system.</p><p>\\\n<strong>Previous Chapters in the FogAI Saga:</strong></p><h2>The \"Memory Copy Tax\" Trap</h2><p>Most computer vision prototypes are slow because they treat memory like a game of Hot Potato.</p><p>\\\nMy initial architecture was the \"standard\" mess: FFmpeg decoded H.264 into YUV hardware formats, converted it to an OpenCV&nbsp;&nbsp;(BGR) to feed the model, applied masks on the RGB image, converted it&nbsp;&nbsp;to YUV, and finally hit the encoder.</p><p>\\\n<strong>That's three unnecessary memory copies and two heavy pixel-format conversions.</strong>&nbsp;On an ARM CPU processing 4K frames, that overhead burns up to&nbsp;&nbsp;just moving bits around.</p><p>\\\nI fixed this by implementing&nbsp;<strong>Zero-Copy Hardware Mapping</strong>. Instead of converting the frame, I mapped the&nbsp;&nbsp;hardware Y-plane (Luminance) directly into an OpenCV&nbsp;&nbsp;wrapper.</p><pre><code>// Mapping the hardware Y-plane natively - zero memcpy, zero overhead.\ncv::Mat y_plane(yuvFrame-&gt;height, yuvFrame-&gt;width, CV_8UC1,\n                yuvFrame-&gt;data, yuvFrame-&gt;linesize);\n\n// YOLO segmentation masks now inject binary modifications directly\n// onto the hardware Y sequence.\ny_plane(bbox).setTo(0, valid_mask);\n</code></pre><p>\\\nBy bypassing the conversion overhead, I skipped the CPU bottleneck entirely. But I was still capped at 23 FPS.&nbsp;</p><h2>Mutability and Asynchronous Reordering</h2><p>Profiling showed that my threads were locked in a sequential death grip. The&nbsp;&nbsp;abstraction relies on mutating shared internal buffers. If I just spawned more threads on a single model, they contaminated each other, and the system segfaulted.</p><p>\\\n&nbsp;I instantiated a concurrent pool of&nbsp;<code>std::unique_ptr&lt;YOLO_Segment&gt;</code>&nbsp;models---one unique ONNX model instance per worker thread.</p><p>\\\nBut there was a catch:&nbsp;<strong>DASH video requires strict frame order.</strong>&nbsp;Since workers finish at different times, Frame 2 might finish before Frame 1, causing the video to stutter like a 90s jump-cut. I had to inject a reorder buffer using an&nbsp;&nbsp;to ensure flawless H.264 synchronization.</p><pre><code>// Reorder buffer logic to keep the stream sequential\nstd::map&lt;int64_t, FramePayload&gt; reorderBuffer;\nint64_t expected_pts = 0;\n\nwhile (true) {\n    auto payload = inferenceQueue.pop(); // Workers drop processed frames here\n    reorderBuffer[payload.pts] = payload;\n\n    // Emit frames only when the sequential timestamp flags align\n    while (!reorderBuffer.empty() &amp;&amp; reorderBuffer.begin()-&gt;first == expected_pts) {\n        auto it = reorderBuffer.begin();\n        encoder.writeFrame(it-&gt;second.yuvFrame, it-&gt;second.pts);\n        reorderBuffer.erase(it);\n        expected_pts++;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre><h2>The Final Boss: Thread Cache Thrashing</h2><p>On paper, the logic was perfect. In practice, my FPS plummeted to&nbsp;. My Time-To-Inference (TTI) latencies shot up from 43ms to a horrific 890ms.</p><p>\\\n<strong>I was a victim of CPU Cache Thrashing.</strong></p><p>\\\nEven though I had decoupled my locks, the underlying ML libraries (OpenCV and ONNX) were \"helping\" me by spawning their own internal threads.</p><ol><li>: Defaults to&nbsp;<code>hardware_concurrency() / 2</code>&nbsp;threads&nbsp;. With 10 workers, it spawned 100+ internal threads on my 20-core CPU.</li><li>: Automatically deploys workers for operations like&nbsp;.</li></ol><p>\\\nMy designated workers were fighting ONNX's threads, which were fighting OpenCV's threads.&nbsp;<strong>Thousands of context switches were destroying my L1/L2 caches every second.</strong></p><p>\\\nThe fix was a brutal \"No\" to implicit concurrency. I stripped the libraries of their right to spawn threads:</p><pre><code>int main() {\n  // Globally disable implicit OpenCV threading\n  cv::setNumThreads(1);\n\n  // Cap ONNX Runtime to a single thread per op\n  Ort::SessionOptions session_options;\n  session_options.SetIntraOpNumThreads(1);\n  session_options.SetInterOpNumThreads(1);\n}\n</code></pre><p>\\\nThe context-switching noise vanished. My CPU instruction cache is synchronized. The pipeline immediately hit a flawless&nbsp;&nbsp;with a TTI ceiling of ~329ms.</p><h2>Maintenance Over Ego: The Vanilla Strategy</h2><p>A common question I get is: \"If you're so focused on performance, why not fork the engine and optimize the kernels yourself?\"</p><p>\\\nThe answer is&nbsp;<strong>Technical Debt avoidance.</strong></p><p>If you hack the engine's internals, you're signing up for a never-ending maintenance loop. Every time a new version drops with support for fresh hardware---like&nbsp;&nbsp;(57% prefill boost) or&nbsp;&nbsp;--- you'd have to re-port your custom optimizations manually. By sticking with a&nbsp;, I can \"catch\" these hardware updates for free just by bumping a version number.</p><p>\\\nSimilarly, I chose not to optimize the coding/decoding pipeline. Why? Because hardware vendors already did. Whether it's&nbsp;&nbsp;or the&nbsp;, these chips have silicon-level acceleration for H.264. Focus the code on the&nbsp;; leave the codecs to the metal they were built for.</p><h2>Conclusion: Stop Guessing, Start Profiling</h2><p>Scaling AI for the real world requires peeling back the layers of abstraction we've gotten too comfortable with. Python hides these latency taxes until you put the system into production.</p><p>\\\nIf you are tasked with heavy tensor payloads on video:</p><ol><li>---work on the hardware planes directly.</li><li>---one instance per worker.</li><li><strong>Reorder sequential outputs</strong>---don't let async finish times break your stream.</li><li><strong>Never let your libraries spawn their own threads.</strong></li><li>---optimize your architecture, not the engine, to keep tech debt low.</li></ol><p>\\\nNext for the FogAI node? We're prepping&nbsp;&nbsp;for a zero-copy run…</p>",

The company says you can create images with a resolution ranging from 512px to 4K, in different aspect ratios. Nano Banana 2 can maintain character consistency for up to five characters and fidelity of up to 14 objects in one workflow for better storytelling. Users can also issue complex requests with detailed nuances for image generation, Google says. In addition, users can create media with more vibrant lighting, richer textures, and sharper detail.\n \n[...] On Google's higher-end plans, Google AI Pro and Ultra, subscribers can continue to use Nano Banana Pro for specialized tasks by regenerating images via the three-dot menu. [...] The company said that all images created through the new model will have a SynthID watermark, which is Google's mark to denote AI-generated images. The images are also interoperable with C2PA Content Credentials, created by an industry body consisting of companies like Adobe, Microsoft, Google, OpenAI, and Meta. Google said that since launching the SynthID verification in the Gemini app in November, people have used it over 20 million times.",

Built as a fork of Anza's Agave, SolanaCDN gives every Solana validator access to faster shred propagation through Pipe's global network of 35,000+ PoP (Point-of-Presence) nodes.</p><p>The client and CDN layer are both completely free. Pipe Network is providing SolanaCDN as public good infrastructure for the Solana ecosystem.</p><h3>The problem SolanaCDN solves</h3><p>Validator performance on Solana is heavily influenced by network geography. Validators closer to block producers see shreds earlier, vote sooner, and earn more rewards. Validators in less connected regions face slower propagation, missed votes, and reduced leader slot revenue regardless of their hardware.</p><p>SolanaCDN addresses this by giving validators a second, faster path for shred delivery alongside native gossip. Shreds and vote packets route through Pipe's global mesh, which continuously measures every network path and routes traffic along the fastest available route in real time.</p><p>Native gossip still runs underneath. SolanaCDN adds a parallel fast lane.</p><p>SolanaCDN delivers 3.8x faster propagation than standard Turbine, with a P50 cross-region latency of approximately 78ms compared to the roughly 300ms baseline on standard gossip.</p><p>The client also ships with Pipe-built optimizations available out of the box before the CDN layer is enabled: optimized shred coalescing for leaders (Fast Shreds), snapshot downloads from Pipe's global network, and restore progress with real-time ETAs during validator catchup.</p><h3>Public good infrastructure</h3><p>Faster propagation is a network effect. Every validator running SolanaCDN improves shred delivery globally, which means faster block finalization, fewer forks, and fewer missed slots across the entire Solana network.</p><blockquote><p>\"Validator performance shouldn't be determined by geography,\" said David Rhodus, CEO of Pipe Network. \"SolanaCDN gives every validator access to the same fast infrastructure. The more validators that run it, the faster Solana gets for everyone.\"</p></blockquote><p>SolanaCDN is a fully compatible Agave fork. Validators can install it as a drop-in replacement for their existing client. The CDN layer is optional, activated with a single configuration flag, and is non-consensus by design. It does not modify block production, consensus logic, leader scheduling, or voting rules. All CDN operations are non-blocking and fail-safe. If the CDN layer is unavailable, the validator continues operating normally.</p><p>Built-in Prometheus metrics and CDN-versus-gossip race data give operators full visibility into performance changes in their environment.</p><p>SolanaCDN is available now. The source code is published on GitHub and the client is ready to run on Solana mainnet-beta.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.pipe.network/\">Pipe Network</a> is a global edge infrastructure company built on Solana. The network operates 35,000+ hyperlocal PoP nodes globally, providing distributed storage with fast reads and real-time data delivery.

      "content": "<p>Decentralized lending has become one of the foundational pillars of modern DeFi. Protocols like Aave demonstrated that users want permissionless borrowing and yield generation without relying on traditional intermediaries. However, high network fees and fragmented liquidity across chains continue to limit adoption.</p><p>QIELend aims to solve this by delivering a familiar, capital-efficient lending experience — but on the high-performance QIE Blockchain. Keep your yield — not pay it to gas.</p><p>Built for interoperability and low-cost execution, QIELend allows users to supply assets, earn yield, and borrow against their holdings with significantly lower transaction friction than many legacy DeFi environments.</p><h3>Aave-Style Lending, Optimized for QIE</h3><p>At its core, QIELend operates similarly to leading money markets: users deposit assets into liquidity pools, earn interest from borrowers, and can unlock liquidity by borrowing against their collateral.</p><p>The key difference is infrastructure efficiency.</p><p>By operating on QIE’s high-throughput, low-fee Layer-1, QIELend enables micro-efficient lending that would be uneconomical on higher-cost networks.</p><p>Wrapped assets are tokens locked on their original blockchain and mirrored on QIE, allowing users to use ETH, BNB, and USDC within the QIE ecosystem and redeem them back at any time.</p><p>Together, these represent exposure to ETH, BNB, USD liquidity, and the native QIE ecosystem — all standardized under the QIE-20 format for seamless composability.</p><p>More markets, including XRP and Solana, are planned for upcoming releases.</p><h2>Liquidity Is Already Live</h2><p>The protocol has launched with $100,000+ in initial liquidity, providing the foundation for early lending and borrowing activity.</p><p>As utilization grows, additional liquidity providers are expected to deepen the markets and improve capital efficiency across the ecosystem.</p><h2>Why Lending Protocols Matter in DeFi</h2><p>Decentralized lending unlocks several powerful financial use cases:</p><p>Users can supply supported assets and earn interest from borrowers — similar to depositing funds in an interest-bearing account, but without centralized custody risk.</p><h2>2. Unlock Liquidity Without Selling</h2><p>Long-term holders often do not want to sell core assets like ETH or QIE. Lending protocols allow users to:</p><ul><li>Borrow stablecoins against holdings</li></ul><p>This is one of the primary drivers of DeFi lending adoption globally.</p><h2>3. Capital Efficiency for Traders</h2><p>Active traders can use borrowed liquidity to:</p><ul><li>Fund additional positions</li><li>Participate in new opportunities</li></ul><p>All while keeping their base collateral intact.</p><p>QIELend is currently offering highly competitive borrowing conditions:</p><ul><li><p>QUSDC borrowing from as low as 0.01% APR</p></li><li><p>Volatile assets like WQIE around 5% APR</p></li></ul><p>Collateral requirements are dynamically risk-based:</p><ul><li>up to ~80% drawdown protection for QUSDC</li></ul><p>This risk-weighted model helps maintain protocol stability while maximizing capital efficiency for users.</p><h2>Built for Interoperability</h2><p>A major strength of QIELend is its cross-chain asset pipeline.</p><p>Users can seamlessly onboard major crypto assets into the QIE ecosystem:</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/FS1PiuQb1sWxoW2ESuJpZswu0xk2-6o83hy8.jpeg\" alt=\"\">Bridge ETH and BNB to QIE:</p><p>👉 https://www.bridge.qie.digital/</p><p>Swap native QIE to WQIE (QIE-20 standard):</p><p>👉 https://www.swap.dex.qie.digital/swap</p><p>Standardizing assets into the QIE-20 format ensures that all markets “speak the same language,” improving composability across DeFi applications.</p><p>Getting started with QIELend is intentionally straightforward:</p><ol><li>Connect via MetaMask or QIE Wallet</li><li>Earn yield or borrow against collateral</li></ol><p>If assets imported via MetaMask are not immediately visible, users may simply refresh the interface after supplying funds.</p><p>Token contract addresses for supported assets can always be verified via the QIE explorer:</p><p>Notably, QIE Wallet already includes these assets by default for a smoother onboarding experience.</p><p>Maximizing Returns with Smart Looping</p><p>For users looking to go beyond basic lending, QIElend introduces an efficient looping mechanism designed to enhance capital productivity. Instead of earning yield on a single supply, users can manually re-supply borrowed assets in a streamlined flow, effectively increasing their exposure to lending rewards and incentive programs. Because QIElend runs on the ultra-low-fee QIE network, this strategy remains practical even for smaller portfolios where high gas costs on other chains would normally erode profits. The result is a more capital-efficient approach to DeFi yield, supported by clear health-factor visibility and built-in risk awareness tools.</p><h2>Why QIELend Matters for the QIE Ecosystem</h2><p>Every successful Layer-1 ecosystem eventually requires a robust money market. Lending protocols create:</p><ul><li>stronger DeFi composability</li></ul><p>By launching early and focusing on efficiency, QIELend is positioning itself as the core liquidity engine of the QIE financial stack.</p><p>As additional assets like XRP and Solana come online, the protocol’s addressable liquidity universe is expected to expand meaningfully.</p><h2>QIElend vs Aave: The Next Evolution in DeFi Lending Efficiency</h2><p>QIElend offers a structurally more efficient lending experience than legacy DeFi protocols such as Aave by removing much of the operational friction that arises from high gas costs and slower block-based execution. While established platforms rely on traditional on-chain transaction models where every supply, borrow, or repayment incurs meaningful network fees and timing delays, QIElend is built natively on the high-performance QIE blockchain, enabling near-zero-cost transactions and near-instant position updates.</p><p>This allows users to manage collateral more actively, reduces the incentive burden on liquidators, and supports faster market rebalancing, which in turn can translate into more competitive effective borrowing rates. By optimizing liquidity specifically for its ecosystem rather than competing across congested global markets, QIElend delivers a lending environment designed for speed, capital efficiency, and practical usability at scale.</p><p>QIELend brings a proven DeFi primitive — decentralized lending — into a faster and more cost-efficient environment on the QIE Blockchain.</p><p>With live liquidity, competitive borrowing rates, and a growing multi-asset pipeline, the protocol provides both yield opportunities for suppliers and flexible capital access for borrowers.</p><p>For users seeking Aave-style functionality without high network friction, QIELend represents an important step forward in the evolution of the QIE ecosystem.</p><p>:::tip\nThis story was published as a press release by Btcwire under HackerNoon’s Business Blogging&nbsp;</p><p>This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice.

The Chinese law enforcement official used ChatGPT like a diary to document the alleged covert campaign of suppression, OpenAI said. In one instance, Chinese operators allegedly disguised themselves as US immigration officials to warn a US-based Chinese dissident that their public statements had supposedly broken the law, according to the ChatGPT user. In another case, they describe an effort to use forged documents from a US county court to try to get a Chinese dissident's social media account taken down. \"This is what Chinese modern transnational repression looks like,\" Ben Nimmo, principal investigator at OpenAI, told reporters ahead of the report's release. \"It's not just digital. It's not just about trolling. It's industrialized. It's about trying to hit critics of the CCP [Chinese Communist Party] with everything, everywhere, all at once.\"\n \nMichael Horowitz, a former Pentagon official focused on emerging technologies, said the report from OpenAI \"clearly demonstrates the way that China is actively employing AI tools to enhance information operations. US-China AI competition is continuing to intensify. This competition is not just taking place at the frontier, but in how China's government is planning and implementing the day-to-day of their surveillance and information apparatus.\"",

Other prosecutors have refused to engage with the administration’s vindictive plans, resulting in most of them retiring or being fired. Consequently, there’s a shortage of qualified, experienced prosecutors. The void is being constantly refilled by some of the emptiest people ever to leverage MAGA loyalty into federal employment. </p><p>It took less than a year for the Trump DOJ to almost completely destroy the “<a href=\"https://www.justsecurity.org/120547/presumption-regularity-trump-administration-litigation/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.justsecurity.org/120547/presumption-regularity-trump-administration-litigation/\">presumption of regularity</a>” — the legal concept that the government is acting in good faith, even if its legal arguments aren’t the best. It took less than a year for the Trump DOJ to <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2026/01/16/welcome-to-the-resistance-grand-juries/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2026/01/16/welcome-to-the-resistance-grand-juries/\">turn grand juries</a> into coin flips.</p><blockquote><p><em>In 2016, the most recent year for which&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/fjs16st.pdf\">the Justice Department has published data</a>, federal prosecutors concluded more than 155,000 prosecutions and declined over 25,000 cases presented by investigators.&nbsp;<strong>In only six instances was a grand jury’s refusal to indict listed as the reason for dropping the matter</strong>.</em></p></blockquote><p>Six times in a one year over 25,000 declined cases. Trump’s loyalist US Attorney pick, Lindsey Halligan, put her insurance law background to work and… managed to do this twice during a  (attempted) prosecution. </p><p>When prosecutors aren’t shooting themselves in the foot (or being shot in the foot by their employer), they’re losing cases because the people they expect to back up their cases — the federal officers claiming to have been assaulted, etc. — can’t even back up their own narratives when testifying in court.</p><blockquote><p><em>The most recent significant fumble came from Minneapolis prosecutors, who last week&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/13/justice-department-moves-to-drop-charges-alfredo-alejandro-aljorna-julio-cesar-sosa-celis-ice-minnesota\">dismissed felony assault charges</a>&nbsp;they had filed against two Venezuelan men&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/news/2026/01/15/dhs-releases-more-details-about-three-violent-criminal-illegal-aliens-who-violently\">accused</a>&nbsp;of “violently beating” an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer “with weapons” on 14 January.</em></p></blockquote><p>According to the early government narrative, federal officers were assaulted by “violent criminal illegal aliens” during a stop of an undocumented Venezuelan. The officers claimed two other men came out of a nearby apartment and attacked an officer with a “snow shovel and broom handle.” That case is now dead because… well, the testifying officers lied. </p><blockquote><p><em>[O]n 12 February, prosecutors filed a motion to dismiss both men’s cases, saying: “Newly discovered evidence in this matter is materially inconsistent with the allegations in the complaint affidavit.”</em></p><p><em>ICE director Todd Lyons said ICE and the DoJ had&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/13/ice-officers-minneapolis\">opened an investigation</a>&nbsp;into the case after videos revealed “sworn testimony provided by two separate officers appears to have made untruthful statements”, marking a rare acknowledgement of possible wrongdoing by DHS officials.</em></p></blockquote><p>It’s extremely rare for the government to dismiss its  prosecution with prejudice, meaning it can’t  seek to refile these criminal charges against the alleged perpetrators. And I don’t know if Todd Lyons just misspoke or if he actually tried to use the exonerative tense while simultaneously stating these officers lied. “Sworn testimony… appears to have made untruthful statements” sounds like the courtroom version of a government official discussing a shooting by an officer with the phrase “the officer’s weapon discharged,” suggesting no one actually pulled the trigger.</p><p>Whatever the case, there’s definitely a trend here. </p><blockquote><p><em>In Chicago, of 92 people arrested for assaulting or impeding officers last fall, 74 cases have resulted in no charges; in 13 cases, charges were filed and dismissed; and five charged cases were still pending, a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fox9.com/news/dhs-arrests-assaulting-ice-agents-rarely-charged-regularly-dismissed-jan-28\">recent investigation</a>&nbsp;by Fox 9, a Minneapolis-based station, showed. As of the end of January, there have been no convictions.</em></p><p><em>In LA, the federal public defenders have won all six cases filed against ICE protesters that have gone to trial since June, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2026-02-06/federal-public-defenders-winning\">LA Times recently reported</a>. Fewer than 1% of federal criminal defendants were acquitted across the US in fiscal year 2024, with US prosecutors traditionally having a roughly 90% conviction rate, the paper noted.</em></p></blockquote><p>I assume the DOJ bloodshed will continue. Trump hates losing and he hates people who lose in his name even more. But replacing talent with loyalists isn’t going to end this losing streak. If nothing else, this iteration of the DOJ has the chance to go down in history as one of the worst ever assembled, even if we consider nothing else but its win-loss record. </p><p>It doesn’t mean the DOJ is harmless, however. It’s still more than willing to engage in vindictive prosecutions, ignore court orders, and take bite after bite of the apple (so to speak) until it finally manages to at least pierce the skin. And that means a lot of people are going to have their lives upended, even if only temporarily, just to please a tyrant who thinks anything or anyone presenting even the most minimal of opposition should be subjected to punishment. </p>",
