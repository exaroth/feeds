The conversation explores how Java programming has evolved from Java 5 to Java 25, covering major shifts like the move toward immutability, the introduction of sequenced collections, streams, and unmodifiable collections.\n\nThey delve into critical design topics including encapsulation of collections, the anemic domain model anti-pattern, the controversial unsupported operation exception, and the challenges of null handling. The book includes new chapters on usage guidance and design retrospectives that reflect decades of accumulated wisdom about the Collections Framework.\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n01:19 A 19-year journey from Java 5 to Java 25\n04:41 The shift toward immutability &amp; unmodifiable collections\n07:08 Usage guidance: Ownership &amp; the anemic domain model\n17:58 Extension points &amp; the fragile base class problem\n20:41 Design retrospective: The unsupported operation exception controversy\n27:11 The Null handling mess\n29:09 A lasting achievement\n30:21 Outro\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nMaurice Naftalin &amp; Philip Wadler • Java Generics and Collections 2nd ed • https://amzn.to/47dOp9t\nMaurice Naftalin &amp; Philip Wadler • Java Generics and Collections 1st ed • https://amzn.to/42JI03i\nJoshua Bloch • Effective Java • https://amzn.to/4oFbdoi\nVictor Grazi &amp; Jeanne Boyarsky • Real-World Java • https://amzn.to/4oCEeBR\nKevlin Henney &amp; Trisha Gee • 97 Things Every Java Programmer Should Know • https://amzn.to/3kiTwJJ\nChristian Clausen • Five Lines of Code • https://amzn.to/3s2zjyg\nNicolai Parlog • The Java Module System • https://amzn.to/3xFggR4\n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.instagram.com/goto_con\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#Java #JavaGenerics #JavaCollections #Immutability #Unmodifiability #Encapsulation #Java25 #Java5 #Null #NullHandling #Getters #Setters #AnemicDomainModel #JavaProgramming #TodayInTech #SoftwareDevelopment #SoftwareEngineering #Programming #MauriceNaftalin #StuartMarks #PhilipWadler #BookClub\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

From state-of-the-art incinerators to mushrooms that eat construction material and an effort to clean one of the world’s most sacred rivers, they are changing the narrative to show how waste is actually a valuable raw material.\n\n--------\nLike this video?

      "content": "<article>On September 15, Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night show opening monologue included comments about the shooting of right-wing media figure Charlie Kirk, and how the \"Maga gang\" was \"desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them.” \n\nSoon after, Brendan Carr, the chair of the FCC and an appointee of President Donald Trump, appeared on a conservative podcast and threatened to act against ABC and its parent company, Disney, for Kimmel’s remarks. On September 17, ABC and Disney suspended “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” \n\nKimmel’s suspension launched a national debate and protest around freedom of speech and satire. From celebrities like Wanda Sykes to Republicans like Sen. Ted Cruz, people from across the spectrum weighed in on the decision. The show returned days later on September 23, but the FCC’s actions left many questioning whether Kimmel’s First Amendment rights were violated.\n\nThis incident is just one of many instances of the gray areas of free speech making its way into the news cycle. In this video, we take a look at the origins of the “inalienable right” to free speech, how the Supreme Court has determined the boundaries of speech (including hate speech), and where free speech might be headed next with a six-justice majority of Republican appointees. As this issue continues to evolve, social media is one of the latest modes of communication adding new layers of complexity to this age-old debate.\n\nSubscribe to our channel and turn on notifications (🔔) so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

      "content": "<article>Shepherds in the Alps have been guiding their sheep through the mountains for 6,000 years. They have to climb 3,000 meters and cross rivers and glaciers. Known as Alpine transhumance, this tradition has been recognized by UNESCO as Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.  \n\nWith 1,400 sheep, Markus and his colleagues make the journey from South Tyrol to Austria every spring. Like his ancestors, Markus spends the whole summer taking care of the animals in the alpine meadows.  \n\nBut they can't make a living from farming alone. Shepherds need to find other sources of income or even change jobs altogether. Still, they say what matters to them is that the next generation can carry on this tradition.  \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

      "content": "<article>Many children and teenagers spend hours every day on Instagram, TikTok or other platforms. More and more families and schools are setting clear boundaries to counter the constant distraction of social media.\n\nStudies have linked excessive smartphone use to depression, anxiety, and difficulties concentrating. This documentary follows several families and schools that greatly restrict smartphone use for children and young people. Martin and Ursula Novotny in Sevelen, Switzerland, are convinced that phones and social media are just as addictive as alcohol or drugs. They waited until their children were older before giving them a cell phone of their own. The Lyceum Alpinum boarding school in Switzerland is equally strict: During the day, all devices remain locked away; older students get their cell phones back after class, while younger students only get them for two hours in the evening. The result: The children are significantly less distracted in class and have actual conversations at breaktime. How much screen time is healthy, and at what age does it make sense to give a child a smartphone? Child and adolescent psychotherapist Nady Mirian explains which parental rules work for social media. The schools and families featured in the documentary are not opposed to new technologies, but they advocate responsible use. Is it still realistic for children today to grow up without a smartphone — and could it actually be preferable?\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #smartphones #kids #socialmedia \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Software engineer Flavia Circiumaru and host Hannes Lowette dive deep into how this London-based regulatory compliance company transformed from a support-free-for-all to a streamlined powerhouse.\n\nFlavia Circiumaru reveals the behind-the-scenes story of building a three-desk support system that turned their support team into the ultimate connector, bridging customers, developers, and business teams like never before.

      "content": "<article>Ruth Bopp has been suffering from an incurable lung disease for years. She can no longer breathe freely. A donor organ is finally found. The film shows the beginning of her new life. Her struggle, her happiness, and her setbacks.\n\nRuth Bopp will never forget October 20, 2023. At 3:50 a.m., the ringing of her cell phone roused her from sleep. On the other end of the line: Hannover Medical School. The news: there was a suitable lung for her. An ambulance was already on its way.\nRuth Bopp suffered from pulmonary fibrosis, a serious chronic disease that makes breathing increasingly difficult. For years, she was dependent on an oxygen tank. After the transplant, she was able to breathe freely again just four days later - without a tube or device. \"It was an indescribable feeling,” she says. \"Finally being able to breathe on my own again - that was wonderful.”\nBut Ruth's story is an exception. In Germany, 8,400 patients are urgently waiting for a donor organ - but there are only 965 donors. The country has what’s known as an \"opt-in” policy: organ or tissue donation is only possible if the deceased person has given their consent during their lifetime - or if their relatives do so retroactively. In many other European countries such as France, Spain and the Netherlands, however, an \"opt-out” policy applies: anyone who does not expressly object is automatically considered a donor.\nThe documentary provides an insight into what life with a serious lung disease is like, and traces the path to transplantation. The film also documents the emotional power of hope. Ruth Bopp makes an urgent appeal to society: \"If you need an organ yourself, you want it straight away - but very few people consider the idea of donating themselves.” Yet current surveys show a positive trend: according to a study by one medical insurance group, 49% of adults in Germany now have an organ donor card - compared to 41% in 2021.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #organdonation #donors \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

      "content": "<article>Sexual violence is a well-known weapon of war. One that is deployed against men, as well as women. The enemy is not killed, but destroyed nonetheless. In this documentary, men from Ukraine, Congo and Bosnia break their silence.\n\nMost male survivors of sexual violence remain silent. So the perpetrators get away with it. Often, the perpetrators do not even have a sense of wrongdoing when they commit these war crimes.\n\nThe first men to seek justice at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in The Hague were survivors of the Bosnian War (1992-1995). This marked a turning point.\n\nZihnija Bašić from Bosnia tells how he had to fight for a long time to be recognized as a war victim after his rapes. He still suffers from the abuse to this day. Oleksiy Sivak from Ukraine has since founded a self-help group. Like his friend Roman Shapovalenko, he was sexually abused by Russian occupying forces. \n\nMasokolo Lemba from the Congo is also a member of a self-help group. Lemba fled from the war in his home country to Uganda - where survivors of sexual violence are often accused of homosexuality, which is a punishable offense in Uganda. This stigmatization and criminalization make it difficult to cope with the trauma. \n\nHistorian Regina Mühlhäuser is a member of an international research group that investigates sexual violence against men. She says: \"If you want to prevent sexual violence against men in war-time, you have to fight it in peace-time. After all, prisons and the military are often breeding grounds for this violence.\"\n\nDespite their fear of stigmatization and discrimination, the survivors in this film have chosen to tell their stories in order to bring this taboo topic to light.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #war \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

      "content": "<article>Explore the incredible, decades-long journey of Vladimir Putin, the figure who has dominated Russian politics since the turn of the millennium. This deep-dive biography traces his remarkable rise to power, from his origins as a KGB officer in Leningrad and East Germany to becoming President of Russia and one of the world's most influential leaders.\n\nWe analyse the key moments of the Putin era, including the consolidation of power, the management of Russia's economy fuelled by oil and gas, the suppression of the oligarchs, and major geopolitical events. Understand the shift from the chaos of the post-Soviet 1990s under Boris Yeltsin to the centralized, authoritarian state of modern Russia.\n\nDiscover his foreign policy initiatives, from the Chechen wars to the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. We examine his relationships with the West, NATO, and other global players, highlighting his campaign to re-establish Russia as a global power. This video is essential viewing for anyone seeking to understand the man, the Kremlin's strategies, the Russian Federation, and the future of international relations.\n\nPlease subscribe here. https://www.youtube.com/@PeopleProfiles?sub_confirmation=1\nOur second channel. https://www.youtube.com/@PeopleProfilesExtra\nFollow us on Spotify. https://open.spotify.com/show/7fKALbrzEO9Q4VVvAwWHqL\nSupport us on Patreon https://patreon.com/thepeopleprofiles\nFollow us on Twitter. https://twitter.com/tpprofiles\n\nThanks for watching!

But an increasing number are breaking the silence and fighting for respect and their rights – with words, music and physical strength. Activist Usha Vishwakarma trains women in the art of self-defense. Many members of her “Red Brigade” have themselves suffered sexual violence. Rapper JQueen channels her anger into powerful rap songs as a solo artist or with her all-female band “Wild Wild Women.” And student Sheshandeep Kaur Sidhu campaigns to get more women to enter politics. They all represent a new generation pushing back against traditional gender roles. They demand respect and personal safety despite structural barriers and societal expectations. Their resistance shows that change begins at the point where women empower themselves.\n\n00:00 Intro \n01:55 Passionate and unrelenting: Usha Vishwakarma \n03:12 Self-defense training with the Red Brigade \n04:21 Male voices: Contradictions and culture \n05:28 Training schoolgirls to fight back \n07:09 Village conversations \n09:21 Feminist author Meghna Pant’s perspective \n11:03 JQueen: Rap as rebellion \n12:47 Family, judgment and societal expectations \n15:10 Women’s safety in public \n16:20 Meghna’s story: Abuse and escape \n17:18 Politics and impunity \n18:27 Sheshandeep Kaur Sidhu: A quiet rebellion \n21:15 Visibility and education as tools of change \n24:07 Tradition vs. transformation \n25:40 Conclusion: Where do we go from here?\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #dwstories #india \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

And - could there be a connection between the answers to these two questions?\n\nUS President Donald Trump has had ties to Russia for decades. In this documentary, former KGB, FBI and CIA employees offer insights into the world of espionage, the Cold War and Trump's extensive network of connections to Russia.\n\nDuring the Cold War, numerous Russian agents infiltrated a variety of political and economic organizations in the US. In addition to industrial espionage, the missions also focused on establishing relationships with influential political figures.\n\nTrump's ties to Russia date back to this period. In 1987, he traveled to Moscow with his then-wife, Ivana, to negotiate a deal to build a luxury hotel there. Semion Mogilevich, head of the Russian mafia, was one of the first investors in New York's Trump Tower. While campaigning for president in 2016, Donald Trump was simultaneously pursuing plans to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. \n\nInvestigations into possible Kremlin interference in the presidential election reveal that more than a dozen members of the Republican campaign team had ties to Russia. And the war against Ukraine further complicates the situation: Russian President Vladimir Putin would have a keen interest in an ally who could weaken Ukraine and help him win.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #russia #usa #trump \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Most families had lived in extreme poverty for generations, and this sum was roughly equivalent to their annual salaries. The money came with no strings attached to how it could be spent. Would this lift villagers out of poverty or be another failed philanthropic endeavor?

The discussion with Kief Morris explores the practical definition of DevOps as efficient software delivery methodology, the relationship between infrastructure as code and application orchestration tools, the necessity of frameworks over custom wrapper scripts, and emerging paradigms including infrastructure from code, infrastructure as graph models, and interactive runbooks.\n\nJim emphasizes that while new approaches are interesting, maturity and standardization in existing tools often provides more value than constantly chasing new technologies.\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n01:10 The LinkedIn transformation\n04:29 Defining DevOps\n06:43 Platform engineering &amp; the infrastructure stack\n20:21 The framework question\n28:17 The future of infrastructure as code\n36:52 Outro\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nYevgeniy Brikman • Fundamentals of DevOps and Software Delivery • https://amzn.to/3WMPMFU\nYevgeniy Brikman • Terraform: Up and Running • https://amzn.to/4otpxQL\nYevgeniy Brikman • Hello, Startup • https://amzn.to/3JmV0VR\nKief Morris • Infrastructure as Code • https://amzn.to/4e6EBQc\nMauricio Salatino • Platform Engineering on Kubernetes • https://amzn.to/3X14qZK\nCharity Majors, Liz Fong-Jones &amp; George Miranda • Observability Engineering • https://amzn.to/38scbma\n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.instagram.com/goto_con\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#DevOps #SoftwareDelivery #InfrastructureAsCode #Infrastructure #Terraform #Kubernetes #Terragrunt #OpenTofu #Pulumi #CICD #YAML #TodayInTech #SoftwareDevelopment #SoftwareEngineering #Programming #Abstraction #YevgeniyBrikman #JimBrikman #KiefMorris #BookClub\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

      "content": "<article>Plastic is everywhere, not just in our rivers and oceans. It permeates the air, soil, and even our bodies. The problem is getting worse, and yet the plastics industry is increasing production.\n\nEnvironmental lawyer Steven Feit reveals that plastics are the petroleum industry’s growth strategy in the 21st century, even as the world moves away from fossil fuels as an energy source. Sarah Jeanne Royer, an oceanographer, shows the damage microplastics are doing to the coasts of Hawaii. Sharon Lavigne, a retired teacher, fights against pollution and environmental racism in her city, which is home to some of the largest plastic production facilities in the US. The film also follows a photojournalist raising awareness about the problems being caused by single-use plastics in his native Kenya, and lobbyists who aim to convince the industry’s critics that new recycling technologies will make a difference. And one Hamburg-based chemist and inventor has suggestions for how we could solve the world’s plastics problem once and for all.\n\nIs the plastics industry listening? Can people trust it to take responsibility for plastic products after the end of their life cycle? And what solutions are there in a world that is increasingly choking on plastic?\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #plastic #environment \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

      "content": "<article>How Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the scion of a storied dynasty, endured tragedy and scandal, broke with the Democratic Party and his family, stoked conspiracy theories, and is reshaping government and public health.\n\nThis journalism is made possible by viewers like you. Support your local PBS station here: https://www.pbs.org/donate\n\n“The Rise of RFK Jr.”offers a powerful portrait of how President Donald Trump’s Secretary of Health and Human Services became who he is today — starting with his childhood in the public eye as a nephew of John F. Kennedy and son of Robert F. Kennedy.\n\nThe two-hour documentary draws on rich archival footage and two dozen interviews that include Kennedy’s lifelong friends, his cousin, top political advisors, close allies in the anti-vaccine movement, scientists he has clashed with, and some he has pushed out of the government. The film is a revelatory examination of Kennedy’s life — his darkest moments, his triumphs, and the influence he’s now exerting as the head of the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n“If he continues in the current approach, it will make decisions to get vaccinated more difficult. As you see an erosion of people’s trust, you’ll see the numbers of people getting vaccinated going down, and you’ll start to see the numbers of illnesses coming back up,” says Dr. Daniel Jernigan, one of several top CDC officials who resigned under Kennedy and speaks out in the film. “And that’s an awful thing to think about in a country that has put so much into protecting Americans with vaccines so far.”\n\nBut Kennedy’s die-hard supporters, especially from the anti-vaccine movement, insist he is bringing welcome changes to America’s health system.  \n\n“He’s trying to triage the worst health situation this country has ever found itself in,” says Del Bigtree, a podcaster, vaccine critic and a close friend of Kennedy. “You don’t have time to have disagreement around you. Get someone in here who agrees with where we’re going, and let’s do this.” \n\nTimely and gripping, “The Rise of RFK Jr.” is a must-watch documentary on one of the most prominent and controversial people in U.S. politics right now, and his impact on the country. \n\n“The Rise of RFK Jr.” is a FRONTLINE production with Kirk Documentary Group, Ltd. The director is Michael Kirk. The writers are Michael Kirk and Mike Wiser. The producers are Michael Kirk, Mike Wiser, Vanessa Fica and Elliott Choi. The reporters are Vanessa Fica and Brooke Nelson Alexander. The editor-in-chief and executive producer of FRONTLINE is Raney Aronson-Rath.\n\nExplore additional reporting on “The Rise of RFK Jr.” on our website: https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/documentary/the-rise-of-rfk-jr/\n\n#Documentary #RobertFKennedyJr #Biography #Politics #PublicHealth\n\nSubscribe on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/PBSfrontline \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/frontlinepbs​​\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/frontline\n\nFRONTLINE is produced at GBH in Boston and is broadcast nationwide on PBS.

      "content": "<article>Orcas began attacking boats off the coast of southern Spain and Portugal in 2020. Several yachts were so badly damaged that they sank. But what’s behind the animals’ behavior?\n\nOrcas, also known as killer whales, compete with fishers around the globe for tuna. Until five years ago, there had never been any reports of attacks on boats. But since then, there have been repeated reports of the creatures ramming yachts, particularly in summer and spring. The orcas mostly target the rudders of the sailboats. The main focal point of the \"interactions,” as marine biologists refer to them, occur in the Strait of Gibraltar and off Portugal’s Atlantic Coast. Fishers, residents, whale watchers and researchers are puzzled by their sudden aggressive behavior. \nVarious theories have been put forward. Some think it might be linked to competition over tuna, which migrate from the Atlantic to the Mediterranean to spawn in May before returning in July. Others suspect that it is some kind of revenge action for past injuries incurred. An older female, the leader of an orca pod, allegedly had bad experiences with boats and is teaching pod members to fight back. Many marine biologists believe it is just a kind of game. What is certain is that no one has actually been seriously hurt up to now — not even on the yachts that sank, which begs the question: Are humans even the main target?  \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #orca #whale \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

She was given a Lithuanian name and forbidden from speaking German.\n\nThe end of World War Two changed not only the borders, but also countless lives—like Luise’s. She was one of hundreds of what now referred to as 'wolf children,' who fought to survive without their parents, all alone in East Prussia and the Baltics. The mass exodus from East Prussia deeply affected children. In northern East Prussia, around Königsberg, tens of thousands of people died from disease and malnutrition. Often, the children were left behind. But without their parents, any relatives, or homes, they were had to fend for themselves. Many fled from impending starvation by crossing into neighboring Lithuania, where they begged or worked for bread and other bare necessities. For decades, their stories went unrecognized. They were too young to be considered directly complicit, but just German enough to be blamed for the crimes of the Nazi regime.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #reporter #lithuania \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Through patterns like the \"solo coding event\", \"everything but the kitchen sink\" and \"space abuse\" she demonstrates how human behaviors, organizational dynamics, career frameworks, and company processes leave traces in codebases that no one intentionally designed.\n\nVanessa argues that technical leaders must look beyond pure technical excellence to understand the organic system they're working within, advocating for honest conversations about constraints and realistic architectural decisions that account for human factors.\nThe discussion extends to the emerging need for ethical engineering as our technical decisions increasingly impact society at unprecedented speed, with practical advice for teams to analyze their own systems through the lens of tech, people, and product dimensions.\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n01:19 What is Holistic Engineering?\n06:28 Patterns in the wild\n09:31 The domain library problem\n11:58 The gap between theory &amp; practice\n13:34 Taking a broader view: The challenge of organizational forces\n15:17 Recognizing the slippery slope\n18:13 Strategies for recognition &amp; mitigation\n26:55 Starting small: Team-level analysis\n33:51 The future: Ethical engineering &amp; changing technology\n36:50 Code as a mirror\n38:11 Outro\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nAndrew Harmel-Law • Facilitating Software Architecture • https://amzn.eu/d/5kZKVfU\nAdam Tornhill • Your Code as a Crime Scene • https://amzn.to/3FI5E2V\nChristopher Alexander • A Pattern Language • https://amzn.to/3Urefj3\nDiana Montalion • Learning Systems Thinking • https://amzn.to/3ZpycdJ\nDonella H.

      "content": "<article>The Spanish Habsburgs were the most powerful royal family in Europe until they destroyed themselves from within. This is the tragic story of Charles II, \"The Bewitched,\" the last king of his line, whose very existence was a death sentence for an empire.\n\nWe dive deep into the science of his incredible inbreeding coefficient, revealing how centuries of cousin-on-cousin marriages concentrated disastrous recessive genes. Charles II was born with a level of consanguinity higher than that of a child born of a brother-sister union, leading to a host of debilitating conditions: the infamous Habsburg jaw that prevented him from chewing, a large tongue, developmental delays (he couldn't walk until age eight), and extreme frailty.\n\nHis physical state was so pitiable that courtiers genuinely believed he was possessed, leading to multiple failed exorcisms. But the true curse was biological. He was infertile and impotent, and his death at age 38, childless and suffering, didn't just end a man's life; it plunged Europe into the devastating War of the Spanish Succession.\n\nPlease subscribe here. https://www.youtube.com/@PeopleProfiles?sub_confirmation=1\nOur second channel. https://www.youtube.com/@PeopleProfilesExtra\nFollow us on Spotify. https://open.spotify.com/show/7fKALbrzEO9Q4VVvAwWHqL\nSupport us on Patreon https://patreon.com/thepeopleprofiles\nFollow us on Twitter. https://twitter.com/tpprofiles\n\nThanks for watching!

      "content": "<article>Shepherds have been crossing the Alps with their animals for 6,000 years. That means climbing 3,000 meters in altitude, all while crossing rivers and a glacier. Called \"transhumance,” the seasonal movement of livestock is now world cultural heritage.\n\nAlong with 1,400 sheep, shepherd Markus and his colleagues travel from South Tyrol to Austria every spring, journeying back again in the fall. Just like his ancestors, Markus looks after the animals on the mountain pastures throughout the summer. It’s an arduous task, but also a dream job.\n\nMarkus is also responsible for ensuring that the crossing of the Alps runs smoothly again this year. This is no easy feat, as the route over rockfall and ice is dangerous for animals and humans alike. Accidents happen again and again: \"One slip and you're gone,\" he says. \"But still, it's something very special. For me, it's an honor to be part of it.\"\n\nMarkus spends the summer alone on the mountain pasture, looking after healthy and sick sheep for months on end. A little further down, in the Schnalstal Valley, his brother Johann looks after the family farm and the animals that spend the summer there.\n\nThe two brothers are bucking a trend, as sheep farming is hardly financially viable anymore. There is little money to be made from the wool and meat of the animals. Shepherds and farmers increasingly need an additional source of income, or are changing their focus completely. \n\nNonetheless, South Tyrolean sheep farmers are still hoping that this season will be better than the last, meaning one without injured sheep, and without accidents. It is important to them that the next generation will also have the opportunity to continue the tradition that has been going on for thousands of years.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #sheep #Alps \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

But Russian authorities have fought back.\n\nIn March 2019, Alexander Gabyshev set out on an 8,000-kilometer walk from Siberia to Moscow. His destination: the Kremlin. He planned to use traditional shamanic rites to drive out the \"demon”: Russian President Vladimir Putin. But Alexander Gabyshev’s protest march quickly attracted attention, and he became too much for the authorities. He continued to protest despite several arrests, until finally, in January 2021, authorities stormed his house and took him away to a psychiatric hospital. An expert has classified him as mentally ill, but Amnesty International calls him a political prisoner. Lawyers are fighting to secure his release - so far without success.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

But behind the pitch decks and performance charts lies a growing crisis. In this video, we explore:\n🔹 Why private equity firms are struggling to exit investments\n🔹 The illusion of stability created by stale pricing\n🔹 The role of leverage in driving returns — and fragility\n🔹 The push into 401(k)s and what it means for retail investors\n🔹 The rise of continuation funds, NAV loans, and other liquidity maneuvers\n🔹 The social and regulatory backlash against PE roll-up strategies\n🔹 What Bain, Buffett, and Cliff Asness really think about the model\nFrom inflated IRRs to collapsing portfolio companies, the cracks are starting to show. Is private equity still a smart bet — or just a sophisticated shell game?\n\nPatrick's Books:\nStatistics For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3eerLA0\nDerivatives For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3cjsyPF\nCorporate Finance:  https://amzn.to/3fn3rvC \n\nWays To Support The Channel\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/PatrickBoyleOnFinance\nBuy Me a Coffee: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/patrickboyle\n\nVisit our website: https://www.onfinance.org\nFollow Patrick on Twitter Here: https://bsky.app/profile/pboyle.bsky.social\n\nBusiness Inquiries ➡️ sponsors@onfinance.org\n\nPatrick Boyle On Finance Podcast:\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/7uhrWlDvxzy9hLoW0EYf0b\nApple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/patrick-boyle-on-finance/id1547740313\nGoogle Podcasts: https://tinyurl.com/62862nve\n\nJoin this channel to support making this content:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCASM0cgfkJxQ1ICmRilfHLw/join</article>",

      "content": "<article>Invasive fungal infections are increasingly leading to life-threatening diseases worldwide. And in agriculture, fungi pose a massive threat to harvests. And the available antidotes for humans and plants are increasingly losing their effectiveness.\n\nWorldwide, fungal infections are already responsible for three times as many deaths as malaria. Experts are extremely concerned about infections caused by invasive fungi, as the numbers are rising rapidly. \n\nThe focus is on two types of fungi: Aspergillus fumigatus and Candida auris. Both have been classified as particularly dangerous by the WHO. Since the discovery of Candida auris, there have been repeated life-threatening outbreaks worldwide, especially in hospitals. \n\nUp to 60 percent of infections are currently fatal. The fungus is spreading rapidly. So far, it has been detected in more than 50 countries. Molds such as Aspergillus fumigatus are also a cause for concern, as the fungi are now resistant to many drugs and disinfectants. \n\nThe documentary shows what tulips, molds and pneumonia have to do with each other, and what role intensive agriculture and climate change play in the spread of fungal infections. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #fungi #health \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

      "content": "<article>In this season 2 mega episode of Man vs. Monster, join Richard Terry as he investigates mysterious animals around the world. Featuring six full episodes:\n\nAfrican Werewolf\nReports are coming in from Tanzania that sound like they're straight out of a horror movie. The peace of the farmlands is being disturbed by the blood curdling screams of farmers being dragged off to their deaths by a huge violent creature. Locals say the beast is so murderous and cunning that it could be a human transformed into an animal. Not only that but they say the full moon is a sign of impending attack. Sounds like Richard is on the tail of an African Werewolf. \n\nMekong Flesh-Eater\nAcross Thailand's rivers and waterways, a terrifying creature is attacking unsuspecting fisherman. Petrified locals report an aquatic giant that strikes in shallow water, gouging flesh and leaving victims with horrendous wounds and intense pain. Nat Geo WILD joins adventurer Richard Terry as he travels to the Mekong River in search of the mysterious creature. Victim interviews and investigation of the attack sites could hold the clues to the identity of this Mekong Flesh-Eater. \n\nMan-Eating Menace\nFrom the remote swamps of eastern India, reports are coming in of villages full of widows -- their husbands killed by a creature that attacks unseen and unprovoked. The culprit is one of nature's most revered animals: the Bengal tiger. Normally, tigers shy away from people, but in this region thousands of innocent locals have died at the jaws of these cats, and it's only getting worse -- but why? Nat Geo joins adventurer Richard Terry as he investigates this pattern of strange animal behavior. \n\nWinged Assassin\nAdventurer Richard Terry travels to a remote Indonesian island chain to investigate reports of a flying creature said to attack humans. Villagers say the monster has a huge wingspan and makes a terrifying sound before it attacks, swooping in on its victims in the forest and in villages. Determined to find out what animal is behind the attacks, Nat Geo WILD follows Terry on a journey that takes him from the rainforest canopy, along crocodile-infested rivers and into dark, damp caves.  \n\nAmazon River Beast\nDeep in the Brazilian Amazon, an unknown creature is responsible for a string of brutal attacks on villagers. The monster is said to strike ferociously and when least expected, and disappear into the jungle before it can be caught, leaving its victims with horrible wounds and terrified to enter the waters again. Nat Geo WILD joins adventurer Richard Terry on his quest to track down this Amazon River Beast.  \n\nBrazilian Bigfoot\nFor generations, tales of a creature called the mapinguari have been passed down among Amazonian villagers. They describe a tall, shaggy beast that attacks with little warning, calling out with a deafening roar. In the world's largest rainforest, new species are discovered every few days, and after hearing stories from villagers who claim they came face to face with the creature, Richard Terry tries to determine whether the mapinguari is more than a myth. \n\nMan vs. Monster | S2 E1 - 6\n\nExplore the World with National Geographic subscriptions: https://natgeo.com/ytngmagazine\n\n➡ Subscribe: https://on.natgeo.com/41A7tf0\n➡ Get wild with more Nat Geo Animals Full Episodes: https://on.natgeo.com/3V2EOLO\n➡ Get Nat Geo Full Episodes: https://on.natgeo.com/3V5ZfHI\n\nAnd check out more National Geographic series and specials here:\n➡ Disney Plus: https://on.natgeo.com/3q6on5p\n➡ Hulu: https://on.natgeo.com/3Qor0Ko\n➡ NGTV: https://natgeo.com/tv\n➡ ABC: https://abc.com\n\n#NationalGeographic #ManVsMonster #MegaEpisode\n\nAbout National Geographic Animals:\nNational Geographic Animals brings you closer to the wild than ever before.

Determined to help, Chris designs a therapeutic “road trip back in time,” revisiting key places from their past to explore the powerful science of social connection — a crucial but overlooked tool in protecting brain health. Along the way, Chris uncovers surprising research showing that connection isn’t just good for the soul; it can also reduce the risk of dementia, slow cognitive decline, and even prolong life. This emotional journey across Australia becomes a chance for Chris and Craig to deepen their bond, relive memories, and discover how love, community and nostalgia can be potent medicine. \n\nExplore the World with National Geographic subscriptions: https://natgeo.com/ytngmagazine\n\n➡ Subscribe: https://on.natgeo.com/4p5A0D6\n➡ Get more Nat Geo Full Episodes: https://on.natgeo.com/3V5ZfHI\n➡ Get wild with Nat Geo Animals Full Episodes: https://on.natgeo.com/3V2EOLO\n\nAnd check out more National Geographic series and specials here:\n➡ Disney Plus: https://on.natgeo.com/3q6on5p\n➡ Hulu: https://on.natgeo.com/3Qor0Ko\n➡ NGTV: https://natgeo.com/tv\n➡ ABC: https://abc.com\n\n#NationalGeographic #RoadTriptoRemember #ChrisHemsworth\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for critically acclaimed storytelling around science and exploration.

Join us for an extraordinary escape story: 19-year-old Charles Hare's audacious journey through enemy territory in 1809, disguised as a French customs officer, under the constant threat of being shot as an enemy spy as he travelled secretly by road and river, terrified his cover would be blown, desperate to get home.\n\nNow, for the very first time, the National Maritime Museum is displaying the uniform and Hare's first-hand account of his amazing exploits, and History Hit has exclusive access to the process.

This two-part series looks at the journey from production to plate, exploring the hidden world behind the food we eat. \n*[PART 1: https://youtu.be/IIU1KM74MxA]*\n\nIn \"Food for Thought,” photographer and filmmaker Kadir van Lohuizen embarks on an investigative journey into the food we eat each day. His research takes him to the US, China, the Netherlands, Kenya, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates—exposing the problems and contradictions of globalized food production.\n\n\"Food for Thought” delves into global challenges of food sustainability in different parts of the world. In the US, where climate change is wreaking havoc, high-tech farming is being touted as a potential savior. China, on the cutting edge of agricultural research, balances traditional farming with AI-driven innovation in order to feed its vast population. Kenya, sometimes called Europe’s vegetable garden, has to balance ethics and economics with its massive export industry. Meanwhile, in the arid landscapes of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, ambitious efforts towards food self-sufficiency reveal the paradoxes of farming in the desert.\n\n\"Food for Thought” is a wake-up call for global agriculture, asking the question: How can we secure the future of our food supply without further endangering our planet?\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #food #nutrition \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

At the heart of this shift is the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), one of the most influential organizations with close ties to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling political party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). \n\nThe RSS and the RSS women’s wing teach Hindu-nationalist ideology through discipline, rituals, and targeted youth training, focusing on the idea of a Hindu nation. However, critics widely classify it as a paramilitary organization. At the same time, religious minorities and interfaith couples are facing increasing social pressures, discrimination, and uncertainty.  \n\nWatch the full documentary “India at a crossroads - 100 years of the Hindu nationalist RSS movement” on the DW Documentary YouTube channel. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #RSS #India \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Doing it while enabling rapid innovation for iconic brands like Taco Bell, KFC, Pizza Hut, and Habit Burger is even harder. Each brand and market has unique operational and customer needs, which means pure architectures often give way to real-world constraints: speed, cost, and team composition.\n\nThis talk is a behind-the-scenes look at how we built the Byte by Yum! platform using a pragmatic mix of AWS services: containers where it makes sense, serverless where it shines, and managed open source where we need control. We’ll show how we created a core platform that supports menu management, ordering, kitchen operations, and AI workflows, using domain primitives that enable rapid iteration and reduced time to market.\n\nWe’ll also explore how we delivered new products quickly using AWS services like EventBridge schedules, DynamoDB streams, and Express Step Functions – while achieving high availability, extreme scale, and cost efficiency.\n\nThis is a no-nonsense look at what it takes to build and evolve a global platform: the tradeoffs, the building blocks, and why there’s never a silver bullet.

      "content": "<article>Every year in Mexico, thousands of women are killed simply because they are women. Femicide rates in the country are among the highest in the world. Authorities often turn a blind eye, allowing perpetrators to go unpunished. But resistance is growing.\n\nAra Osorio's daughter, Lesvy Berlín, was found dead at a university in Mexico City on May 3, 2017, with a telephone cord around her neck. The authorities initially investigated her death as a suicide, but it soon became clear that Lesvy had been strangled by a man. Ara Osorio and students at the university were determined to see justice done, pressuring the public prosecutor's office until it finally opened a murder investigation. \n\nAra Osorio is part of the protest movement \"Ni una menos”, or \"Not one less.” The movement has seen women come together to demand justice for the thousands of killings that happen each year. Authorities say 3,427 women were killed in 2024. Only 829 of these killings were classified as femicides, which has been strongly criticized. \n\nWomen are disproportionately targeted by patriarchal structures, caught up in drug-related gang violence, or killed by their partners. But women in Mexico are fighting back - with protest marches, art, and programs offering practical support. One such program was started by Flora Gutiérrez, an indigenous lawyer from Oaxaca. She started an association that supports women who have been victims of violence. Initiatives like these provide hope that the cycle of violence and impunity may yet be broken.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #Mexico #women \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

It was a labour of love, and I wanted it be reflective of my quality control on my channel, not a rush to make a quick buck. \n\nIt grew out of Great Art Explained on YouTube, but it isn’t simply a transcript of the films. I look at other artists, and other artworks, as well as going deeper into artists I've covered on YouTube. \n\nThe channel is fast, visual and conversational, designed for a world of scrolling and streaming, where attention moves quickly. A book moves differently. It gives the artworks space to breathe, lets you linger on details, and allows room for stories that don’t always fit within a fifteen-minute video.\nOn screen, the camera directs your gaze. On the page, you decide where to look and for how long. In print, reproductions are still and permanent; in video, they are moving and fleeting. Both approaches make art accessible, but they invite different kinds of engagement.\n\nThink of this book not as a replacement for the channel but as its companion. The videos aim to make great art feel immediate. The book offers the chance to slow down, return, and reflect.\n\nAvailable now!</article>",

      "content": "<article>For centuries, the United States was considered a nation of immigrants. President Trump has changed that with a brutal crackdown on immigration. But with opposition growing, arguments about how to define American identity are on the rise, once more.\n\nSince 2025, the US government has been taking a tougher stance on immigration. The US Immigration and Custom’s Enforcement, or ICE, is raiding homes, businesses, and previously protected areas, like churches, schools and hospitals. It’s one of the major flashpoints in US politics right now. But criticism of Trump’s immigration policies is growing. What does the future hold?\n\nThe effects of US immigration policy shifts are most visible along the southern border. In this edition of Close Up, we head to rural Arizona and meet Wendy, whose asylum status is in jeopardy, Isabel, an activist advocating for immigrants, Michael, a karate instructor and DJ who supports the president’s approach—then finally José, a son of immigrants and a proud MAGA fan and US citizen. \n\nThe film explores both the US’s struggle for a new identity and the increasing polarization taking hold of the country.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #Trump #USA #MAGA \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

The parts that were a good match, the parts that weren’t, and how we dealt with it.\n• How to develop a component of an interactive system like Kubernetes while avoiding the dreaded compile/push/deploy time sink.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nBurns, Beda &amp; Hightower • Kubernetes: Up &amp; Running • https://amzn.to/3sueuuI\nBurns, Villalba, Strebel &amp; Evenson • Kubernetes Best Practices • https://amzn.to/3gBXRsr\nLiz Rice • Container Security • https://amzn.to/3oU4iJe\nLiz Rice • Kubernetes Security • https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/kubernetes-security/9781492039075\nJohn Arundel &amp; Justin Domingus • Cloud Native DevOps with Kubernetes • https://amzn.to/3hKZvI5\nHausenblas &amp; Schimanski • Programming Kubernetes • https://amzn.to/3qTvKch\n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.instagram.com/goto_con\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#Kubernetes #k8s #Programming #Containers #CloudNative #Golang #SoftwareEngineering #Programming #KenScambler #SoftwareDevelopment #YOWcon\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

      "content": "<article>Dive into the turbulent story of Georges Danton, the most complex and charismatic leader of the French Revolution! Known as \"The Thunderer\" for his powerful oratory, Danton was the key force behind the overthrow of the monarchy and the establishment of the First French Republic. He became the first President of the Committee of Public Safety, using his famous call for \"daring\" to mobilize the nation against foreign threats during the French Revolutionary Wars.\n\nBut Danton's path to power was cut short by his own growing sense of moderation. Watch as the Jacobin giant falls out with his former ally, Maximilien Robespierre, challenging the escalating violence of the Reign of Terror. This video explores Danton's controversial legacy, his accusations of corruption, his dramatic arrest, and his final moment at the guillotine in 1794, marking a tragic turning point in the Revolution.\n\nPlease subscribe here. https://www.youtube.com/@PeopleProfiles?sub_confirmation=1\nOur second channel. https://www.youtube.com/@PeopleProfilesExtra\nFollow us on Spotify. https://open.spotify.com/show/7fKALbrzEO9Q4VVvAwWHqL\nSupport us on Patreon https://patreon.com/thepeopleprofiles\nFollow us on Twitter. https://twitter.com/tpprofiles\n\nThanks for watching!

Pollution, noise, light, and even our garbage are driving changes in their DNA.

But not all species can adapt. As our cities continue to expand, accommodating wildlife in urban spaces will become crucial to their survival. \n\nFind out more in ‘Nature's response to urban sprawl’.

      "content": "<article>In October 1962, the world narrowly escaped a nuclear war between the US and the Soviet Union. US President John F. Kennedy halted the escalation at the last minute. But behind the scenes, Washington had made concessions to the Kremlin.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Berlin was already a flashpoint of the Cold War. The USSR issued an ultimatum demanding the withdrawal of Western Allies from the divided city. The US responded by stationing nuclear-capable medium-range missiles in Turkey, near the Soviet border. Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev saw this as a provocation.\n\nIn response, Moscow moved to station its own missiles in Cuba - just 150 kilometers from the United States. The plan - operation Anadyr - began in June 1962, under strict secrecy. Around 80 Soviet ships transported more than 50,000 soldiers and dozens of nuclear-capable missiles to the Caribbean island. It was not until October that US reconnaissance aircraft with high-resolution cameras discovered the missile sites. On October 22, Kennedy addressed Americans in a dramatic televised speech. He announced a naval blockade against Cuba and declared the Soviet missiles a direct threat to the US.\n\nAs the US Navy mobilized to stop the Soviet ships, the world held its breath. A single mistake or misunderstanding could have resulted in a Third World War - with nuclear weapons.\n\nKhrushchev recognized the danger and proposed a diplomatic solution: the withdrawal of missiles from Cuba in exchange for a security guarantee for the Castro government and the dismantling of US missile sites in Turkey. Kennedy agreed. Publicly, the US presented the outcome as a triumph - but at their insistence, the withdrawal of US missiles was kept secret.\n\nDespite having achieved his goal, Khrushchev was removed from power in 1964. The Cuban Missile Crisis highlighted the fragility of the power balance between the two nuclear superpowers, and led both to take measures to prevent future escalations.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #cuba \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

      "content": "<article>For people with autism, recognizing a smile or enjoying a touch is often not possible. More and more people, especially children, are being diagnosed with \"autism spectrum disorder”, a complex neurological condition.\n\nDespite an increase in the number of people diagnosed with autism, many autistic people still remain undiagnosed. This is because autism is highly complex and can manifest in many different ways. Some of those affected can live lives similar to people without autism, while others require lifelong care.\n\nThe causes of autism are also a mystery. Scientists around the world are working to find out why the brains of people on the autism spectrum develop differently. This would help medical practitioners to establish reliable methods of diagnosis and effective therapies. The documentary explores what \"living on the autism spectrum” means for those affected, accompanying autistic people in their daily lives and showing the challenges they face. It also follows two renowned autism researchers, Tony Attwood and Professor Ludger Tebartz van Elst, dispelling prejudices that many people have about autistic people. Because, as experts remind us, autism is a very diverse condition.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #autism \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.
