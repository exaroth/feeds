      "content": "<article>Vox senior technology correspondent Adam Clark Estes has a cautionary tale about chatbots.\n\nWhat started as using AI for tedious chores — meal plans, grocery lists, quick research — quietly morphed into hours talking to a chatbot. And Adam isn’t alone. As chatbots get better at flattery, emotional support, and companionship, researchers are seeing more users (including teens) slip into dependency without realizing it.\n\nAdam unpacks how chatbots are designed to keep us coming back, why young people are especially vulnerable, and what happens when adults can’t walk away — in some cases, leading to severe mental health crises. \n\nThis is the first episode of Reporter Extras, a new Patreon-exclusive Vox video series that gives you a behind-the-scenes look at how our journalists create their work.\n\nIf you value this kind of in-depth journalism, join Vox on Patreon to unlock the full episode, get unlimited access to Vox.com, and support the reporting that makes it possible. https://www.patreon.com/posts/144397104?pr=true\n\nSubscribe to our channel and turn on notifications (🔔) so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Support your local PBS station here: https://www.pbs.org/donate\n\nThe soldier, who went by the call sign “Sheva,”  was part of the Ukrainian platoon at the heart of \"2000 Meters to Andriivka,\" the new feature documentary from FRONTLINE, The Associated Press and the Academy Award-winning team behind \"20 Days in Mariupol.\"\n\nWeaving together quiet moments of reflection, like this one with Sheva, and vivid battle footage, \"2000 Meters to Andriivka\" documents the toll of the Russia-Ukraine war from a personal and devastating vantage point. The film follows Ukraine’s 3rd Assault Brigade as it carries out a grueling, meter-by-meter counteroffensive that aims to retake the strategic Ukrainian town of Andriivka from Russia -- and as the soldiers realize that for them, the war may never end.\n\nSheva would be killed in a battle and die in a hospital five months after this scene was filmed. Read more about Sheva's story at pbs.org/frontline, and watch the full documentary on @frontline starting Nov. 25, 2025.\n\n“2000 Meters to Andriivka” is written, filmed and directed by filmmaker and Associated Press journalist Mstyslav Chernov. It is produced by Chernov, FRONTLINE’s senior documentary editor and producer Michelle Mizner and FRONTLINE’s editor-in-chief and executive producer Raney Aronson-Rath. It is edited by Michelle Mizner. The film is co-produced and includes additional cinematography by AP journalist Alex Babenko; is composed by two-time Grammy Award®-winning composer and music-producer Sam Slater; and is executive produced by Raney Aronson-Rath and the AP's Derl McCrudden. Distributed domestically by PBS Distribution and internationally by Dogwoof, “2000 Meters to Andriivka” is a FRONTLINE FEATURES and The Associated Press production.\n\n#ukraine #ukrainewar #ukrainerussiawar #documentaryexcerpt</article>",

      "content": "<article>Fentanyl is estimated to be fifty times as potent as heroin and is extremely addictive. The number of people in Poland abusing this powerful painkiller is growing. There have been dozens of fatalities.\n\nMichal lives in a small town south of Gdansk. Because of the stigma surrounding people with addiction, he prefers to remain anonymous. Every two weeks, he travels to Święciec to take methadone, a substitute drug, at the addiction clinic of the psychiatric hospital. After using various drugs, he started taking fentanyl, the strongest of all opiates. \nFentanyl is used to treat people with severe pain and as an anesthetic. Addicts remove the gel from pain patches and inject it directly into their bloodstream. There have been dozens of fatal overdoses in Poland. Michal has also lost one of his close friends. Corrupt pharmacists are believed to have sold large quantities of fentanyl patches to dealers. The authorities have since put a stop to this.  \nIn Żuromin, Jadwiga Karpinska lost her son Pawel to a fatal overdose. Their town, a two-hour drive from the capital Warsaw, was known as the country’s unofficial fentanyl capital in 2024. That changed when police detained a well-known local dealer. The drug continues to be available there, but in smaller quantities.\nElementary school teacher Adam Ejnik believes in prevention. He wants to keep his students away from the drug by raising awareness about its dangers. \nArtur from Łódź has managed to get off fentanyl. A few years ago, he was so addicted, he had lost the will to live. Today, his girlfriend Agnieszka helps him stay clean. His goal: he hopes to finish his psychology degree and work as a therapist to help other addicts get off the extremely powerful drug.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #poland #fentanyl \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

They build their bodies from thin air, move water with pressures that would crush a human, and grow using a fascinating system of living cables wrapped in layers of corpses. Under their bark lies a razor-thin strip of living cells, working endlessly to move water hundreds of meters, build indestructible wood, and coordinate millions of functions. \nHow do trees work, and what are they even made of? What makes these ancient giants so resilient, and maybe even immortal?\n\n\nOUR CHANNELS\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nGerman:        https://kgs.link/youtubeDE\nSpanish:        https://kgs.link/youtubeES\nFrench:          https://kgs.link/youtubeFR\nPortuguese:  https://kgs.link/youtubePT\nArabic:           https://kgs.link/youtubeAR\nHindi:             https://kgs.link/youtubeHI\nJapanese:     https://kgs.link/youtubeJA\nKorean:          https://kgs.link/youtubeKO\n\n\nHOW CAN YOU SUPPORT US?\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nThis is how we make our living and it would be a pleasure if you support us!\n\nGet Products designed with ❤️ https://shop.kgs.link\nJoin the Patreon Bird Army 🐧  https://kgs.link/patreon  \n\n\nDISCUSSIONS &amp; SOCIAL MEDIA\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nInstagram:     https://kgs.link/instagram\nTikTok:           https://kgs.link/tiktok\nReddit:            https://kgs.link/reddit\nDiscord:          https://kgs.link/discord\nTwitter:           https://kgs.link/twitter\nBluesky:          https://kgs.link/bluesky\nFacebook:      https://kgs.link/facebook\nNewsletter:    https://kgs.link/newsletter\n\n\nOUR VOICE\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nThe kurzgesagt voice is from \nSteve Taylor:  https://kgs.link/youtube-voice\n\n\nOUR MUSIC ♬♪\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\n700+ minutes of kurzgesagt soundtracks by Epic Mountain:\n\nSpotify:            https://kgs.link/music-spotify\nSoundcloud:   https://kgs.link/music-soundcloud\nBandcamp:     https://kgs.link/music-bandcamp\nYoutube:          https://kgs.link/music-youtube\nFacebook:       https://kgs.link/music-facebook\n\nThe soundtrack of this video:\nSoundCloud: https://bit.ly/4riwGp9\nBandcamp: https://bit.ly/44uVxMG\n\nIf you want to help us caption this video, please send subtitles to subtitle@kurzgesagt.org\nYou can find info on what subtitle files work on YouTube here:\nhttps://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2734698?hl=en-GB&amp;ref_topic=7296214\nThank you!\n\n\n🐦🐧🐤 PATREON BIRD ARMY 🐤🐧🐦\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nMany thanks to our wonderful Patreons (from http://kgs.link/patreon) who support us every month and made this video possible:\nAcácio Correia, AeryaRia, aforsberg, Ahmad Seet, Alexander, Alexander Devlin, amia, Andres Ramos, Anna Duwenig, Anthony Hanson, Anton Abrahamsson, AonReo, Armond Aghanian, Asaf Yishai, Benjamin R., Bharath Ron, Brendan Ryan-Lewis, Christoph Lurz, Christoph Rau, Clay, Cliff Hudson, ConsterCoaster, Corbin Meier, Dale Kipple, Delano Stijns, dotvhs, Dylan Gafner, eddie k, Ela Yohannan, Enigma66, Eran Aviram, Erwin Heckler, Eva Markiewicz, Evil Cookie, FeelinaraIRL, Frankie Ennis, G, Geoff Evans, George Hutter, hazardx, Hugh Mungus, Inigo vd, Ireleigh, Isabelll, Ishaan Varma, Jack Sparrow, James Emmitt Zugar, James Pinkerton, james trotta, Jason Desrosiers, Jason Murley, Jens Begemann, Jesse, Jesus Mayo, Joann Taijala, Joseph Gauthier, jurd, Justin, KawasakiDragonno, Keddan, KekzL, Lauren Woolsey LeGrandAnanas, Lulidine, LumpyMammot, manchicken, Mark A Vargas, MasterOfTree, Matthew Brady, Matthew Brodeur, Maximilian Schons, Mead Landis, Ms. Ewing, Mykola Balakin, Nathaniel Bauernfeind, Nicholas McCalla, Owen, PaladinSpartac, Phoenix_Flames, Primalis, Quinn Wilson, Rath Robin, Robert Cudinski, Robin Hockett, Ryan Snead, Ryan Staunch, Ryan Thompson, SentinelD20, Siddharth Chaini, Sindre Nistad, Soko Divanovic, Spleens, Stacey Nicholson, Stephen Conlon, Strudy, Syi, Sérgio P., Thomas Mitchell, Thomas Stokes, Thomas Toombes, Tom Kocmi, Warren MacEvoy, William Lingenfelter</article>",

The approach has proven successful even in traditional corporate environments, ultimately creating more maintainable code bases where development teams actually enjoy working and can respond effectively to changing requirements.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOK\nAndrew Harmel-Law • Facilitating Software Architecture • https://amzn.eu/d/5kZKVfU\nInspiring Tech Leaders - The Technology Podcast (https://www.priceroberts.com/) \nInterviews with Tech Leaders and insights on the latest emerging technology trends.\n\n\nListen on: Apple Podcasts (https://podcasts.apple.com/podcast/id1563026924)  &nbsp; Spotify (https://open.spotify.com/show/5ihWZxxIa2rEnzbx5tdKfH) \n\n\nBluesky (https://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com) \nTwitter (https://twitter.com/GOTOcon) \nInstagram (https://www.instagram.com/goto_con) \nLinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-) \nFacebook (https://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences) \n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

Support your local PBS station here: https://www.pbs.org/donate​.\n\n“2000 Meters to Andriivka” documents the toll of the Russia-Ukraine war from a personal and devastating vantage point. Following his historic account of the civilian toll in Mariupol, Ukrainian filmmaker and Associated Press journalist Mstyslav Chernov turns his lens towards Ukrainian soldiers — who they are, where they came from, and the impossible decisions they face in the trenches as they fight for every inch of their land.\n\nThe documentary follows a Ukrainian brigade battling through approximately one mile of a heavily fortified forest on their mission to liberate the Russian-occupied village of Andriivka amid a failing counteroffensive in 2023. \n\nWeaving together original footage, intensive Ukrainian Army bodycam video and powerful moments of reflection with haunting intimacy, the documentary reveals how the farther the soldiers advance through their destroyed homeland, the more they realize that, for them, this war may never end.\n\n“2000 Meters to Andriivka” is written, filmed and directed by filmmaker and Associated Press journalist Mstyslav Chernov. It is produced by Chernov, FRONTLINE’s senior documentary editor and producer Michelle Mizner and FRONTLINE’s editor-in-chief and executive producer Raney Aronson-Rath. It is edited by Michelle Mizner. The film is co-produced and includes additional cinematography by AP journalist Alex Babenko, and is composed by two-time Grammy Award®-winning composer and music-producer Sam Slater. Distributed domestically by PBS Distribution and internationally by Dogwoof, “2000 Meters to Andriivka” is a FRONTLINE FEATURES and The Associated Press production.</article>",

      "content": "<article>The Houthi militia has been fighting for supremacy in Yemen for years. The conflict has become a civil war, with international involvement. The Middle East conflict has further escalated the situation and exacerbated Yemen’s humanitarian crisis.\n\nYemen, at the southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula, is one of the poorest countries in the world. After many years of civil war, the country is in dire condition. Cities have been destroyed, supplies are lacking, and there is political repression. A lost generation of children is growing up without schooling, medical care or proper nutrition. Aid supplies are blocked, looted or sold on the black market.\n\nThe conflict in Yemen began in 2004 with the uprising of the Shiite Houthis against the Sunni-dominated Yemeni government. In 2014, the Houthis occupied the capital Sanaa - allegedly with the support of Iran. The response was a military intervention, led by Saudi Arabia. \n\nA proxy war, in which the people suffer: So far, there have been over 400,000 fatalities. More than 20 million people - around half the population - are now dependent on humanitarian aid.\n\nFollowing Hamas's terrorist attack on Israel in October, 2023 and the subsequent Israeli ground offensive in Gaza, the conflict is spreading. Houthi militias are not only attacking Israel, but also ships in the Red Sea - and thus international trade. The US and its allies have responded with air strikes. The civilian population, already suffering, is bearing the brunt of the continuing violence.\nBetween blockades, war and geopolitics, is Yemen in danger of being torn apart?\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #yemen #houthi \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

      "content": "<article>Afghanistan has risen from sporting outsider to one of the world's top cricket nations. The unlikely journey has brought hope to a country with rare reason to celebrate while illuminating the complex politics of the Taliban's relationship to cricket.\n\nCricket has grown into a vital part of life in Afghanistan - offering glimmers of joy and excitement to the countless Afghans that play and watch the game. And while the stunning achievements of the men's national team have fostered unity and hope, the Taliban's return to power means half of the country is barred from the festivities and many female players were forced to flee their homeland. \n\nIn a crisis-ridden country like Afghanistan, cricketing success is both deeply meaningful to its people and a complex political challenge, presenting the Taliban government with an opportunity to use the sport at home and abroad. Cricket has offered star players like Gulbadin Naib a path from childhood refugee camps to international acclaim, while all over the country young players like Jamal Stanikzai dream of one day taking part in the team's success. For Afghan refugees like former women's national team player Firooza Amiri, cricket is both a beloved sport and a form of resistance. Deutsche Welle accompanies current and former players and fans in Afghanistan, Australia and Dubai to tell the intertwined stories of Afghan cricket.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #cricket #afghanistan #dwsports\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

For a long time, scientists believed insects acted mostly out of instinct and weren’t particularly intelligent, in part, because most of them only live for a few weeks. But it turns out, the insect world is far more complex than we previously thought.  \n\nMany insect species have brains the size of a grain of rice, but are still able to store images, shapes, colors and experiences, and can even learn new skills and work with tools.  \n\nIn many species, individual insects even develop unique traits and personalities, like bravery or aggressiveness. One reason for this could be that species with diverse individuals can better adapt to environmental changes, giving them an evolutionary advantage for survival. \n\nWatch the full documentary “Smart insects - The astonishing intelligence of bumblebees, wasps &amp; co.” on the DW Documentary YouTube channel.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #insects \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

It is not a ‘celebration’ of winter but a recognition of it, an honest, empathetic portrayal of human beings enduring and coexisting with the overwhelming force of nature. \n\nIt is that bittersweet tension, that makes Hunters in the snow, such an emotive and timeless image. \n\nIMPORTANT!  \nSubscribe and click the bell icon to be notified! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCePD... \n\nI would like to thank all my Patreon supporters, in particular Alan Stewart, Alexander Velser, AMSN, Andrei Surei, Anja Zeutschel, Bria Nicole Art, Brian J Rich, David Asabreu, Ed Gobbi, \"Elias', Eric Mann, Francis Song, Griffin Evans, Jemma Theivendran, Joe Kool, Jon Hanzen, Julio Cardenas, Kibibi Shaw, Louise Tait, Matthew Bondaryk, Mitch Kosowski, Monte St Johns, New Curiosity, Paul Ark, Paul Waterman, Daniel Rakovski, Sam Blakelock, Sean Welgemoed, Stephen Beresford, Tanya Moore, Theresa Garfink, and Toni Ko. \n\n\"What a brilliant series this is\" - Stephen Fry on Twitter (X) \n\nCREDITS \nScript co-written by Laura Beardsell-Moore \nOpening \nAnimation and Title Sequence by Brian Adsit (instagram https://instagram.com/brian_vfx?utm_m... and Behance www.behance.com/badsit88) \nRecording by Robert Lewis \n\nVIDEOS \nAll the videos, songs, images, and graphics used in the video belong to their respective owners and I or this channel do not claim any right over them. \n\nMUSIC \nPeteris Vasks - Musica Dolorosa \n\nFILMS \nSolaris Directed by Andrei Tarkovsky, 1973\nMirror by Andrei Tarkovsky, 1975\nMelancholia - Lars von Trier, 2011\nFrames - Abba Kiarostami, 2017 \nThe Mill and the Cross - Lech Majewski\n\nBOOKS \nBruegel: Peasants, Fools, and Demons by Rainer &amp; Rose-Marie Hagen\nBruegel.

      "content": "<article>Throughout its 250-year existence, the United States has almost always been at war. From its beginnings right through to the present day, the country's armed forces have shaped both American identity and the political decisions of its leaders.\n\nThe United States of America has been at war throughout most of its 250-year existence. From the War of Independence right through to contemporary armed conflicts, the nation's armed forces have not only shaped American identity but also influenced the political decisions of its leaders.\nThe documentary takes a deep dive into this complex history and analyzes the \"hot\" and \"cold\" wars that have shaped US history in order to draw important lessons for the future.\n\nThe film explores how successive generations of US Americans viewed and experienced each conflict. It also examines the enduring impact of these wars on American society and reveals how military engagement was utilized to hone the image and the role of the US on the global stage.\nAround 30 high-profile experts, military personnel and politicians examine the military history of the United States, explaining its successes and failures, as well as its impact on the world and the everyday lives of Americans.\n\nThe film looks to the past to gain a keener understanding of how today's military decisions will affect tomorrow's world — as well as their far-reaching impact on democracy and society. And with US President Donald Trump now in office for a second term, it asks what role the army plays in Trump's world view.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #usa #war \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Trump’s gamble on US magnetism appears to have yielded some wins, but whether they last remains to be seen.

      "content": "<article>The Nuremberg trials started 80 years ago and marked a milestone in the establishment of international law. The images of high-ranking Nazis in the dock are seared into our collective memory.\n\nThe Nuremberg trials were a series of military tribunals staged by the Allies after World War Two. The first and best-known trial ended in October 1946 with the sentencing to death of 12 high-ranking Nazis.  Adolf Hitler’s right-hand man, Hermann Göring, Germany’s foreign minister during the Nazi regime, Joachim von Ribbentrop, Armaments Minister and chief architect Albert Speer, anti-Semitic demagogue Julius Streicher and high-ranking SS officer Ernst Kaltenbrunner were among those in the dock. The court met for the first time in Nuremberg in November 1945 and was in session for 218 days.\nBy making the Nazi elite answer for their crimes in this hugely complex trial, the Allies ushered in the era of modern international law. Using photos and archive film material, the documentary reconstructs what went on in the court room, as well as revealing what went on behind the scenes. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #germany #nurembergtrials \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Researchers call this tantalizing torment a “tip-of-the-tongue state,” and it’s something everyone experiences. But what’s actually happening when a word’s caught here, and how can you best get it unstuck? Cella Wright explores why your brain can struggle with recall.\n\nLesson by Cella Wright, directed by Avi Ofer.\n\nSupport Our Non-Profit Mission\n----------------------------------------------\nSupport us on Patreon: http://bit.ly/TEDEdPatreon\nCheck out our merch: http://bit.ly/TEDEDShop\n----------------------------------------------\n\nConnect With Us\n----------------------------------------------\nSign up for our newsletter: http://bit.ly/TEDEdNewsletter\nFollow us on Facebook: http://bit.ly/TEDEdFacebook\nFind us on Twitter: http://bit.ly/TEDEdTwitter\nPeep us on Instagram: http://bit.ly/TEDEdInstagram\n----------------------------------------------\n\nKeep Learning\n----------------------------------------------\nView full lesson: https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-do-some-words-get-stuck-on-the-tip-of-your-tongue-cella-wright\nDig deeper with additional resources: https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-do-some-words-get-stuck-on-the-tip-of-your-tongue-cella-wright/digdeeper\n\nAnimator's website: https://aviofer.com\nMusic: https://www.wonderboyaudio.com\n----------------------------------------------\n\nThank you so much to our patrons for your support!

Nobody knows for sure just how they made it all the way to Germany, but it’s possible they were brought to Europe by Canadian soldiers stationed in Karlsruhe, where they began spreading non-stop.  \n\nThey started off in ponds and small bodies of water in South-Western Germany. But now, 30 years after they first got here, they’ve been spotted hundreds of kilometers upriver. They can’t really outcompete larger predators, but in places with little competition, they’ve been hard to stop. Crayfish reproduce incredibly fast – a single female cay lay hundreds of eggs, leaving locals, scientists and conservationists scrambling for ways to stop its quick spread and preserve their local ecosystems.  \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

They explore what SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) is and why it enables dramatic performance improvements for specific computational tasks, discuss when assembly language programming is justified versus using compiler intrinsics, and examine the challenges of writing vectorized algorithms. Dan shares insights from his career optimizing image analysis software and explains how understanding low-level architecture can improve code quality even when writing in higher-level languages.\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n01:39 What is Assembly Language &amp; why does it matter?\n05:58 Understanding SIMD programming\n10:11 Writing SIMD algorithms\n13:16 Challenges of SIMD programming\n18:58 Intrinsics vs Assembly Language\n22:41 Real-world optimization examples\n24:42 Development workflow &amp; benchmarking\n30:12 Outro\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nDaniel Kusswurm • Modern X86 Assembly Language Programming v3 • https://amzn.to/44hIVZf\nDaniel Kusswurm • Modern X86 Assembly Language Programming v2 • https://amzn.to/3LJlMIZ\nDaniel Kusswurm • Modern X86 Assembly Language Programming v1 • https://amzn.to/43DPANj\nDaniel Kusswurm • Modern Arm Assembly Language Programming • https://amzn.to/4rbyH6M\nDaniel Kusswurm • Practical C++ STL Programming • https://amzn.to/4ickAdq\nDaniel Kusswurm • Modern Parallel Programming with C++ and Assembly Language • https://amzn.to/4o5J3SF\n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.instagram.com/goto_con\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#X86 #Assembly #AssemblyLanguage #SIMD #SIMDAlgorithms #SSE #Compiler #Intrinsics #Benchmarking #CompilerExplorer #ARM #ARMx64 #64bit #AVX #AVX2 #AVX512 #TodayInTech #SoftwareDevelopment #SoftwareEngineering #Programming #DanielKusswurm #DanKusswurm #MattGodbolt #BookClub\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

      "content": "<article>Queer people who live in rural areas and come out often face major challenges. While the LGBTQ+ community has battled to secure its place in urban centers, out in the provinces, worlds frequently collide.\n\n\"I could move to the big city like so many others do, but I want to make a difference.\" Eric is gay and lives in a small town in the state of Saxony-Anhalt, where he struggles to find acceptance. Especially when he organizes the region's first Pride parade. \"The district is a right-wing stronghold. Many people around me are concerned and afraid,\" he says. Against all odds and defying prejudice, Eric goes ahead with the Pride event, amid a large police presence. Will the celebration pass off peacefully in this small town? \"I used to know many people who actually think homosexuality is a disease,\" says Eric.\n \nFor a long time, Tina, who comes from a small village in the Black Forest region, struggled to accept herself. When she wanted to have a child, she moved back to her home village with wife Sarah. But with four generations living under her parents' roof, the couple is finding things hard: \"We did wonder if it would work out, because you're moving to a village and leaving the anonymity of the big city behind,\" says Tina.\n\nChristian is also about to leave Berlin to live with his fiancé Jens in a small village in Mecklenburg. They plan to live in a house that Christian has inherited, but until now the building has housed the village’s only pub - which has had to close to make way for the couple. Will they ever find acceptance in the village?\n\nWhen Joe came out as non-binary around two years ago and started wearing skirts and makeup, it was mainly Joe's mother who had to field questions from people in the small East Frisian village where they live. Joe is keen to change their name on their official ID, in line with Germany's Self-Determination Act, but the registry office is uncooperative. \"It was one of the worst phone calls of my life,\" says Joe. But they are not giving up.\n\nThe documentary allows viewers to witness quiet struggles as well as moments of solidarity. It demonstrates that social change and acceptance can develop outside of urban centers. Rural communities, too, can be places where queer people find ways to assert their place in society.\n\n[Warning: This documentary addresses the topic of suicide. If you or someone you know is suffering from serious emotional strain or suicidal thoughts, do not hesitate to seek professional help.

      "content": "<article>Did Texas execute an innocent man? This 2010 documentary investigates the controversial death penalty case of Cameron Todd Willingham — and the scientific validity of the arson evidence used to convict him of the deaths of his three children. \n\nThis journalism is made possible by viewers like you. Support your local PBS station here: https://www.pbs.org/donate\n\nThe execution of Cameron Todd Willingham in Texas in 2004 became the center of a national debate about the death penalty and the science behind arson investigations.\n\nDrawing on unique access to those closest to the Willingham case, “Death by Fire” meticulously examines the evidence used to convict Willingham, and explores the implications of the execution of a possibly innocent man.\n\nThrough interviews with Willingham’s friends and family, the documentary tells the story of a troubled young man with a history of domestic violence who quickly became the prime suspect in his children’s deaths. The discovery by fire investigators of more than 20 indicators of arson at the scene of the fire pointed directly to Willingham’s guilt.\n\nBut the re-examination of the case turned on a critical finding that came only weeks before Willingham’s scheduled execution: The investigators who determined that he had set the fire that killed his three daughters had relied on an outdated understanding of arson evidence. \n\nExperts told FRONTLINE there could be hundreds of innocent people in prison for arson cases where the evidence was misinterpreted by investigators.\n\n“Death by Fire” is a FRONTLINE production with Kirk Documentary Group in association with StartBox Films. The producer and director is Jessie Deeter. The writers are Mike Wiser and Michael Kirk. The co-producer is Mike Wiser and the senior producer is Michael Kirk. \n\nExplore additional reporting on “Death by Fire” on our website:\nhttps://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/documentary/death-by-fire/\n\n#Documentary #Texas #DeathPenalty \n\nSubscribe on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/PBSfrontline\nSign up for our newsletter: https://frontline.org/newsletter\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/frontlinepbs\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/frontline\nBluesky: https://bsky.app/profile/frontlinepbs.bsky.social\n\nFRONTLINE is produced at GBH in Boston and is broadcast nationwide on PBS.

      "content": "<article>Thomas Cromwell rose from the streets of Putney to become the most powerful man in England, serving as Henry VIII's chief minister and architect of the English Reformation. For nearly a decade, Cromwell wielded unprecedented authority, orchestrating the break from Rome, the dissolution of the monasteries, and the destruction of Anne Boleyn. Yet his bloody partnership with the volatile Tudor king would end exactly as it began - with violence, betrayal, and the executioner's axe.\n\nThis documentary chronicles the complete story of Henry VIII and Thomas Cromwell's deadly alliance, from Cromwell's meteoric rise through the Tudor court to his catastrophic fall from grace in 1540. We examine how this blacksmith's son transformed himself into Henry's indispensable fixer, the brutal methods he employed to consolidate royal power, his role in the executions of Catherine Howard, Anne Boleyn, and Thomas More, and the fatal miscalculation that cost him everything. Through contemporary accounts and modern scholarship, we reveal the true nature of one of history's most consequential and ruthless political partnerships.\n\nPlease subscribe here. https://www.youtube.com/@PeopleProfiles?sub_confirmation=1\nOur second channel. https://www.youtube.com/@PeopleProfilesExtra\nFollow us on Spotify. https://open.spotify.com/show/7fKALbrzEO9Q4VVvAwWHqL\nSupport us on Patreon https://patreon.com/thepeopleprofiles\nFollow us on Twitter. https://twitter.com/tpprofiles\n\nThanks for watching!

      "content": "<article>Sulaiman Tadmory came to Germany in 2015 after fleeing the civil war in Syria. With dictator Bashar al-Assad and his regime now gone, he's one of thousands of Syrians wondering whether it's time to return home.\n\nIt’s been ten years since Tadmory left Syria. Now, a German citizen, he’s embarking on a personal journey to find out whether his future lies in his adopted country or his homeland. Does he feel there is a place for him in Germany amid growing racism, including calls for \"remigration\"? And does the Syria he grew up in still exist after 13 years of war?\nIn addition to visiting his native city of Homs, Tadmory also speaks with other Syrians in Germany who come from a variety of backgrounds and have differing opinions on the big question. They include Mohammed in Dortmund, a metalworker who has decided to go back to Syria for good under the German government’s voluntary return program; Leen, a student living in Berlin, who believes that Germany - despite political tensions and challenges - remains the safest place for her; and Maher, a dentist in Münster who, along with his German fiancé, is developing an emergency \"Plan B,” in case the German far-right AfD party gains control of the government. \nTadmory is torn. He wants to stay in Germany, but would return to Syria if his mother were deported.\nCan and will Germany ever feel like home? If so, under what conditions? These questions resonate not just with Tadmory, but with countless other migrants who have built a new life in this country. And he also poses these very questions to the politicians who are shaping both public discourse and policy. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #syria #germany #refugees #deportation \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Moving beyond the \"AI will replace developers\" narrative, they reveal how AI assistants excel at the tedious work of typing, scaffolding, and error handling while remaining surprisingly bad at the nuanced thinking that experienced developers bring to complex systems.\n\nTheir discussion illuminates a more mature relationship with AI tools: one where developers maintain agency over design decisions while leveraging AI's strengths in automation, synthesis, and rapid prototyping. The result is a pragmatic roadmap for using AI to amplify human expertise rather than replace it.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nDiana Montalion • Learning Systems Thinking • https://amzn.to/3ZpycdJ\nAndrew Harmel-Law • Facilitating Software Architecture • https://amzn.eu/d/5kZKVfU\nDonella H.

      "content": "<article>Thanksgiving is arguably one of the yummiest celebrations in the US and one where you’re expected to be home for the holidays. But, what are your options when going home isn’t one? In recent decades, Friendsgiving has emerged as the go-to choice as an additional event or complete alternative to Thanksgiving. \n\nIt can be tough during the holidays with the pressures of trying to get everything just right to present yourself as a well-adjusted adult hosting a Thanksgiving dinner, or to be present with family that may think they know what’s  best for you. Friendsgiving has opened the door to do things a little bit differently. The intention is to have a laid-back, low-pressure (or over-the-top, totally up to the host) potluck-style dinner with friends and other people in your chosen community — because as cheesy as it sounds, friends are the new family. \n\nFriendsgiving was seemingly plucked from obscurity in the 2010s. While its exact origins are debated, it was likely widely practiced prior to its fame on The Real Housewives of New Jersey in 2011. Even then it took a few more years for it to pick up steam in the media. \n\nWatch this video to learn how Friendsgiving went from a friendly potluck dinner to a cultural mainstay.\n\nThis video is presented by T-Mobile 5G Home Internet.

      "content": "<article>It was Aug. 30, 2020. The Gulf Livestock 1 was steaming into the path of Maysak, a Category 4 typhoon that was hurtling up the Philippine Sea with 130 mph winds and 20-foot waves. Even the sturdiest cargo ship would take a beating in such conditions. But for the Gulf, Maysak spelled catastrophe.\n\nGulf Livestock 1 was due to arrive at Tangshan, a massive Chinese port complex about 100 miles from Beijing, in four days. It was the height of pandemic gridlock in ports around the world, especially in China, where ships often waited more than two days to offload. For the Gulf, which carried a shifting, easily frightened cargo of 5,867 dairy cattle, every extra day at anchor heightened the risk of the animals becoming ill or dying—and of costing the exporter and ship owner money.\n\nThe ship continued its route towards China. The eventual sinking of Gulf Livestock 1 was the worst disaster in the history of the live-export trade, an industry made up of about 150 ships with a market value totaling as much as $30 billion. While the industry’s size makes it a tiny fraction of the $2.2 trillion global commercial shipping fleet, which numbers around 100,000 vessels, the live-export fleet was already disproportionately prone to catastrophic accidents.\n\nThis story was produced in collaboration with the Food &amp; Environment Reporting Network, a nonprofit investigative news organization.\n\n0:00 Introduction\n1:30 Live export industry\n3:49 Gulf Livestock 1\n5:37 2020 journey\n8:00 After the sinking\n10:38 New findings\n14:32 Global reactions\n15:58 Safety improvements\n17:00 Industry outlook\n18:14 Conclusion\n\n--------\nLike this video?

This is very important as the more you like and comment on each video the better it will perform, so please help us if you can. Thank you!\n\nWas John Brown a heroic freedom fighter or a dangerous terrorist? On 16th October 1859, this radical abolitionist led an armed raid on Harper's Ferry, attempting to spark a slave rebellion that would tear America apart. Sixteen months later, the nation was plunged into Civil War. \n\nBrown's execution made him a martyr in the North and a monster in the South. His body was \"a-mouldering in the grave,\" but his actions ignited the powder keg that had been building for decades. No single figure better embodies the violent collision between slavery and freedom that defined 19th century America. \n\nFrom his brutal actions in “Bleeding Kansas\" to his final words on the gallows, this is the story of the man who forced America to confront its original sin—and paid the ultimate price.\n\nPlease subscribe here. https://www.youtube.com/@PeopleProfiles?sub_confirmation=1\nOur second channel. https://www.youtube.com/@PeopleProfilesExtra\nFollow us on Spotify. https://open.spotify.com/show/7fKALbrzEO9Q4VVvAwWHqL\nSupport us on Patreon https://patreon.com/thepeopleprofiles\nFollow us on Twitter. https://twitter.com/tpprofiles\n\nThanks for watching!

      "content": "<article>While heat and drought reduce the groundwater in many places, water consumption continues to rise. Is it possible to reverse this global trend by using water more sparingly in households, industry, and agriculture?\n\n\"Water is an important but not an infinite resource,\" warns Dorothea Mergel, a project engineer at Hamburg's water company, adding that water is becoming increasingly scarce both in Germany and around the world. Mergel is working to make sure that the drinking water supply in Germany's second-largest city is sustainable. One idea is a pilot project in which \"gray water\" - wastewater from our showers and kitchen sinks - is used to flush toilets and water gardens, thus saving precious drinking water.\n\nIn Tunisia, every drop counts - especially in agriculture. The country has a high proportion of desert, with temperatures reaching up to 45 degrees Celsius in summer. Agricultural scientist Dr. Bellachheb Chahbani has developed a method of traditional irrigation that reduces water use by 70%. Dr. Chahbani visits olive farmers in the south of the country, helping to set up the water-saving system.\n\nIndustry has the potential to save enormous amounts of water, too. Water conservationist Andreas Kirketerp works at the Carlsberg Brewery in Fredericia, Denmark. His innovative system recycles the water used to clean bottles, cans, equipment, and tanks, making it usable again. The saving amounts to 1,800 cubic meters of water every day - or the daily water consumption of around 14,000 people. The effect on the local drinking water supply has been hugely positive.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #water #drought \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

The California-headquartered firm, which operates out of financial centers including New York, Paris and London, was founded by her family as a traditional asset manager, but has now expanded into alternative sectors including real estate and private credit, which has soared after banks tightened their lending following the 2008 financial crisis. Johnson, whose tenure has included challenges like the pandemic and major acquisitions, also discusses her embrace of digital assets, technology and blockchain in order to position for the future of finance and investing.\n\n#investing #Finance #leadership \n\n--------\nLike this video?

      "content": "<article>The Ukrainian intelligence service has intercepted thousands of Russian soldiers' telephone conversations. They are harrowing testimonies to the cruelty of war. In this film, the calls are juxtaposed against images of the destruction of Ukraine.\n\nOksana Karpovych's documentary sets images of the war in Ukraine against audio of Russian soldiers phoning their families from the front line. It links the destruction of the nation with those responsible for it, thus highlighting the tragedy of war. But the documentary also shows Ukrainians trying to live relatively normal lives despite the attack on their country.\n\nTension can be heard in the voices of the Russian soldiers. Their accounts reflect the phases they have gone through during their deployment, from a sense of supposed heroism in response to propaganda, to doubt and subsequent disillusionment. Sometimes the fighters lose their heads, committing looting and other crimes. These diverse recordings reveal the full extent of Russian aggression in Ukraine.\n\nThe award-winning and acclaimed film is a powerful document about the dehumanizing power of war. The juxtaposition of images of the war with the intercepted conversations between Russian soldiers and their relatives amounts to a profound reflection on the banality of evil.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #ukraine #russiaukrainewar \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

This is very important as the more you like and comment on each video the better it will perform, so please help us if you can. Thank you! \n\nSigmund Freud revolutionized our understanding of the human mind—but behind the genius was a man battling his own demons. This is the story of how an addict doctor from Vienna became the father of psychoanalysis and changed psychology forever.\n\nBorn in 1856 in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Freud's early life was marked by ambition and intellectual curiosity. As a young neurologist, he experimented with narcotics, believing it to be a miracle drug—a decision that would haunt him for decades. Yet this same flawed man would go on to unlock the secrets of the unconscious mind, revealing hidden desires, repressed memories, and the dark forces that drive human behavior.\n\nFrom his groundbreaking work on dream interpretation to his controversial theories of psychosexual development, Freud's ideas sparked both revolution and outrage. His concept of the id, ego, and superego fundamentally changed how we understand personality. His exploration of childhood trauma laid the foundation for modern psychotherapy. But his personal struggles—his addiction, his complex relationships, his flight from Nazi-occupied Austria—reveal a man as troubled as the patients he treated.\n\nThis documentary explores the complete life of Sigmund Freud: the brilliant theorist who gave us the \"Freudian slip,\" the flawed human who couldn't escape his own addictions, and the cultural icon whose influence extends far beyond the therapist's couch. Through his triumphs and failures, we see how one man's inner turmoil became the key to understanding the human psyche itself.\n\nAll human history essentially comes down to biography. Every revolution in thought, every breakthrough in science, is shaped by the decisions and experiences of individual human beings. To understand the birth of modern psychology, we must understand the addicted genius who created it.\n\nPlease subscribe here. https://www.youtube.com/@PeopleProfiles?sub_confirmation=1\nOur second channel. https://www.youtube.com/@PeopleProfilesExtra\nFollow us on Spotify. https://open.spotify.com/show/7fKALbrzEO9Q4VVvAwWHqL\nSupport us on Patreon https://patreon.com/thepeopleprofiles\nFollow us on Twitter. https://twitter.com/tpprofiles\n\nThanks for watching!

For others, a place that swallows them up.\n\nAt night, the major changes that the megacity is currently undergoing become apparent: The economic crisis is weighing on people's minds and pocketbooks and poverty is constantly on the rise. \n\nŞevket is a cab driver. For more than 20 years, he’s been taking photo portraits of people living on the streets during his night-time journeys. His subjects now include entire families who no longer have a place to live. \n\nTowards morning, Şevket caters to people coming from the clubs, ferrying them safely home. Istanbul is famous for its party scene, but it is clearly feeling the effects of the prescribed Islamization.\n\nŞükrü is a choreographer who teaches dances that, as he says, bring out the feminine side. His students include men and women.\n\nIn today's Turkey, this kind of activity is increasingly difficult and can only be practiced in special, protected spaces.\n\nThe film accompanies people who seek happiness in the city they love. Many want to preserve its former cosmopolitan flair. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #turkey #istanbul \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

      "content": "<article>Earth’s population is growing. We’re expected to have 2 billion more mouths to feed by 2050. But how can we feed all those people in a way that is still sustainable and ethical? Many have argued that aquaculture (or fish farming) is one of the most sustainable ways we can consume animal protein, since it requires less land use. It’s currently the quickest-growing form of food production in the world. But how exactly does it work? And is it really the best path forward? \n\nTo find out more, Vox video producer Nate Krieger went down the rabbit hole on salmon aquaculture. Salmon is currently the most popular fish in the US: The average American consumes 3.2 pounds of salmon annually. And over 70% of that salmon comes from farms, totalling 3 million tons of salmon a year. \n\nTo understand the impact that the salmon industry is having on our planet and our future, and on the salmon themselves, we spoke to industry insiders, marine biologists, and fish welfare experts. \n\nThis is a complicated issue, full of lots of caveats and trade-offs. But the more we know about the food we eat and where it comes from, the more responsible we can be. \n\nSources and further reading: \n\nRead more of Vox's reporting on salmon farming: https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/468348/atlantic-salmon-farm-cruelty-pollution\n\nVox's Future Perfect team reports on what it takes to feed the fish involved in aquaculture, which turns out to be one of the most important impacts to consider:\nhttps://www.vox.com/future-perfect/464898/trump-tariffs-china-trade-war-soybeans-exports\nhttps://www.vox.com/future-perfect/379564/fish-farming-sustainable-wild-caught\n\nThe website for the Global Salmon Initiative, a collaboration between some of the world’s biggest salmon farming companies, whose CEO we spoke with for this piece. Its handbook is a great resource for information on salmon aquaculture:\nhttps://globalsalmoninitiative.org/en/about-salmon-farming/gsi-handbook/\n\nThe World Wildlife Fund’s page on the tradeoffs involved in salmon farming: https://www.worldwildlife.org/our-work/oceans/sustainable-seafood/farmed-seafood/farmed-salmon/\n\nThis video is part of a series supported by Animal Charity Evaluators, which received a grant from EarthShare.\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

      "content": "<article>The reputation of the French Foreign Legion is both legendary and notorious. Every day, men from all over the world come to the legion's barracks in Aubagne. Often, they're looking for a second chance in life. But they have no idea what awaits them.\n\nSince 1831, the Légion étrangère, or Foreign Legion, has fought on the front lines of every armed conflict France has been involved in. Thousands of men apply each year but only around 1,600 are accepted. Recruits must be prepared to give their all despite the extreme challenges: strict orders, grueling exercises, lack of sleep and little food.\n\nThis film follows three young men through the selection process: David del Solar de la Sotta from Chile, Alan Gracin from Croatia, and Adrien Macquart from France. Their physical fitness is repeatedly tested, as are their mental and intellectual skills. Another factor is whether they get along with the others in the group. Are they prepared to be subordinates, to take orders and handle the constant pressure and hardship? Are they really willing to give their all?\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #foreignlegion \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

From the end of the 19th century, through the dawn of the Atomic Age and past the rush of the Space Race, the future was painted as a place of possibility and optimism.\n\nBut now?\nNot so much. Our view of the future lies somewhere between neutral and gloomy.\n\nWhy the change?\nThat question has come up almost every time our Program Committee has met. Back in the good old days the future was always bright. Innovation and craftsmanship was blooming. Failure not a topic.\n\nSo, if the future is not what it used to be, what is it?\nIn this keynote, PC members Kevlin Henney and James Lewis will look at the future seen through the eyes of the past.

      "content": "<article>Lithium is an essential raw material for electric car batteries. Europe is completely dependent on imports. Demand is so high that plans are now underway to develop Europe's own lithium deposits. But can this be done sustainably?\n\nThe expansion of electromobility has made lithium a raw material of strategic importance. Global demand has risen sharply in recent years. \"By 2030, demand will grow another five to seven times,\" predicts Michael Schmidt of the German Raw Materials Agency.\n\nUntil now, Europe has been dependent on supplies from South America, Australia and China. The European Union now aims to cover at least ten percent of its demand from its own production by 2030. The bloc also wants to process lithium here, as well as manufacture batteries and boost recycling. The aim is to establish a lithium cycle in Europe. Can this work? And what of the impact of lithium mining on the environment?\n \nThe documentary visits places that could determine the success of a European lithium cycle: for example, a quarry in the French Massif Central, where one company could very soon be setting up one of Europe's largest lithium mines; or a pilot plant in the Upper Rhine Plain, where lithium is extracted not from rock but from hot deep geothermal brines. Whether in a refinery, a research facility for battery cells or a recycling plant for electric car batteries, each stage presents technological challenges for the development of a lithium cycle.\n\nThe documentary observes the work of scientists researching resource-saving methods of lithium extraction and hears the views of experts investigating how much lithium Europe actually needs.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #lithium #europe \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

      "content": "<article>An on-the-ground look at how Ecuador, a once-peaceful nation, is now gripped by drug cartels, violence and a military crackdown. With rare access to gang recruits, police, politicians and families caught in the crossfire, this documentary explores efforts to stem the violence and the human toll.\n\nThis journalism is made possible by viewers like you. Support your local PBS station here: https://www.pbs.org/donate\n\nOnce one of Latin America’s most peaceful nations, Ecuador has now become one of its most violent. Foreign cartels have joined with local gangs to control the drug trade, funneling cocaine to the U.S. and Europe, and pushing the homicide rate in the country to record levels. In response, Ecuador’s government declared a state of emergency in 2024, and sent the military onto the streets and into gang-plagued prisons to crack down. \n\n“Drug War in Ecuador” illuminates the stark human toll of it all, drawing on deep access to those involved in the struggle, from the military and police to the gangs to the families caught in the crossfire. The film focuses on the stories of three people: Father Jose Antonio Maeso, a well-known gang violence mediator  who also collects evidence of alleged abuses by the police and military; Colonel Javier Buitron, then governor in Esmeraldas, a hotbed of gang violence, who defends the government’s crackdown; and Ronny Medina, a grieving father who’s seeking justice for his 11-year-old son, Steven, one of four boys who were found dead after the military detained them. Ecuador’s military said the soldiers released the boys alive and gang members later killed them.  \n\nRaw and profound, the documentary offers a powerful look at the ongoing crisis in the country.\n\n“Drug War in Ecuador” is a Duskwater Films production for GBH/FRONTLINE and ITV in association with The Big Story Films. Filmed and directed by Marcel Mettelsiefen. The producers are Stephen Ellis, Marcel Mettelsiefen, Mayte Carrasco and Ahisha Ghafoor. The associate producer is Esme Ramlal.

This is very important as the more you like and comment on each video the better it will perform, so please help us if you can. Thank you! In the scorching deserts of the Holy Land during the 12th century, two extraordinary leaders faced each other across the battlefield - one a teenage leper king fighting against his own body and overwhelming odds, the other a brilliant Muslim general determined to reclaim Jerusalem. Their rivalry became one of history's most fascinating confrontations, not defined by hatred, but by mutual respect and honour that transcended the brutal reality of the Crusades. \n\nThis compilation explores the legendary encounters between Baldwin IV of Jerusalem and Saladin, two men whose decisions shaped the fate of kingdoms and the course of medieval history. From the stunning victory at the Battle of Montgisard where a 16-year-old leper king defeated Saladin's massive army, to their complex diplomatic exchanges and military strategies, witness how these two remarkable figures demonstrated that even in war, honour and respect could exist between enemies. Their story continues to captivate audiences today, reminding us that all human history essentially comes down to the choices and character of individual leaders.\n\nPlease subscribe here. https://www.youtube.com/@PeopleProfiles?sub_confirmation=1\nOur second channel. https://www.youtube.com/@PeopleProfilesExtra\nFollow us on Spotify. https://open.spotify.com/show/7fKALbrzEO9Q4VVvAwWHqL\nSupport us on Patreon https://patreon.com/thepeopleprofiles\nFollow us on Twitter. https://twitter.com/tpprofiles\n\nThanks for watching!

The film explores the stark human toll of the country’s drug and gang crisis, which has caused homicide rates to skyrocket — and also examines allegations that the military has “disappeared” innocent people in the resulting crackdown.\n\nIncluding Steven. \n\nAs the above video drawn from the documentary shows, surveillance footage from December 8 in Guayaquil, Ecuador, captured the military detaining Steven and beating another boy. Steven’s charred remains and those of three 14- and 15-year-old boys he was with — Nehemías Saúl Arboleda, Josué Arroyo and Ismael Arroyo — were found on Christmas Eve. Ecuador's military said the soldiers released the boys alive and that gang members later killed them. A judge ordered 16 soldiers to be put in detention. The soldiers who picked up Steven and the other boys are currently on trial for their role in the deaths.\n\nFor the full story, watch \"Drug War in Ecuador\" starting Nov. 11 on @frontlinepbs. \n\n\"Drug War in Ecuador\" is a Duskwater Films production for GBH/FRONTLINE and ITV in association with The Big Story Films.

      "content": "<article>An increasing number of Indonesian imams are calling on the faithful to protect nature and save the world. This new movement preaching environmentalism originates in one of the largest mosques in the world, in Jakarta. But just how credible is this movement? And how effective?\n\nFatwas against logging, sermons about safeguarding the planet, and mosques with solar panels and water recycling systems. In Indonesia, protecting the environment is being presented as a religious duty. The model for this spiritual revolution is the Istiqlal Mosque in Jakarta, the largest in Asia, designated as the world's first \"ecological house of worship.\"\n\nNow, the plan is to turn 70% of the nation's 800,000 mosques into \"eco mosques.\" At Quran schools, future imams are being trained to deliver \"green sermons.\" \"Islamic green armies\" explore the mountains of Java, teach sustainable farming practices and pray collectively for the preservation of divine creation. Senior Islamic authorities such as the Indonesian Ulema Council are even publishing green fatwas against environmental crime. Together, they're aiming for Indonesian carbon neutrality by 2060. \n\nBut the movement also has its critics:  As well as being the largest nickel producer in the world, Indonesia is also one of the world's biggest coal-mining nations. Nature conservation groups say the new Islamic movement focuses too much on individual responsibility while remaining silent over the country's major industrial polluters. Some religious leaders are even involved in controversial mining projects. \n\nJust as everywhere else in the world, Indonesia is a place of contradictions and conflicting interests. But despite that, the green Islam movement continues to pick up pace and spread its message.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #indonesia #isalm #environment \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Decision was made that was unique in history. There would be an international trial convened in the German city of Nuremberg. The senior Nazis men like Hermann Goering, would be placed in the dock. And the trial that followed would change the course of history.\n\n00:00:00 The Crimes\n00:03:10 The Trial\n00:05:31 The Defendants \n00:13:49 Why Nuremberg \n00:18:00 The Charges \n00:20:45 Keeping the Defendants Alive\n00:26:00 The Verdicts \n00:27:00 Goering Escapes The Noose \n\nWant to see more?

Ángela Mendoza has found an unconventional way to return apartments back to the their owners.\n\nMendoza used to be a flamenco dancer, but the pandemic and personal setbacks forced her to start over. She hired a group of strong young men and launched her own security firm. Its specialty: Removing squatters and non-paying tenants from apartments all across Spain.\n\nÁngela and her team have already returned hundreds of properties to their owners. She's developed her own psychological approach — a mix of firm pressure and empathetic negotiation.\n\nBusiness is booming. Last year alone, Spain recorded nearly 20,000 illegal occupations, and the number keeps climbing. Courts are overwhelmed, and obtaining an official eviction order can take years. But Mendoza's work is divisive. Critics accuse her of serving the interests of wealthy investors and landlords at a time when many people in Spain are unable to secure housing for reasons beyond their control.\n\n00:00 Intro\n01:12 Unpaid rent in Castell de Ferro\n04:13 Relief for the owners\n05:15 Spain's housing market: Extreme pressures\n06:03 Ángela receives threats\n06:25 A citizens' initiative against evictions\n08:10 Ángela responds to criticism\n09:48 Accusations against Spain's bureaucracy\n11:24 No easy answers\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #spain #housing #eviction \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

If your “modernization” effort stopped at lifting-and-shifting monolithic apps into Kubernetes, you’ve simply boxed yesterday’s problems in today’s tech.\n\nIn this session we’ll unpack why true modernization demands more than orchestration stickers: it requires re-architecting for event-driven, serverless, and AI-augmented patterns that slash time-to-value and operating costs. Drawing on field experience across 50+ enterprise and startup transformations—spanning 8,000+ AWS Lambda functions, real-time data pipelines, and GenAI copilots.\n\nWe’ll explore:\n• The Illusion of Progress: Hidden technical debt and cost traps that containers often preserve.\n• Transformation Levers: Domain-driven decomposition, serverless services, and managed data layers that free teams from infrastructure toil.\n• GenAI as a Catalyst: Where large-language-model capabilities amplify modernization ROI—and where they don’t.\n• Change Management Playbook: Culture, skill-matrix, and governance shifts that let teams iterate safely at cloud speed.\n• Success Metrics &amp; Case Studies: Concrete KPIs (release frequency ↑ 5×, infra spend ↓ 60%) from healthcare, QSR, and fintech modernizations.

      "content": "<article>They eat and reproduce at record speed - calico crayfish. In its quest for more information about the species, this report finds tens of thousands of crayfish in just one pool along the upper Rhine River. Can this invasive creature still be stopped?\n\nThe last remaining habitats of amphibians and dragonflies are at risk. Calico crayfish are endangering biodiversity along the upper Rhine. These crayfish can strip entire biotopes bare. They've completely destroyed a project to reintroduce marsh turtles costing millions of Euros. We meet a frustrated research team and a fisher who says he can't simply stand by and watch - and who catches and eats as many of the crayfish as possible. But is this really a solution? Should we be using biocides in future as a way to combat invasive species? And how did the American crayfish get to Europe in the first place? \n\nIt's evident that the crayfish can no longer be completely eradicated, but as a research team from Karlsruhe has found, small biotopes can be protected. Although such measures don't come cheap, this offers a glimmer of hope for endangered amphibian species. But what lessons can be learned, and what might our future response to invasive species look like? This documentary shows how much damage a single invasive species can cause.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

      "content": "<article>The hunt for the assets of the former East Germany’s ruling party has the hallmarks of a thriller. There are dubious characters, bags of cash, and key witnesses who suddenly die. At its heart is the question: How do you stash away 6 billion marks?\n\nAfter the fall of the Berlin Wall, with the Cold War over and German reunification on the horizon, lawyer and politician Gregor Gysi inherited a fortune worth billions. Hardly anyone knew about the wealth of East Germany’s ruling party, the SED. Gysi became the revamped party’s new chairman, and little by little, he became aware of how the SED had enriched itself over 40 years of misgoverning. The party assets still belonged to the SED and its successor party, but it was unclear how long that would remain the case. East Germany was undergoing massive changes, with the first free democratic elections imminent. How could this enormous wealth be secured? In December 1989, transactions of incredible proportions started being made. Domestic and foreign currency, as well as other assets, were distributed to old party cadres. There were suitcases and bags full of cash. Loans were handed out to party comrades, sometimes amounting to millions. In later years, international investigators would implicate numerous businesspeople, and even an Islamic religious group. In particular, the Austrian Rudolfine Steindling played a key role in covering up traces of the money in her role as trustee of a company linked to the SED.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #eastgermany #germany #rich \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

      "content": "<article>Following former Vice President Dick Cheney’s death at age 84, watch this 2007 documentary tracing the behind-closed-doors battle Cheney waged within the George W. Bush administration over the power of the presidency and the rule of law. \n\nThis journalism is made possible by viewers like you. Support your local PBS station here: https://www.pbs.org/donate\n\nFor three decades, Dick Cheney had been an advocate of granting the president virtually unlimited wartime power. In the aftermath of the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, with Cheney as George W. Bush’s vice president, the Justice Department and the White House made a number of controversial legal decisions. Orchestrated by Cheney and his lawyer David Addington, the department interpreted executive power in an expansive and extraordinary way, granting Bush the power to detain, interrogate, torture, wiretap and spy — without congressional approval or judicial review.\n\nIn “Cheney’s Law,” a documentary by Michael Kirk and his team, FRONTLINE examined the battle over the power of the presidency and Cheney’s way of looking at the Constitution. As the White House and Congress faced off over executive privilege, the terrorist surveillance program, and the firing of U.S. attorneys, FRONTLINE told the story of what formed Cheney’s perspectives and what some at the time viewed as the most ambitious project to reshape the power of the president in American history.\n\nExplore additional reporting on “Cheney’s Law” on our website:\nhttps://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/documentary/cheney/\n\n#Documentary #Politics #DickCheney\n\nSubscribe on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/PBSfrontline \nSign up for our newsletter: https://frontline.org/newsletter\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/frontlinepbs\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/frontline\nBluesky: https://bsky.app/profile/frontlinepbs.bsky.social\n\nFRONTLINE is produced at GBH in Boston and is broadcast nationwide on PBS.

Scientists and indigenous communities are both searching for ways to stop the destruction.\n\nIn many parts of the world, fires were once a natural phenomenon. Periodic fires rejuvenated forests, made plains fertile, and helped biodiversity to flourish. Today, however, extreme fires are becoming rapidly more prevalent - killing both humans and animals and destroying nature on an unprecedented scale.\n\nThis documentary follows the collaboration between scientists and indigenous guardians who are fighting to protect forests and other ecosystems. It explores the benefits of traditional farming techniques, exposes prejudice and corruption, and highlights the deep-rooted knowledge that indigenous communities have when it comes to protecting our planet.\n\nTheir stories can inspire us to see the natural world not as a resource, but as the very foundation of life.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #indigenous #environment \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

This is very important as the more you like and comment on each video the better it will perform, so please help us if you can. Thank you! Two brothers. One throne. A decision that changed the course of British history forever. This is the story of King George VI and King Edward VIII - two men whose contrasting choices during the 1936 abdication crisis would define their legacies and shape the future of the British monarchy through World War II and beyond.\n\nEdward VIII chose love over duty, abdicating the throne to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson in what became the most controversial royal scandal of the 20th century. His younger brother, the reluctant George VI, stepped forward to shoulder the burden of kingship during Britain's darkest hour, overcoming personal struggles to become a symbol of courage and resilience during the Second World War.\n\nBut the story doesn't end there. While George VI led his nation through war and earned the admiration of millions, Edward's actions during and after the abdication raised questions about his loyalty, his judgment, and his true character. Was he simply a man who followed his heart, or was there something darker beneath the surface?\n\nThis documentary explores the lives, decisions, and legacies of both brothers - examining how their choices shaped not only their own destinies but the fate of an entire nation.\n\nPlease subscribe here. https://www.youtube.com/@PeopleProfiles?sub_confirmation=1\nOur second channel. https://www.youtube.com/@PeopleProfilesExtra\nFollow us on Spotify. https://open.spotify.com/show/7fKALbrzEO9Q4VVvAwWHqL\nSupport us on Patreon https://patreon.com/thepeopleprofiles\nFollow us on Twitter. https://twitter.com/tpprofiles\n\nThanks for watching!

      "content": "<article>Brandon Scott, a young black politician, was elected mayor of Baltimore in 2020. It was a turbulent time: the city's crime rate was high, and there were mass protests in response to the police killings of George Floyd and other Black Americans.\n\nScott, a reformer and idealist, grew up in Baltimore at a time when the city was marked by crime and urban decay. He had lost friends to gun violence and knew first-hand what life on the streets was like. As mayor, he and his team aimed to reduce the crime rate. His guiding principle was that, in a city overwhelmed by violence, peace is the only thing worth fighting for.\n\nIn contrast to previous city governments, Scott focused more on prevention than on controlling crime and making arrests. He wanted to give people alternatives, opportunities and hope. But as soon as he took office he was confronted by a new wave of violence. Before he could implement his reforms, he was already under pressure. The media and political opponents attacked his \"woke\" policies, and the Maryland governor refused to talk to the new mayor for months - despite being responsible for funding city programs.\n\nThis documentary follows Brandon Scott and his team through their first year in City Hall. It shows the struggle of a man who is determined to stick to his convictions, despite resistance, setbacks and political isolation. Can his holistic approach help Baltimore heal? Could it even become a blueprint for other cities in the US?\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #baltimore #usa #crime \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

But while we still don’t know exactly what degree of difference causes health issues, doctors have made great strides in figuring out how to even out these mismatched limbs. Jason Shih Hoellwarth digs into the benefits and limitations of bone lengthening surgery.\n\nLesson by Jason Shih Hoellwarth, directed by Igor Ćorić, Artrake Studio.\n\nSupport Our Non-Profit Mission\n----------------------------------------------\nSupport us on Patreon: http://bit.ly/TEDEdPatreon\nCheck out our merch: http://bit.ly/TEDEDShop\n----------------------------------------------\n\nConnect With Us\n----------------------------------------------\nSign up for our newsletter: http://bit.ly/TEDEdNewsletter\nFollow us on Facebook: http://bit.ly/TEDEdFacebook\nFind us on Twitter: http://bit.ly/TEDEdTwitter\nPeep us on Instagram: http://bit.ly/TEDEdInstagram\n----------------------------------------------\n\nKeep Learning\n----------------------------------------------\nView full lesson: https://ed.ted.com/lessons/what-if-one-of-your-legs-was-shorter-than-the-other-jason-shih-hoellwarth\nDig deeper with additional resources: https://ed.ted.com/lessons/what-if-one-of-your-legs-was-shorter-than-the-other-jason-shih-hoellwarth/digdeeper\n\nAnimator's website: https://www.artrake.com\n----------------------------------------------\n\nThank you so much to our patrons for your support!

What starts as a discussion about the EU AI Act quickly reveals a deeper truth: the real challenge isn't regulatory compliance - it's fundamental engineering practices.\n\nLarysa argues that quality AI systems require robust MLOps, comprehensive documentation, and proper data governance, whether regulation mandates it or not. Drawing from frameworks like CRISP-ML and the Machine Learning Canvas, the book provides practical checklists and methodologies for taking AI projects from prototype to production. Written partially in Ukraine during wartime, this \"battle-tested\" guide addresses the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders, offering a common language for building sustainable AI systems.\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n01:11 Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)\n02:03 MLOps\n05:33 Discovering the engineering problem behind the regulation\n11:40 The power of checklists &amp; structure\n19:28 Translating legal requirements into engineering practice\n29:52 Outro\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nLarysa Visengeriyeva • The AI Engineer's Guide to Surviving the EU AI Act • https://amzn.to/42SKOuU\nLakshmanan, Robinson &amp; Munn • Machine Learning Design Patterns • https://amzn.to/4ox4Eos\nPhil Winder • Reinforcement Learning • https://amzn.to/3t1S1VZ\nDiana Montalion • Learning Systems Thinking • https://amzn.to/3ZpycdJ\nBernd Rücker • Practical Process Automation • https://amzn.to/3cs3BSH\nLauren Maffeo • Designing Data Governance from the Ground Up • https://amzn.to/3QhIlnV\nKatharine Jarmul • Practical Data Privacy • https://amzn.to/46XPrns\nZhamak Dehghani • Data Mesh • https://amzn.to/3tTCwAC\nKate Stanley &amp; Mickael Maison • Kafka Connect • https://amzn.to/40Jq5Jz\n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.instagram.com/goto_con\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#EUAIAct #AI #EngineersGuide #AIAct #AIEngineer #MLOps #MLSecOps #CRISPML #Compliance #Governance #Documentation #DataGovernance #DataScience #MachineLearning #ArtificialIntelligence #Regulation #TodayInTech #SoftwareDevelopment #SoftwareEngineering #Programming #LarysaVisengeriyeva #BarbaraLampl #BookClub\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
