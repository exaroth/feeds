      "content": "<article>The Rise of the Seljuk Turks chronicles how a Turko-Persian frontier confederation grew into one of the medieval world’s most influential empires. Emerging from the steppes of Central Asia, the Seljuks united inner-city Persia with Turkic cavalry might, transforming political and cultural landscapes across Iran, Iraq, and Anatolia. Under Tughril Beg, they consolidated power in the early 11th century, capturing Ray and routing rival dynasties to establish the Great Seljuk state. The empire expanded under Alp Arslan, whose victory at Manzikert in 1071 shattered Byzantium’s frontier and opened Anatolia to Turkish settlement, setting the stage for the Turkic-ruled Sultanate of Rum. Malik Shah I presided over a prosperous era, supported by the brilliant vizier Nizam al-Mulk and a thriving network of madrasas that fused Sunni scholarship with Persian administrative sophistication. The Seljuks pioneered a centralized yet adaptive governance model, blending military prowess with a sophisticated bureaucratic system that influenced governance across the region for centuries. As they defended eastern borders against rival powers and fostered a rich cultural milieu, their rise also created the conditions for Crusades to enter the Levant. This video unpacks the key figures, battles, and institutions that defined the Seljuk ascent, and traces their enduring legacy in Anatolia, Iran, and the broader Islamic world. If you love medieval history and the fusion of Turkic and Persian influences, subscribe for more on the rise and legacy of the Seljuk Turks. \n\n#SeljukEmpire #SeljukTurks #MedievalHistory #Manzikert #Crusades #IslamicHistory #TurkishHistory #epichistory</article>",

      "content": "<article>For many single parents, everyday life can be a challenge. But a number of projects offer assistance and encouragement. Affordable housing, social networking, and childcare services are designed to ease the burden.\n\nSingle parents in Europe can increasingly rely on help and support from people, associations, and institutions to help them balance raising children with work, financial issues, and mental overload. \n\n\"A secure, affordable living situation - that's such a key issue in the lives of single parents,” says Sarah Zeller. A few years ago, she found herself confronting this issue when, along with another friend and her child, she decided to set up a shared apartment for the two single parent families. But they searched in vain for an affordable apartment with enough space. \n\nThis predicament gave rise to an innovative approach. In 2015, the German native founded the non-profit association JUNO in Vienna. Working with property developers, the association plans and develops compact and affordable apartments for single parents. With her idea, the founder has now helped over 160 families find a suitable apartment. \n\nThe Belgian region of Wallonia has set itself the goal of strengthening the social position of single parents. Amandine Dedoncker is a social worker involved in the \"Relais Familles Mono” program, creating services tailored to the needs of single parents. The government program enables single parents to learn practical skills, meet other mothers or fathers, and be part of a community. As a population group particularly affected by loneliness, this is extremely important for single parents‘ mental health. \nWhen other families have free time, on Saturdays Bianka Baumann is at work: in a supermarket in Rostock. The single mother and sales assistant works weekends. But who looks after her son Linus, during a time when most daycare centers are closed? An innovative daycare center here makes her weekend work possible by offering overnight care for parents who work night shifts. \nAll of this is financed by the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. A model that supports single parents - and makes it possible to truly balance work and family life.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

This documentary explores the remarkable life of the woman who served as the longest-serving Princess of Wales and eventually Queen Consort to King Edward VII.\n\nWhile the Edwardian era is often remembered for its lavish parties and the \"Marlborough House Set,\" Alexandra’s private reality was defined by her battle with progressive deafness and the \"Alexandra Limp\"—a physical disability caused by rheumatic fever that, bizarrely, became a viral fashion trend among the Victorian elite. From her \"rags-to-riches\" journey as a Danish princess to her complicated marriage to a \"Playboy King,\" we reveal how she navigated his high-profile mistresses (including Alice Keppel) and the strict demands of Queen Victoria.\n\nPlease subscribe here. https://www.youtube.com/@PeopleProfiles?sub_confirmation=1\nOur second channel. https://www.youtube.com/@PeopleProfilesExtra\nFollow us on Spotify. https://open.spotify.com/show/7fKALbrzEO9Q4VVvAwWHqL\nSupport us on Patreon https://patreon.com/thepeopleprofiles\nFollow us on Twitter. https://twitter.com/tpprofiles\n\nThanks for watching!

Maps, documents, and eyewitness accounts from French and Algerian veterans document the dimension of this warfare, as well as the human suffering it caused. \n\nInterviews with experts on nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons explain how military and political decision-makers organized these secret attacks. In addition to the torture and displacement of entire population groups, the use of chemical weapons constituted a huge breach of France's international obligations.

The only problem for its supporters? It doesn't officially exist. \n\nAfter the Yugoslav Wars, the border between Serbia and Croatia along the Danube River remained unresolved. Vit Jedlička, a former politician from the Czech Republic, saw an opportunity. In 2015, he declared the “Free Republic of Liberland” on a 7-square-kilometer piece of land. \n\nThe Liberland experiment may seem like an oddity, but it also raises serious questions: Cryptocurrencies and decentralized networks are undermining traditional national borders, and radical market ideas are gaining influence. Parallel structures are emerging.

Use code BOYLE at the link below and get 60% off an annual plan: https://incogni.com/boyle\n\nThis video explores the 2026 \"Deep Freeze\" of the crypto market, analyzing why the \"digital gold\" thesis has failed to protect investors as Bitcoin lags behind the S&amp;P 500 total returns. We dive into the \"Victory Paradox\"—the irony that Bitcoin’s institutional acceptance through Wall Street ETFs and a \"crypto-friendly\" presidency has tethered it to traditional financial risks, destroying its status as an uncorrelated asset. From the $12 billion losses at Michael Saylor’s Strategy Inc. and the liquidity crisis at institutional prime broker BlockFills to the Great AI Pivot in the mining industry, we break down the structural traps currently paralyzing the ecosystem. Featuring insights on \"Financial Nihilism\" from Demetri Kofinas, the \"Juggalo Theory\" of crypto subcultures from Zeke Faux, and the massive migration toward prediction markets like Kalshi and Polymarket, we ask the ultimate forward-looking question: now that Bitcoin is fully financialized, will it ever be an independent asset again?\n\nPatrick's Books:\nStatistics For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3eerLA0\nDerivatives For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3cjsyPF\nCorporate Finance:  https://amzn.to/3fn3rvC \n\nWays To Support The Channel\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/PatrickBoyleOnFinance\nBuy Me a Coffee: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/patrickboyle\n\nVisit our website: https://www.onfinance.org\nFollow Patrick on Twitter Here: https://bsky.app/profile/pboyle.bsky.social\n\nBusiness Inquiries ➡️ sponsors@onfinance.org\n\nPatrick Boyle On Finance Podcast:\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/7uhrWlDvxzy9hLoW0EYf0b\nApple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/patrick-boyle-on-finance/id1547740313\nGoogle Podcasts: https://tinyurl.com/62862nve\n\nJoin this channel to support making this content:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCASM0cgfkJxQ1ICmRilfHLw/join</article>",

      "content": "<article>Jeffrey Epstein remained a thriving member of the elite for decades, even when everyone seemed to know what he was doing. His sphere of influence included top political officials, CEOs, corporate executives, finance managers, and even a member of the British royal family. How did he manage it? It turns out it was by establishing an elaborate network of influence and access that went well beyond the norms and expectations of the rich and famous.\n\nWhat were the tipping points that nearly brought Epstein to justice in the 14 years before his first conviction and his final 2019 arrest? What were the structures and systems that failed to stop him from abusing and exploiting young women and girls in those 14 years? In this episode, we tick through the guest lists and institutions that continued to profit from relationships with Jeffrey Epstein — and which helped him remain free, in turn.\n\nWe will also talk about many of the conspiracy theories that have popped up since the latest tranche of Epstein documents came out. Was Epstein a national security asset? Did he actually kill himself?\n\nIndependent journalist Tara Palmeri, author of the Red Letter Substack and host of The Tara Palmeri Show, argues that conspiracies are important to help the public understand the extent and scope of the Epstein scandal — since for so long, so much about the story was covered up. We’ll make sense of which conspiracies have validity and which are tinfoil hat material, in this interview with a journalist who has long advocated for and written about the Epstein survivors.\n\n00:00 Intro: What we do and do not know about Epstein\n03:31 The stories of the Epstein survivors\n07:56 The conspiracy theories around Epstein\n11:21 The elite enablers around Epstein\n17:08 The political cover-up over Epstein\n19:13 The conspiracy theorizing around Epstein\n22:13 The elite lies around Epstein\n\nToday, Explained publishes compelling interviews with key figures in politics and culture every Saturday.

We know that ICE was created in 2003. So what exactly do they mean by that? To unpack this claim, Vox producer Nate Krieger examines the history of immigration enforcement in the US. \n\nThe story of American immigration is one of gradual change. Over time, the role of the immigration services slowly changed, morphing from an agency that managed labor and benefits to one that saw itself as law enforcement, with a focus on national security. \n\nAnd with that shift came a growth in capacity. The first federal immigration agency was created in 1891 with a total staff of 4 people. Today, with ICE, that number is over 22,000.\n\nSo how did immigration restrictions and enforcement change over the span of American history? By examining the centuries of events that culminated in the creation of ICE, we can begin to understand the context that created this modern agency. \n\nSources and further reading: \n\nFor more context, images, and written accounts of Ellis Island, see this page on the National Park Service’s website: https://www.nps.gov/elis/learn/historyculture/index.htm\n\nFor this story, Nate Krieger focused on the history leading up to 2003 and the creation of ICE, so the piece does not delve into more recent developments. But detailed information and data on deportation in President Donald Trump’s second term can be found here: https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/immigration-detention-report.pdf and https://deportationdata.org/analysis/immigration-enforcement-first-nine-months-trump\n\nAnd more information on ICE’s arrests in the interior, which are a relatively recent phenomenon, can be found here: https://www.migrationpolicy.org/content/ice-arrests-deportations-interior\n\nThis piece only touched on Japanese incarceration during the Second World War. For more information — and first-hand accounts — about this important subject, Densho is a fantastic resource: https://ddr.densho.org/\n\n\"Immigration: How the Past Shapes The Present\" by the sociologist Nancy Foner, who was interviewed for this piece, is a comprehensive look into why the past is critical to understanding modern immigration: https://www.politybooks.com/bookdetail?book_slug=immigration-how-the-past-shapes-the-present--9781509557912\n\nIf you enjoy our reporting and want to hear more from Vox journalists, sign up for our Patreon at patreon.com/vox.

He dedicated it to Sacha Guitry, the famous French actor and screenwriter, who loved crayfish butter. I've adapted it for the home kitchen using cooked prawns.\nA compound butter is a flavoured butter made by blending softened butter with other ingredients — in this case, cooked prawns with their shells and coral. What makes this dish unique is that the compound butter is not just served on top. It is used as a cooking fat, and then whisked into the sauce at the end to give it a rich, silky shellfish finish.\n\nIn this video you will learn how to:\n\nMake a prawn compound butter from scratch using a stick blender\nCook chicken breasts à blanc (with minimal colour)\nWhite-cook mushrooms in butter, lemon and water\nBuild a French cream sauce using Madeira wine\nUse compound butter as a sauce thickener and enrichment\nPrepare and sauté dried morels\n\nThis is Part 1 of a 3-part series on compound butters in French cooking.\n\nFULL RECIPE\nAvailable on our website: https://www.thefrenchcookingacademy.com/recipes/poulet-sacha-guitry\n\nLEARN FRENCH COOKING WITH US\nJoin the FCA Club for full access to structured French cooking courses, a private community and more: https://www.thefrenchcookingacademy.com\n\nABOUT THIS CHANNEL\nThe French Cooking Academy teaches classical French cooking techniques for the home kitchen.

She analyses the historical accuracy of pivotal scenes, from Mary’s return to Scotland after her time in France to her turbulent marriages, political struggles with the Scottish nobility, and her fraught rivalry with Elizabeth.\n\n0:00 The Young Henry VIII &amp; Catherine of Aragon ('The Spanish Princess')\n12:24 The Anne Boleyn Affair ('The Other Boleyn Girl')\n27:18 A Son &amp; A New Wife: Jane Seymour &amp; Anne of Cleves ('Wolf Hall')\n42:54 The Teenage Queen: Katherine Howard ('The Tudors')\n54:11 Jude Law &amp; The Final Years with Katherine Parr ('Firebrand')\n1:08:16 Historian's Final Verdict on Henry VIII Portrayals\n\nThroughout the video, Dr. Paul critiques the casting and character portrayals, discussing how Ronan and Robbie capture the intelligence, vulnerability, and political acumen of two powerful Renaissance queens. She explores the realities behind the drama, including Mary’s marriage to Lord Darnley, the murder of David Rizzio, the scandal surrounding the Earl of Bothwell, her forced abdication, and eventual imprisonment in England. \n\nThe review culminates in a close look at Mary’s trial and execution, separating cinematic invention from the complex historical record surrounding one of the most compelling monarchs of the sixteenth century.\n\nYou can now become a History Hit member right here on YouTube!

      "content": "<article>From a modest Corsican artillery officer to the master of Europe, Napoleon Bonaparte’s ascent after the French Revolution reshaped maps, laws, and destinies. This concise history traces how his military genius, political skill, and relentless reform propelled him from lieutenant to consul and finally emperor, setting the stage for nearly two decades of continental domination. We tour the pivotal moves—the coup of 18 Brumaire, the centralization of authority, and the Napoleonic Code that codified revolutionary ideals into everyday law. We examine how campaigns across Italy, Austria, and Egypt demonstrated both daring strategy and fragile supply networks, while battles such as Ulm, Austerlitz, and Jena showcased a genius for rapid, decisive action that forced coalitions to adapt or collapse. The narrative then turns to the continental system, designed to cripple Britain and redraw European trade, and to the political architecture that forged client states, reshaped governance, and sparked nationalist currents that outlived the Emperor himself. The rise’s zenith gave way to a brutal winter in Russia, a string of defeats, and a dramatic exile that ended an era, only for legacies—legal reforms, administrative efficiency, and a lasting, controversial vision of European order—to echo long after Napoleon’s fall. This video explains the complex causes and consequences of European domination under Napoleon, offering clear context for students and history lovers alike, while linking events to the broader currents of the era.

Three young women talk about their near-death experiences and how these moments changed their lives.\n\n\"I used to be extremely afraid of death. But ever since my near-death experience, that's no longer the case,\" says model Chanel Silberberg, who became famous through the German reality TV show \"Germany's Next Topmodel.\" She nearly died at the age of 11 from complications related to a chronic illness. The experience fundamentally shaped her.\nWhy do near-death experiences have such a lasting impact? This documentary shares the dramatic and inspiring stories of three young women who stood on the brink between life and death and returned with a completely new life perspective. Their background stories are vastly different: Laethisia Schimek is a competitive athlete; Léa Winzenried is a dance therapist; and Chanel Silberberg is a model and influencer. What all three have in common is an awareness of the finiteness of life, and a drive to experience it to the fullest. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Frances shares her unique teaching philosophy, which emphasizes self-contained, playable examples like simple games that make complex concepts accessible and memorable.\n\nDrawing on her background in mathematics and her father's work in teacher education, she explains how her approach—exemplified by her famous \"X Out of a Y Paper Bag\" series of talks—uses humor and practical scenarios to help learners understand challenging topics like coroutines, the spaceship operator, and the \"almost always auto\" style. The discussion touches on the evolution of C++, the upcoming reflection features in C++26, and Fran's current project: writing an introductory C++ book for complete beginners, despite finding concepts like \"constant variable\" challenging to explain even as an experienced author.\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n01:48 Why modern C++ needs a new approach\n07:03 Teaching through games &amp; examples\n11:41 Coroutines in C++\n14:50 \"almost always auto\" &amp; modern C++ style\n22:04 Teaching &amp; writing: A family tradition?\n28:44 Outro\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nFrances Buontempo • Learn C++ by Example • https://amzn.to/4rgxSZX\nFrances Buontempo • Introducing C++ • https://amzn.to/40aHQQC\nFrances Buontempo • Genetic Algorithms and Machine Learning for Programmers • https://amzn.to/3OLjXMV\nDaniel Kusswurm • Modern Parallel Programming with C++ and Assembly Language • https://amzn.to/4o5J3SF\n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.instagram.com/goto_con\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#Cpp #CppProgramming #CppProgramminglanguage #Coroutines #ConstantVariable #Cpp26 #Compiler #AlmostAlwaysAuto #ModernCpp #CompilerExplorer #TodayInTech #SoftwareEngineering #Programming #FrancesBuontempo #MattGodbolt #BookClub\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

While Chairman Mao held the title, it was Jiang Qing who held the leash—orchestrating a decade of chaos, purges, and cultural erasure that left an indelible scar on China.\n\nHow did a struggling film star become the \"White-Boned Demon\" of the Politburo?

      "content": "<article>The \"Green Deal” is Europe's recipe for economic growth and climate protection. But green technologies require critical raw materials, which often come from China. Is more mining in Europe a viable solution?\n\nEurope wants to encourage economic growth, while also saving our planet from climate collapse. The name of the plan to do this is the \"Green Deal.” Under the Green Deal, electric cars are supposed to replace combustion engines, and renewable energies will be used instead of coal, oil, and gas. \nBut green technologies require many critical raw materials, like lithium and rare earths. But these raw materials are rarely mined in Europe anymore. Currently, they come from faraway places like Africa, South America, Russia, and above all, China.\n \nThe ensuing dependence poses a risk to the European economy. Politicians and industry leaders now want to bring some mining back to Europe. They promise green, sustainable mines with as little impact on the environment as possible. But in places where these types of mines are being built, people are fighting back. They fear that their regions will be sacrificed for the energy transition.\n\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #rawmaterials \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

      "content": "<article>A 90-minute documentary examining Venezuela’s controversial and outspoken late former president Hugo Chávez and the revolution he claimed was turning his country into an anti-capitalist beacon for Latin America and the world. (Aired 2008) \n\nThis journalism is made possible by viewers like you. Donate to FRONTLINE now: https://bit.ly/47DFzCb\n\nAnd support your local PBS station here: https://www.pbs.org/donate\n\nIn “The Hugo Chávez Show,” FRONTLINE traveled to Venezuela to offer an illuminating portrait of the country’s  then-president, Hugo Chávez. Through interviews with former government officials, Chávez associates and critics, and ordinary Venezuelans, FRONTLINE chronicled how Chávez ascended to power,  how he became a dominant figure in recent Latin American history, and how he used broadcast media to spread the “21st-century socialism” he espoused.\n\nMemorably, the documentary introduced U.S. viewers to “Aló Presidente” — or “Hello, President” — a weekly televised show that often ran five to eight hours and featured Chávez speaking directly to the people, explaining government policy and mixing in a smattering of songs, poetry and whatever else struck his fancy. Beyond being a venue for Chávez’s personality, the program served as a weekly window into the Venezuelan government, with Chávez often announcing major policy decisions on live television.\n\nWith Venezuela in the headlines following the U.S. government’s capture of Nicolás Maduro, who was Chávez’s protege and successor, “The Hugo Chávez Show” offers important context on Venezuela’s political history and the accomplishments, failures, appeal and repression of the Chávez era.\n\nPraise for “The Hugo Chavez Show”:\n“This portrait transcends news events.” – David Montgomery, The Washington Post\n“An even-handed, unillusioned view of a highly perplexing figure.” – Mark Feeney, The Boston Globe\n“A fascinatingly revealing documentary.” – Kate Taylor, The Globe and Mail \n\n“The Hugo Chávez Show” is a FRONTLINE co-production with Ofra Bikel Productions. The producer, writer and director was Ofra Bikel. \n\nExplore additional reporting on “The Hugo Chávez Show” on our website:\nhttps://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/documentary/hugochavez/\n\n#Documentary #Venezuela #HugoChavez #Politics\n\nSubscribe on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/PBSfrontline\nSign up for our newsletter: https://frontline.org/newsletter\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/frontlinepbs​\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/frontline\nBluesky: https://bsky.app/profile/frontlinepbs.bsky.social\n\nFRONTLINE is produced at GBH in Boston and airs nationwide on PBS.

      "content": "<article>Thousands of people from Africa attempt to reach Europe via the Mediterranean. The EU is disrupting these migration routes and outsourcing its border control responsibilities to countries in the Sahara and Sahel regions.\n\nChristian and David try not to fall off the back of the pick-up. The vehicle is being driven at breakneck speed through the desert by smugglers. Like hundreds of thousands of people before them, the two Nigerians are traveling from West Africa to the Libyan Mediterranean coast. They’re hoping to reach Europe and the promise of a better life.\n\nIn a bid to stem irregular migration, the European Union is ramping up spending on migration, asylum and border management to tens of billions of euros. Some of the money funds migration partnerships with African countries. The aim is to halt people well before they reach Europe’s external borders. Local security forces are under orders to stop migrants in the desert, effectively making the Sahara a key arena in Europe’s border policy. But many of these desert regions have limited governance. Smuggling networks, human traffickers and armed groups operate there with general impunity.\n\nThe documentary joins migrants on the most dangerous leg of their trip: traversing the Sahara. An investigative journey on a migration route that reveals the full reach of Europe’s border policies - and the price paid by those desperate to reach the continent.\nOnly those who’ve survived the traffickers and torturers, who haven’t been imprisoned and deported, reach the Mediterranean. And crossing the sea brings a whole set of new dangers.\n\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #europe #migration \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

What do they do to our metabolism, and could they change public health forever?\n\n\nOUR CHANNELS\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nGerman:        https://kgs.link/youtubeDE\nSpanish:        https://kgs.link/youtubeES\nFrench:          https://kgs.link/youtubeFR\nPortuguese:  https://kgs.link/youtubePT\nArabic:           https://kgs.link/youtubeAR\nHindi:             https://kgs.link/youtubeHI\nJapanese:     https://kgs.link/youtubeJA\nKorean:          https://kgs.link/youtubeKO\n\n\nHOW CAN YOU SUPPORT US?\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nThis is how we make our living and it would be a pleasure if you support us!\n\nGet Products designed with ❤️ https://shop.kgs.link\nJoin the Patreon Bird Army 🐧  https://kgs.link/patreon  \n\n\nDISCUSSIONS &amp; SOCIAL MEDIA\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nInstagram:     https://kgs.link/instagram\nTikTok:           https://kgs.link/tiktok\nReddit:            https://kgs.link/reddit\nDiscord:          https://kgs.link/discord\nTwitter:           https://kgs.link/twitter\nBluesky:          https://kgs.link/bluesky\nFacebook:      https://kgs.link/facebook\nNewsletter:    https://kgs.link/newsletter\n\n\nOUR VOICE\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nThe kurzgesagt voice is from \nSteve Taylor:  https://kgs.link/youtube-voice\n\n\nOUR MUSIC ♬♪\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\n700+ minutes of kurzgesagt soundtracks by Epic Mountain:\n\nSpotify:            https://kgs.link/music-spotify\nSoundcloud:   https://kgs.link/music-soundcloud\nBandcamp:     https://kgs.link/music-bandcamp\nYoutube:          https://kgs.link/music-youtube\nFacebook:       https://kgs.link/music-facebook\n\nThe soundtrack of this video:\nSoundCloud: https://bit.ly/ozempic-music\nBandcamp: https://bit.ly/ozempic-track\n\nIf you want to help us caption this video, please send subtitles to subtitle@kurzgesagt.org\nYou can find info on what subtitle files work on YouTube here:\nhttps://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2734698?hl=en-GB&amp;ref_topic=7296214\nThank you!\n\n\n🐦🐧🐤 PATREON BIRD ARMY 🐤🐧🐦\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nMany thanks to our wonderful Patreons (from http://kgs.link/patreon) who support us every month and made this video possible:\nAaron Relyea, Atley Palazzetti, Ben, Bora Ciner, Charles Vane, Chrissi_rsv, Conlan Long, David Feng, Drew, Jan Rodemerk, Joshua Bock, João Lídio Bisneto, Klaymeb, LF0984, Mark McDonald, Matthew Pabst, Melissa Utomo, Micael Batista, Noah Evers, Robert Pennoyer, Schwubbi, Sevn, Stealthcomman, Stefan Hanemann, Stephen Johnson, Štěpán Pijáček, 성 이름</article>",

      "content": "<article>©Bangalore International Centre\n\nA different kind of video.\n\nIn this recording of a talk I recently gave, I first of all discuss my journey to YouTube (first 15mins), and then I talk about how art can (and should) be seen in so many different ways, and all are relevant.  \n\nI never set out to become a \"YouTuber\". I simply wanted to make art history accessible, stumbling into success with over two million subscribers along the way. And now, a book! \n\n“In a world of noise and distraction,” I say in my book, “great art slows us down. It demands attention, reflection, and interpretation. It doesn’t exist to give us easy answers—but it does give us better questions.”\n\nIn this illustrated talk, I bring my signature storytelling and striking visuals to explore celebrated artworks not as distant masterpieces, but as creations shaped by real people, real pressures, real ambitions. Through visual analysis, historical context, and human stories, I reveal how art intersects with power, class, money, religion, politics, and everyday life. No academic jargon. No dense theory. Just essential questions: Why was this made? What did it mean then? Why does it matter now?\n\nThroughout the talk, I encourage and guide the audience to slow down and really look. Details often missed in galleries are brought into focus, helping viewers understand how artists guide the eye, create meaning, and communicate emotion. As much as it is about learning facts, the talk is about learning how to look.\n\nThis is art history as it should be: open, democratic, relevant.\n\nCopyright Disclaimer under section 107 of the Copyright Act of 1976, allowance is made for “fair use” for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, education and research.

      "content": "<article>John F. Kennedy's Moonshot set the United States on a daring path to land humans on the Moon and return them safely to Earth by the end of the 1960s. In his iconic 1961 speech to Congress, Kennedy framed space conquest as a decisive Cold War challenge, arguing that the nation needed a bold, unifying goal that would accelerate science, technology, and national pride. The Moonshot galvanized NASA, industry, and universities to develop the Saturn V rocket, the Apollo Command/Service Module, and the Lunar Module, while training a generation of astronauts, engineers, and technicians. The plan demanded rapid technological advances, massive budgets, and unprecedented cross-sector coordination. Along the way, Mercury and Gemini missions built crucial experience in orbital operations, rendezvous, and life-support systems that made the Moon landings possible. In 1969, Apollo 11 achieved the primary objective: Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walked on the lunar surface while Michael Collins orbited above, delivering humanity’s first steps beyond Earth’s gravity. The Moonshot reshaped science, engineering, education, and global prestige, triggering tech spinoffs in computing, materials, and communications that still influence modern technology. The program also faced political shifts, budget pressures, and real risks, reminding us that exploration requires courage and resilience. This video breaks down the goal, the milestones, and the enduring legacy of JFK's Moonshot. \n\n#JFK #MoonLanding #Apollo11 #NASA #SpaceRace #HistoryShorts #epichistory</article>",

This film presents the latest scientific theories on how the human species evolved and looks at the shadow side of our unique abilities.\n\nSome animals see, hear or smell better than humans. Others can find their way in the dark much better than we can. Some can fly. All animals communicate, some have excellent memories and others build complex structures and have highly-developed social skills. \n\nSo what sets humans apart? Why have humans evolved such highly developed cognitive abilities in comparison to animals? The documentary sheds light on this major question of human evolution -- one of the mysteries that has long puzzled the world of science.

He discusses how Chainguard tackles this problem by building everything from source using Wolfi, creating minimal \"distroless\" images with near-zero CVEs, and how concepts like SBOMs, attestations, and defense in depth are reshaping security practices.\n\nThe conversation also covers major security incidents including the XZ Utils backdoor and Shai-hulud attacks, emphasizing the importance of building from source, using short-lived credentials, and replacing rather than updating containers – practices pioneered by companies like Google that are gradually spreading across the industry.\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n01:02 Early adoption of containers\n02:12 The problem of outdated packages\n05:21 Understanding scanners &amp; vulnerabilities\n09:39 Google Distroless &amp; the beginning of Chainguard\n14:39 Wolfi &amp; building from source\n20:14 Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) &amp; attestations\n27:01 Defense in depth &amp; best practices\n34:32 The XZ utils backdoor\n38:14 Resources\n38:52 Outro\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nAdrian Mouat • Using Docker • https://amzn.to/3PEYIJL\nLiz Rice • Container Security • https://amzn.to/3oU4iJe\nLiz Rice • Kubernetes Security • https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/kubernetes-security/9781492039075\n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.instagram.com/goto_con\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#Chainguard #Cybersecurity #Security #Wolfi #GoogleDistroless #SBOM #SoftwareBillOfMaterials #XZutils #ShaiHulud #ShaiHuludAttack #Containers #ContainerSecurity #Docker #DockerSecurity #TodaInTech #AdrianMouat #CharlesHumble\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

      "content": "<article>A technical masterpiece -- and a big responsibility. The Kiel Canal in Germany is the busiest artificial waterway in the world. But keeping it operational is expensive.\n\nThe infrastructure of the Kiel Canal is a much-discussed topic. As is the case in Germany with roads, bridges and railway tracks, cost-cutting measures are also impacting waterways. \n\nYet the canal offers decisive advantages for freight transport: every shipping container transported here replaces a long lorry journey. This saves fuel and improves the freight’s carbon footprint.\n\nEvery year, 25,000 to 30,000 ships pass through the artificial waterway that runs between the port cities of Kiel and Brunsbüttel, connecting the Baltic Sea with the North Sea. But the Kiel Canal, which opened in 1895 and is almost 100 kilometers long, requires constant monitoring and maintenance.\n\nIn the summer of 2024, one of the large lock chambers in Brunsbüttel had to be shut down for several months, and the canal was widened. Up to 30,000 cubic meters of soil were removed here every day to meet the increased demands of shipping traffic. \n\nTwo young boat builders, both named Paul, have little inkling of these challenges. They bought an old sailing boat and made it seaworthy again. The canal and its locks are the first big adventure of their journey, which will take them to the Canary Islands.\n\nThe impressive ships that sail the Kiel Canal have attracted their own fan base. Ship spotters regularly gather on the banks of the canal to watch the majestic cargo ships. \nParking attendant Rainer Schmidt is in charge of maintenance for the Rendsburg viewing point. One of his most important tasks is to keep the hedges trimmed, to ensure the view of the canal is not obstructed.\n\nThe report highlights the different facets of the Kiel Canal and shows how closely people are connected to this waterway. It accompanies them in their everyday lives and during special challenges, against the impressive backdrop of an ageing, but fascinating, technical monument.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #germany #kiel \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

One was Insys, which sold fentanyl, a drug fifty times stronger than heroin. *Part 1: https://youtu.be/MyQQiK3vn88*\n\nProfit was gained by any means necessary - from strippers seducing doctors to bribery, insurance fraud and massive dose increases without the consent of patients. Some did not survive.\n\nIn Florida, unscrupulous profiteers opened pain clinics that turned out to be \"pill mills” - legal hubs for drugs. Chris George, head of the largest network, cynically reports on the system that made him rich before he spent 11 years in prison.\n\nBut by the end of the 2010s, the party was over: the justice system put a stop to the legal trade. Pharmacies stopped selling opioids. But the pills did not disappear. Mexican drug cartels took over the business. Members of the Sinaloa cartel explain in the documentary how they copied the methods of US pharmaceutical companies. To this day, they continue to flood the streets of America with fentanyl.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #opioidcrisis  #usa #addictionawareness \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

This is a painting designed to be decoded.\n\nUnlike Renaissance harmony (think Leonardo or Raphael) this painting feels tense, airless. There is no stable ground and Venus’ body twists unnaturally; Cupid’s leg bends at an impossible angle. Even beauty feels slightly disturbing.\n\nAnd that’s the point.</article>",

      "content": "<article>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has a playbook for fighting back against the Trump administration, and he says it’s working. Few Democratic politicians have leaned into the fight against the Trump administration as aggressively as he has. While some blue-state leaders have tried to find a lane of compromise or quiet resistance, Pritzker has gone the other direction: signing laws to limit ICE operations in Illinois, creating an accountability commission staffed by retired federal judges, suing the federal government, and successfully blocking the deployment of federalized National Guard troops on Chicago’s streets.\n\nPritzker is a unique figure in Democratic politics. A billionaire heir to the Hyatt hotel fortune, he has spent tens of millions of his own dollars to push for a more progressive income tax in Illinois and has advocated for a national wealth tax — policies that would directly cost him money. He's also a Jewish Democrat who has navigated his party’s shifting positions on Israel and Gaza and is a two-term governor who has drawn some public support as a potential 2028 presidential candidate.\n\n00:00 Intro \n01:22 The Illinois playbook against Trump \n03:23 Are Dems too timid in their pushback against Trump? \n05:07 Are our elections safe? \n06:17 Democrats and immigration \n09:27 A billionaire in favor of the wealth tax \n11:12 Is Gov.

We analyze why the FBI is still hiding crucial investigation files—like the 302 victim statements—while Ghislaine Maxwell receives a mysterious prison upgrade and offers conditional testimony. The names are finally out, but as this investigation proves, the cover-up is far from over.\n\nIn this video we ask who are: Les Wexner and Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem.  Since the video was released after being questioned by The Guardian - the Department of Justice said that four of the men have no connection to Epstein whatsoever, but rather appeared in a photo lineup assembled by the southern district of New York (SDNY). https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/13/four-men-unredacted-epstein-files-no-ties-ro-khanna\n\nPatrick's Books:\nStatistics For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3eerLA0\nDerivatives For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3cjsyPF\nCorporate Finance:  https://amzn.to/3fn3rvC \n\nWays To Support The Channel\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/PatrickBoyleOnFinance\nBuy Me a Coffee: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/patrickboyle\n\nVisit our website: https://www.onfinance.org\nFollow Patrick on Twitter Here: https://bsky.app/profile/pboyle.bsky.social\n\nBusiness Inquiries ➡️ sponsors@onfinance.org\n\nPatrick Boyle On Finance Podcast:\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/7uhrWlDvxzy9hLoW0EYf0b\nApple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/patrick-boyle-on-finance/id1547740313\nGoogle Podcasts: https://tinyurl.com/62862nve\n\nJoin this channel to support making this content:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCASM0cgfkJxQ1ICmRilfHLw/join</article>",

New structures of protection, security and dignity are emerging in Ukraine, while war shapes everyday life.\n\nAll of Ukraine has been at war since Russia’s full-scale attack in February 2022. It is a war whose repercussions are inescapable. And it is giving rise to new structures that every country would be happier to be able to live without. \n\nOne of these is a network of carers who risk their lives to evacuate elderly and sick people from homes that they are often unable to leave on their own. For some, it’s the first journey of their lives, for others, the last. \n\nA different team, of forensic scientists and military personnel, works to identify the remains of young soldiers. The bodies of the fallen are then transported across Ukraine to their families so that they can be buried in their hometowns. These tasks are all the more difficult, as they must be accomplished amidst the constant threat of bombs and drones. \n\nAs Russia's war of aggression rages against Ukraine, Yuri Rechinsky documents the everyday lives of those who are too weak to flee, or who care for the dead. He captures impressions of displacement, uncertainty, grief and loss, but also shows moments of solidarity, humor and resilience. \"Dear Beautiful Beloved\" takes a sober look at the survival strategies of people who retain their humanity in the midst of war.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #ukraine \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

      "content": "<article>Ragnar Lothbrok's death in a snake pit is one of the Viking Age's most enduring legends, shaping both Norse memory and later European storytelling. Across sagas and chronicles, Ragnar's capture by Northumbria's kings and his doom at the hands of King Aelle is presented as a defining moment—an emblem of Viking fate, defiance, and the high cost of ambition. The epic scene—Ragnar hurled into a pit of venomous serpents and left to endure torture—has been retold with varying details, but the core image remains: a royal ambush ending in a brutal ordeal that tests a warrior's courage to the limit. Equally contested are Ragnar's dying words. Different sources offer different lines, some casting him as a prophetic father warning his sons about what is to come, others giving him a stoic farewell that underscores revenge and resilience. This video traces the saga-side of the death, mapping how later storytellers and medieval chroniclers adapted the tale for their audiences, and how modern dramatizations reframe it for contemporary viewers. We compare primary sources like the Saga of Ragnar Lodbrok, the Prose Edda, and the Anglo-Saxon chronicles, noting where history ends and legend begins and how memory elevates the figure into a cultural icon. If you enjoy mythic history, epic voyages, and the way legends migrate through time, subscribe for more Viking-age legends, join the discussion about what Ragnar’s final words meant, and explore how the story informs our view of courage, kinship, and vengeance.\n\n#RagnarLothbrok, #Vikings, #NorseMythology, #VikingHistory, #HistoryShorts, #RagnarDeath</article>",

This is because muscles work in a similar way to an endocrine organ: when activated, muscles release messenger substances called myokines, which directly influence our central organs such as the brain, liver, heart and intestines. If we lose muscle mass, these organs can become diseased, or metabolic disorders like diabetes can develop. Increased strength and muscle mass have been linked to better mental health, increased focus, improved sleep, and stronger immunity. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #fitness \n______\n\nWe kindly ask viewers to read and stick to the DW netiquette policy on our channel: https://p.dw.com/p/MF1G</article>",

Sam, a software developer with 30 years of experience spanning companies from startups to AWS, shares his approach to applying clean architecture principles with Python while maintaining the language's pragmatic nature.\n\nThe conversation explores the balance between architectural rigor and practical development, the critical relationship between architecture and testability, and how clean architecture principles can enhance AI-assisted coding workflows. Sam emphasizes that clean architecture isn't an all-or-nothing approach but a set of principles that developers can adapt to their context, with the core value lying in thoughtful dependency management and clear domain modeling.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nSam Keen • Clean Architecture with Python • https://amzn.to/4pBT5g0\nFabrizio Romano &amp; Heinrich Kruger • Learn Python Programming • https://amzn.to/4myLBIt\nUncle Bob • Clean Code • https://amzn.to/3soPO6k\nUncle Bob • Clean Architecture • https://amzn.to/3x0gjBQ\nEric Evans • Domain-Driven Design • https://amzn.to/3tnGhwm\nNaomi Ceder • The Quick Python Book • https://amzn.to/3zwdDOa\nLuciano Ramalho • Fluent Python • https://amzn.to/3oSw2je\nDavid Beazley • Python Distilled (Developer's Library) • https://amzn.to/3QjNBEv\nSaleem Siddiqui • Learning Test-Driven Development • https://amzn.to/35OMb3n\nMaciej «MJ» Jedrzejewski • Master Software Architecture • https://leanpub.com/master-software-architecture\n\n\nBluesky (https://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com) \nTwitter (https://twitter.com/GOTOcon) \nInstagram (https://www.instagram.com/goto_con) \nLinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-) \nFacebook (https://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences) \n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

      "content": "<article>Liberland is a country that doesn’t officially exist. A country that promises voluntary taxes and a lean state. It’s a libertarian utopia that’s finding more supporters worldwide.\n\nAfter the Yugoslav Wars, the border between Serbia and Croatia along the Danube river remained unresolved. Vit Jedlička, a former politician from the Czech Republic, took advantage of this situation. He proclaimed the \"Free Republic of Liberland” on a seven-square-kilometer piece of land in 2015. \nLiberland is not internationally recognized, and its president is not allowed to set foot on the soil of his republic. Croatia sees the founding of Liberland as an attack on its territorial integrity.\nThe film accompanies Samuela Davidova, influencer, crypto enthusiast, and spokesperson for Liberland, and Liberland‘s president, Vit Jedlička, on a journey into two very different worlds. \nOn the one hand, they travel to Dubai, a glittering metropolitan meeting place for crypto-enthusiastic elites. Here, they want to recruit investors — and new citizens. \nAnd on the other hand, they travel to \"Ark Village,” the base camp of the Liberland community on Serbian soil. Here, they celebrate the 10th anniversary of Liberland.\nThe highlight of the journey is a boat trip to the shores of Liberland. Liberland claims to function as a meritocracy: taxes are voluntary, but those who invest more have a greater say. \nThe Liberland experiment may seem like an oddity, but it also raises serious questions: Cryptocurrencies and decentralized networks are undermining traditional national borders, and radical market ideas are gaining influence. Parallel structures are emerging. Critics see them as a threat to democracy. Others, of course, sense opportunity. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #liberland #crypto #cryptocurrency \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Anywhere from 50 to 90% of people who menstruate deal with painful abdominal or pelvic cramps during their period. Individual experiences can vary, from mild discomfort, to throbbing aches, to contraction-like cramps that rival the pain of labor. So, why do menstrual cramps hurt so much? Chen X. Chen explains this surprisingly common experience.\n\nLesson by Chen X.

If today's quantum computing manufacturers achieve their roadmaps, RSA-2048 will be broken within the next few years. Beyond a sea change for encrypted communications globally, this heralds the arrival of a new era of HPC workflows and the possibility of solving heretofore unsolvable problems.\n\nIn this talk, we will discuss the current state of research into what applications might come online first, the nascent ecosystems for delivering them, and the call to action to all developers to prepare for Q-Day and beyond!

While Osama bin Laden was the face of Al-Qaeda, many intelligence experts argue that Ayman al-Zawahiri was the true operational mastermind and strategic architect of the 9/11 attacks.\n\nIn this deep-dive documentary, we explore the chilling transformation of an Egyptian surgeon into the world’s most wanted man. We uncover how Ayman al-Zawahiri radicalized Bin Laden, merging his Egyptian Islamic Jihad group with Al-Qaeda to create a global insurgency. For over two decades, the CIA manhunt for \"The Doctor\" spanned continents, from the mountains of Tora Bora to his final days in a Kabul safehouse.\n\nWe break down the high-stakes counter-terrorism operation that ended with a precision drone strike on a balcony in Afghanistan. Was Zawahiri more dangerous than Bin Laden? How did he manage to evade justice for 21 years? Join us as we examine the legacy of the man who redefined modern warfare and the War on Terror.\n\nPlease subscribe here. https://www.youtube.com/@PeopleProfiles?sub_confirmation=1\nOur second channel. https://www.youtube.com/@PeopleProfilesExtra\nFollow us on Spotify. https://open.spotify.com/show/7fKALbrzEO9Q4VVvAwWHqL\nSupport us on Patreon https://patreon.com/thepeopleprofiles\nFollow us on Twitter. https://twitter.com/tpprofiles\n\nThanks for watching!

Around 40 to 60 volcanoes erupt every year.\n\nThe eruption of Mont Pelée on the Caribbean island of Martinique is considered the deadliest volcanic eruption of the 20th century. \nOn May 8, 1902, a pyroclastic flow wiped out the island's  cultural capital, Saint-Pierre. Known as the \"Paris of the Caribbean,” the city was located just seven kilometers away from the eruption, and was engulfed in a matter of minutes. An estimated 28,000 to 30,000 people were killed - they were burned, or suffocated. \nThe eruption came as a complete surprise to the islanders, as the signs of the volcano’s activity were ignored. \nThe disaster led to the establishment of the first volcanic observatories and marked the birth of volcanology. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #martinique #volcano \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Those insiders include Venezuela’s acting president Delcy Rodríguez — who, the AP found, has been on the radar of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration for years.\n\nIt also examines the Trump administration’s relationship with Rodríguez and its approach to democracy in Venezuela in the aftermath of Maduro’s capture. \n\n“Crisis in Venezuela” is a FRONTLINE production with Mongoose Pictures and Documento Films in association with The Associated Press.

      "content": "<article>On 3 February 2026, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi was shot dead by four unknown gunmen in Zintan, Libya. This documentary was produced in 2023 and has not been updated for this reupload. It traces the turbulent life of the second son of the former Libyan dictator Muammar al-Gaddafi. In 2021, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi unexpectedly announced that he would run for the presidency in Libya.\n\nStatements from relatives and political actors paint a portrait of an unpredictable and fiercely determined man. Saif al-Islam Gaddafi’s presidential bid is a major challenge for Libya. The second son of the Libyan dictator Muammar Al Gaddafi has been convicted several times in Libya and is being prosecuted by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity.\n\nSaif al-Islam Gaddafi has had an unusual life: he grew up a clan that operated with a high degree of paranoia, suspecting conspiracies at work everwhere. Later, he led a playboy lifestyle in Europe, presenting himself to the world as a reformer. In the second phase of his life, which began with the Libyan revolution of 2011, he perpetuated the repressive style of his father’s regime. He was taken prisoner by anti-Gaddafi militias who made him stand trial -- but only allowed him to take part via videolink. \n\nEveryone in Libya is talking about him, all kinds of rumors are doing the rounds, his life is under threat. People say he’s a crazy, sick mystic who’s absconded into the desert. What’s making him run for president, despite the death threats? Does he stand a chance of winning? What does he know about the secret machinations of his father’s regime? His eventful life mirrors the current chaos in Libya: a country divided, with one government in the east and another in the west, rival militias vying for power and foreign states influencing the conflict. With statements from relatives and political actors, the film paints a portrait of Saif al-Islam Gaddafi - an unpredictable and fiercely determined survivor who is trying to find his way.  \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #libya #gaddafi \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

      "content": "<article>In 1805, during the Napoleonic Wars, two pivotal battles highlighted the highs and lows of Napoleon Bonaparte's empire-building. First, his brilliance shone at the Battle of Austerlitz on December 2, dubbed the \"Battle of the Three Emperors.\" Facing a larger Austro-Russian army of 85,000 under Tsar Alexander I and Emperor Francis II, Napoleon's 68,000 French troops executed a masterful strategy. He deliberately weakened his right flank to lure the allies into a trap, then launched a devastating counterattack on the Pratzen Heights, splitting their forces. Using fog for cover and precise artillery, Napoleon's Grande Armée inflicted 16,000 casualties while losing only 9,000. The victory dissolved the Third Coalition, forced Austria to sue for peace, and cemented Napoleon's reputation as a tactical genius, leading to the Confederation of the Rhine and his continental dominance.\n\nConversely, Trafalgar's tragedy unfolded at sea on October 21, off Spain's Cape Trafalgar. Napoleon's invasion plans for Britain hinged on naval superiority, but Admiral Pierre-Charles Villeneuve's combined Franco-Spanish fleet of 33 ships met British Admiral Horatio Nelson's 27 vessels. Nelson's innovative \"breaking the line\" tactic divided the enemy formation, resulting in a crushing defeat: 22 allied ships captured or destroyed, with no British losses. Nelson died from wounds, but the battle ensured British naval supremacy, ending Napoleon's dreams of invading England and shifting his focus to land campaigns. These battles encapsulate Napoleon's land genius versus his naval vulnerabilities, reshaping Europe's power balance.\n\n#napoleon #napoleonicwars #navalhistory #epichistory #epichistorytv</article>",

      "content": "<article>The mayor of Budapest, Gergely Karácsony, is facing criminal charges. In defiance of President Viktor Orbán’s ban, he organized a Pride march in the city on 28 June 2025—the largest such event ever held in Hungary.\n\nA few months earlier, the government had further tightened its controversial so-called Child Protection Law, which severely restricts the rights of the LGBTQ+ community in Hungary. The Pride event drew supporters both from within the country and abroad. \n\nOur documentary follows Béla, Zsu, and Norbert, who refuse to be intimidated and are prepared to publicly stand up against Orbán’s authoritarian government.\n\nPhotographer Béla Varadi is Roma and identifies as queer. He moved to London a few years after the right-wing nationalist Fidesz party came to power in 2010, making life increasingly hard for queer people and minorities. Béla visited Hungary in 2025 to take photos at the Pride march.\nIn Budapest, Béla meets up with Norbert, who is also Roma and queer. Norbert loves the city, but social tensions are proving challenging. Despite support from his family, Norbert is considering emigrating—a step many queer people in Hungary have already taken.\n\nZsu and Enikő are a young lesbian couple from Budapest. They recently bought a house in the countryside and plan to move there soon. But how will they fare as outsiders in a rural community?\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #LGBTQ+ #hungary \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

They discuss how AI tools are transforming developer workflows, making developers about 20% faster on simple tasks while being 19% slower on complex ones.\n\nThe conversation covers critical topics including code quality and trust, security concerns with AI-generated code, the importance of education and best practices, and how developer roles are shifting from syntax experts to system architects. Both experts emphasize that AI tools serve as amplifiers rather than replacements, with humans remaining essential in the loop for quality, security, and licensing compliance.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nPhil Winder • Reinforcement Learning • https://amzn.to/3t1S1VZ\nAlex Castrounis • AI for People and Business • https://amzn.to/3NYKKTo\nHolden Karau, Trevor Grant, Boris Lublinsky, Richard Liu &amp; Ilan Filonenko • Kubeflow for Machine Learning • https://amzn.to/3JVngcx\nKelleher &amp; Tierney • Data Science (The MIT Press Essential Knowledge series) • https://amzn.to/3AQmIRg\nLakshmanan, Robinson &amp; Munn • Machine Learning Design Patterns • https://amzn.to/2ZD7t0x\nLakshmanan, Görner &amp; Gillard • Practical Machine Learning for Computer Vision • https://amzn.to/3m9HNjP\n\n\nBluesky (https://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com) \nTwitter (https://twitter.com/GOTOcon) \nInstagram (https://www.instagram.com/goto_con) \nLinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-) \nFacebook (https://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences) \n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

Almost overnight, the Lapua movement collapsed.

How do you know that the path you are on will work out - you don’t. Are you struggling with complexity, inertia and problems? It’s time to stop spinning your wheels and start building real momentum. Join David Anderson, author of The Value Flywheel Effect, for a session dedicated to breaking this cycle. He will share tried-and-tested mechanisms to build a self-reinforcing engine for innovation, accelerating value delivery. The Value Flywheel Effect is a proven framework that empowers teams to achieve accelerating cycles of learning, delivery, and value through focused modernization.\n\nIn this talk, you'll learn:\n• Creating Flow: Modernization is about movement.

Aren’t they?\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nWhen we play games — board games, video games, any kind of game — something magical happens. Games allow us to explore, to create little worlds where we can be different versions of ourselves. But when we turn life into a game — where we have to get the best grade, or the most money, or the most “likes” — then games stop being fun. Why is that?\n\nThis week Sean speaks with philosopher C. Thi Nguyen about what a game really is, the difference between playing for enjoyment and playing to win, and why games lose their magic when the stakes become real.\n\nThi argues that the things we value in life are increasingly captured by grades and likes and downloads and step counts and a thousand other metrics that quietly rewrite what we want and what we think makes us happy.\n\nHost: Sean Illing (@SeanIlling)\nGuest: C. Thi Nguyen, author of The Score\n\n00:00 Intro\n00:38 What is a game?\n09:18 Playing a game for fun vs. playing to win\n10:09 Why “gamifying” life isn't fun\n24:26 Metrics and “value capture”\n27:57 Metrics can reshape how we see ourselves\n33:58 Why metrics aren't proxies for everything we care about\n42:13 Deciding when metrics matter and when they don't\n\nWe would love to hear from you.

We dive into the “Social Ponzi Scheme” that enabled decades of abuse, exploring the suspicious real estate transfers, cryptocurrency custodian links, and the international criminal probes that are currently toppling political giants across the globe. From the high-level PR strategies of the “Wall Street Renaissance Man” to the harrowing evidence of a eugenics-obsessed operation, we explore why this long-awaited transparency should not be confused with actual justice. As it turns out, when the powerful retreat into “vast carelessness,” it is often because they have spent years building a system designed to silence the questions they cannot answer.\n\n@2lazy2tryYT Video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KT9td3FJxj8&amp;t=68s\n\nPatrick's Books:\nStatistics For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3eerLA0\nDerivatives For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3cjsyPF\nCorporate Finance:  https://amzn.to/3fn3rvC \n\nWays To Support The Channel\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/PatrickBoyleOnFinance\nBuy Me a Coffee: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/patrickboyle\n\nVisit our website: https://www.onfinance.org\nFollow Patrick on Twitter Here: https://bsky.app/profile/pboyle.bsky.social\n\nBusiness Inquiries ➡️ sponsors@onfinance.org\n\nPatrick Boyle On Finance Podcast:\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/7uhrWlDvxzy9hLoW0EYf0b\nApple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/patrick-boyle-on-finance/id1547740313\nGoogle Podcasts: https://tinyurl.com/62862nve\n\nJoin this channel to support making this content:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCASM0cgfkJxQ1ICmRilfHLw/join</article>",

      "content": "<article>Women around the world are working to break down outdated structures and empower one another. Initiatives in Germany and Ecuador are calling for equal rights in the workplace, self-determination, and financial independence for women.\n\nOne of the women working for change is surgeon Katja Schlosser. The former head physician at Agaplesion Hospital in Giessen is working with her association \"Die Chirurginnen” (The Female Surgeons) to ensure that female colleagues can continue to practice their profession even during pregnancy. In some clinics, pregnant women are still banned from operating rooms - often due to restrictive interpretations of the Maternity Protection Act. This can put female surgeons at a disadvantage compared to their male colleagues. That’s why Katja Schlosser is calling for an equal say in decision-making processes, as well as equal career opportunities for women.\nStanding up for themselves is often difficult for girls from male-dominated cultures. Take Bahareh Husseini. She fled Iran and now lives in the German city of Düsseldorf. She wanted to study and be able determine her own path in life. In Germany, she found support at Diakonie, a Protestant social welfare organization. There, Jessica te Heesen heads the JUMP project, which helps refugee girls develop self-confidence, assert themselves, and find their way in school and at work. Bahareh is now studying medical physics — and passing on her experiences to others. \nThis is exactly what Patricia Yaselga is promoting with her SEDAL foundation in Ecuador. In the north of the country, many indigenous women have little choice but to work in the cut flower industry. It usually pays only the minimum wage and contaminates the once fertile soil with pesticides and artificial fertilizers. Among the consequences: poverty and malnutrition. SEDAL offers workshops in organic farming for indigenous women so that they can become financially independent and feed their families. The courses don’t just teach them cultivation techniques, but also how to develop self-confidence and assert their rights. Some of the organic farmers are now also politically active in their communities.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #women \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

      "content": "<article>The United States has a huge drug problem: cheap opioids, thousands of deaths. President Trump blames Latin American cartels. But it all began 30 years ago, quite legally, in the United States.\n\nThe Sackler family, owners of Purdue Pharma, brought the prescription painkiller OxyContin - containing the highly potent opioid oxycodone - onto the market, unleashing one of the greatest health disasters in the history of the United States. With hundreds of sales representatives, they pressured doctors in economically disadvantaged regions to prescribe the drug. \n\nOne of the film's protagonists is Dr Lou Ortenzio, who was himself part of this machinery: he brought the drug to his town of Clarksburg before becoming addicted himself. Former sales representatives, now whistleblowers, report how they lied to doctors and claimed that Oxy was not addictive.\n\nA perfectly oiled machine got millions of Americans hooked - and deceived an entire country. Prosecutors like Maura Healey describe their fight to stop Purdue and bring the Sacklers to justice. The investigations reveal a network of power and influence: Purdue secretly received support from McKinsey, consulting firm to the powerful, and from Publicis, a major advertising agency.\n\nThrough exclusive interviews, insider accounts and previously unpublished archive material, this two-part documentary reveals how the Sacklers bribed regulators, pushed Oxy and evaded justice despite overwhelming evidence. The two-part documentary tells the story of a crisis that continues to devastate parts of American society to this day.\n\n*[Part 2 coming next week]*\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #opioidcrisis  #usa #addictionawareness \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

      "content": "<article>During World War II, the Enigma machine was a portable encryption device used by Nazi Germany to secure military communications. Invented in the 1920s by Arthur Scherbius, it resembled a typewriter with rotors, plugs, and lamps that scrambled messages into unbreakable codes— or so the Germans thought. Each key press rotated the rotors, creating billions of possible settings, making decryption seem impossible without the daily key.\n\nEnter the Allied codebreakers at Bletchley Park, Britain—a secret hub of mathematicians, linguists, and engineers. Led by figures like Alan Turing, they formed the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS). Polish cryptologists had cracked early Enigma versions in the 1930s, sharing insights with the Allies before Poland's invasion.\n\nTuring and his team built the \"Bombe,\" an electromechanical machine that tested Enigma settings at high speed, exploiting flaws like repeated message keys. By 1940, they routinely broke codes, producing intelligence codenamed \"Ultra.\" This ultra-secret info, from intercepted German signals, revealed troop movements, U-boat positions, and battle plans.\n\nUltra's impact was immense: it shortened the war by up to two years, aiding D-Day and the Battle of the Atlantic. Codebreakers like Joan Clarke and Gordon Welchman worked in huts, under immense pressure, sworn to secrecy—even postwar. Their efforts saved millions of lives but came at personal costs, including Turing's tragic fate. Today, Enigma symbolizes the dawn of modern computing and cybersecurity.\n\n#EpicHistoryTV #EpicHistory #History #WW2 #WW2history #WorldWar2</article>",

      "content": "<article>Rep. Jasmine Crockett wants you to know she comes by her controversies and clap-backs honestly. The representative from Texas has served just two terms in Congress, but is already a rising political star and a bona fide internet sensation. She’s also become a political lightning rod for Democrats as well as Republicans. Crockett has built her brand on coining phrases that are almost President Donald Trump-like in their virality. She goes after the president and the administration relentlessly, and says it's the only way to stay relevant and gain voters’ trust in the Trump era.\n\nBut if Democrats are less than thrilled with her performance, that’s due more to style than substance, at least, according to her. This week on Today, Explained, Vox’s Astead Herndon travels to Washington, DC, to meet with Crockett and finds her unwilling to back down from her most controversial statements, including comments about some Latino voters having a “slave mentality” and that she doesn’t need Trump voters to win.\n\nRegret and apology are not Crockett’s brand, which has many Democrats worrying about her candidacy for a Senate seat in Texas. In this interview, she walks through her plan and formula for winning that Senate seat: running up the numbers among Black voters, the most loyal voting block for Democrats in Texas, and encouraging nonvoters to participate in the primary.\n\n00:17 Intro \n01:25 Who is a Jasmine Crockett voter?\n01:59 The ‘bleach blonde’ moment: planned or not?\n03:20 Are clapbacks the new Democratic strategy?\n05:28 From public defender to Congress\n07:38 Strategy for Democrats to win \n11:41 Race and racism in US politics\n14:12 Viral anti-Rep. Crockett moments in culture\n17:52 Policy pushbacks against Rep.

This means that today, the average representative is responsible for more than 750,000 constituents. Scholars and politicians argue this imbalance helps explain why many Americans feel disconnected from Congress. \n\nRep. Sean Casten (D-IL) has introduced a bill that would expand the House, aiming to restore a vision closer to what the founders intended: a House that expanded with the population. Supporters say more seats could improve representation, but the idea raises a key question: Would a larger House function better — or just add to the gridlock?

But many animals manage to adapt to the new conditions, thanks to changes in behavior, new survival strategies and, sometimes, even genetic changes.\n\nThe film shows how animals in urban areas live alongside humans, develop new skills and learn habits and behaviors that are suited for life in large cities. While urbanization is changing the way humans live around the globe, it has also opened a new chapter in the evolution of animals. \nBut the question remains: how can we build the cities of tomorrow in such a way that they become a beneficial home for both humans and animals? The film explores these topics in India, the US, Canada, the Netherlands and the UK.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #animals #city \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

They explore how modern software delivery has transformed from simple monolithic deployments to complex microservices ecosystems, drawing parallels between managing production code and managing the \"factory\" that produces it.\n\nThe discussion covers optimization strategies, the balance between local and remote development, platform engineering trends, and how AI is reshaping DevOps practices. Olaf emphasizes that getting software into users' hands is as critical as writing it, and shares how teams can leverage observability, right-sizing, and intelligent automation to improve their delivery pipelines.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nDavid Farley • Continuous Delivery Pipelines • https://leanpub.com/cd-pipelines\nJez Humble &amp; Dave Farley • Continuous Delivery • https://amzn.to/3ocIHwd\nNicole Forsgren, Jez Humble &amp; Gene Kim • Accelerate • https://amzn.to/442Rep0\nKim, Humble, Debois, Willis &amp; Forsgren • The DevOps Handbook • https://amzn.to/47oAf3l\nLauren Maffeo • Designing Data Governance from the Ground Up • https://amzn.to/3QhIlnV\nRoy Osherove • The Art of Unit Testing • https://bit.ly/3obiKNB\nBurns, Beda &amp; Hightower • Kubernetes: Up &amp; Running • https://amzn.to/3sueuuI\nGojko Adzic • Lizard Optimization • https://leanpub.com/lizardoptimization\nGregor Hohpe • Platform Strategy • https://amzn.to/4cxfYdb\n\n\nBluesky (https://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com) \nTwitter (https://twitter.com/GOTOcon) \nInstagram (https://www.instagram.com/goto_con) \nLinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-) \nFacebook (https://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences) \n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

But beneath the surface, Thailand is confronting a long‑brewing economic crisis marked by slow growth, political instability, soaring inequality, demographic decline and a shrinking workforce.\n\nOver the past decade, Thailand’s economy has slipped behind its Southeast Asian peers, struggling with weak GDP growth, declining foreign investment and an overreliance on tourism and low‑value manufacturing. While neighbors like Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia power ahead with new industries and rising exports, Thailand is battling what many economists see as a perfect storm of structural challenges.

      "content": "<article>For more than a century, the size of the House of Representatives has been frozen at 435 seats; in that same period, the US population has tripled. This means that today, the average representative is responsible for more than 750,000 constituents. Scholars and politicians say this imbalance is why many Americans feel like Congress is disconnected from them. \n\nSo what if we…added more seats? That’s what Rep. Sean Casten (D-IL) is proposing in a new bill because he believes it’s closer to what the country’s founders originally envisioned. While expanding Congress could make our ratio of voters to representatives smaller, it also raises a difficult question: Can a larger, more crowded legislature actually govern, or are we just adding more voices to the gridlock? Vox dives into the math, the history, and the potential future of a \"bigger\" American democracy.\n\nRead more about expanding the House of Representatives:\n\nThe Case for Enlarging the House of Representatives, a report from the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, co-authored by Lee Drutman, who’s featured in the video. \nhttps://www.amacad.org/ourcommonpurpose/enlarging-the-house\n\nProtect Democracy: \nhttps://protectdemocracy.org/work/expanding-the-house-of-representatives-explained/\n\nThe text of Rep.

Whether you are a fan of the musical Evita, a student of Latin American politics, or a history enthusiast, this film examines the rise and fall of a woman who challenged the establishment. \n\nWe break down the Peronist movement, her fight for women’s suffrage, and the enduring mystery surrounding her final years.

Our reproductive organs are no exception. Vaginas are engaged in ongoing cycles of fluid discharge. But it can be hard to know what is \"normal\" when there’s a taboo in talking about it. So, what’s healthy discharge? And when is there cause for concern?

As tensions boiled with Denmark's neutral alliance threatening Britain's trade routes, Nelson—under Admiral Hyde Parker—led a daring assault on Copenhagen's harbor. But the real drama? Nelson's threatening letter to the Danish Crown Prince, warning of total bombardment if they didn't surrender their fleet. \"To spare the effusion of blood,\" he wrote, but the Danes stood firm—until Nelson's cannons spoke louder.\n\nWatch as we break down the chaos: Nelson's fleet of 12 ships-of-the-line faced Danish defenses, ignoring orders to retreat with his famous \"turn a blind eye\" tactic. The result? A brutal three-hour bombardment that crippled Denmark's navy, forcing a truce and weakening Napoleon's allies. This wasn't just a battle; it was psychological warfare at its finest, showcasing Nelson's ruthless genius before his Trafalgar triumph.\n\n\n#BattleOfCopenhagen #HoratioNelson #NapoleonicWars #HistoryFacts #BritishHistory #DanishHistory #NavalBattles #epichistory</article>",

      "content": "<article>With its booming economy, Vietnam is considered Asia's next tiger economy. Since the communist government decided to replace Marxism with capitalism, the country has undergone a transformation.\n\nVietnam has a growing number of millionaires, and signs of growth are everywhere. But this prosperity comes at a price: anyone who dares to criticize the official policy of the Communist Party risks losing everything. \n\nThe only political organization permitted under the Vietnamese constitution is the Communist Party. It has over 5 million members, but the real power lies with the Central Committee, headed by General Secretary To Lam. \n\nOne of the richest women in the country is Le Hoang Diep Thao, aka the \"Queen of Coffee.” She proudly shows us around her plantations. But she does not own any of this fertile land: Because there is no private ownership of land in Vietnam, she leases it from the government. If she were to criticize their policies, she could lose everything. \n\nIn 2017, Pastor Nguyen Trung Ton was arrested by the police. After a sham trial, he was sentenced to 12 in prison for \"propaganda against the state.” His real crime was attempting to defend individual freedoms and human rights. His health has deteriorated dramatically in prison. \n\nWhile most political opponents have sought asylum abroad, some children of Vietnamese migrants are returning. Anthony TK Nguyen, an American of Vietnamese descent, has returned to his homeland with his brother to try his luck there. In Nha Trang, a popular seaside resort, he runs one of the hottest nightclubs around - and hopes to profit from the economic boom.\n\nThe documentary looks at the meteoric rise of Vietnam — a country currently performing a difficult balancing act between capitalist ambitions and communist-style control.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #vietnam \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

      "content": "<article>How did PFAS chemicals once used in popular stain-resistant carpets end up in the water and environment in parts of Georgia and Alabama? An investigation from FRONTLINE in partnership with The Associated Press, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, The Post and Courier and AL.com.\n\nThis journalism is made possible by viewers like you. Donate to FRONTLINE now: https://bit.ly/47DFzCb\n\nAnd support your local PBS station here: https://www.pbs.org/donate\n\nFor decades, PFAS, a group of manmade forever chemicals prized for their water- and stain-resistance, were ubiquitous in everything from nonstick pans to raincoats to shoes. But accumulating research has linked some kinds of PFAS to serious health problems. In few places is this issue more pronounced than northwest Georgia, home to some of the world’s largest carpet companies, and now grappling with an environmental crisis.  \n\nThis story unfolds in “Contaminated: The Carpet Industry’s Toxic Legacy,” a documentary investigating how PFAS chemicals once used in making stain-resistant carpets ended up in the environment and the drinking water in parts of Georgia and Alabama, and the ongoing health impacts. \n\n“Contaminated: The Carpet Industry’s Toxic Legacy” is part of a groundbreaking multiplatform investigative collaboration among local and national news organizations. Over much of the past year, the consortium of journalists reviewed thousands of pages of documents and court depositions and interviewed former regulators and industry insiders, as well as doctors, scientists and people who have the kinds of illnesses that researchers have linked to PFAS contamination. \n\nThe carpet industry has long insisted it’s not to blame for PFAS getting into the environment and noted that chemical companies obscured the risks and assured them the products they were supplying were safe. But recently reviewed records also show that executives from two of the largest carpet companies received warnings dating back decades about potential harms of some types of PFAS.\n\nThe companies say they stopped using any kind of PFAS in U.S. manufacturing in 2019. But since PFAS takes so long to break down, communities fear that decades of use of these forever chemicals have made their drinking water unsafe — and local governments say the problem is too vast for them to fix alone.\n\n“Contaminated: The Carpet Industry’s Toxic Legacy” is a FRONTLINE production with Five O’Clock Films in association with the AP, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, AL.com and The Post and Courier. The writer, director and producer is Jonathan Schienberg. The producers are Kate McCormick and Dana Miller Ervin. The reporters are Jason Dearen of the AP, Dylan Jackson and Justin Price of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and Margaret Kates of AL.com.

      "content": "<article>A filmmaker’s firsthand experience of the US attacks on Venezuela. Her country is at the center of geopolitics—but ordinary people are powerless. A view from Caracas, caught between hope and resignation.\n\nIn December 2025, the death of her stepfather Nelson brought documentary filmmaker Anabel Rodríguez Ríos home to Venezuela, to mourn with her mother. The country is economically devastated, and the public healthcare system is in crisis. Medical treatment might have helped save her stepfather’s life. But it was too expensive.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Caribbean Sea, off the coast of Venezuela, the US is stationing warships. US President Donald Trump threatened Venezuela’s deposed leader Nicolás Maduro with war, accusing him of \"narco-terrorism.” In September 2025, the United States begins ordering strikes on Venezuelan boats without an international legal mandate; the claim is that these are boats belong to drug traffickers. More than 100 people have been killed in these strikes so far.\n\nOn the night of 3 January 2026, Anabel Rodríguez Ríos is awakened by bombs—the US has launched a strike on Venezuela. Maduro and his wife are captured and taken to the US, where they are almost immediately indicted.\n\nShot in real time and told from a first-person perspective, Notes from Caracas shows the effects of global geopolitical events on everyday life. While US aircrafts bomb boats in the Caribbean and Venezuela is gripped by uncertainty, on New Year’s Eve the streets of Caracas are filled with music and dancing. At the same time, American corporations are already dividing up Venezuela’s wealth—the oil that the United States is now asserting control over.\n\nAs she moves through the city, the filmmaker encounters human rights activists, relatives of political prisoners, and survivors of torture. They report on the practice of enforced disappearances and tell of beatings and arbitrary arrests in a system designed to intimidate and silence those who dissent. In Anabel’s own family, conversations at home reflect a society marked by polarization, fear, and exhaustion.\n\nBlending personal experience, political power plays and global interests, Notes from Caracas is an intimate portrait of Venezuela at a turning point—told from an insider perspective.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #venezuela #caracas #usa \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.
