The discussion reveals that effects are composable operations that encapsulate side effects and defer execution, giving developers the right handles to manage unpredictability through compiler-checked types.\nThe authors explain how ZIO tracks three critical types: outputs, failures, and environmental requirements, enabling better testing with mock clocks and random number generators.\n\nThey share their intentional avoidance of intimidating functional programming terminology like \"monads\" proving you don't need mathematical foundations to understand effects. The conversation covers effect systems' expansion beyond Scala into TypeScript, Kotlin, and new languages like Unison and Roc, and how their collaborative writing process with strict constraints like 47-character line limits - created a coherent 100-page book readable in portrait mode on your phone.\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n03:33 From 250 pages to 100: The art of distillation\n09:38 What are effects, really?\n13:58 Managing unpredictability with the right tools\n18:37 Beyond Scala: The growing effect oriented ecosystem\n29:58 Forbidden words &amp; mathematical foundations\n33:08 Collaboration &amp; constraints\n36:08 Outro\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nBill Frasure, Bruce Eckel, James Ward • Effect Oriented Programming • https://amzn.to/4sO6wLV\nBruce Eckel &amp; Svetlana Isakova • Atomic Kotlin • https://amzn.to/4qT1gEQ\nBruce Eckel • Thinking in C++ • https://amzn.to/4qnrIGW\nAndrew Harmel-Law • Facilitating Software Architecture • https://amzn.eu/d/5kZKVfU\nSam Keen • Clean Architecture with Python • https://amzn.to/4pBT5g0\nEric Evans • Domain-Driven Design • https://amzn.to/3tnGhwm\nMaciej «MJ» Jedrzejewski • Master Software Architecture • https://leanpub.com/master-software-architecture\n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.instagram.com/goto_con\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#EffectOrientedProgramming #Scala #ZIO #Kotlin #Roclang #Unisonlang #TypeScript #SoftwareEngineering #FunctionalProgramming #Programming #TodayInTech #BillFrasure #BruceEckel #JamesWard #AndrewHarmelLaw #BookClub\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

      "content": "<article>Dive into the life of Michelangelo Buonarroti, the Renaissance genius whose “divine hands” transformed the history of art. This full-length biography documentary explores the man behind the Sistine Chapel ceiling, the David sculpture, and some of the most powerful religious art ever created.\n\nFrom his harsh upbringing in Florence to his rise as the most sought-after artist in Renaissance Italy, this Michelangelo documentary reveals the struggles, obsessions, and rivalries that shaped his masterpieces. Discover how he battled popes, princes and patrons, endured exhausting physical labour on the Sistine Chapel, and pushed sculpture and painting to new extremes.\n\nLearn the secrets of Michelangelo’s artistic techniques, his revolutionary understanding of human anatomy, and the deep faith and inner turmoil that drove his greatest works. We uncover the politics of the Vatican, the pressures of working for powerful popes, and the personal cost of his relentless pursuit of perfection.\n\nIf you’re interested in Renaissance history, art history, Catholic Church history, or in-depth biography documentaries, this Michelangelo film is for you.\n\nPlease subscribe here. https://www.youtube.com/@PeopleProfiles?sub_confirmation=1\nOur second channel. https://www.youtube.com/@PeopleProfilesExtra\nFollow us on Spotify. https://open.spotify.com/show/7fKALbrzEO9Q4VVvAwWHqL\nSupport us on Patreon https://patreon.com/thepeopleprofiles\nFollow us on Twitter. https://twitter.com/tpprofiles\n\nThanks for watching!

      "content": "<article>When the sun goes down, India's megacity most intense side comes to light. Queer subculture, everyday slum life and spiritual celebrity culture - Mumbai nightlife could hardly be more diverse. Anything is possible, here!\n\nMumbai: India's financial, commercial and entertainment center. This is the New York of South Asia, according to many of its inhabitants. Here, they say, anything is possible and hard work pays off. Like New York City, Mumbai is a melting pot of different cultures and lifestyles - and a city that never sleeps. Between red carpets and slums, this documentary shows a city full of contrasts.\n\nReporter Johannes Hano explores the night with a motorcycle gang. He experiences Bollywood glamour, celebrates an Indian wedding and immerses himself in the harsh life of the slums. He rides through the chaotic night-time streets in a three-wheeler with queer Muslim drag artist Zeesh, and talks to him on a red carpet. Zeesh speaks openly about his initially difficult relationship with his mother after coming out, diversity in India and his path to the cover of Indian Vogue. Rochelle Pinto from Vogue India describes the fashion industry’s take on what Zeesh embodies in his nightly stage shows: the shift towards more diversity and a different set of attitudes.\n  \nBut change is also a question of self-empowerment. Take Amruta Mane, for example: at the age of 21, she founded a motorcycle driving school for women called Women on Wheels. In doing so, she's creating spaces for independence - in a society where self-determination is often not a given.\n\nRadhe Maa has a somewhat different community. Her followers say she's a deity (godwoman) and she's as revered as she is controversial. She's omnipresent in Mumbai: posters bearing her image look down on the city streets.\n\nBut not all faces are so visible, especially at night when most people are asleep. In Dharavi, one of the largest slums in the world, reporter Johannes Hano meets a baker. And in Dhobi Ghat, the largest open-air laundry in the world, he visits a laundry worker at home - and looks on, as he goes about his tough job.\n \nMumbai - encounters with people whose courage, creativity and diversity are inspiring.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #india #mumbai \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Donate to FRONTLINE now: https://bit.ly/47DFzCb\n\nAnd support your local PBS station here: https://www.pbs.org/donate\n\nThe Emmy Award-winning documentary “The Luanda Leaks” — part of a worldwide investigation with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists that drew on a trove of more than 700,000 leaked documents — revealed how Isabel dos Santos made hundreds of millions of dollars thanks in part to her father’s longtime control of Angola’s government.\n\nDespite a history of favorable deals with the Angolan government, dos Santos said she made her fortune on her own merit — and that corruption charges that were levied against her were part of a politically motivated “witch hunt.”\n\nAs part of the ICIJ’s reporting, 120 journalists from 36 media organizations in 20 countries spent months examining and verifying dos Santos’ leaked financial and business records, and revealed a paper trail of how she benefited from her position — and how big-name American accounting and consulting firms helped make it possible.\n\nRead more about developments in the U.S. after the film aired: https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/luanda-leaks-isabel-dos-santos-barred-from-us/ \n“The Luanda Leaks” is a BBC Current Affairs production for WGBH/FRONTLINE and BBC.

      "content": "<article>Greenland should become part of the United States — at least, that’s the opinion of US President Donald Trump. Talk of the US acquiring, or perhaps even seizing, the world's largest island with its vast mineral wealth has been causing concern not only among Greenlanders.\n\nDenmark is outraged, as Greenland — a former colony — is still a semi-autonomous territory of the Danish Realm. But for how long? Many Greenlanders want to take control of their own future.\nNukannguaq Zeeb was born on the island and feels deeply connected to the island’s cultural traditions of hunting and fishing. He also coaches Greenland’s national soccer team, a sport introduced by Danish colonialists. He’s critical of Denmark’s ongoing influence. \"To be honest, we are currently under Danish rule and not an independent country,” he says. Trump's neocolonial ambitions came as a shock to him.\n\nGreenland did not gain any autonomy until 1953, when it became a Danish district. To this day, it remains closely associated with Denmark, both politically and economically. Many Greenlanders are pinning their hopes on the rich natural resources still hidden beneath the ice. As global warming accelerates, they could soon become accessible — drawing attention not only from the US administration.\n\nThe White Mountain mine lies north of the capital Nuuk and can only be reached by boat or helicopter. International investors are extracting anorthosite, a mineral used to produce insulation material and glass fiber, among other things.\n\nNiels Ole is one of the few Greenlandic foremen in the mine — many skilled workers here come from abroad. Greenland’s weak education system means that many young people drop out before graduating. Social worker Ane Pipaluk looks after them. They live in shared housing and often come from families struggling with unemployment and alcoholism.\n\nNegotiating a path between old and new dependencies poses a major challenge for Greenland. Niels Ole dreams of more autonomy for his homeland. He says, \"It's the dream of many Greenlanders.”\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #greenland #trump #denmark \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Use my link https://www.tailorstore.com/patrickboyle so you can take a look whenever it suits you.\n\nIn a highly unusual move - the Department of Justice has opened a criminal investigation into Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell. As America faces a high-stakes standoff over the future of the Federal Reserve, the traditional independence of the nation’s central bank is under direct attack. This video explores the intensifying war between the White House and Fed Chair, over a $2.5 billion headquarters renovation. We break down why many experts believe this probe is a mere pretext intended to bully the Fed into slashing interest rates to rock-bottom levels, potentially putting the long-term stability of the U.S. economy at risk for short-term political gains.\n\nWe also take a closer look at the \"agents of chaos\" Bill Pulte, Judge Jeanine Pirro and the \"shadow\" economic strategies currently in play, from the FHFA’s controversial bond-buying programs to the proposed 10% cap on credit card interest rates. From the strategic blockade in the Senate by Senator Thom Tillis to the \"Miran Limbo\" on the Fed’s Board of Governors, we unpack the technical and political maneuvers being used to bypass Jerome Powell. Is the U.S. headed toward a \"banana republic\" risk premium, or can its institutional guardrails hold firm? Join us as we examine the true price of a political Fed and what it means for the future of the dollar.\n\nPatrick's Books:\nStatistics For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3eerLA0\nDerivatives For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3cjsyPF\nCorporate Finance:  https://amzn.to/3fn3rvC \n\nWays To Support The Channel\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/PatrickBoyleOnFinance\nBuy Me a Coffee: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/patrickboyle\n\nVisit our website: https://www.onfinance.org\nFollow Patrick on Twitter Here: https://bsky.app/profile/pboyle.bsky.social\n\nBusiness Inquiries ➡️ sponsors@onfinance.org\n\nPatrick Boyle On Finance Podcast:\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/7uhrWlDvxzy9hLoW0EYf0b\nApple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/patrick-boyle-on-finance/id1547740313\nGoogle Podcasts: https://tinyurl.com/62862nve\n\nJoin this channel to support making this content:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCASM0cgfkJxQ1ICmRilfHLw/join</article>",

      "content": "<article>More and more city dwellers are collecting food in the asphalt jungle. They harvest herbs by the roadside and grow wild vegetables in cracks in the concrete. For these modern foragers and hunters, the food is free, tasty and more varied than in the supermarket.\n\nChristian Amys is an urban foraging professional. He forages for fresh food in his hometown of Brighton. For him, the English coastal city is an urban Garden of Eden. Christian finds wild vegetables and herbs in places where most people would never expect to find food. The 42-year-old only spends a few pounds a week on food from the supermarket: \"I want to be independent and don't like to rely on the supermarket. I like to forage on my doorstep because it's nice to know where my food comes from.\"\n\nChristian Amys worked as a top chef for 20 years before becoming an urban forager. Today, he shows others where to find wild fennel, hogweed, pineapple weed and dandelion heads and how to use them in food preparation. Christian now even supplies top restaurants and cocktail bars with his wild delicacies.\n\nAlexis Goertz also looks for her food on the roadside and in parks. The Canadian has lived in Berlin for over 10 years. She preserves what she collects using the centuries-old technique of fermentation. Whether it's evening primrose capers, wild garlic kimchi or goutweed sauerkraut - for Alexis, fermentation is about more than just preservation: \"Above all, fermentation makes food tastier and easier to digest. And I've just become addicted to it.\"\n\nAlexis regularly invites people to join her on urban herb walks and explains what’s edible - and what’s poisonous. The 33-year-old is all about rediscovering nature in the city: \"Berlin is fantastic for foraging for food. The diversity is immense. Not just among the people, but also in nature.\"\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #urbanforaging #food \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), nearly half of all American adults now live with diet-related chronic diseases.   \n\nMore than half the average diet in the U.S. now consists of ultra-processed food. But for some younger, lower-income communities, ultra-processed food can typically make up as much as 80% of their diet. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #mediterraneandiet \n______\n\nWe kindly ask viewers to read and stick to the DW netiquette policy on our channel: https://p.dw.com/p/MF1G</article>",

      "content": "<article>In the summer of 2014, fields and coal mines in eastern Ukraine became a crime scene. The wreckage of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was scattered across 12 square kilometers. Evidence of a war crime that remains unpunished to this day.\n\nOn July 17, 2014, the Malaysian Boeing 777 with flight number MH17 was en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, carrying 283 passengers and 15 crew members. The plane was shot down by a Russian BUK missile as it flew over eastern Ukraine, where war broke out in 2014. \n\nThis documentary reflects on the tragedy of MH17. The film consists of archive material, intercepted telephone conversations, open-source material, excerpts from television broadcasts, and staged fictional episodes. By combining different materials into a comprehensive collage, the film sheds light on the crash and examines the connections between propaganda, justice, punishment, and the far-reaching consequences of actions. \n\nWhile the film revolves around the story of MH17, it also approaches the subject on a very personal level — including a meeting with a Dutch relative of one of the victims on the plane. By making connections to what is happening in Ukraine today, the film sheds light on the global repercussions of this crime. \n\nThe film views the tragic events of July 17, 2014 from different perspectives and at different points in time, linking the crimes of the past with the present.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #flight #boeing777 \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

For Soviet naval planners, a nightmare scenario was unfolding. If war broke out, American submarines could find and destroy Soviet submarines before they had a chance to strike back.\n\nSimply catching up to American stealth wasn't an option. It wasn't a technology that could easily be copied, it was the result of decades of precision manufacturing, relentless quality control, advances in materials science, and industrial discipline that the Soviet system couldn't support at the time. It would take decades to catch up.\n\nFaced with a widening stealth technology gap, Soviet planners stopped trying to play hide and seek under the oceans, and instead chose raw power. They would bet everything on speed, depth, maneuverability and brute force.\n\nIn 1960, the Soviet Union launched their most ambitious submarine programs in history. Project 705 ‘Lira’, later designated as the ‘Alfa Class’ submarine by NATO, was a nuclear-powered attack submarine capable of outrunning torpedoes, executing extreme maneuvers, and diving deeper than anything the world had ever seen. Built with a revolutionary liquid-metal nuclear reactor, advanced automation, and a titanium hull, this machine represented a generational leap in engineering.\nIt wasn’t just a faster submarine, it was a radical attempt to rewrite the rules of underwater warfare.\n\nWhen Western intelligence realized what the Soviets were building, it caused immediate panic. A submarine that could outrun torpedoes and dive beyond existing weapons threatened to upend NATO’s entire anti-submarine strategy, forcing the West into a sudden scramble to catch up.\n\nBut Project 705, a super submarine meant to restore balance beneath the seas, would prove to be far more than the Soviets ever bargained for.\n\nThanks for watching!</article>",

      "content": "<article>In June 2024, Joanna lost her 20-year-old son Philipos. He was beaten up by another young man, following his sister's high school graduation party. Two days later, he died. The alleged perpetrator, a 19-year-old Syrian, was arrested.\n\nA summer evening that ended in disaster. After his sister's high school graduation party, 20-year-old Philipos was brutally attacked in the German town of Bad Oeynhausen.\n\nAs his mother Joanna was mourning her son, Philipos became headline news. Before long, his death was used to reignite the debate on Germany’s asylum policy. Both in the German parliament, and in the media. \n\nPhilipos' mother did not participate in this discussion. For her, the nationality of the perpetrator was irrelevant. \"The doctor who fought for my child's life is Syrian,\" she said. \"So is my hairdresser. And me? I'm Polish.”\n\nInstead, Joanna, who is deeply religious, tried to find a way to deal with her anger, rage, despair, and grief. She sought advice from a prison psychologist and a priest: Why did Philipos have to die? Am I allowed to be angry with the perpetrator? Do I have to forgive him?\n\nShe sat opposite the defendant at the Bielefeld Regional Court, endured the police reports and witness statements, listened to the autopsy results from the forensic pathologists, and witnessed the images of her dead child on the dissection table.\n\n\"Even hearing the incomprehensible, the painful, knowing how Philipos died... I owe that to my child,\" she said. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

They explore what SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) is and why it enables dramatic performance improvements for specific computational tasks, discuss when assembly language programming is justified versus using compiler intrinsics, and examine the challenges of writing vectorized algorithms. Dan shares insights from his career optimizing image analysis software and explains how understanding low-level architecture can improve code quality even when writing in higher-level languages.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nDaniel Kusswurm • Modern X86 Assembly Language Programming v3 • https://amzn.to/44hIVZf\nDaniel Kusswurm • Modern X86 Assembly Language Programming v2 • https://amzn.to/3LJlMIZ\nDaniel Kusswurm • Modern X86 Assembly Language Programming v1 • https://amzn.to/43DPANj\nDaniel Kusswurm • Modern Arm Assembly Language Programming • https://amzn.to/4rbyH6M\nDaniel Kusswurm • Practical C++ STL Programming • https://amzn.to/4ickAdq\nDaniel Kusswurm • Modern Parallel Programming with C++ and Assembly Language • https://amzn.to/4o5J3SF\n\n\nBluesky (https://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com) \nTwitter (https://twitter.com/GOTOcon) \nInstagram (https://www.instagram.com/goto_con) \nLinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-) \nFacebook (https://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences) \n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

But history is only half the story. The real question is why the United States cares so much about Greenland right now.\n\nAs climate change melts Arctic ice, Greenland is no longer just the world’s largest island—it’s a strategic goldmine. New shipping routes, untapped rare earth minerals, and massive energy potential are turning the Arctic into the next great power competition zone. The U.S., China, and Russia are all watching closely, but America’s interest in Greenland goes back decades, from Cold War military bases to recent, very public attempts to increase influence.\n\n0:00 Introduction \n1:23 Prehistory \n2:50 Viking Age\n7:50 Rediscovery\n9:21 Polar Exploration\n11:30 World War Two\n13:35 The Cold War\n19:14 Modern Era\n\nYou can now become a History Hit member right here on YouTube!

      "content": "<article>Filmed in secret, this documentary is a behind-the-scenes look at the \"Woman, Life, Freedom” uprising in Iran. The story begins a few weeks after the death of Jina Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish student who died on 16 September 2022.\n\nShe had allowed a few strands of hair to escape from her veil. Members of the Iranian morality police beat her so severely that she died of her injuries. The regime in Tehran has denied all responsibility for her death, which triggered nationwide mass protests under a slogan that echoed all around the world: \"Woman, Life, Freedom”.\n\nIranian filmmaker Shorresh Afkari filmed in secret, smuggling the footage out of the country to a colleague in France. His documentary gives a voice to people who, like large sections of the Iranian population, have run out of strength and patience.\n\nFor example, the film observes a young couple who dream of being able to express their love openly and in complete freedom. We also meet a taxi driver, who ends up in prison as a bitter opponent of the regime. His mother tries to protect him at all costs. A painter continues to practise her art despite censorship; a doctor secretly treats demonstrators. A young man is prepared to do anything for cash, even sell one of his kidneys. Just like men who dare to protest, women who show their hair in public and publicly oppose the regime still face harsh punishment, including the death penalty. For this reason, many interviewees speak off-camera to protect their anonymity.\n\nThe widespread protests and mass demonstrations that began shortly before the end of 2025 and continue to this day show that large parts of the population no longer support the regime in Tehran — a regime that continues to respond with brutality against the people of Iran.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #iran #protest #womanlifefreedom \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

A holy man stopped by and told them of a Magic Mountain, east of north and north of east, where they’d find their most meaningful treasures. But, he said, only a true hero could complete the journey. Malay Bera shares the Bengali tale of Kiranmala's quest.\n\nLesson by Malay Bera, directed by Héloïse Dorsan-Rachet.\n\nAlthough this folktale exists in multiple oral variants across the Bengali-speaking world, this video is based on a variant akin to the better-known literary version, “Kironmala\", from Thakurmar Jhuli (1907), an anthology of Bengali folktales collected by Dakshinaranjan Mitra Majumdar in the early 20th century.\n\nSupport Our Non-Profit Mission\n----------------------------------------------\nSupport us on Patreon: http://bit.ly/TEDEdPatreon\nCheck out our merch: http://bit.ly/TEDEDShop\n----------------------------------------------\n\nConnect With Us\n----------------------------------------------\nSign up for our newsletter: http://bit.ly/TEDEdNewsletter\nFollow us on Facebook: http://bit.ly/TEDEdFacebook\nFind us on Twitter: http://bit.ly/TEDEdTwitter\nPeep us on Instagram: http://bit.ly/TEDEdInstagram\n----------------------------------------------\n\nKeep Learning\n----------------------------------------------\nView full lesson: https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-princess-who-conquered-magic-mountain-malay-bera\nDig deeper with additional resources: \n\nAnimator's website: https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-princess-who-conquered-magic-mountain-malay-bera/digdeeper\n----------------------------------------------\n\nThank you so much to our patrons for your support!

      "content": "<article>Malcolm X remains one of the most powerful and controversial figures in American history. This full Malcolm X documentary explores his life, ideas and legacy, from his troubled early years and prison conversion to his rise as a leading voice in the civil rights movement and the emergence of Black Power.\n\nIn this in depth biographical documentary, we trace how Malcolm X transformed from an outspoken Nation of Islam minister into a global human rights activist who challenged America’s racial order. Featuring archival footage, expert historical analysis and detailed biography, the film examines his most important speeches, his break with the Nation of Islam, his pilgrimage to Mecca, and his evolving views on race, Black nationalism and unity.\n\nWe investigate how Malcolm X’s radical message helped shape the Black Power movement, influenced groups like the Black Panther Party, and forced America to confront its history of racism, segregation and violence. This Malcolm X biography places his story within the wider struggle for Black freedom and civil rights in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nIf you are interested in Black history, racial politics and the people who changed the world, this Malcolm X and Black Power documentary offers a comprehensive, historically grounded account of a revolutionary life.\n\nPlease subscribe here. https://www.youtube.com/@PeopleProfiles?sub_confirmation=1\nOur second channel. https://www.youtube.com/@PeopleProfilesExtra\nFollow us on Spotify. https://open.spotify.com/show/7fKALbrzEO9Q4VVvAwWHqL\nSupport us on Patreon https://patreon.com/thepeopleprofiles\nFollow us on Twitter. https://twitter.com/tpprofiles\n\nThanks for watching!

      "content": "<article>Carsten Breuer is Inspector General of the German Armed Forces, and thus the highest-ranking soldier in Germany. He says that Russia will be ready for a military conflict with the West in just a few years.\n\nThe documentary follows Carsten Breuer on camera for nine months. Filmmakers accompany him to a meeting with Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD), as well as on trips to southern Lebanon, Ukraine, and the USA. The result is a portrait of the German government's top military advisor that also provides deep insights into the German security apparatus.\n\nWhere the military meets politics, Carsten Breuer is redefining the role of Inspector General. Unlike his predecessors, he seeks out the public eye to get his messages across. In detailed newspaper interviews, on talk shows, in conversations with citizens, he drives his points home: The Bundeswehr and society must get ready for war.\n\nMeanwhile, the German Armed Forces are taking part in defense exercises in Lithuania designed to strengthen NATO’s eastern flank. A German brigade there is expected to grow to around 5,000 soldiers by 2027 - posted as a deterrent against Russia.\n\nAt the brigade headquarters in Vilnius, General Breuer receives a military briefing and inspects a military exercise from the hatch of an armored personnel carrier. Suddenly, the exercise is interrupted, and military radio communications are cut off. \n\nA Russian reconnaissance aircraft has apparently been spotted in the airspace above. Incidents like this have been increasing in recent months. Cyberattacks, sabotage of military facilities, destroyed undersea cables, and drone flights - according to Breuer, these are all Putin's tests to gauge defense capabilities and resilience. From Russia's perspective, war with the West has long been underway.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

      "content": "<article>The Matterhorn is one of the world’s most famous mountains — and amongst the deadliest. Since it was first ascended in 1865, over 600 climbers have lost their lives on the peak.\n\nDespite modern infrastructure and global awareness of the risks, tragedy strikes the Matterhorn again and again. This film asks why so many climbers misjudge the risks. Death on the Matterhorn follows mountain guide and head of rescue operations, Anjan Truffer, up to Solvay Bivouac — one of the mountain's high-altitude huts. It shows how Edith Lehner, warden of the nearby Hörnli Hut, lives with the losses. The crew also accompanies climber Meli Rüfenacht on her first ascent of the Matterhorn — one year after she herself witnessed a fatal fall.\n\nThis documentary takes a look beyond the physical risks that come with mountain climbing to explore the psychological toll. How do families cope with the sudden losses? How do rescue crews live with the constant exposure to death and trauma? And — with more climbers than ever attempting the ascent without proper preparation — what role is social media playing? Death on the Matterhorn examines both the pull and the perils of mountaineering — and comes with a clear warning: In the high alps, even the smallest mistake can end in death.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #matterhorn #climbing #mountains \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

What starts as a discussion about the EU AI Act quickly reveals a deeper truth: the real challenge isn't regulatory compliance - it's fundamental engineering practices.\n\nLarysa argues that quality AI systems require robust MLOps, comprehensive documentation, and proper data governance, whether regulation mandates it or not. Drawing from frameworks like CRISP-ML and the Machine Learning Canvas, the book provides practical checklists and methodologies for taking AI projects from prototype to production. Written partially in Ukraine during wartime, this \"battle-tested\" guide addresses the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders, offering a common language for building sustainable AI systems.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nLarysa Visengeriyeva • The AI Engineer's Guide to Surviving the EU AI Act • https://amzn.to/42SKOuU\nLakshmanan, Robinson &amp; Munn • Machine Learning Design Patterns • https://amzn.to/4ox4Eos\nPhil Winder • Reinforcement Learning • https://amzn.to/3t1S1VZ\nDiana Montalion • Learning Systems Thinking • https://amzn.to/3ZpycdJ\nBernd Rücker • Practical Process Automation • https://amzn.to/3cs3BSH\nLauren Maffeo • Designing Data Governance from the Ground Up • https://amzn.to/3QhIlnV\nKatharine Jarmul • Practical Data Privacy • https://amzn.to/46XPrns\nZhamak Dehghani • Data Mesh • https://amzn.to/3tTCwAC\nKate Stanley &amp; Mickael Maison • Kafka Connect • https://amzn.to/40Jq5Jz\n\n\nBluesky (https://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com) \nTwitter (https://twitter.com/GOTOcon) \nInstagram (https://www.instagram.com/goto_con) \nLinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-) \nFacebook (https://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences) \n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

How to exploit GenAI to make our 3000 engineers more productive without compromising quality, safety, or our values. Initially we created our own ChatGPT experience (LibertyGPT), rolled out GitHub CoPilot worldwide, and designed our own SDLC process. That was the easy part.\n\nRight now we’re tackling three interrelated opportunities:\n• The first is AI Engineering - how do we integrate GenAI into developer pipelines to ship better software faster?\n• The second is AI Architecture - how do we infuse AI based features into new applications to better serve our customers?\n• The final revolves around Agentic AI and the prospect of Digital Software Engineers - can this work and if so how?\n\nYour organisation is most likely walking a similar path. We will share with you what we have learned to date, in terms of technologies, architectures, practises and processes. There will be no artificial hype or gushing over vendors and their platforms. This will be a ‘from the trenches’ talk where we share hard won lessons. [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n02:16 GenAl adoption was a roller coaster\n04:22 1. Learning never stops\n07:43 2.

Housing costs are soaring. Transit systems are crumbling. And we’re struggling to update our infrastructure to prepare for the climate crisis. Even when there’s broad agreement that something needs to be done, collective action feels impossible. Why is that? Today’s guest is Marc Dunkelman, author of Why Nothing Works, a book about the modern American experience of watching government fail. He argues that by giving too many people the power to say “no,” we’ve stymied our collective progress.\n\nMarc and Sean discuss an inherent tension in American politics: the need for effective, centralized power and a deep fear of its abuse. They trace how that tension has played out across American history, from the clashes between Jefferson and Hamilton, through the New Deal’s Tennessee Valley Authority, to the backlash against figures like Robert Moses. Marc argues that our current system — born out of a reaction to too much top-down authority during the late 20th century — has produced paralysis, dysfunction, and a deep distrust of government.\n\nHost: Sean Illing (@SeanIlling)\nGuest: Guest: Marc Dunkelman (@MarcDunkelman), author of Why Nothing Works: Who Killed Progress — and How to Bring It Back.\n\nWe would love to hear from you.

That testimony concerned in part a multi-year project to renovate historic Federal Reserve office buildings. I have deep respect for the rule of law and for accountability in our democracy. No one—certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve—is above the law. But this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure. This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings. It is not about Congress's oversight role; the Fed through testimony and other public disclosures made every effort to keep Congress informed about the renovation project. Those are pretexts. The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President. This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions—or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation. I have served at the Federal Reserve under four administrations, Republicans and Democrats alike. In every case, I have carried out my duties without political fear or favor, focused solely on our mandate of price stability and maximum employment. Public service sometimes requires standing firm in the face of threats. I will continue to do the job the Senate confirmed me to do, with integrity and a commitment to serving the American people.\" \n\nnyt confirms the reporting: https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/11/us/politics/jerome-powell-fed-inquiry-trump.html\n\ntrump denies knowledge: https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-denies-involvement-doj-fed-subpoena-jerome-powell-rcna253526\n\nsupport: https://www.patreon.com/coffeezilla\n\ndisclaimer (updated May 2025): voidzilla is an opinion‑driven channel that comments on the news of the day under the satirical and rhetorically hyperbolic banner “CRIME IS LEGAL.” the phrase critiques what we see as a lax or uneven regulatory enforcement environment for fraud. unlike our affiliated channel Coffeezilla, which conducts detailed investigations and source‑document deep dives, and draws opinions from that, voidzilla offers rapid‑fire commentary and criticism on information already in the public domain. statements here reflect the host’s views at the moment of recording and may become outdated as facts evolve. references to “crime,” “fraud,” “scam,” or similar terms appear in a rhetorical hyperbolic context similar to “CRIME IS LEGAL.” unless we expressly state that a court has entered a final judgment, no segment should be read as a definitive finding of legal liability. viewers are urged to consult primary sources and form independent conclusions. production of this program is public‑interest commentary protected by the First Amendment and the Texas Citizens Participation Act (TCPA). \n\nanyone featured in this program who believes a material error has occured may contact our business email with supporting documentation under the SUBJECT: \"CORRECTION REQUEST\". we will promptly review substantiated notices and, where appropriate, issue corrections or updates.</article>",

Wells redefined science fiction. \"The War of the Worlds” was the first story about an invasion by aliens that simultaneously managed to raise questions about human progress, immortalize Martians, and inspire countless adaptations.\n\nH. G. Wells made his mark on the science fiction genre with \"The War of the Worlds.” In his novel, published in 1898, he described an alien invasion—a motif that has since become a fixture in science fiction literature. \n\nThis documentary traces how Wells used science fiction as a moral and political fable to criticize colonialism and modernity. Wells also warned of the dangers associated with industrial, scientific, and technological progress. \n\nThe book sparked a wave of adaptations and reinterpretations.

We explore why the plan to \"take the oil\" faces a minor mathematical hurdle: according to Rystad Energy, 60% of Venezuela's production projects require an oil price of $80 per barrel just to break even. This makes the administration's plan to lower gas prices by flooding the market with oil a bit like trying to save money on your commute by buying a fleet of private jets.\n\nWe also look at the high-profile residents currently moving into the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, why the \"ultimate sin\" in modern diplomacy is keeping your own Nobel Peace Prize, and why the Danish government is currently checking its lease agreement on Greenland after being told the U.S. is interested in a \"hard way\" to close the deal.\n\nPatrick's Books:\nStatistics For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3eerLA0\nDerivatives For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3cjsyPF\nCorporate Finance:  https://amzn.to/3fn3rvC \n\nWays To Support The Channel\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/PatrickBoyleOnFinance\nBuy Me a Coffee: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/patrickboyle\n\nVisit our website: https://www.onfinance.org\nFollow Patrick on Twitter Here: https://bsky.app/profile/pboyle.bsky.social\n\nBusiness Inquiries ➡️ sponsors@onfinance.org\n\nPatrick Boyle On Finance Podcast:\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/7uhrWlDvxzy9hLoW0EYf0b\nApple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/patrick-boyle-on-finance/id1547740313\nGoogle Podcasts: https://tinyurl.com/62862nve\n\nJoin this channel to support making this content:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCASM0cgfkJxQ1ICmRilfHLw/join</article>",

From the garage days with Steve Wozniak and the revolutionary launch of the Macintosh to his exile and triumphant return, we uncover the Apple history that shaped Silicon Valley.\n\nWhile Jobs is famously known for his inspiration and motivational speeches like the Stanford commencement, this documentary exposes the gritty reality. We investigate the controversial Steve Jobs facts—his ruthless management, the rude outbursts, and the exposed moments that painted him as a tyrant. Was his abrasive style necessary for entrepreneurship success, or a tragic flaw?\n\nJoin The People Profiles for a definitive look at the man who invented the future.

People fled to the United States. Today, President Trump exploits this situation, using it to boost his popularity.\n\nIn Venezuela, Hugo Chávez’s victory in the 1998 presidential election sent shockwaves through the country. His radical reforms met resistance from Venezuela’s economic elites, who subsequently organised a coup. But in a dramatic turn of events, Chávez returned to power just 48 hours later. After his return, he blamed the United States for the attempted coup.\n\nIn the 1990s, Colombia intensified its fight against drug trafficking with the help of the United States. The country was on the brink of collapse, as drug cartels and FARC guerrillas put increasing pressure on the government. With massive US support — and despite numerous human rights violations — President Álvaro Uribe implemented \"Plan Colombia”, which was intended primarily to crack down on drug traffickers. But the drug routes simply shifted: Honduras became a new hub for cocaine.\n\nBecause of ongoing human rights abuses, many Colombians left their country for the United States. Donald Trump exploited the resulting migration crisis, making it a central theme of his 2015 election campaign.\n\nMeanwhile, China stepped up its influence in Latin America. Panama’s President Juan Carlos Varela negotiated an agreement with Beijing without informing Washington, a long-standing ally.\n\nPart 1: https://youtu.be/UkZASVWnHmU\nPart 2: https://youtu.be/IJ3zOE9V18I\nPart 3: https://youtu.be/tweCup3tL04\nPlaylist: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLovlAKbQVz6CSYO4CxmIzQXrLkV8tY_6_&amp;si=KlqFh7QL3aHgEmFL\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #latinamerica #usa #venzuela \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

      "content": "<article>Nearly all of Latin America’s crises have been shaped by the United States. In the 1980s, the US supported anti-communist forces in Nicaragua and the controversial strongman Manuel Noriega in Panama.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Panama avoided a civil war, but a shadowy figure came to power: Manuel Noriega, a long-time CIA agent and protégé of the United States. His main opponent, guerrilla leader Hugo Spadafora, accused Noriega of drug trafficking. In 1988, the US Department of Justice in Florida brought charges against Noriega, including for his links to Pablo Escobar's Medellín cartel. Noriega refused to step down, which led to the US invasion of Panama and his arrest.\n\nIn Nicaragua, the Sandinistas introduced sweeping reforms after coming to power in 1979. Fearing the spread of a socialist revolution in Central America, the United States armed counter-revolutionary militias known as the Contras. A brutal guerrilla war followed.\n\nIn Chile, ruler Augusto Pinochet faced growing opposition. In a 1988 referendum, the United States supported the democratic opposition through its ambassador, Harry Barnes. Pinochet was subsequently forced to step down.\n\nBut another crisis was already unfolding: in 1989, the economic crisis in Venezuela, a traditional ally of the United States, reached its peak. Unrest broke out and was violently suppressed by the army.\n\nPart 1: https://youtu.be/UkZASVWnHmU\nPart 2: https://youtu.be/IJ3zOE9V18I\nPart 3: https://youtu.be/tweCup3tL04\nPlaylist: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLovlAKbQVz6CSYO4CxmIzQXrLkV8tY_6_&amp;si=KlqFh7QL3aHgEmFL\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #latinamerica #usa \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Whether it was Brazil's dictatorship, the coup in Chile or the Cuban Missile Crisis - at some level, American politics were involved.\n\nBrazil's first \"national security\" dictatorship was established in 1964 with the support of the United States. Washington, fearing an expansion of a perceived communist threat following the Cuban Revolution, rallied behind the coup leaders - making Brazil the first \"national security\" dictatorship in the region. Many opponents of the regime fled to Chile, where Augusto Pinochet seized power in a coup - also with the support of the United States.\n\nAlmost simultaneously, the secret services of Chile, Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia, Uruguay and Paraguay joined forces under the code name \"Operation Condor\" to track down and eliminate their opponents.\n\nBut in Nicaragua, a bloody civil war broke out and brought the leftist Sandinistas to power. This gave rise to a period of hope across the continent for greater independence from the United States. But Ronald Reagan's inauguration in 1981 marked a new era in relations with Latin America.\n\nCorrections:\n06:55 This happened in 1970, not a few months earlier. \n08:33 The correct date is 1971.\n\nPart 1: https://youtu.be/UkZASVWnHmU\nPart 2: https://youtu.be/IJ3zOE9V18I\nPart 3: https://youtu.be/tweCup3tL04\nPlaylist: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLovlAKbQVz6CSYO4CxmIzQXrLkV8tY_6_&amp;si=KlqFh7QL3aHgEmFL\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #latinamerica #usa \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

The conversation explores how Java programming has evolved from Java 5 to Java 25, covering major shifts like the move toward immutability, the introduction of sequenced collections, streams, and unmodifiable collections.\n\nThey delve into critical design topics including encapsulation of collections, the anemic domain model anti-pattern, the controversial unsupported operation exception, and the challenges of null handling. The book includes new chapters on usage guidance and design retrospectives that reflect decades of accumulated wisdom about the Collections Framework.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nMaurice Naftalin &amp; Philip Wadler • Java Generics and Collections 2nd ed • https://amzn.to/47dOp9t\nMaurice Naftalin &amp; Philip Wadler • Java Generics and Collections 1st ed • https://amzn.to/42JI03i\nJoshua Bloch • Effective Java • https://amzn.to/4oFbdoi\nVictor Grazi &amp; Jeanne Boyarsky • Real-World Java • https://amzn.to/4oCEeBR\nKevlin Henney &amp; Trisha Gee • 97 Things Every Java Programmer Should Know • https://amzn.to/3kiTwJJ\nChristian Clausen • Five Lines of Code • https://amzn.to/3s2zjyg\nNicolai Parlog • The Java Module System • https://amzn.to/3xFggR4\n\n\nBluesky (https://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com) \nTwitter (https://twitter.com/GOTOcon) \nInstagram (https://www.instagram.com/goto_con) \nLinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-) \nFacebook (https://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences) \n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

      "content": "<article>Vice President JD Vance said that the ICE agent responsible for Wednesday’s fatal shooting of a woman in Minnesota was doing his job as a federal officer and is protected by “absolute immunity.”\nVance, during a lengthy appearance in the White House briefing room on Thursday, defended the Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer and criticized the woman who was killed, Renee Nicole Good, calling her a “victim of left-wing ideology.”\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said the agent fired in self-defense after Good attempted to run over officers, but state and city officials have disputed that version of events after videos on social media raised questions about whether Good was attempting to flee the scene rather than harm anyone.\n\nSome officials in ICE’s headquarters were alarmed that the leadership in the Trump administration quickly labeled the incident an act of “domestic terrorism,” rather than waiting to conduct an investigation into the incident, according to people familiar with the matter. Officials internally passed around an interview with border czar Tom Homan on CBS News, in which he said he would reserve judgment while an investigation was under way, the people said.\n\n#Minneosta #JDVance #WSJ</article>",

Every catch is monitored and recorded. \n\nBut despite their efforts to keep fishing as selective and sustainable as possible, the Azores fishermen are struggling to make ends meet. Because of overfishing, the EU imposed fishing quotas that could run them out of business. \n\nLocal fishermen say they are frustrated because it’s not their fault the quotas have to be implemented. They say waters are depleted thanks to industrial fishing fleets casting out gigantic purse seine nets further out at sea, where they can easily evade monitoring.  \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #sustainablefishing #overfishing\n______\n\nWe kindly ask viewers to read and stick to the DW netiquette policy on our channel: https://p.dw.com/p/MF1G</article>",

Known to history as the Sun King, his 72-year rule stands as the longest reign in history and the ultimate symbol of Absolute Monarchy in Europe.\n\nThis biography explores how Louis transformed a humble hunting lodge into the magnificent Palace of Versailles, creating a gilded cage for the French nobility and establishing France as the dominant global power. From the chaos of the Frondes to the War of the Spanish Succession, we examine the military campaigns, court scandals, and political intrigues of the Bourbon Dynasty.\n\nWas he a divinely appointed leader or a tyrant who paved the way for revolution? Witness the rise of the man who declared \"L'État, c'est moi\" (I am the State) and became a titan of French history.

There were a lot of things that I wanted to do, that I did very little of. As a result, I learned, or was reminded of a few important lessons that have become my focus moving forward, and have also inspired some recent changes I've made to my photography approach and business, including moving into a new studio space. In this video, I'm going to talk about those three lessons in hopes that they maybe help you out with your work in one way or another.

Donate to FRONTLINE now: https://bit.ly/47DFzCb\n\nAnd support your local PBS station here: https://www.pbs.org/donate\n\nThis short documentary from FRONTLINE, Retro Report and ProPublica examined the horrors of what happened when U.S.-trained and equipped Salvadoran soldiers killed some 1,000 civilians, many of them children, in an attack more than 40 years ago. In the documentary, Raymond Bonner — who was one of the first journalists to bear witness to the aftermath of the massacre — recounted the experience of reporting the story and spoke with survivors of the attack.\n\nThis on-the-ground investigation detailed how, for decades following the tragedy, there was little movement towards holding anyone accountable, and how the case against high-ranking military officials faltered under Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele. \n\n“Massacre in El Salvador” laid bare the nation’s grisly past and the decades-long struggle for justice.\n\n“Massacre in El Salvador” is a FRONTLINE and Retro Report production with ProPublica.

      "content": "<article>Turkey's Sea of Marmara is on the brink of environmental collapse. Pollution, overfishing and climate change are depleting its oxygen. The crisis became visible when a thick layer of algal slime first began spreading across its waters in 2021.\n\nNecla Köseoğlu, from Rumelikavağı, is one of the last people still working in traditional small-scale fishing on Turkey's Sea of Marmara. She's also one of the few women in the business. She used to be able to live off what she made from fishing, but those days are gone. Fish stocks in the Turkish inland sea have declined dramatically. The ecosystem is at risk of collapse due to overfishing, urban and industrial waste, and shipping pollution. The Marmara Sea, whose shores are home to around 25 million people, is suffocating.\n\nThe crisis became widely known in 2021, when a kind of slime known as \"sea snot\" began to cover large parts of the sea's surface. The foul-smelling, gelatinous substance is an organic substance secreted by algae. It's not harmful to humans, but it starves other marine life of oxygen. Professor Hasan Örek is among the marine biologists and oceanographers sounding the alarm.\n\nIstanbul's city government has acknowledged the looming disaster. Environmental engineer Ayşen Erdinçler and her colleague Ilker Aslan say stricter controls and fines will curb pollution from shipping. But those measures are nothing more than a drop in the ocean. The greatest threat comes from millions of cubic meters of untreated domestic and industrial waste discharged into the sea each day. Local wastewater treatment plants urgently need modernization, but the Turkish government lacks the funds to carry it out.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #turkey #marmarasea \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Kathy Hochul recently announced a commitment to add a gigawatt of nuclear power to the New York state grid, partially to meet the electricity demands of the booming AI industry. And Oswego is vying to be chosen as a site for this new power plant. To find out more about why Oswego is so eager for nuclear — and what would happen next if it’s chosen — Vox video producer Nate Krieger traveled there to meet with the mayor and see the nuclear power plants up close. \n\nSubscribe to our channel and turn on notifications (🔔) so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Documenting a year in the life of two kindergartners, this film shows how formative early interpersonal experiences can be.\n\nHaakon and Balder, two Norwegian boys, discover the world together in kindergarten. Director Gunhild Westhagen Magnor accompanies the two two-year-olds for a whole year in her film \"Budding Humans.\" One of the children is her own son. \n\nThe two boys' growing up is observed with uncommented images and shows intimate moments of closeness and exclusion, arguments and trust. The caregivers teach the children important values such as empathy and conflict resolution—skills that will shape how they go through life as adults.\n\nThe starting point for the film was the question of how an innocent child could become a mass murderer. The Norwegian director became a mother while the trial of Utøya attacker Anders Breivik was underway.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #children #emotions \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Any young person, including young men and boys, can experience it, but current research suggests that PSH disproportionately affects women and girls. Harassment comes in many forms – from unwanted sexual comments or jokes to being followed or grabbed. \n\nThis has a big impact on women’s lives as it often restricts their freedom. Many avoid certain places, rush home before it gets dark, or even clutch their keys between their fingers as a makeshift weapon.   \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nWe kindly ask viewers to read and stick to the DW netiquette policy on our channel: https://p.dw.com/p/MF1G</article>",

We explore his critical interventions in the Spanish Civil War, his strategic navigation of the Cold War, and the exhausting Portuguese Colonial War that eventually led to the regime's collapse. \n\nHow did a reclusive academic hold onto power for over 40 years?

      "content": "<article>More donor organs are needed, but too few are available. Could the future of transplant medicine be found in the laboratory? Doctors and scientists around the world are researching ways to produce organs artificially.\n\nThe shortage of donor organs is one of the most pressing problems in medicine. Waiting lists are long, with some patients waiting many years for a life-saving transplant. For some, the donor organ comes too late. That’s why doctors and scientists around the world are working on alternatives. What if it was possible to simply order a new heart? \n\nMini kidneys from stem cells, liver cells in animal models, and the vision of an artificial heart are at the center of these exciting developments, known collectively as \"tissue engineering.” \n\nAt the Charité hospital in Berlin, efforts are being made to modify organs of animal origin so that they can be used as donor organs for humans. At the Riken Institute in Japan, scientists are working not only to modify organs, but to generate them entirely in the laboratory—tailor-made and in sufficient quantities.\n\nThe film follows leading research projects in Germany, Japan, and Sweden to consider central themes of modern medicine. Ethical questions are also addressed: What does it mean to produce artificial organs? And how close are we really to a revolution in transplant medicine?\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #transplants #artificialheart #medicine \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

This film takes a look behind the scenes -- at the tech company, and its CEO, Alex Karp.\n\nAlongside Elon Musk, Peter Thiel and Sam Altman, the CEO of Palantir is considered one of the most influential digital leaders. Like these better-known figures, US billionaire Alex Karp also stands to benefit from Donald Trump's election as President of the United States. After all, Palantir has close ties to US authorities and intelligence services.\n\nIn Germany, Karp is still relatively unknown. This, despite the fact that German police authorities also work with Palantir's \"Gotham\" software. This successful yet controversial data analysis program specializes in bundling and visualizing large amounts of data for the purpose of information gathering and surveillance. \n\n\"Gotham\" can create profiles of individuals worldwide, using digital data analysis. The software supports intelligence agencies, the military and police authorities in the fight against terrorism. However, its use is controversial: data protectionists in Germany fear that sensitive police data could find its way to the USA. In addition, co-founder Peter Thiel has caused a stir on several occasions in the past with anti-democratic statements.\n\nThe documentary provides exclusive insights into US entrepreneur Alex Karp and his mysterious and secretive company Palantir.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #surveillance #software #tech \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.
