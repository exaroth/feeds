Faced with what it views as transactional coercion, Brussels is readying an arsenal of economic countermeasures, ranging from a \"trade bazooka\" targeting U.S. tech firms to the highly publicized \"financial nuclear option\"—the threat of dumping trillions in U.S. Treasuries. But before we panic about a bond market collapse, we need to examine the hard financial realities: Is weaponizing sovereign debt a viable strategy, or is it merely a macroeconomic suicide pact?

      "content": "<article>The Neretva in Bosnia and Herzegovina is one of Europe's last wild rivers. Its unique ecosystem is threatened with destruction. Despite objections, politicians and entrepreneurs are allowing hydroelectric power plants to be built here. But resistance to the plans remains strong.\n\nOver the past millennia, the Neretva has developed into a globally unique ecosystem. It is home to animal and plant species that exist nowhere else. But the \"Blue Heart of Europe,” as the Neretva is also known, is threatened with collapse.\n\nPoliticians and entrepreneurs see new power plants as opportunities to generate sustainable energy — and rake in big money. Local residents and scientists, on the other hand, have serious doubts about the projects. This is because the construction of a dam changes the natural environment forever.\n\nBoban Škrtar lives a few kilometers above the planned main dam in the village of Ulog. On the riverbank, he explains the devastating impact of the construction project to date: \"Everything here used to be forest. It was cleared for the dam, and you can see that now everything is destroyed. There used to be a swimming area and a campsite there, but now everything is gone forever.\"\nOn the other side of the dam, Austrian aquatic ecologist Kurt Pinter is searching for the softmouth trout—a fish thought to live in just four river systems, including the Neretva. His hope is that if the softmouth trout is declared an endangered endemic species in this part of the river system, the construction of some 70 new power plants along the Neretva may be prevented.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #bosnia #neretva #bosniaandherzegovina \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

This is a film about the power of listening.\n\nWhen Dori Laub began recording the stories of other survivors in the late 1970s, he was preserving memory. But he was also pioneering a radical act of listening. He recognized the power of listening to life stories as a way of helping survivors cope with trauma. His work led to the creation of the world’s first video testimony archive and shaped a unique therapeutic approach centered on presence, empathy, and witness.  \n\nThe documentary follows the final four years of Laub’s life (2015-2018), interweaving powerful archival testimonies with intimate glimpses into his own story: a childhood in Romanian camps, a love affair with the daughter of a former Nazi officer, and the moment his own children hear his testimony for the first time.

      "content": "<article>Minnesota has become ground zero for the biggest federal immigration operation in US history. Thousands of immigration officers are patrolling the streets of Minneapolis, leading to the death of one anti-ICE protester, Renee Nicole Good, and setting off a massive swirl of protests. \n\nVice President JD Vance visited Minneapolis late this week — showing his support for law enforcement, and sending a political message at the same time: that this White House is doubling down on its war against blue cities, and Minneapolis specifically.\n\nNow, President Trump has subpoenaed the state’s top Democratic officials, alleging they were impeding federal immigration enforcement actions. The Justice Department has promised to arrest anyone who impedes the immigration enforcement actions, and a Trump official accused some state officials of “terrorism.” With Minnesota now in a full-blown conflict with the Trump administration, the Democratic state leadership is front and center in the standoff.\n\nIn this video episode of Vox’s Today, Explained podcast, host Astead Herndon interviews Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison about the Somali fraud scandal that first brought on the ICE surge in his state. Did Democratic officials do enough to staunch the fraud? What more could they have done to cut the fraud off at its knees? And now that ICE is in Minnesota, what more can they do? Are the courts the only recourse, if President Trump does as he has been threatening, and invokes the Insurrection Act? \n\n00:00 Intro \n01:21 The fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good \n03:26 The DOJ going after Democratic state officials\n07:38  Minneapolis protests against ICE\n10:17 Trump's threat to impose the Insurrection Act in Minneapolis\n12:30 \"Defund the Police\" and \"Abolish ICE\"\n16:41: Is Minneapolis a sanctuary city?\n19:19 The fallout of the Somali fraud scandal in Minnesota\n23:40 The fallout from the scandal on Democratic leadership\n24:29 Pushing back on the Trump administration\n\nToday, Explained is a daily news podcast from Vox that explains one story in the news or culture each day, while doing their best not to bum you out.

Barbara.\n\nFor well over 100 years, birthright citizenship has been enshrined in the Constitution,with the understanding that anyone born on US soil is granted citizenship. \n\nBut in Trump v. Barbara, the administration claims that the law applies to those who are not just born in the United States but also “owe allegiance” to it.\n\nThe plaintiffs represent a group of people affected by Trump’s executive order, and their argument is simple: Leave birthright citizenship alone. \n\nWatch the full second episode of The Docket exclusively on Vox's Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/posts/docket-trumps-on-148945751\n\nSubscribe to our channel and turn on notifications (🔔) so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Initial tests are promising. Is success a genuine possibility?\n\nOver half of humanity lives near the coast. But in many places, flooding is a constant threat, forcing entire populations to search for new habitats. Paradoxically, these could be located directly on the water. \n\nCities, floating on the ocean. It sounds like science fiction, but could soon become reality. International research has long been developing concepts for life on water. Now, new designs — from temporary huts to affordable student dormitories to smart high-tech villas — seem to hold promise. Could huge numbers of people soon be living in \"floating cities”?\n\nThis futuristic living concept could have some real perks. Artificial islands can adjust to changing water levels. Modular city ‘fleets’ can change location like ships. Flexible floating neighborhoods can expand or move closer together. Efficient water management systems could supply the city with food and energy. \n\nBut where floating cities drop anchor, questions arise: What laws do they fall under? What about environmental protection? How do they interact with the ecosystem? And how can they be protected from tsunamis? The search for answers has led to the creation of floating homes in Copenhagen and the Maldives; smart islands in the heart of Seoul; and the world's first underwater greenhouse. \n\nOne thing is certain: in the face of climate change, we need to rethink our urbanized way of life. Will we succeed in making \"floating cities” innovative, safe, and sustainable? Could we soon be experiencing a \"blue revolution”?\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

      "content": "<article>In 1099, during the First Crusade, a multinational force of about 12,000 Christian warriors—led by figures like Godfrey of Bouillon and Raymond of Toulouse—besieged Jerusalem, then controlled by the Fatimid Caliphate. The city's formidable walls, over 50 feet high and defended by 60,000 inhabitants, posed a massive challenge. Starved of resources after a grueling march, the Crusaders turned to innovative siege warfare: massive wooden siege towers.\n\nThese wheeled behemoths, up to 60 feet tall, were constructed from scavenged timber, including dismantled ships from Jaffa. Covered in animal hides soaked in vinegar to resist fire arrows and Greek fire, the towers shielded archers and allowed troops to approach the walls undetected. The Crusaders built three: one for Raymond's southern assault and two for Godfrey's northern push.\n\nOn July 13-14, after failed initial attacks, the towers rolled forward under cover of night. Godfrey's tower, repositioned stealthily, reached the northwest wall at dawn on July 15. From its top platform, knights like Lethold of Tournai leaped onto the battlements using a drawbridge, overwhelming defenders. This breach allowed Crusaders to pour in, leading to the city's fall after 40 days of siege. The victory resulted in a brutal massacre, claiming up to 70,000 lives, and established the Kingdom of Jerusalem.\n\nSiege towers exemplified medieval engineering, turning a desperate siege into a triumph. They overcame Jerusalem's defenses through mobility, protection, and height, symbolizing the Crusaders' determination and tactical ingenuity in their quest to reclaim the Holy City.\n\n#crusader #siegewarfare #epichistory #epichistorytv</article>",

The layers and reflections of those symmetries give us the wonderful richness of what we call the standard model of particle physics.

The discussion reveals that effects are composable operations that encapsulate side effects and defer execution, giving developers the right handles to manage unpredictability through compiler-checked types.\nThe authors explain how ZIO tracks three critical types: outputs, failures, and environmental requirements, enabling better testing with mock clocks and random number generators.\n\nThey share their intentional avoidance of intimidating functional programming terminology like \"monads\" proving you don't need mathematical foundations to understand effects. The conversation covers effect systems' expansion beyond Scala into TypeScript, Kotlin, and new languages like Unison and Roc, and how their collaborative writing process with strict constraints like 47-character line limits - created a coherent 100-page book readable in portrait mode on your phone.\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n03:33 From 250 pages to 100: The art of distillation\n09:38 What are effects, really?\n13:58 Managing unpredictability with the right tools\n18:37 Beyond Scala: The growing effect oriented ecosystem\n29:58 Forbidden words &amp; mathematical foundations\n33:08 Collaboration &amp; constraints\n36:08 Outro\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nBill Frasure, Bruce Eckel, James Ward • Effect Oriented Programming • https://amzn.to/4sO6wLV\nBruce Eckel &amp; Svetlana Isakova • Atomic Kotlin • https://amzn.to/4qT1gEQ\nBruce Eckel • Thinking in C++ • https://amzn.to/4qnrIGW\nAndrew Harmel-Law • Facilitating Software Architecture • https://amzn.eu/d/5kZKVfU\nSam Keen • Clean Architecture with Python • https://amzn.to/4pBT5g0\nEric Evans • Domain-Driven Design • https://amzn.to/3tnGhwm\nMaciej «MJ» Jedrzejewski • Master Software Architecture • https://leanpub.com/master-software-architecture\n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.instagram.com/goto_con\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#EffectOrientedProgramming #Scala #ZIO #Kotlin #Roclang #Unisonlang #TypeScript #SoftwareEngineering #FunctionalProgramming #Programming #TodayInTech #BillFrasure #BruceEckel #JamesWard #AndrewHarmelLaw #BookClub\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

This full-length biography documentary explores the man behind the Sistine Chapel ceiling, the David sculpture, and some of the most powerful religious art ever created.\n\nFrom his harsh upbringing in Florence to his rise as the most sought-after artist in Renaissance Italy, this Michelangelo documentary reveals the struggles, obsessions, and rivalries that shaped his masterpieces. Discover how he battled popes, princes and patrons, endured exhausting physical labour on the Sistine Chapel, and pushed sculpture and painting to new extremes.\n\nLearn the secrets of Michelangelo’s artistic techniques, his revolutionary understanding of human anatomy, and the deep faith and inner turmoil that drove his greatest works. We uncover the politics of the Vatican, the pressures of working for powerful popes, and the personal cost of his relentless pursuit of perfection.\n\nIf you’re interested in Renaissance history, art history, Catholic Church history, or in-depth biography documentaries, this Michelangelo film is for you.\n\nPlease subscribe here. https://www.youtube.com/@PeopleProfiles?sub_confirmation=1\nOur second channel. https://www.youtube.com/@PeopleProfilesExtra\nFollow us on Spotify. https://open.spotify.com/show/7fKALbrzEO9Q4VVvAwWHqL\nSupport us on Patreon https://patreon.com/thepeopleprofiles\nFollow us on Twitter. https://twitter.com/tpprofiles\n\nThanks for watching!

      "content": "<article>When the sun goes down, India's megacity most intense side comes to light. Queer subculture, everyday slum life and spiritual celebrity culture - Mumbai nightlife could hardly be more diverse. Anything is possible, here!\n\nMumbai: India's financial, commercial and entertainment center. This is the New York of South Asia, according to many of its inhabitants. Here, they say, anything is possible and hard work pays off. Like New York City, Mumbai is a melting pot of different cultures and lifestyles - and a city that never sleeps. Between red carpets and slums, this documentary shows a city full of contrasts.\n\nReporter Johannes Hano explores the night with a motorcycle gang. He experiences Bollywood glamour, celebrates an Indian wedding and immerses himself in the harsh life of the slums. He rides through the chaotic night-time streets in a three-wheeler with queer Muslim drag artist Zeesh, and talks to him on a red carpet. Zeesh speaks openly about his initially difficult relationship with his mother after coming out, diversity in India and his path to the cover of Indian Vogue. Rochelle Pinto from Vogue India describes the fashion industry’s take on what Zeesh embodies in his nightly stage shows: the shift towards more diversity and a different set of attitudes.\n  \nBut change is also a question of self-empowerment. Take Amruta Mane, for example: at the age of 21, she founded a motorcycle driving school for women called Women on Wheels. In doing so, she's creating spaces for independence - in a society where self-determination is often not a given.\n\nRadhe Maa has a somewhat different community. Her followers say she's a deity (godwoman) and she's as revered as she is controversial. She's omnipresent in Mumbai: posters bearing her image look down on the city streets.\n\nBut not all faces are so visible, especially at night when most people are asleep. In Dharavi, one of the largest slums in the world, reporter Johannes Hano meets a baker. And in Dhobi Ghat, the largest open-air laundry in the world, he visits a laundry worker at home - and looks on, as he goes about his tough job.\n \nMumbai - encounters with people whose courage, creativity and diversity are inspiring.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #india #mumbai \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

      "content": "<article>China's Democracy Wall movement, which unfolded in Beijing from late 1978 to early 1979, marked a brief but significant period of political openness and public dissent in post-Mao China. It centered around a brick wall near the Xidan intersection, where citizens posted \"big-character posters\" (dazibao) expressing grievances, ideas, and calls for reform. This wall became a symbol of grassroots activism, embodying themes of freedom and criticism amid the country's transition from the Cultural Revolution's chaos.\n\nThe movement emerged in the wake of Mao Zedong's death in 1976 and the subsequent arrest of the Gang of Four, creating a political vacuum. Deng Xiaoping, rising to power, initially tolerated the posters as they aligned with his efforts to rehabilitate victims of Mao-era purges and promote economic modernization. Posters criticized the excesses of the Cultural Revolution, demanded democratic reforms, and advocated for human rights, including freedom of speech and assembly. Wei Jingsheng's famous poster, \"The Fifth Modernization,\" argued that true progress required democracy alongside Deng's \"Four Modernizations\" (agriculture, industry, defense, and science-technology).\n\nFreedom was a core theme: activists sought liberation from authoritarian controls, inspired by Western ideas and China's own revolutionary history. Criticism targeted corruption, inequality, and the Communist Party's monopoly on power. However, this \"Beijing Spring\" was short-lived. By December 1979, as posters grew bolder—some even questioning Deng himself—the government cracked down. Wei was arrested, sentenced to 15 years in prison, and the wall was cleared. The movement highlighted the tension between reform and control in China, foreshadowing later events like the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests.\n\nThough suppressed, Democracy Wall demonstrated the power of public criticism in challenging authoritarianism. It inspired future dissidents and remains a poignant reminder of unfulfilled democratic aspirations in China.</article>",

      "content": "<article>Greenland should become part of the United States — at least, that’s the opinion of US President Donald Trump. Talk of the US acquiring, or perhaps even seizing, the world's largest island with its vast mineral wealth has been causing concern not only among Greenlanders.\n\nDenmark is outraged, as Greenland — a former colony — is still a semi-autonomous territory of the Danish Realm. But for how long? Many Greenlanders want to take control of their own future.\nNukannguaq Zeeb was born on the island and feels deeply connected to the island’s cultural traditions of hunting and fishing. He also coaches Greenland’s national soccer team, a sport introduced by Danish colonialists. He’s critical of Denmark’s ongoing influence. \"To be honest, we are currently under Danish rule and not an independent country,” he says. Trump's neocolonial ambitions came as a shock to him.\n\nGreenland did not gain any autonomy until 1953, when it became a Danish district. To this day, it remains closely associated with Denmark, both politically and economically. Many Greenlanders are pinning their hopes on the rich natural resources still hidden beneath the ice. As global warming accelerates, they could soon become accessible — drawing attention not only from the US administration.\n\nThe White Mountain mine lies north of the capital Nuuk and can only be reached by boat or helicopter. International investors are extracting anorthosite, a mineral used to produce insulation material and glass fiber, among other things.\n\nNiels Ole is one of the few Greenlandic foremen in the mine — many skilled workers here come from abroad. Greenland’s weak education system means that many young people drop out before graduating. Social worker Ane Pipaluk looks after them. They live in shared housing and often come from families struggling with unemployment and alcoholism.\n\nNegotiating a path between old and new dependencies poses a major challenge for Greenland. Niels Ole dreams of more autonomy for his homeland. He says, \"It's the dream of many Greenlanders.”\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #greenland #trump #denmark \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

The discussion covers why this modular approach saves years of development time while providing better performance and compatibility.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nKasun Indrasiri &amp; Danesh Kuruppu • gRPC: Up and Running • https://amzn.to/3sBGBJJ\nTomer Shiran, Jason Hughes &amp; Alex Merced • Apache Iceberg: The Definitive Guide • https://amzn.to/488Z30k\nWilliam Smith • Arrow Flight Protocols and Practices • https://amzn.to/4o2Q2fd\nMatthew Topol • In-Memory Analytics with Apache Arrow • https://amzn.to/4oJQ6BM\nApache Parquet A Complete Guide • https://amzn.to/4i7HVN6\n\n\nBluesky (https://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com) \nTwitter (https://twitter.com/GOTOcon) \nInstagram (https://www.instagram.com/goto_con) \nLinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-) \nFacebook (https://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences) \n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

As America faces a high-stakes standoff over the future of the Federal Reserve, the traditional independence of the nation’s central bank is under direct attack. This video explores the intensifying war between the White House and Fed Chair, over a $2.5 billion headquarters renovation. We break down why many experts believe this probe is a mere pretext intended to bully the Fed into slashing interest rates to rock-bottom levels, potentially putting the long-term stability of the U.S. economy at risk for short-term political gains.\n\nWe also take a closer look at the \"agents of chaos\" Bill Pulte, Judge Jeanine Pirro and the \"shadow\" economic strategies currently in play, from the FHFA’s controversial bond-buying programs to the proposed 10% cap on credit card interest rates. From the strategic blockade in the Senate by Senator Thom Tillis to the \"Miran Limbo\" on the Fed’s Board of Governors, we unpack the technical and political maneuvers being used to bypass Jerome Powell. Is the U.S. headed toward a \"banana republic\" risk premium, or can its institutional guardrails hold firm? Join us as we examine the true price of a political Fed and what it means for the future of the dollar.\n\nPatrick's Books:\nStatistics For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3eerLA0\nDerivatives For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3cjsyPF\nCorporate Finance:  https://amzn.to/3fn3rvC \n\nWays To Support The Channel\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/PatrickBoyleOnFinance\nBuy Me a Coffee: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/patrickboyle\n\nVisit our website: https://www.onfinance.org\nFollow Patrick on Twitter Here: https://bsky.app/profile/pboyle.bsky.social\n\nBusiness Inquiries ➡️ sponsors@onfinance.org\n\nPatrick Boyle On Finance Podcast:\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/7uhrWlDvxzy9hLoW0EYf0b\nApple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/patrick-boyle-on-finance/id1547740313\nGoogle Podcasts: https://tinyurl.com/62862nve\n\nJoin this channel to support making this content:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCASM0cgfkJxQ1ICmRilfHLw/join</article>",

      "content": "<article>More and more city dwellers are collecting food in the asphalt jungle. They harvest herbs by the roadside and grow wild vegetables in cracks in the concrete. For these modern foragers and hunters, the food is free, tasty and more varied than in the supermarket.\n\nChristian Amys is an urban foraging professional. He forages for fresh food in his hometown of Brighton. For him, the English coastal city is an urban Garden of Eden. Christian finds wild vegetables and herbs in places where most people would never expect to find food. The 42-year-old only spends a few pounds a week on food from the supermarket: \"I want to be independent and don't like to rely on the supermarket. I like to forage on my doorstep because it's nice to know where my food comes from.\"\n\nChristian Amys worked as a top chef for 20 years before becoming an urban forager. Today, he shows others where to find wild fennel, hogweed, pineapple weed and dandelion heads and how to use them in food preparation. Christian now even supplies top restaurants and cocktail bars with his wild delicacies.\n\nAlexis Goertz also looks for her food on the roadside and in parks. The Canadian has lived in Berlin for over 10 years. She preserves what she collects using the centuries-old technique of fermentation. Whether it's evening primrose capers, wild garlic kimchi or goutweed sauerkraut - for Alexis, fermentation is about more than just preservation: \"Above all, fermentation makes food tastier and easier to digest. And I've just become addicted to it.\"\n\nAlexis regularly invites people to join her on urban herb walks and explains what’s edible - and what’s poisonous. The 33-year-old is all about rediscovering nature in the city: \"Berlin is fantastic for foraging for food. The diversity is immense. Not just among the people, but also in nature.\"\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #urbanforaging #food \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

      "content": "<article>In 1989, China's Tiananmen Square became the epicenter of massive pro-democracy protests, marking a pivotal moment in modern Chinese history. Sparked by the death of Hu Yaobang, a former Communist Party leader seen as a reformer, on April 15, students from Beijing universities gathered to mourn and demand political change. What began as memorial vigils quickly escalated into widespread demonstrations calling for democracy, freedom of speech, an end to corruption, and economic reforms amid rising inflation and inequality.\n\nBy late April, tens of thousands occupied Tiananmen Square, the symbolic heart of Beijing. Protesters, including students, workers, intellectuals, and ordinary citizens, erected tents, staged hunger strikes, and created the iconic \"Goddess of Democracy\" statue, inspired by the Statue of Liberty. Support swelled nationwide, with up to a million people joining at its peak in May. The movement drew international attention, highlighting generational frustrations under Deng Xiaoping's regime, which had liberalized the economy but clamped down on political dissent.\n\nThe Chinese government, viewing the protests as a threat to Communist rule, declared martial law on May 20. After failed negotiations, the People's Liberation Army was deployed. On the night of June 3-4, troops advanced with tanks and gunfire, clearing the square in a violent crackdown. Official death tolls claim around 200-300 civilians, but independent estimates range from hundreds to over 2,600, with thousands injured or arrested. The \"Tank Man\" – an anonymous protester blocking a column of tanks – became a global symbol of defiance.\n\nPost-crackdown, the government imposed strict censorship, erasing the event from domestic history. Internationally, it led to sanctions and condemnation, straining China's relations. The protests inspired future movements but also entrenched authoritarian controls. Today, Tiananmen represents the clash between aspiration for freedom and state power, a reminder of the costs of dissent.</article>",

      "content": "<article>In the summer of 2014, fields and coal mines in eastern Ukraine became a crime scene. The wreckage of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was scattered across 12 square kilometers. Evidence of a war crime that remains unpunished to this day.\n\nOn July 17, 2014, the Malaysian Boeing 777 with flight number MH17 was en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, carrying 283 passengers and 15 crew members. The plane was shot down by a Russian BUK missile as it flew over eastern Ukraine, where war broke out in 2014. \n\nThis documentary reflects on the tragedy of MH17. The film consists of archive material, intercepted telephone conversations, open-source material, excerpts from television broadcasts, and staged fictional episodes. By combining different materials into a comprehensive collage, the film sheds light on the crash and examines the connections between propaganda, justice, punishment, and the far-reaching consequences of actions. \n\nWhile the film revolves around the story of MH17, it also approaches the subject on a very personal level — including a meeting with a Dutch relative of one of the victims on the plane. By making connections to what is happening in Ukraine today, the film sheds light on the global repercussions of this crime. \n\nThe film views the tragic events of July 17, 2014 from different perspectives and at different points in time, linking the crimes of the past with the present.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #flight #boeing777 \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

For Soviet naval planners, a nightmare scenario was unfolding. If war broke out, American submarines could find and destroy Soviet submarines before they had a chance to strike back.\n\nSimply catching up to American stealth wasn't an option. It wasn't a technology that could easily be copied, it was the result of decades of precision manufacturing, relentless quality control, advances in materials science, and industrial discipline that the Soviet system couldn't support at the time. It would take decades to catch up.\n\nFaced with a widening stealth technology gap, Soviet planners stopped trying to play hide and seek under the oceans, and instead chose raw power. They would bet everything on speed, depth, maneuverability and brute force.\n\nIn 1960, the Soviet Union launched their most ambitious submarine programs in history. Project 705 ‘Lira’, later designated as the ‘Alfa Class’ submarine by NATO, was a nuclear-powered attack submarine capable of outrunning torpedoes, executing extreme maneuvers, and diving deeper than anything the world had ever seen. Built with a revolutionary liquid-metal nuclear reactor, advanced automation, and a titanium hull, this machine represented a generational leap in engineering.\nIt wasn’t just a faster submarine, it was a radical attempt to rewrite the rules of underwater warfare.\n\nWhen Western intelligence realized what the Soviets were building, it caused immediate panic. A submarine that could outrun torpedoes and dive beyond existing weapons threatened to upend NATO’s entire anti-submarine strategy, forcing the West into a sudden scramble to catch up.\n\nBut Project 705, a super submarine meant to restore balance beneath the seas, would prove to be far more than the Soviets ever bargained for.\n\nThanks for watching!</article>",

      "content": "<article>In 1935, the Nazi regime in Germany enacted the Nuremberg Laws, a pivotal set of antisemitic legislation that formalized racial discrimination and laid the groundwork for the Holocaust. Announced on September 15 at the annual Nazi Party rally in Nuremberg, these laws were presented as protecting \"German blood and honor.\" They consisted of two main decrees: the Reich Citizenship Law and the Law for the Protection of German Blood and German Honor.\n\nThe Reich Citizenship Law redefined citizenship, distinguishing between \"Reich citizens\" (those of \"German or related blood\" with full political rights) and mere \"subjects\" of the state. Jews were classified as non-citizens, stripping them of voting rights, public office eligibility, and other civic protections. It used a pseudoscientific racial criterion: anyone with three or four Jewish grandparents was deemed fully Jewish, regardless of religious practice. Even those with fewer Jewish ancestors (\"Mischlinge\") faced restrictions.\n\nThe second law banned marriages and extramarital relations between Jews and \"Aryans,\" prohibiting Jews from employing German women under 45 in their homes and from displaying the German flag. These measures aimed to isolate Jews socially and economically, promoting the Nazi ideology of racial purity.\n\nThe Nuremberg Laws intensified existing boycotts and violence, such as the 1933 anti-Jewish campaigns. They were enforced through supplemental decrees, like mandatory yellow stars for identification. By 1938, they fueled events like Kristallnacht, escalating to mass deportations and genocide. Internationally, the laws drew condemnation but little intervention, emboldening Hitler.\n\nHistorians view them as a turning point from discrimination to systematic extermination, affecting over 400,000 German Jews and extending to occupied territories. Post-WWII Nuremberg Trials held Nazi leaders accountable, using these laws as evidence of crimes against humanity. Today, they serve as a stark reminder of how legal systems can enable hatred, underscoring the importance of human rights protections.</article>",

The alleged perpetrator, a 19-year-old Syrian, was arrested.\n\nA summer evening that ended in disaster. After his sister's high school graduation party, 20-year-old Philipos was brutally attacked in the German town of Bad Oeynhausen.\n\nAs his mother Joanna was mourning her son, Philipos became headline news. Before long, his death was used to reignite the debate on Germany’s asylum policy. Both in the German parliament, and in the media. \n\nPhilipos' mother did not participate in this discussion. For her, the nationality of the perpetrator was irrelevant. \"The doctor who fought for my child's life is Syrian,\" she said. \"So is my hairdresser. And me? I'm Polish.”\n\nInstead, Joanna, who is deeply religious, tried to find a way to deal with her anger, rage, despair, and grief. She sought advice from a prison psychologist and a priest: Why did Philipos have to die? Am I allowed to be angry with the perpetrator? Do I have to forgive him?\n\nShe sat opposite the defendant at the Bielefeld Regional Court, endured the police reports and witness statements, listened to the autopsy results from the forensic pathologists, and witnessed the images of her dead child on the dissection table.\n\n\"Even hearing the incomprehensible, the painful, knowing how Philipos died... I owe that to my child,\" she said. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

But history is only half the story. The real question is why the United States cares so much about Greenland right now.\n\nAs climate change melts Arctic ice, Greenland is no longer just the world’s largest island—it’s a strategic goldmine. New shipping routes, untapped rare earth minerals, and massive energy potential are turning the Arctic into the next great power competition zone. The U.S., China, and Russia are all watching closely, but America’s interest in Greenland goes back decades, from Cold War military bases to recent, very public attempts to increase influence.\n\n0:00 Introduction \n1:23 Prehistory \n2:50 Viking Age\n7:50 Rediscovery\n9:21 Polar Exploration\n11:30 World War Two\n13:35 The Cold War\n19:14 Modern Era\n\nYou can now become a History Hit member right here on YouTube!

      "content": "<article>Filmed in secret, this documentary is a behind-the-scenes look at the \"Woman, Life, Freedom” uprising in Iran. The story begins a few weeks after the death of Jina Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish student who died on 16 September 2022.\n\nShe had allowed a few strands of hair to escape from her veil. Members of the Iranian morality police beat her so severely that she died of her injuries. The regime in Tehran has denied all responsibility for her death, which triggered nationwide mass protests under a slogan that echoed all around the world: \"Woman, Life, Freedom”.\n\nIranian filmmaker Shorresh Afkari filmed in secret, smuggling the footage out of the country to a colleague in France. His documentary gives a voice to people who, like large sections of the Iranian population, have run out of strength and patience.\n\nFor example, the film observes a young couple who dream of being able to express their love openly and in complete freedom. We also meet a taxi driver, who ends up in prison as a bitter opponent of the regime. His mother tries to protect him at all costs. A painter continues to practise her art despite censorship; a doctor secretly treats demonstrators. A young man is prepared to do anything for cash, even sell one of his kidneys. Just like men who dare to protest, women who show their hair in public and publicly oppose the regime still face harsh punishment, including the death penalty. For this reason, many interviewees speak off-camera to protect their anonymity.\n\nThe widespread protests and mass demonstrations that began shortly before the end of 2025 and continue to this day show that large parts of the population no longer support the regime in Tehran — a regime that continues to respond with brutality against the people of Iran.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #iran #protest #womanlifefreedom \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

      "content": "<article>Malcolm X remains one of the most powerful and controversial figures in American history. This full Malcolm X documentary explores his life, ideas and legacy, from his troubled early years and prison conversion to his rise as a leading voice in the civil rights movement and the emergence of Black Power.\n\nIn this in depth biographical documentary, we trace how Malcolm X transformed from an outspoken Nation of Islam minister into a global human rights activist who challenged America’s racial order. Featuring archival footage, expert historical analysis and detailed biography, the film examines his most important speeches, his break with the Nation of Islam, his pilgrimage to Mecca, and his evolving views on race, Black nationalism and unity.\n\nWe investigate how Malcolm X’s radical message helped shape the Black Power movement, influenced groups like the Black Panther Party, and forced America to confront its history of racism, segregation and violence. This Malcolm X biography places his story within the wider struggle for Black freedom and civil rights in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nIf you are interested in Black history, racial politics and the people who changed the world, this Malcolm X and Black Power documentary offers a comprehensive, historically grounded account of a revolutionary life.\n\nPlease subscribe here. https://www.youtube.com/@PeopleProfiles?sub_confirmation=1\nOur second channel. https://www.youtube.com/@PeopleProfilesExtra\nFollow us on Spotify. https://open.spotify.com/show/7fKALbrzEO9Q4VVvAwWHqL\nSupport us on Patreon https://patreon.com/thepeopleprofiles\nFollow us on Twitter. https://twitter.com/tpprofiles\n\nThanks for watching!

      "content": "<article>Carsten Breuer is Inspector General of the German Armed Forces, and thus the highest-ranking soldier in Germany. He says that Russia will be ready for a military conflict with the West in just a few years.\n\nThe documentary follows Carsten Breuer on camera for nine months. Filmmakers accompany him to a meeting with Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD), as well as on trips to southern Lebanon, Ukraine, and the USA. The result is a portrait of the German government's top military advisor that also provides deep insights into the German security apparatus.\n\nWhere the military meets politics, Carsten Breuer is redefining the role of Inspector General. Unlike his predecessors, he seeks out the public eye to get his messages across. In detailed newspaper interviews, on talk shows, in conversations with citizens, he drives his points home: The Bundeswehr and society must get ready for war.\n\nMeanwhile, the German Armed Forces are taking part in defense exercises in Lithuania designed to strengthen NATO’s eastern flank. A German brigade there is expected to grow to around 5,000 soldiers by 2027 - posted as a deterrent against Russia.\n\nAt the brigade headquarters in Vilnius, General Breuer receives a military briefing and inspects a military exercise from the hatch of an armored personnel carrier. Suddenly, the exercise is interrupted, and military radio communications are cut off. \n\nA Russian reconnaissance aircraft has apparently been spotted in the airspace above. Incidents like this have been increasing in recent months. Cyberattacks, sabotage of military facilities, destroyed undersea cables, and drone flights - according to Breuer, these are all Putin's tests to gauge defense capabilities and resilience. From Russia's perspective, war with the West has long been underway.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

      "content": "<article>In 1932, Ukraine, then part of the Soviet Union, endured one of history's most devastating man-made famines, known as the Holodomor (from Ukrainian words meaning \"death by hunger\"). This tragedy, orchestrated under Joseph Stalin's regime, claimed an estimated 3.5 to 7 million lives, primarily in rural areas. It wasn't a natural disaster but a deliberate policy tied to Soviet collectivization and political repression.\n\nStalin's Five-Year Plan aimed to industrialize the USSR by forcing peasants into collective farms, seizing grain to fund urban growth and exports. Ukraine, the \"breadbasket of Europe,\" was hit hardest. In 1932, unrealistic grain quotas were imposed, even as crops failed due to poor weather and mismanagement. When peasants couldn't meet demands, Soviet authorities confiscated food, livestock, and seeds, leaving families to starve. Borders were sealed to prevent escape, and blacklists punished \"kulaks\" (wealthier farmers) accused of hoarding.\n\nSurvivors recounted harrowing scenes: emaciated bodies in streets, widespread cannibalism, and mass graves. The famine peaked in spring 1933, with daily deaths in the thousands. Stalin denied its existence, suppressing reports and even jailing journalists like Gareth Jones who exposed it. Many view the Holodomor as genocide, targeting Ukrainian nationalism amid broader purges.\n\nThe aftermath scarred Ukraine's demographics and culture, with lasting debates over intent. In 2006, Ukraine officially recognized it as genocide; Russia disputes this. Today, the Holodomor symbolizes resilience and a warning against authoritarian excess. Memorials worldwide honor victims, emphasizing \"never again.\"</article>",

      "content": "<article>The Matterhorn is one of the world’s most famous mountains — and amongst the deadliest. Since it was first ascended in 1865, over 600 climbers have lost their lives on the peak.\n\nDespite modern infrastructure and global awareness of the risks, tragedy strikes the Matterhorn again and again. This film asks why so many climbers misjudge the risks. Death on the Matterhorn follows mountain guide and head of rescue operations, Anjan Truffer, up to Solvay Bivouac — one of the mountain's high-altitude huts. It shows how Edith Lehner, warden of the nearby Hörnli Hut, lives with the losses. The crew also accompanies climber Meli Rüfenacht on her first ascent of the Matterhorn — one year after she herself witnessed a fatal fall.\n\nThis documentary takes a look beyond the physical risks that come with mountain climbing to explore the psychological toll. How do families cope with the sudden losses? How do rescue crews live with the constant exposure to death and trauma? And — with more climbers than ever attempting the ascent without proper preparation — what role is social media playing? Death on the Matterhorn examines both the pull and the perils of mountaineering — and comes with a clear warning: In the high alps, even the smallest mistake can end in death.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #matterhorn #climbing #mountains \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

What starts as a discussion about the EU AI Act quickly reveals a deeper truth: the real challenge isn't regulatory compliance - it's fundamental engineering practices.\n\nLarysa argues that quality AI systems require robust MLOps, comprehensive documentation, and proper data governance, whether regulation mandates it or not. Drawing from frameworks like CRISP-ML and the Machine Learning Canvas, the book provides practical checklists and methodologies for taking AI projects from prototype to production. Written partially in Ukraine during wartime, this \"battle-tested\" guide addresses the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders, offering a common language for building sustainable AI systems.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nLarysa Visengeriyeva • The AI Engineer's Guide to Surviving the EU AI Act • https://amzn.to/42SKOuU\nLakshmanan, Robinson &amp; Munn • Machine Learning Design Patterns • https://amzn.to/4ox4Eos\nPhil Winder • Reinforcement Learning • https://amzn.to/3t1S1VZ\nDiana Montalion • Learning Systems Thinking • https://amzn.to/3ZpycdJ\nBernd Rücker • Practical Process Automation • https://amzn.to/3cs3BSH\nLauren Maffeo • Designing Data Governance from the Ground Up • https://amzn.to/3QhIlnV\nKatharine Jarmul • Practical Data Privacy • https://amzn.to/46XPrns\nZhamak Dehghani • Data Mesh • https://amzn.to/3tTCwAC\nKate Stanley &amp; Mickael Maison • Kafka Connect • https://amzn.to/40Jq5Jz\n\n\nBluesky (https://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com) \nTwitter (https://twitter.com/GOTOcon) \nInstagram (https://www.instagram.com/goto_con) \nLinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-) \nFacebook (https://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences) \n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

      "content": "<article>The Night of the Long Knives, occurring from June 30 to July 2, 1934, was a brutal political purge orchestrated by Adolf Hitler to consolidate his absolute power in Nazi Germany. Officially dubbed \"Operation Hummingbird,\" it targeted perceived threats within the Nazi Party, particularly the Sturmabteilung (SA), the paramilitary wing that had helped Hitler rise to power but had grown unruly under leader Ernst Röhm.\n\nBy 1934, Hitler faced internal rivalries. Röhm, a close ally turned potential rival, advocated for a \"second revolution\" that would integrate the SA into the regular army, challenging the conservative German military elite and Hitler's alliances with industrialists. Hitler, fearing a coup and pressured by the Reichswehr (army), decided to act decisively. With the SS (Schutzstaffel) led by Heinrich Himmler and Hermann Göring, Hitler launched a surprise assault.\n\nOver the weekend, SS death squads arrested and executed key figures without trial. Röhm was captured in Munich and later shot in prison after refusing suicide. Victims included SA leaders, former Chancellor Kurt von Schleicher, and even critics like Gregor Strasser. Official reports claimed around 85 deaths, but estimates suggest 150–200 or more. Hitler justified the purge in a Reichstag speech, framing it as self-defense against treason, which retroactively legalized the murders.\n\nThis event marked a turning point: it eliminated the SA's influence, elevated the SS as Hitler's elite force, and solidified his dictatorship. It demonstrated the regime's willingness to use terror, foreshadowing the Holocaust and World War II atrocities. The purge silenced opposition and ensured loyalty through fear, paving the way for unchecked Nazi totalitarianism.</article>",

Initially we created our own ChatGPT experience (LibertyGPT), rolled out GitHub CoPilot worldwide, and designed our own SDLC process. That was the easy part.\n\nRight now we’re tackling three interrelated opportunities:\n• The first is AI Engineering - how do we integrate GenAI into developer pipelines to ship better software faster?\n• The second is AI Architecture - how do we infuse AI based features into new applications to better serve our customers?\n• The final revolves around Agentic AI and the prospect of Digital Software Engineers - can this work and if so how?\n\nYour organisation is most likely walking a similar path. We will share with you what we have learned to date, in terms of technologies, architectures, practises and processes. There will be no artificial hype or gushing over vendors and their platforms. This will be a ‘from the trenches’ talk where we share hard won lessons. [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n02:16 GenAl adoption was a roller coaster\n04:22 1. Learning never stops\n07:43 2.

Housing costs are soaring. Transit systems are crumbling. And we’re struggling to update our infrastructure to prepare for the climate crisis. Even when there’s broad agreement that something needs to be done, collective action feels impossible. Why is that? Today’s guest is Marc Dunkelman, author of Why Nothing Works, a book about the modern American experience of watching government fail. He argues that by giving too many people the power to say “no,” we’ve stymied our collective progress.\n\nMarc and Sean discuss an inherent tension in American politics: the need for effective, centralized power and a deep fear of its abuse. They trace how that tension has played out across American history, from the clashes between Jefferson and Hamilton, through the New Deal’s Tennessee Valley Authority, to the backlash against figures like Robert Moses. Marc argues that our current system — born out of a reaction to too much top-down authority during the late 20th century — has produced paralysis, dysfunction, and a deep distrust of government.\n\nHost: Sean Illing (@SeanIlling)\nGuest: Guest: Marc Dunkelman (@MarcDunkelman), author of Why Nothing Works: Who Killed Progress — and How to Bring It Back.\n\nWe would love to hear from you.

      "content": "<article>Jerome Powell's Statement: \"On Friday, the Department of Justice served the Federal Reserve with grand jury subpoenas, threatening a criminal indictment related to my testimony before the Senate Banking Committee last June. That testimony concerned in part a multi-year project to renovate historic Federal Reserve office buildings. I have deep respect for the rule of law and for accountability in our democracy. No one—certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve—is above the law. But this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure. This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings. It is not about Congress's oversight role; the Fed through testimony and other public disclosures made every effort to keep Congress informed about the renovation project. Those are pretexts. The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President. This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions—or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation. I have served at the Federal Reserve under four administrations, Republicans and Democrats alike. In every case, I have carried out my duties without political fear or favor, focused solely on our mandate of price stability and maximum employment. Public service sometimes requires standing firm in the face of threats. I will continue to do the job the Senate confirmed me to do, with integrity and a commitment to serving the American people.\" \n\nnyt confirms the reporting: https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/11/us/politics/jerome-powell-fed-inquiry-trump.html\n\ntrump denies knowledge: https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-denies-involvement-doj-fed-subpoena-jerome-powell-rcna253526\n\nsupport: https://www.patreon.com/coffeezilla\n\ndisclaimer (updated May 2025): voidzilla is an opinion‑driven channel that comments on the news of the day under the satirical and rhetorically hyperbolic banner “CRIME IS LEGAL.” the phrase critiques what we see as a lax or uneven regulatory enforcement environment for fraud. unlike our affiliated channel Coffeezilla, which conducts detailed investigations and source‑document deep dives, and draws opinions from that, voidzilla offers rapid‑fire commentary and criticism on information already in the public domain. statements here reflect the host’s views at the moment of recording and may become outdated as facts evolve. references to “crime,” “fraud,” “scam,” or similar terms appear in a rhetorical hyperbolic context similar to “CRIME IS LEGAL.” unless we expressly state that a court has entered a final judgment, no segment should be read as a definitive finding of legal liability. viewers are urged to consult primary sources and form independent conclusions. production of this program is public‑interest commentary protected by the First Amendment and the Texas Citizens Participation Act (TCPA). \n\nanyone featured in this program who believes a material error has occured may contact our business email with supporting documentation under the SUBJECT: \"CORRECTION REQUEST\". we will promptly review substantiated notices and, where appropriate, issue corrections or updates.</article>",

Wells redefined science fiction. \"The War of the Worlds” was the first story about an invasion by aliens that simultaneously managed to raise questions about human progress, immortalize Martians, and inspire countless adaptations.\n\nH. G. Wells made his mark on the science fiction genre with \"The War of the Worlds.” In his novel, published in 1898, he described an alien invasion—a motif that has since become a fixture in science fiction literature. \n\nThis documentary traces how Wells used science fiction as a moral and political fable to criticize colonialism and modernity. Wells also warned of the dangers associated with industrial, scientific, and technological progress. \n\nThe book sparked a wave of adaptations and reinterpretations. From literature to feature films, the DNA of the story continues to shape pop culture today.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

You’ll also get 20% off an annual premium subscription.\n\nLast week, the White House decided to pivot from \"America First\" to \"America Everywhere.\" It began on Saturday morning with a 150-aircraft military strike to serve what Secretary of State Marco Rubio described as a \"routine law enforcement warrant\"—proving once and for all that if you have a large enough aircraft carrier, every parking ticket is technically a tactical operation.\n\nIn this video, we look at the internal contradictions of the new \"Donroe Doctrine,\" a policy that treats international borders as suggested boundaries and sovereign nations as distressed assets. We explore why the plan to \"take the oil\" faces a minor mathematical hurdle: according to Rystad Energy, 60% of Venezuela's production projects require an oil price of $80 per barrel just to break even. This makes the administration's plan to lower gas prices by flooding the market with oil a bit like trying to save money on your commute by buying a fleet of private jets.\n\nWe also look at the high-profile residents currently moving into the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, why the \"ultimate sin\" in modern diplomacy is keeping your own Nobel Peace Prize, and why the Danish government is currently checking its lease agreement on Greenland after being told the U.S. is interested in a \"hard way\" to close the deal.\n\nPatrick's Books:\nStatistics For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3eerLA0\nDerivatives For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3cjsyPF\nCorporate Finance:  https://amzn.to/3fn3rvC \n\nWays To Support The Channel\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/PatrickBoyleOnFinance\nBuy Me a Coffee: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/patrickboyle\n\nVisit our website: https://www.onfinance.org\nFollow Patrick on Twitter Here: https://bsky.app/profile/pboyle.bsky.social\n\nBusiness Inquiries ➡️ sponsors@onfinance.org\n\nPatrick Boyle On Finance Podcast:\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/7uhrWlDvxzy9hLoW0EYf0b\nApple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/patrick-boyle-on-finance/id1547740313\nGoogle Podcasts: https://tinyurl.com/62862nve\n\nJoin this channel to support making this content:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCASM0cgfkJxQ1ICmRilfHLw/join</article>",

Remembered domestically as the “Builder King,” Leopold engineered a brutal colonial system built on forced labor, rubber extraction, corporate partnerships, and propaganda, resulting in the deaths of millions of Congolese people, and what early human rights advocates would later call crimes against humanity. \n\n* Watch Extra History ad-free &amp; get 1-week early access on *NEBULA* https://go.nebula.tv/extrahistory \n* Suggest &amp; Vote on our next episodes, get exclusive content &amp; 24-hour early access on *PATREON* https://bit.ly/EHPatreon   \n* Show off your fandom with *MERCH* from our store! http://extracredits.store/  \n* Interested in sponsoring an episode?* Email us: extracredits@standard.tv \n\nhttps://twitter.com/extracreditz | https://www.facebook.com/ExtraCredits/ | http://instagram.com/extracredits | https://www.tiktok.com/@extracreditz\nGAMING: https://www.youtube.com/@extracredits | http://www.twitch.tv/extracredits/\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/extracredits.bsky.social \n\n*Miss an episode in our Series?*\nPart 1 - https://youtu.be/99dygZ98Krg\nPart 2 - Release Date: January 24th, Herod the Great - Available on Nebula NOW!\nPart 3 - Release Date: February 7th, Emperor Qin Shi Huang\nPart 4 - Release Date: February 21st, Richard III \nSeries Wrap-up &amp; Recommended Reading / Lies Episode - Release Date: February 26th\n\nThanks for the high-quality conversations &amp; for following our community guidelines here: https://bit.ly/ECFansRNice\n\nArtist: David Hueso | Writer: Robert Rath | Researcher: A.

      "content": "<article>To this day, the USA has a hand in almost all the crises affecting Latin America. Colombia, for example, sank into chaos in the 1990s. The cartels took over the country. People fled to the United States. Today, President Trump exploits this situation, using it to boost his popularity.\n\nIn Venezuela, Hugo Chávez’s victory in the 1998 presidential election sent shockwaves through the country. His radical reforms met resistance from Venezuela’s economic elites, who subsequently organised a coup. But in a dramatic turn of events, Chávez returned to power just 48 hours later. After his return, he blamed the United States for the attempted coup.\n\nIn the 1990s, Colombia intensified its fight against drug trafficking with the help of the United States. The country was on the brink of collapse, as drug cartels and FARC guerrillas put increasing pressure on the government. With massive US support — and despite numerous human rights violations — President Álvaro Uribe implemented \"Plan Colombia”, which was intended primarily to crack down on drug traffickers. But the drug routes simply shifted: Honduras became a new hub for cocaine.\n\nBecause of ongoing human rights abuses, many Colombians left their country for the United States. Donald Trump exploited the resulting migration crisis, making it a central theme of his 2015 election campaign.\n\nMeanwhile, China stepped up its influence in Latin America. Panama’s President Juan Carlos Varela negotiated an agreement with Beijing without informing Washington, a long-standing ally.\n\nPart 1: https://youtu.be/UkZASVWnHmU\nPart 2: https://youtu.be/IJ3zOE9V18I\nPart 3: https://youtu.be/tweCup3tL04\nPlaylist: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLovlAKbQVz6CSYO4CxmIzQXrLkV8tY_6_&amp;si=KlqFh7QL3aHgEmFL\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #latinamerica #usa #venzuela \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

      "content": "<article>Nearly all of Latin America’s crises have been shaped by the United States. In the 1980s, the US supported anti-communist forces in Nicaragua and the controversial strongman Manuel Noriega in Panama.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Panama avoided a civil war, but a shadowy figure came to power: Manuel Noriega, a long-time CIA agent and protégé of the United States. His main opponent, guerrilla leader Hugo Spadafora, accused Noriega of drug trafficking. In 1988, the US Department of Justice in Florida brought charges against Noriega, including for his links to Pablo Escobar's Medellín cartel. Noriega refused to step down, which led to the US invasion of Panama and his arrest.\n\nIn Nicaragua, the Sandinistas introduced sweeping reforms after coming to power in 1979. Fearing the spread of a socialist revolution in Central America, the United States armed counter-revolutionary militias known as the Contras. A brutal guerrilla war followed.\n\nIn Chile, ruler Augusto Pinochet faced growing opposition. In a 1988 referendum, the United States supported the democratic opposition through its ambassador, Harry Barnes. Pinochet was subsequently forced to step down.\n\nBut another crisis was already unfolding: in 1989, the economic crisis in Venezuela, a traditional ally of the United States, reached its peak. Unrest broke out and was violently suppressed by the army.\n\nPart 1: https://youtu.be/UkZASVWnHmU\nPart 2: https://youtu.be/IJ3zOE9V18I\nPart 3: https://youtu.be/tweCup3tL04\nPlaylist: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLovlAKbQVz6CSYO4CxmIzQXrLkV8tY_6_&amp;si=KlqFh7QL3aHgEmFL\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #latinamerica #usa \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Whether it was Brazil's dictatorship, the coup in Chile or the Cuban Missile Crisis - at some level, American politics were involved.\n\nBrazil's first \"national security\" dictatorship was established in 1964 with the support of the United States. Washington, fearing an expansion of a perceived communist threat following the Cuban Revolution, rallied behind the coup leaders - making Brazil the first \"national security\" dictatorship in the region. Many opponents of the regime fled to Chile, where Augusto Pinochet seized power in a coup - also with the support of the United States.\n\nAlmost simultaneously, the secret services of Chile, Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia, Uruguay and Paraguay joined forces under the code name \"Operation Condor\" to track down and eliminate their opponents.\n\nBut in Nicaragua, a bloody civil war broke out and brought the leftist Sandinistas to power. This gave rise to a period of hope across the continent for greater independence from the United States. But Ronald Reagan's inauguration in 1981 marked a new era in relations with Latin America.\n\nCorrections:\n06:55 This happened in 1970, not a few months earlier. \n08:33 The correct date is 1971.\n\nPart 1: https://youtu.be/UkZASVWnHmU\nPart 2: https://youtu.be/IJ3zOE9V18I\nPart 3: https://youtu.be/tweCup3tL04\nPlaylist: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLovlAKbQVz6CSYO4CxmIzQXrLkV8tY_6_&amp;si=KlqFh7QL3aHgEmFL\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #latinamerica #usa \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

      "content": "<article>The British Invasion of New York in 1776 was a critical campaign during the early stages of the American Revolutionary War. Following the colonists' Declaration of Independence in July, the British aimed to crush the rebellion by seizing New York City, a strategic port and economic hub. Under General William Howe, a massive British force—over 32,000 troops, supported by the Royal Navy's fleet—arrived in New York Harbor in late June. This armada, one of the largest ever assembled at the time, dwarfed the Continental Army led by General George Washington, which numbered around 19,000 mostly inexperienced soldiers.\n\nThe invasion began with the Battle of Long Island on August 27, 1776. British forces outflanked Washington's defenses at Brooklyn Heights, inflicting heavy casualties—over 1,000 American dead or wounded compared to just 400 British losses. Washington narrowly escaped total defeat by orchestrating a daring nighttime evacuation across the East River, saving his army under the cover of fog. The British then pursued, capturing Manhattan in the Battle of Kip's Bay on September 15 and the Battle of Harlem Heights the next day, though the latter was a minor American victory that boosted morale.\n\nBy November, Howe had taken Fort Washington and Fort Lee, forcing Washington to retreat across New Jersey. The British occupation of New York lasted until the war's end in 1783, serving as their main base. This campaign exposed the Continental Army's vulnerabilities but also highlighted Washington's resilience, setting the stage for future guerrilla tactics and alliances, like with France. Ultimately, while a British triumph, it failed to end the revolution, as American forces regrouped and fought on.</article>",

The conversation explores how Java programming has evolved from Java 5 to Java 25, covering major shifts like the move toward immutability, the introduction of sequenced collections, streams, and unmodifiable collections.\n\nThey delve into critical design topics including encapsulation of collections, the anemic domain model anti-pattern, the controversial unsupported operation exception, and the challenges of null handling. The book includes new chapters on usage guidance and design retrospectives that reflect decades of accumulated wisdom about the Collections Framework.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nMaurice Naftalin &amp; Philip Wadler • Java Generics and Collections 2nd ed • https://amzn.to/47dOp9t\nMaurice Naftalin &amp; Philip Wadler • Java Generics and Collections 1st ed • https://amzn.to/42JI03i\nJoshua Bloch • Effective Java • https://amzn.to/4oFbdoi\nVictor Grazi &amp; Jeanne Boyarsky • Real-World Java • https://amzn.to/4oCEeBR\nKevlin Henney &amp; Trisha Gee • 97 Things Every Java Programmer Should Know • https://amzn.to/3kiTwJJ\nChristian Clausen • Five Lines of Code • https://amzn.to/3s2zjyg\nNicolai Parlog • The Java Module System • https://amzn.to/3xFggR4\n\n\nBluesky (https://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com) \nTwitter (https://twitter.com/GOTOcon) \nInstagram (https://www.instagram.com/goto_con) \nLinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-) \nFacebook (https://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences) \n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

Officials internally passed around an interview with border czar Tom Homan on CBS News, in which he said he would reserve judgment while an investigation was under way, the people said.\n\n#Minneosta #JDVance #WSJ</article>",

      "content": "<article>In 1775, amid escalating tensions in the American colonies, King George III of Britain orchestrated a comprehensive strategy to quash colonial unrest and reassert royal authority—what can be described as his \"massive plan\" against America. This plan was not a single document but a multifaceted response to events like the Boston Tea Party (1773) and the First Continental Congress (1774), culminating in the outbreak of war.\n\nThe year began with the Battles of Lexington and Concord in April 1775, where British troops attempted to seize colonial arms, igniting armed conflict. King George, viewing the colonies as traitorous, rejected olive branches like the Olive Branch Petition from the Second Continental Congress in July. Instead, on August 23, 1775, he issued the Proclamation of Rebellion, officially declaring the American colonies in open rebellion against the Crown. This decree urged loyal subjects to suppress the uprising and authorized military force, effectively labeling colonial leaders as traitors.\n\nGeorge's plan involved mobilizing a massive military response: deploying over 30,000 British troops, hiring Hessian mercenaries (German auxiliaries), and blockading American ports with the Royal Navy to starve the colonies economically. He aimed to isolate New England, the rebellion's hotbed, and divide the colonies through divide-and-conquer tactics. Domestically, he suppressed pro-American sentiments in Britain via censorship and propaganda.\n\nHowever, the plan backfired, unifying colonists and leading to the Declaration of Independence in 1776. George's inflexibility, influenced by hardline advisors like Lord North, prolonged the war, costing Britain dearly. This \"massive plan\" symbolized imperial overreach, fueling America's fight for independence and reshaping global history.\n\n#RevolutionaryWar #UShistory #EpicHistory</article>",

Every catch is monitored and recorded. \n\nBut despite their efforts to keep fishing as selective and sustainable as possible, the Azores fishermen are struggling to make ends meet. Because of overfishing, the EU imposed fishing quotas that could run them out of business. \n\nLocal fishermen say they are frustrated because it’s not their fault the quotas have to be implemented. They say waters are depleted thanks to industrial fishing fleets casting out gigantic purse seine nets further out at sea, where they can easily evade monitoring.  \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #sustainablefishing #overfishing\n______\n\nWe kindly ask viewers to read and stick to the DW netiquette policy on our channel: https://p.dw.com/p/MF1G</article>",

As a result, I learned, or was reminded of a few important lessons that have become my focus moving forward, and have also inspired some recent changes I've made to my photography approach and business, including moving into a new studio space. In this video, I'm going to talk about those three lessons in hopes that they maybe help you out with your work in one way or another.

Donate to FRONTLINE now: https://bit.ly/47DFzCb\n\nAnd support your local PBS station here: https://www.pbs.org/donate\n\nThis short documentary from FRONTLINE, Retro Report and ProPublica examined the horrors of what happened when U.S.-trained and equipped Salvadoran soldiers killed some 1,000 civilians, many of them children, in an attack more than 40 years ago. In the documentary, Raymond Bonner — who was one of the first journalists to bear witness to the aftermath of the massacre — recounted the experience of reporting the story and spoke with survivors of the attack.\n\nThis on-the-ground investigation detailed how, for decades following the tragedy, there was little movement towards holding anyone accountable, and how the case against high-ranking military officials faltered under Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele. \n\n“Massacre in El Salvador” laid bare the nation’s grisly past and the decades-long struggle for justice.\n\n“Massacre in El Salvador” is a FRONTLINE and Retro Report production with ProPublica.

      "content": "<article>Turkey's Sea of Marmara is on the brink of environmental collapse. Pollution, overfishing and climate change are depleting its oxygen. The crisis became visible when a thick layer of algal slime first began spreading across its waters in 2021.\n\nNecla Köseoğlu, from Rumelikavağı, is one of the last people still working in traditional small-scale fishing on Turkey's Sea of Marmara. She's also one of the few women in the business. She used to be able to live off what she made from fishing, but those days are gone. Fish stocks in the Turkish inland sea have declined dramatically. The ecosystem is at risk of collapse due to overfishing, urban and industrial waste, and shipping pollution. The Marmara Sea, whose shores are home to around 25 million people, is suffocating.\n\nThe crisis became widely known in 2021, when a kind of slime known as \"sea snot\" began to cover large parts of the sea's surface. The foul-smelling, gelatinous substance is an organic substance secreted by algae. It's not harmful to humans, but it starves other marine life of oxygen. Professor Hasan Örek is among the marine biologists and oceanographers sounding the alarm.\n\nIstanbul's city government has acknowledged the looming disaster. Environmental engineer Ayşen Erdinçler and her colleague Ilker Aslan say stricter controls and fines will curb pollution from shipping. But those measures are nothing more than a drop in the ocean. The greatest threat comes from millions of cubic meters of untreated domestic and industrial waste discharged into the sea each day. Local wastewater treatment plants urgently need modernization, but the Turkish government lacks the funds to carry it out.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #turkey #marmarasea \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.
