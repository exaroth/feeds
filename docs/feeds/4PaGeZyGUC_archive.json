      "content": "<article>For a cow to produce milk, she must give birth to a calf. Female calves later become dairy cows themselves, while male calves are surplus to the dairy industry’s requirements. They’re packed into trucks and suffer in transit on their way to fattening facilities.\n\nCows must calve once a year to produce milk. However, male calves are unwanted, considered waste products of the dairy industry. They’re often sent to fattening farms, mostly outside the EU. A farmer, a scientist and a butcher want to change this. Instead of sending the animals to factory farms where they’re fattened with soy or corn, the bull calves are sent to the pastures and alpine meadows of the Alps.\n \nAlong with a small group of farmers, restaurateurs and retailers, dairy farmer Marcel Renz is trying to change the dairy system in southern Germany. He wants to improve animal welfare, shorten transport distances and produce good quality meat that customers are willing to pay a little more for.\n\nFor people who buy their meat from butcher Hannes Hönegger, this is a positive. The butcher works with small, traditional organic farms that rely on what’s known as dual-purpose breeds, animals not bred solely for performance. Here, cows and calves are suitable for both milk and meat production, just as they were in the past. They feed almost exclusively on what grows in the pastures. In this way, they also contribute to the protection of nature in the Alps - from the Allgäu to South Tyrol.\n \nThomas Zanon's bull calves are among the lucky ones. No long journeys, no fattening with soya or maize. Instead, they graze on his mountain pasture - a small herd that he’s rescued from the dairy industry. Thomas Zanon's main job is as an assistant professor of livestock farming at the University of Bolzano in Italy. Taking all factors into account, he says, milk is by no means inferior to milk substitutes made from oats or soya. The rescued bull calves on his alpine pasture are not only happy animals: They also embody a new approach to sustainable milk production.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

      "content": "<article>In the collective memory, the Cold War is the conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union. However, one thing is often forgotten: the two superpowers also set their sights on the African continent.\n\nTo this day, the Cold War is remembered as an East-West conflict that was fought in the form of proxy and guerrilla wars in Asia and Latin America. However, one aspect of this confrontation is often forgotten: the United States and the Soviet Union also set their sights on Africa, which became a new arena for their power struggle, against the backdrop of decolonization. \nLeft-wing political forces gained strength in African countries in the 1960s. Moscow seized the opportunity and invested heavily in East African Somalia, for example. The situation was similar in Angola. And Moscow triumphed.\nWith Ronald Reagan as the new president, the United States began preparing its return to the African continent in 1981. The timing was favorable, as communism had been devastating in Africa: the collectivization of agriculture in Ethiopia, for example, led to a famine that cost 500,000 people their lives. \nAs more and more African countries turned away from the Soviet model, Moscow could only stand by and watch. Ultimately, Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms could not prevent the collapse of the USSR in 1991.\nThe end of the East-West conflict offered many countries in Africa the opportunity to take control of their own destiny once again. However, to avoid being exploited and manipulated by world powers once more, the continent had to learn the lessons of the Cold War era.\n\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

But maybe the biggest divide in our politics is the insider vs. outsider divide.\n\nThat’s only gotten more noticeable in recent months, as issues like the Epstein files and artificial intelligence have pitted the elites against everyone else. Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) is at the center of both of those issues. He wrote the Epstein Files Transparency Act. He brought one of Jeffrey Epstein’s abuse survivors to this week's State of the Union address. And he’s coined the term “the Epstein class” — the group of wealthy and connected individuals that he wants to bring to accountability. Even if they’re fellow Democrats.\n\nKhanna represents Silicon Valley in his district, so he has worked with companies like Google and Meta for years. That puts him at the forefront of one of the important political and economic questions of the coming year: Is AI about to put us all out of work? And is the government prepared to do anything about it?\n\n00:00 Intro\n1:52 Advocating for Epstein survivors\n4:31 Forcing the release of the Epstein Files\n5:23 Pushing for a vote on Iran strikes\n6:32 Should Dems work with Trump?\n9:41 Holding the “Epstein class” accountable\n15:03 Should Dems have done more to stop Epstein?\n18:10 Tech leaders and income inequality\n19:03 Is there an AI tsunami?\n19:42 Are Dems anti-AI?\n22:00 CA tax on billionaires\n23:56 Is Khanna making a presidential bid?\n\nToday, Explained publishes video episodes every Saturday tackling key issues in politics and culture.

Martin Luther King, Jr. in the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and was appointed to lead Operation Breadbasket, a program aimed at addressing economic concerns of Black Americans. In the years after King’s assassination, Jackson formed the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, a civil rights organization pushing for equity in the economic and political spheres for Black Americans. He died in February 2026 at the age of 84.\n\nThe interview has been edited for length and clarity.

      "content": "<article>In India, more than 80 women are raped every day. This number is probably just the tip of the iceberg. In most cases, the crimes are not reported - whether out of shame, fear of the perpetrator, or mistrust of the police and the justice system.\n\nIn the west of the country, in the wealthy and conservative state of Gujarat, the story of 17-year-old Kinjal portrays an India in which rape is apparently considered a \"trivial offense.” \nThree years ago, the young girl, who belongs to the Dalit community - a group considered \"untouchables,” who occupy the lowest social status, at the bottom of the caste system -- was raped by the son of a landowner from a higher caste. \nTo cover up the incident, the rapist's family offered Kinjal's parents land and 100,000 euros - a fortune. But Kinjal's father rejected the compromise, preferring to take the case to court. \nThis rare act of courage was considered an affront by the higher castes. As a sign of his struggle, he decided not to cut his hair again until the perpetrator was convicted. \nKinjal and her family were supported by Manjula Pradeep. The activist, who is also a Dalit, has dedicated her life to defending women who have been raped. Her goal, as yet unattained, is that each victim she helps will be the last. \nFor six months, a camera crew accompanied Kinjal and her family in their search for justice. A glimpse behind the scenes in India, where the violence of the caste system and the weight of tradition determine the lives of hundreds of millions of women.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #india \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

A lot of Gen Z women…do not. \n\nAnd that divide — and the national handwringing about it — says a lot about the changing status of men and women in this country, and the uncomfortable realization that for American policymakers, not all children are created equal. \n\nToday’s guest on The Gray Area is Vox reporter and bestselling novelist Anna North, who covers kids, parenting, and American family life. She writes the Vox newsletter Kids Today, and her latest chart-topping novel is Bog Queen. She recently reported on the gap between young men and young women on parenthood and what that might tell us about gender roles, relationships, and the future of family formation in a politically polarized country.\n\nHost: Sean Illing (@SeanIlling)\nGuest: Anna North, Staff Writer, Vox\n\n3:30 The poll that revealed a massive parenting gender gap in Gen Z.\n11:20 Why \"Tradwife\" content and traditional values are finding a new audience.\n15:43 The Gen Z family split\n23:11 The \"Care Crisis\" and the trauma of modern immigration enforcement on children.\n26:15 The future of the American family in 2026 and beyond.\n\nWe would love to hear from you.

      "content": "<article>China is pushing into European markets - and striving for ever greater military power. This has already had an impact on the internal and external security of Western countries. How dependent is Germany on China?\n\nFancy some iced tea? It'll be delivered by drone. A tree falls onto the road? The driverless taxi swerves out of the way. The rapid development of artificial intelligence and automation in the megacity of Shenzhen shows how high-tech China is integrating innovation into everyday life. Digitalization is everywhere, in a country where administrative procedures are carried out via mobile phone. \nBut the example of Shenzhen also shows that western countries are in danger of being left behind by China in key technologies such as AI, robotics and electric cars. \nBehind all this advancement lies a great deal of state planning - as well as possible attempts to exert influence. \nThis film shows how China is creating economic and technological dependencies, for example when it comes to so-called \"rare earths\" and \"technology metals.” These are not only indispensable for photovoltaics, wind power and robotics: Many armaments also depend on these raw materials, which are supplied almost exclusively by China.\nChinese manufacturers of batteries and electric cars are also focusing on Hungary as a location to conquer the European market. Factories are being built there, partly to circumvent EU customs duties. The country is actively courting Chinese investment. Within the EU, Hungary repeatedly blocks tougher measures against China. This is putting pressure on Germany's automotive industry.\nThe film explores the question of how dependent Germany is on China and what risks this poses for security and cyber security. What are the strengths and weaknesses of this global power? China competes with the US for leadership in the world, and has long been a security policy challenge for the West. The documentary looks at the two countries’ economic ties, political goals and interrelations -- down to the hyper-local level. Experts from Europe, the US and China provide insights and answers.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #china #europe \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Known as \"Eddy\" to his family, Queen Victoria's grandson and the eldest son of King Edward VII lived a life defined by privilege, mystery, and explosive royal scandals.\n\nIn this full documentary, we investigate the events that shadowed his legacy—from the notorious Cleveland Street Scandal and rumours of a secret life in London’s underworld to the sensational (though debunked) theories linking him to the Jack the Ripper murders. Was there a royal cover-up to protect the heir apparent, or was he a \"black sheep\" prince unfairly targeted by the press?\n\nWe also explore his tragic death at just 28 during the 1892 influenza pandemic, an event that changed British royal history forever by paving the way for his brother, King George V. Featuring insights into his education at Trinity College, his military service, and his failed romances, this biography reveals the human story behind the \"Lost King.\"\n\nPlease subscribe here. https://www.youtube.com/@PeopleProfiles?sub_confirmation=1\nOur second channel. https://www.youtube.com/@PeopleProfilesExtra\nFollow us on Spotify. https://open.spotify.com/show/7fKALbrzEO9Q4VVvAwWHqL\nSupport us on Patreon https://patreon.com/thepeopleprofiles\nFollow us on Twitter. https://twitter.com/tpprofiles\n\nThanks for watching!

      "content": "<article>Sixty years ago, Europe's first seawater desalination plant was built in the Canary Islands. This technology for producing fresh water was a blessing for the islands. Now, it could prove to be a curse for the ecosystem.\n\nThis water treatment system is essential for life in the area - but is it compatible with the principles of sustainable development?\n\nDue to limited freshwater resources and rising demand, the first seawater desalination plant in Europe was built in the Canary Islands. It is often touted as a perfect solution. Today, the Canary Islands have the highest number of desalinations plants in the world, relative to the islands’ size and population. \n\nThe fresh water obtained in this way is indispensable for human life on the volcanic islands, but - since it appears to be available in abundance - it also encourages unbridled economic development, such as mass tourism and the intensive monoculture of bananas for export. \n\nMoreover, seawater desalination is anything but climate-neutral. The plants consume vast amounts of electricity from fossil fuels. The brine returned to the sea destroys marine life and contributes to ocean acidification. \n\nThe film sheds light for the first time on this region's dependence on desalinated seawater. The documentary also explains how water desalination works, and the various impacts that need to be considered.\n \nAware of the urgent need to protect nature, their own health and the future of their children, the Canarian people are working together with scientists to find alternative solutions for sustainable water management. \n\nThanks to decades of experience, the Canary Islands are now leaders in the field of seawater desalination, and their technical expertise is in demand worldwide. In view of increasingly frequent droughts due to climate change, the extraction of drinking water using this technology is becoming a matter of survival for an increasing number of people.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #canaryislands #water \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

      "content": "<article>The survivors of the bar fire in the Swiss mountain resort and their families are desperately trying to come to terms with the tragedy. Could the New Year's blaze in Crans-Montana that claimed 41 lives and left 116 people injured have been prevented?\n\nNew Year's celebrations ended in tragedy at the Le Constellation bar in the upscale ski resort of Crans-Montana. Swiss investigators believe that sparklers attached to champagne bottles set light to sound insulation foam on the basement ceiling. The flames spread within seconds, turning the basement of the bar - a popular party location - into a death trap. \n41 people died as a result of the blaze and 116 people were left injured. Many of the mostly teenaged victims sustained severe burns. That night was the start of a living nightmare for the families affected. \nThis documentary accompanies some of the parents whose children were left critically injured and now face long hospital stays far from home, uncertain outcomes and the daily struggle to keep hope alive. \nOne young survivor also describes what she went through that night and how it has affected her. The psychological wounds run deep: anxiety, trauma and feelings of guilt. She is plagued by the question of why she survived when others died. \nThe film shows how initial reactions of shock and dismay quickly turned to outrage after revelations that human blunders and safety shortcomings may have led to the blaze. The investigation and legal proceedings are only just getting underway, but the mental and emotional impact is already overwhelming.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #swiss #switzerland \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

The discussion reveals that effects are composable operations that encapsulate side effects and defer execution, giving developers the right handles to manage unpredictability through compiler-checked types.\nThe authors explain how ZIO tracks three critical types: outputs, failures, and environmental requirements, enabling better testing with mock clocks and random number generators.\n\nThey share their intentional avoidance of intimidating functional programming terminology like \"monads\" proving you don't need mathematical foundations to understand effects. The conversation covers effect systems' expansion beyond Scala into TypeScript, Kotlin, and new languages like Unison and Roc, and how their collaborative writing process with strict constraints like 47-character line limits - created a coherent 100-page book readable in portrait mode on your phone.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nBill Frasure, Bruce Eckel, James Ward • Effect Oriented Programming • https://amzn.to/4sO6wLV\nBruce Eckel &amp; Svetlana Isakova • Atomic Kotlin • https://amzn.to/4qT1gEQ\nBruce Eckel • Thinking in C++ • https://amzn.to/4qnrIGW\nAndrew Harmel-Law • Facilitating Software Architecture • https://amzn.eu/d/5kZKVfU\nSam Keen • Clean Architecture with Python • https://amzn.to/4pBT5g0\nEric Evans • Domain-Driven Design • https://amzn.to/3tnGhwm\n\n\nBluesky (https://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com) \nTwitter (https://twitter.com/GOTOcon) \nInstagram (https://www.instagram.com/goto_con) \nLinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-) \nFacebook (https://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences) \n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

Overthrow the results of an election they claimed was rigged, despite no credible evidence of fraud. \n\nIf that sounds familiar, that’s because it is. Brazil’s January 8 looked a lot like the January 6 attack on the US capital, just two years earlier: mob violence, an insurrection, and a defeated leader who refused to concede.\n\nBut the aftermath could not be more different. Jair Bolsonaro is now serving a 27-year prison sentence, while Donald Trump is president, again. \n\nSo how did two democracies, facing similar threats, end up with such different outcomes?

      "content": "<article>We explored some of Irelands most famous castles.\n\nHistory Hit’s Matt Lewis travels through Ireland, discovering its spectacular castles, from ancient legendary hilltops to Norman keeps and mighty medieval citadels. \n\nIn the first episode we head to the High King’s of Ireland seat of power, the Hill of Tara, before investigating the Norman invasions and the powerful structures they built…castles! \n\nMatt begins at the Hill of Tara, or in Irish Teamhair or Cnoc na Teamhrach, an ancient site for projecting spiritual and political power. Matt reveals the mystical stories of the High King’s of Ireland, including the formative leader Brian Boru. But it’s not just Boru who has a direct link to Tara, one of Ireland’s most famous people is said to have come here…St Patrick. Patrick is believed to have performed miracles challenging the old pagan rulers, bringing christianity to the island of Ireland. Tara remains a magical place, even today. \n\nBut Ireland wasn’t to be ruled by High Kings forever...In 1167 the Normans invaded. For years they fought for control. By 1176 they gained enough land to cement their power in stone…in castles! \n\nMatt heads to one of the biggest castles in Ireland, Trim. Trim sat on the frontier of Ireland, a symbol of English dominance over the Irish populace. It was built by the Norman Lord, Hugh De Lacy. De Lacy used Trim as his powerbase to control this area of Ireland through force and ideology. The Normans portrayed the Irish as barbaric people who they should conquer and ‘civilise’. Matt explores an incredible ancient manuscript that reveals exactly this. The Topographia Hibernica could be called the first piece of colonial propaganda in Ireland, aiming to justify the subjugation of of Irish land and people. But it wasn’t just through ideology and propaganda that the Normans could invade this green isle, it was the weapons and force they brought with them too - Matt discovers the brutal weapons that backed up their fortresses.\n-\n-\n-\nLove Castles and want to find out more?

An invisible poison — lead — has been destroying lives in Zambia for decades.\n \nHeadaches, fatigue, stomach pain, memory loss — for many people in Kabwe, Zambia, all that is part of daily life. Children suffer the most. Lead damages their developing brains, slows learning and leaves scars that last a lifetime.\n\nThe cause is no mystery: An old lead mine. The United Nations ranks Kabwe among the most polluted places on Earth. Around 200,000 people are affected. Nearly every child has dangerously high levels of lead in their blood.\n\nWe met mothers like Jane, whose 6-year-old daughter Elizabeth struggles to keep up at school because of lead poisoning. Former workers, too: Like Mathias, who spent decades working without protections in the mine and now speaks of a toxic legacy no one wants to clean up.\n\nOver 30 years since the mine closed, the damage continues. Families are living with irreversible harm, while a class-action lawsuit seeks to finally answer a simple question: Who is responsible?\n \n00:00 The invisible threat: Lead in Kabwe\n01:10 Jane and Elizabeth: A child losing her memory\n01:48 Diagnosis: Severe lead poisoning in a child\n03:05 The mine: A century of toxicity\n04:25 The class action against Anglo American\n05:00 Mathias’ story: Working in a toxic lab\n08:28 Mining today: Selling health at 13 euros a week\n09:55 Living with poison: Jane fighting the dust\n10:05 Hope for compensation — and a new life\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #reporter #zambia \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

      "content": "<article>Mindfulness is everywhere now, which is kind of weird.\n\nWhat started as a countercultural practice has become a productivity hack and a billion-dollar app ecosystem. On one level, it’s great that more people are meditating. But somewhere along the way, the whole thing got flattened. When mindfulness is mainly about optimizing your output, we’ve probably missed the point.\n\nToday’s guest is Jon Kabat-Zinn, pioneer of the American mindfulness movement and author of the mega-bestseller Wherever You Go, There You Are. Jon’s work helped bring meditation into medicine, schools, sports, and everyday life. He’s also spent decades reminding people that mindfulness isn’t about escape, self-improvement, or becoming some perfectly serene version of yourself.\n\nSean and Jon talk about what mindfulness actually is, why being present is so damn hard, and what happens when industry turns meditation into another tool for self-optimization.\n\nThis episode originally aired in December of 2023.\n\nHost: Sean Illing (@SeanIlling)\nGuest: Jon Kabat-Zinn, author of Wherever You Go, There You Are: Mindfulness Meditation in Everyday Life.\n\n00:00 Intro\n03:02 Mindfulness vs. mindlessness\n13:12 What to do when you have a lapse in attention\n19:36 The mindfulness industry\n34:10 Recognizing this moment\n36:46 A meditation led by Jon Kabat-Zinn\n\nWe would love to hear from you.

      "content": "<article>For many single parents, everyday life can be a challenge. But a number of projects offer assistance and encouragement. Affordable housing, social networking, and childcare services are designed to ease the burden.\n\nSingle parents in Europe can increasingly rely on help and support from people, associations, and institutions to help them balance raising children with work, financial issues, and mental overload. \n\n\"A secure, affordable living situation - that's such a key issue in the lives of single parents,” says Sarah Zeller. A few years ago, she found herself confronting this issue when, along with another friend and her child, she decided to set up a shared apartment for the two single parent families. But they searched in vain for an affordable apartment with enough space. \n\nThis predicament gave rise to an innovative approach. In 2015, the German native founded the non-profit association JUNO in Vienna. Working with property developers, the association plans and develops compact and affordable apartments for single parents. With her idea, the founder has now helped over 160 families find a suitable apartment. \n\nThe Belgian region of Wallonia has set itself the goal of strengthening the social position of single parents. Amandine Dedoncker is a social worker involved in the \"Relais Familles Mono” program, creating services tailored to the needs of single parents. The government program enables single parents to learn practical skills, meet other mothers or fathers, and be part of a community. As a population group particularly affected by loneliness, this is extremely important for single parents‘ mental health. \n\nWhen other families have free time, on Saturdays Bianka Baumann is at work: in a supermarket in Rostock. The single mother and sales assistant works weekends. But who looks after her son Linus, during a time when most daycare centers are closed? An innovative daycare center here makes her weekend work possible by offering overnight care for parents who work night shifts. \nAll of this is financed by the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. A model that supports single parents - and makes it possible to truly balance work and family life.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #family #singlemom #singledad \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

In allied propaganda, these atrocities became a central talking point, were often grossly exaggerated and served as a justification for why the war against the German Empire had to be won. But why did the German troops target the Belgians specifically at the very start of WW1? What circumstances and reasons allowed these crimes to happen?

This documentary explores the remarkable life of the woman who served as the longest-serving Princess of Wales and eventually Queen Consort to King Edward VII.\n\nWhile the Edwardian era is often remembered for its lavish parties and the \"Marlborough House Set,\" Alexandra’s private reality was defined by her battle with progressive deafness and the \"Alexandra Limp\"—a physical disability caused by rheumatic fever that, bizarrely, became a viral fashion trend among the Victorian elite. From her \"rags-to-riches\" journey as a Danish princess to her complicated marriage to a \"Playboy King,\" we reveal how she navigated his high-profile mistresses (including Alice Keppel) and the strict demands of Queen Victoria.\n\nPlease subscribe here. https://www.youtube.com/@PeopleProfiles?sub_confirmation=1\nOur second channel. https://www.youtube.com/@PeopleProfilesExtra\nFollow us on Spotify. https://open.spotify.com/show/7fKALbrzEO9Q4VVvAwWHqL\nSupport us on Patreon https://patreon.com/thepeopleprofiles\nFollow us on Twitter. https://twitter.com/tpprofiles\n\nThanks for watching!

Newly evaluated archive material, eyewitnesses, and experts document the extent, background, and consequences of this warfare.\n\nA little-known chapter of colonial violence: The French army secretly used chemical weapons against independence fighters during the Algerian War (1954-1962). Maps, documents, and eyewitness accounts from French and Algerian veterans document the dimension of this warfare, as well as the human suffering it caused. \n\nInterviews with experts on nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons explain how military and political decision-makers organized these secret attacks. In addition to the torture and displacement of entire population groups, the use of chemical weapons constituted a huge breach of France's international obligations. Obligations France deliberately disregarded during its colonial war. \n\nStep by step, the film reveals the impact of this warfare on Algeria’s land and people. The film illuminates both the historical events, and their current relevance.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #frenchcolonialism #colonialism #algeria \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Use code BOYLE at the link below and get 60% off an annual plan: https://incogni.com/boyle\n\nThis video explores the 2026 \"Deep Freeze\" of the crypto market, analyzing why the \"digital gold\" thesis has failed to protect investors as Bitcoin lags behind the S&amp;P 500 total returns. We dive into the \"Victory Paradox\"—the irony that Bitcoin’s institutional acceptance through Wall Street ETFs and a \"crypto-friendly\" presidency has tethered it to traditional financial risks, destroying its status as an uncorrelated asset. From the $12 billion losses at Michael Saylor’s Strategy Inc. and the liquidity crisis at institutional prime broker BlockFills to the Great AI Pivot in the mining industry, we break down the structural traps currently paralyzing the ecosystem. Featuring insights on \"Financial Nihilism\" from Demetri Kofinas, the \"Juggalo Theory\" of crypto subcultures from Zeke Faux, and the massive migration toward prediction markets like Kalshi and Polymarket, we ask the ultimate forward-looking question: now that Bitcoin is fully financialized, will it ever be an independent asset again?\n\nPatrick's Books:\nStatistics For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3eerLA0\nDerivatives For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3cjsyPF\nCorporate Finance:  https://amzn.to/3fn3rvC \n\nWays To Support The Channel\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/PatrickBoyleOnFinance\nBuy Me a Coffee: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/patrickboyle\n\nVisit our website: https://www.onfinance.org\nFollow Patrick on Twitter Here: https://bsky.app/profile/pboyle.bsky.social\n\nBusiness Inquiries ➡️ sponsors@onfinance.org\n\nPatrick Boyle On Finance Podcast:\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/7uhrWlDvxzy9hLoW0EYf0b\nApple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/patrick-boyle-on-finance/id1547740313\nGoogle Podcasts: https://tinyurl.com/62862nve\n\nJoin this channel to support making this content:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCASM0cgfkJxQ1ICmRilfHLw/join</article>",

      "content": "<article>Jeffrey Epstein remained a thriving member of the elite for decades, even when everyone seemed to know what he was doing. His sphere of influence included top political officials, CEOs, corporate executives, finance managers, and even a member of the British royal family. How did he manage it? It turns out it was by establishing an elaborate network of influence and access that went well beyond the norms and expectations of the rich and famous.\n\nWhat were the tipping points that nearly brought Epstein to justice in the 14 years before his first conviction and his final 2019 arrest? What were the structures and systems that failed to stop him from abusing and exploiting young women and girls in those 14 years? In this episode, we tick through the guest lists and institutions that continued to profit from relationships with Jeffrey Epstein — and which helped him remain free, in turn.\n\nWe will also talk about many of the conspiracy theories that have popped up since the latest tranche of Epstein documents came out. Was Epstein a national security asset? Did he actually kill himself?\n\nIndependent journalist Tara Palmeri, author of the Red Letter Substack and host of The Tara Palmeri Show, argues that conspiracies are important to help the public understand the extent and scope of the Epstein scandal — since for so long, so much about the story was covered up. We’ll make sense of which conspiracies have validity and which are tinfoil hat material, in this interview with a journalist who has long advocated for and written about the Epstein survivors.\n\n00:00 Intro: What we do and do not know about Epstein\n03:31 The stories of the Epstein survivors\n07:56 The conspiracy theories around Epstein\n11:21 The elite enablers around Epstein\n17:08 The political cover-up over Epstein\n19:13 The conspiracy theorizing around Epstein\n22:13 The elite lies around Epstein\n\nToday, Explained publishes compelling interviews with key figures in politics and culture every Saturday.

      "title": "What was immigration like before ICE?",
      "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJHgmQc-Fog",

      "content": "<article>In the history section on ICE’s website, one line reads: “Despite U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's relatively young age, its functional history predates the modern birth of the agency by more than 200 years.” That phrasing of “functional history” stands out. We know that ICE was created in 2003. So what exactly do they mean by that? To unpack this claim, Vox producer Nate Krieger examines the history of immigration enforcement in the US. \n\nThe story of American immigration is one of gradual change. Over time, the role of the immigration services slowly changed, morphing from an agency that managed labor and benefits to one that saw itself as law enforcement, with a focus on national security. \n\nAnd with that shift came a growth in capacity. The first federal immigration agency was created in 1891 with a total staff of 4 people. Today, with ICE, that number is over 22,000.\n\nSo how did immigration restrictions and enforcement change over the span of American history? By examining the centuries of events that culminated in the creation of ICE, we can begin to understand the context that created this modern agency. \n\nSources and further reading: \n\nFor more context, images, and written accounts of Ellis Island, see this page on the National Park Service’s website: https://www.nps.gov/elis/learn/historyculture/index.htm\n\nFor this story, Nate Krieger focused on the history leading up to 2003 and the creation of ICE, so the piece does not delve into more recent developments. But detailed information and data on deportation in President Donald Trump’s second term can be found here: https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/immigration-detention-report.pdf and https://deportationdata.org/analysis/immigration-enforcement-first-nine-months-trump\n\nAnd more information on ICE’s arrests in the interior, which are a relatively recent phenomenon, can be found here: https://www.migrationpolicy.org/content/ice-arrests-deportations-interior\n\nThis piece only touched on Japanese incarceration during the Second World War. For more information — and first-hand accounts — about this important subject, Densho is a fantastic resource: https://ddr.densho.org/\n\n\"Immigration: How the Past Shapes The Present\" by the sociologist Nancy Foner, who was interviewed for this piece, is a comprehensive look into why the past is critical to understanding modern immigration: https://www.politybooks.com/bookdetail?book_slug=immigration-how-the-past-shapes-the-present--9781509557912\n\n\"The Migrant's Jail: An American History of Mass Incarceration\" by historian Brianna Nofil, who was also interviewed for this piece, is a look at the century-long history of immigrant incarceration in the United States: https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691237015/the-migrants-jail\n\nIf you enjoy our reporting and want to hear more from Vox journalists, sign up for our Patreon at patreon.com/vox.

She explores the realities behind the drama, including Mary’s marriage to Lord Darnley, the murder of David Rizzio, the scandal surrounding the Earl of Bothwell, her forced abdication, and eventual imprisonment in England. \n\nThe review culminates in a close look at Mary’s trial and execution, separating cinematic invention from the complex historical record surrounding one of the most compelling monarchs of the sixteenth century.\n\nYou can now become a History Hit member right here on YouTube!

Three young women talk about their near-death experiences and how these moments changed their lives.\n\n\"I used to be extremely afraid of death. But ever since my near-death experience, that's no longer the case,\" says model Chanel Silberberg, who became famous through the German reality TV show \"Germany's Next Topmodel.\" She nearly died at the age of 11 from complications related to a chronic illness. The experience fundamentally shaped her.\n\nWhy do near-death experiences have such a lasting impact? This documentary shares the dramatic and inspiring stories of three young women who stood on the brink between life and death and returned with a completely new life perspective. Their background stories are vastly different: Laethisia Schimek is a competitive athlete; Léa Winzenried is a dance therapist; and Chanel Silberberg is a model and influencer. What all three have in common is an awareness of the finiteness of life, and a drive to experience it to the fullest. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Frances shares her unique teaching philosophy, which emphasizes self-contained, playable examples like simple games that make complex concepts accessible and memorable.\n\nDrawing on her background in mathematics and her father's work in teacher education, she explains how her approach—exemplified by her famous \"X Out of a Y Paper Bag\" series of talks—uses humor and practical scenarios to help learners understand challenging topics like coroutines, the spaceship operator, and the \"almost always auto\" style. The discussion touches on the evolution of C++, the upcoming reflection features in C++26, and Fran's current project: writing an introductory C++ book for complete beginners, despite finding concepts like \"constant variable\" challenging to explain even as an experienced author.\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n01:48 Why modern C++ needs a new approach\n07:03 Teaching through games &amp; examples\n11:41 Coroutines in C++\n14:50 \"almost always auto\" &amp; modern C++ style\n22:04 Teaching &amp; writing: A family tradition?\n28:44 Outro\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nFrances Buontempo • Learn C++ by Example • https://amzn.to/4rgxSZX\nFrances Buontempo • Introducing C++ • https://amzn.to/40aHQQC\nFrances Buontempo • Genetic Algorithms and Machine Learning for Programmers • https://amzn.to/3OLjXMV\nDaniel Kusswurm • Modern Parallel Programming with C++ and Assembly Language • https://amzn.to/4o5J3SF\n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.instagram.com/goto_con\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#Cpp #CppProgramming #CppProgramminglanguage #Coroutines #ConstantVariable #Cpp26 #Compiler #AlmostAlwaysAuto #ModernCpp #CompilerExplorer #TodayInTech #SoftwareEngineering #Programming #FrancesBuontempo #MattGodbolt #BookClub\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

In this documentary, we unmask Jiang Qing, the woman who rose from the fringes of the communist movement to become the de-facto dictator of the Cultural Revolution. While Chairman Mao held the title, it was Jiang Qing who held the leash—orchestrating a decade of chaos, purges, and cultural erasure that left an indelible scar on China.\n\nHow did a struggling film star become the \"White-Boned Demon\" of the Politburo?

      "content": "<article>The \"Green Deal” is Europe's recipe for economic growth and climate protection. But green technologies require critical raw materials, which often come from China. Is more mining in Europe a viable solution?\n\nEurope wants to encourage economic growth, while also saving our planet from climate collapse. The name of the plan to do this is the \"Green Deal.” Under the Green Deal, electric cars are supposed to replace combustion engines, and renewable energies will be used instead of coal, oil, and gas. \nBut green technologies require many critical raw materials, like lithium and rare earths. But these raw materials are rarely mined in Europe anymore. Currently, they come from faraway places like Africa, South America, Russia, and above all, China.\n \nThe ensuing dependence poses a risk to the European economy. Politicians and industry leaders now want to bring some mining back to Europe. They promise green, sustainable mines with as little impact on the environment as possible. But in places where these types of mines are being built, people are fighting back. They fear that their regions will be sacrificed for the energy transition.\n\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #rawmaterials \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

      "content": "<article>A 90-minute documentary examining Venezuela’s controversial and outspoken late former president Hugo Chávez and the revolution he claimed was turning his country into an anti-capitalist beacon for Latin America and the world. (Aired 2008) \n\nThis journalism is made possible by viewers like you. Donate to FRONTLINE now: https://bit.ly/47DFzCb\n\nAnd support your local PBS station here: https://www.pbs.org/donate\n\nIn “The Hugo Chávez Show,” FRONTLINE traveled to Venezuela to offer an illuminating portrait of the country’s  then-president, Hugo Chávez. Through interviews with former government officials, Chávez associates and critics, and ordinary Venezuelans, FRONTLINE chronicled how Chávez ascended to power,  how he became a dominant figure in recent Latin American history, and how he used broadcast media to spread the “21st-century socialism” he espoused.\n\nMemorably, the documentary introduced U.S. viewers to “Aló Presidente” — or “Hello, President” — a weekly televised show that often ran five to eight hours and featured Chávez speaking directly to the people, explaining government policy and mixing in a smattering of songs, poetry and whatever else struck his fancy. Beyond being a venue for Chávez’s personality, the program served as a weekly window into the Venezuelan government, with Chávez often announcing major policy decisions on live television.\n\nWith Venezuela in the headlines following the U.S. government’s capture of Nicolás Maduro, who was Chávez’s protege and successor, “The Hugo Chávez Show” offers important context on Venezuela’s political history and the accomplishments, failures, appeal and repression of the Chávez era.\n\nPraise for “The Hugo Chavez Show”:\n“This portrait transcends news events.” – David Montgomery, The Washington Post\n“An even-handed, unillusioned view of a highly perplexing figure.” – Mark Feeney, The Boston Globe\n“A fascinatingly revealing documentary.” – Kate Taylor, The Globe and Mail \n\n“The Hugo Chávez Show” is a FRONTLINE co-production with Ofra Bikel Productions. The producer, writer and director was Ofra Bikel. \n\nExplore additional reporting on “The Hugo Chávez Show” on our website:\nhttps://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/documentary/hugochavez/\n\n#Documentary #Venezuela #HugoChavez #Politics\n\nSubscribe on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/PBSfrontline\nSign up for our newsletter: https://frontline.org/newsletter\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/frontlinepbs​\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/frontline\nBluesky: https://bsky.app/profile/frontlinepbs.bsky.social\n\nFRONTLINE is produced at GBH in Boston and airs nationwide on PBS.

      "content": "<article>Thousands of people from Africa attempt to reach Europe via the Mediterranean. The EU is disrupting these migration routes and outsourcing its border control responsibilities to countries in the Sahara and Sahel regions.\n\nChristian and David try not to fall off the back of the pick-up. The vehicle is being driven at breakneck speed through the desert by smugglers. Like hundreds of thousands of people before them, the two Nigerians are traveling from West Africa to the Libyan Mediterranean coast. They’re hoping to reach Europe and the promise of a better life.\n\nIn a bid to stem irregular migration, the European Union is ramping up spending on migration, asylum and border management to tens of billions of euros. Some of the money funds migration partnerships with African countries. The aim is to halt people well before they reach Europe’s external borders. Local security forces are under orders to stop migrants in the desert, effectively making the Sahara a key arena in Europe’s border policy. But many of these desert regions have limited governance. Smuggling networks, human traffickers and armed groups operate there with general impunity.\n\nThe documentary joins migrants on the most dangerous leg of their trip: traversing the Sahara. An investigative journey on a migration route that reveals the full reach of Europe’s border policies - and the price paid by those desperate to reach the continent.\nOnly those who’ve survived the traffickers and torturers, who haven’t been imprisoned and deported, reach the Mediterranean. And crossing the sea brings a whole set of new dangers.\n\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #europe #migration \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

      "content": "<article>©Bangalore International Centre\n\nA different kind of video.\n\nIn this recording of a talk I recently gave, I first of all discuss my journey to YouTube (first 15mins), and then I talk about how art can (and should) be seen in so many different ways, and all are relevant.  \n\nI never set out to become a \"YouTuber\". I simply wanted to make art history accessible, stumbling into success with over two million subscribers along the way. And now, a book! \n\n“In a world of noise and distraction,” I say in my book, “great art slows us down. It demands attention, reflection, and interpretation. It doesn’t exist to give us easy answers—but it does give us better questions.”\n\nIn this illustrated talk, I bring my signature storytelling and striking visuals to explore celebrated artworks not as distant masterpieces, but as creations shaped by real people, real pressures, real ambitions. Through visual analysis, historical context, and human stories, I reveal how art intersects with power, class, money, religion, politics, and everyday life. No academic jargon. No dense theory. Just essential questions: Why was this made? What did it mean then? Why does it matter now?\n\nThroughout the talk, I encourage and guide the audience to slow down and really look. Details often missed in galleries are brought into focus, helping viewers understand how artists guide the eye, create meaning, and communicate emotion. As much as it is about learning facts, the talk is about learning how to look.\n\nThis is art history as it should be: open, democratic, relevant.\n\nCopyright Disclaimer under section 107 of the Copyright Act of 1976, allowance is made for “fair use” for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, education and research.

This film presents the latest scientific theories on how the human species evolved and looks at the shadow side of our unique abilities.\n\nSome animals see, hear or smell better than humans. Others can find their way in the dark much better than we can. Some can fly. All animals communicate, some have excellent memories and others build complex structures and have highly-developed social skills. \n\nSo what sets humans apart? Why have humans evolved such highly developed cognitive abilities in comparison to animals? The documentary sheds light on this major question of human evolution -- one of the mysteries that has long puzzled the world of science.

He discusses how Chainguard tackles this problem by building everything from source using Wolfi, creating minimal \"distroless\" images with near-zero CVEs, and how concepts like SBOMs, attestations, and defense in depth are reshaping security practices.\n\nThe conversation also covers major security incidents including the XZ Utils backdoor and Shai-hulud attacks, emphasizing the importance of building from source, using short-lived credentials, and replacing rather than updating containers – practices pioneered by companies like Google that are gradually spreading across the industry.\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n01:02 Early adoption of containers\n02:12 The problem of outdated packages\n05:21 Understanding scanners &amp; vulnerabilities\n09:39 Google Distroless &amp; the beginning of Chainguard\n14:39 Wolfi &amp; building from source\n20:14 Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) &amp; attestations\n27:01 Defense in depth &amp; best practices\n34:32 The XZ utils backdoor\n38:14 Resources\n38:52 Outro\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nAdrian Mouat • Using Docker • https://amzn.to/3PEYIJL\nLiz Rice • Container Security • https://amzn.to/3oU4iJe\nLiz Rice • Kubernetes Security • https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/kubernetes-security/9781492039075\n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.instagram.com/goto_con\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#Chainguard #Cybersecurity #Security #Wolfi #GoogleDistroless #SBOM #SoftwareBillOfMaterials #XZutils #ShaiHulud #ShaiHuludAttack #Containers #ContainerSecurity #Docker #DockerSecurity #TodaInTech #AdrianMouat #CharlesHumble\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

      "content": "<article>A technical masterpiece -- and a big responsibility. The Kiel Canal in Germany is the busiest artificial waterway in the world. But keeping it operational is expensive.\n\nThe infrastructure of the Kiel Canal is a much-discussed topic. As is the case in Germany with roads, bridges and railway tracks, cost-cutting measures are also impacting waterways. \n\nYet the canal offers decisive advantages for freight transport: every shipping container transported here replaces a long lorry journey. This saves fuel and improves the freight’s carbon footprint.\n\nEvery year, 25,000 to 30,000 ships pass through the artificial waterway that runs between the port cities of Kiel and Brunsbüttel, connecting the Baltic Sea with the North Sea. But the Kiel Canal, which opened in 1895 and is almost 100 kilometers long, requires constant monitoring and maintenance.\n\nIn the summer of 2024, one of the large lock chambers in Brunsbüttel had to be shut down for several months, and the canal was widened. Up to 30,000 cubic meters of soil were removed here every day to meet the increased demands of shipping traffic. \n\nTwo young boat builders, both named Paul, have little inkling of these challenges. They bought an old sailing boat and made it seaworthy again. The canal and its locks are the first big adventure of their journey, which will take them to the Canary Islands.\n\nThe impressive ships that sail the Kiel Canal have attracted their own fan base. Ship spotters regularly gather on the banks of the canal to watch the majestic cargo ships. \nParking attendant Rainer Schmidt is in charge of maintenance for the Rendsburg viewing point. One of his most important tasks is to keep the hedges trimmed, to ensure the view of the canal is not obstructed.\n\nThe report highlights the different facets of the Kiel Canal and shows how closely people are connected to this waterway. It accompanies them in their everyday lives and during special challenges, against the impressive backdrop of an ageing, but fascinating, technical monument.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #germany #kiel \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Some did not survive.\n\nIn Florida, unscrupulous profiteers opened pain clinics that turned out to be \"pill mills” - legal hubs for drugs. Chris George, head of the largest network, cynically reports on the system that made him rich before he spent 11 years in prison.\n\nBut by the end of the 2010s, the party was over: the justice system put a stop to the legal trade. Pharmacies stopped selling opioids. But the pills did not disappear. Mexican drug cartels took over the business. Members of the Sinaloa cartel explain in the documentary how they copied the methods of US pharmaceutical companies.

      "content": "<article>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has a playbook for fighting back against the Trump administration, and he says it’s working. Few Democratic politicians have leaned into the fight against the Trump administration as aggressively as he has. While some blue-state leaders have tried to find a lane of compromise or quiet resistance, Pritzker has gone the other direction: signing laws to limit ICE operations in Illinois, creating an accountability commission staffed by retired federal judges, suing the federal government, and successfully blocking the deployment of federalized National Guard troops on Chicago’s streets.\n\nPritzker is a unique figure in Democratic politics. A billionaire heir to the Hyatt hotel fortune, he has spent tens of millions of his own dollars to push for a more progressive income tax in Illinois and has advocated for a national wealth tax — policies that would directly cost him money. He's also a Jewish Democrat who has navigated his party’s shifting positions on Israel and Gaza and is a two-term governor who has drawn some public support as a potential 2028 presidential candidate.\n\n00:00 Intro \n01:22 The Illinois playbook against Trump \n03:23 Are Dems too timid in their pushback against Trump? \n05:07 Are our elections safe? \n06:17 Democrats and immigration \n09:27 A billionaire in favor of the wealth tax \n11:12 Is Gov.

We analyze why the FBI is still hiding crucial investigation files—like the 302 victim statements—while Ghislaine Maxwell receives a mysterious prison upgrade and offers conditional testimony. The names are finally out, but as this investigation proves, the cover-up is far from over.\n\nIn this video we ask who are: Les Wexner and Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem.  Since the video was released after being questioned by The Guardian - the Department of Justice said that four of the men have no connection to Epstein whatsoever, but rather appeared in a photo lineup assembled by the southern district of New York (SDNY). https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/13/four-men-unredacted-epstein-files-no-ties-ro-khanna\n\nPatrick's Books:\nStatistics For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3eerLA0\nDerivatives For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3cjsyPF\nCorporate Finance:  https://amzn.to/3fn3rvC \n\nWays To Support The Channel\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/PatrickBoyleOnFinance\nBuy Me a Coffee: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/patrickboyle\n\nVisit our website: https://www.onfinance.org\nFollow Patrick on Twitter Here: https://bsky.app/profile/pboyle.bsky.social\n\nBusiness Inquiries ➡️ sponsors@onfinance.org\n\nPatrick Boyle On Finance Podcast:\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/7uhrWlDvxzy9hLoW0EYf0b\nApple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/patrick-boyle-on-finance/id1547740313\nGoogle Podcasts: https://tinyurl.com/62862nve\n\nJoin this channel to support making this content:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCASM0cgfkJxQ1ICmRilfHLw/join</article>",

New structures of protection, security and dignity are emerging in Ukraine, while war shapes everyday life.\n\nAll of Ukraine has been at war since Russia’s full-scale attack in February 2022. It is a war whose repercussions are inescapable. And it is giving rise to new structures that every country would be happier to be able to live without. \n\nOne of these is a network of carers who risk their lives to evacuate elderly and sick people from homes that they are often unable to leave on their own. For some, it’s the first journey of their lives, for others, the last. \n\nA different team, of forensic scientists and military personnel, works to identify the remains of young soldiers. The bodies of the fallen are then transported across Ukraine to their families so that they can be buried in their hometowns. These tasks are all the more difficult, as they must be accomplished amidst the constant threat of bombs and drones. \n\nAs Russia's war of aggression rages against Ukraine, Yuri Rechinsky documents the everyday lives of those who are too weak to flee, or who care for the dead. He captures impressions of displacement, uncertainty, grief and loss, but also shows moments of solidarity, humor and resilience. \"Dear Beautiful Beloved\" takes a sober look at the survival strategies of people who retain their humanity in the midst of war.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #ukraine \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Sam, a software developer with 30 years of experience spanning companies from startups to AWS, shares his approach to applying clean architecture principles with Python while maintaining the language's pragmatic nature.\n\nThe conversation explores the balance between architectural rigor and practical development, the critical relationship between architecture and testability, and how clean architecture principles can enhance AI-assisted coding workflows. Sam emphasizes that clean architecture isn't an all-or-nothing approach but a set of principles that developers can adapt to their context, with the core value lying in thoughtful dependency management and clear domain modeling.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nSam Keen • Clean Architecture with Python • https://amzn.to/4pBT5g0\nFabrizio Romano &amp; Heinrich Kruger • Learn Python Programming • https://amzn.to/4myLBIt\nUncle Bob • Clean Code • https://amzn.to/3soPO6k\nUncle Bob • Clean Architecture • https://amzn.to/3x0gjBQ\nEric Evans • Domain-Driven Design • https://amzn.to/3tnGhwm\nNaomi Ceder • The Quick Python Book • https://amzn.to/3zwdDOa\nLuciano Ramalho • Fluent Python • https://amzn.to/3oSw2je\nDavid Beazley • Python Distilled (Developer's Library) • https://amzn.to/3QjNBEv\nSaleem Siddiqui • Learning Test-Driven Development • https://amzn.to/35OMb3n\nMaciej «MJ» Jedrzejewski • Master Software Architecture • https://leanpub.com/master-software-architecture\n\n\nBluesky (https://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com) \nTwitter (https://twitter.com/GOTOcon) \nInstagram (https://www.instagram.com/goto_con) \nLinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-) \nFacebook (https://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences) \n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

      "content": "<article>Liberland is a country that doesn’t officially exist. A country that promises voluntary taxes and a lean state. It’s a libertarian utopia that’s finding more supporters worldwide.\n\nAfter the Yugoslav Wars, the border between Serbia and Croatia along the Danube river remained unresolved. Vit Jedlička, a former politician from the Czech Republic, took advantage of this situation. He proclaimed the \"Free Republic of Liberland” on a seven-square-kilometer piece of land in 2015. \nLiberland is not internationally recognized, and its president is not allowed to set foot on the soil of his republic. Croatia sees the founding of Liberland as an attack on its territorial integrity.\nThe film accompanies Samuela Davidova, influencer, crypto enthusiast, and spokesperson for Liberland, and Liberland‘s president, Vit Jedlička, on a journey into two very different worlds. \nOn the one hand, they travel to Dubai, a glittering metropolitan meeting place for crypto-enthusiastic elites. Here, they want to recruit investors — and new citizens. \nAnd on the other hand, they travel to \"Ark Village,” the base camp of the Liberland community on Serbian soil. Here, they celebrate the 10th anniversary of Liberland.\nThe highlight of the journey is a boat trip to the shores of Liberland. Liberland claims to function as a meritocracy: taxes are voluntary, but those who invest more have a greater say. \nThe Liberland experiment may seem like an oddity, but it also raises serious questions: Cryptocurrencies and decentralized networks are undermining traditional national borders, and radical market ideas are gaining influence. Parallel structures are emerging. Critics see them as a threat to democracy. Others, of course, sense opportunity. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #liberland #crypto #cryptocurrency \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

If today's quantum computing manufacturers achieve their roadmaps, RSA-2048 will be broken within the next few years. Beyond a sea change for encrypted communications globally, this heralds the arrival of a new era of HPC workflows and the possibility of solving heretofore unsolvable problems.\n\nIn this talk, we will discuss the current state of research into what applications might come online first, the nascent ecosystems for delivering them, and the call to action to all developers to prepare for Q-Day and beyond!

While Osama bin Laden was the face of Al-Qaeda, many intelligence experts argue that Ayman al-Zawahiri was the true operational mastermind and strategic architect of the 9/11 attacks.\n\nIn this deep-dive documentary, we explore the chilling transformation of an Egyptian surgeon into the world’s most wanted man. We uncover how Ayman al-Zawahiri radicalized Bin Laden, merging his Egyptian Islamic Jihad group with Al-Qaeda to create a global insurgency. For over two decades, the CIA manhunt for \"The Doctor\" spanned continents, from the mountains of Tora Bora to his final days in a Kabul safehouse.\n\nWe break down the high-stakes counter-terrorism operation that ended with a precision drone strike on a balcony in Afghanistan. Was Zawahiri more dangerous than Bin Laden? How did he manage to evade justice for 21 years? Join us as we examine the legacy of the man who redefined modern warfare and the War on Terror.\n\nPlease subscribe here. https://www.youtube.com/@PeopleProfiles?sub_confirmation=1\nOur second channel. https://www.youtube.com/@PeopleProfilesExtra\nFollow us on Spotify. https://open.spotify.com/show/7fKALbrzEO9Q4VVvAwWHqL\nSupport us on Patreon https://patreon.com/thepeopleprofiles\nFollow us on Twitter. https://twitter.com/tpprofiles\n\nThanks for watching!

Around 40 to 60 volcanoes erupt every year.\n\nThe eruption of Mont Pelée on the Caribbean island of Martinique is considered the deadliest volcanic eruption of the 20th century. \nOn May 8, 1902, a pyroclastic flow wiped out the island's  cultural capital, Saint-Pierre. Known as the \"Paris of the Caribbean,” the city was located just seven kilometers away from the eruption, and was engulfed in a matter of minutes. An estimated 28,000 to 30,000 people were killed - they were burned, or suffocated. \nThe eruption came as a complete surprise to the islanders, as the signs of the volcano’s activity were ignored. \nThe disaster led to the establishment of the first volcanic observatories and marked the birth of volcanology. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #martinique #volcano \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

      "content": "<article>On 3 February 2026, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi was shot dead by four unknown gunmen in Zintan, Libya. This documentary was produced in 2023 and has not been updated for this reupload. It traces the turbulent life of the second son of the former Libyan dictator Muammar al-Gaddafi. In 2021, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi unexpectedly announced that he would run for the presidency in Libya.\n\nStatements from relatives and political actors paint a portrait of an unpredictable and fiercely determined man. Saif al-Islam Gaddafi’s presidential bid is a major challenge for Libya. The second son of the Libyan dictator Muammar Al Gaddafi has been convicted several times in Libya and is being prosecuted by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity.\n\nSaif al-Islam Gaddafi has had an unusual life: he grew up a clan that operated with a high degree of paranoia, suspecting conspiracies at work everwhere. Later, he led a playboy lifestyle in Europe, presenting himself to the world as a reformer. In the second phase of his life, which began with the Libyan revolution of 2011, he perpetuated the repressive style of his father’s regime. He was taken prisoner by anti-Gaddafi militias who made him stand trial -- but only allowed him to take part via videolink. \n\nEveryone in Libya is talking about him, all kinds of rumors are doing the rounds, his life is under threat. People say he’s a crazy, sick mystic who’s absconded into the desert. What’s making him run for president, despite the death threats? Does he stand a chance of winning? What does he know about the secret machinations of his father’s regime? His eventful life mirrors the current chaos in Libya: a country divided, with one government in the east and another in the west, rival militias vying for power and foreign states influencing the conflict. With statements from relatives and political actors, the film paints a portrait of Saif al-Islam Gaddafi - an unpredictable and fiercely determined survivor who is trying to find his way.  \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #libya #gaddafi \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

      "content": "<article>The mayor of Budapest, Gergely Karácsony, is facing criminal charges. In defiance of President Viktor Orbán’s ban, he organized a Pride march in the city on 28 June 2025—the largest such event ever held in Hungary.\n\nA few months earlier, the government had further tightened its controversial so-called Child Protection Law, which severely restricts the rights of the LGBTQ+ community in Hungary. The Pride event drew supporters both from within the country and abroad. \n\nOur documentary follows Béla, Zsu, and Norbert, who refuse to be intimidated and are prepared to publicly stand up against Orbán’s authoritarian government.\n\nPhotographer Béla Varadi is Roma and identifies as queer. He moved to London a few years after the right-wing nationalist Fidesz party came to power in 2010, making life increasingly hard for queer people and minorities. Béla visited Hungary in 2025 to take photos at the Pride march.\nIn Budapest, Béla meets up with Norbert, who is also Roma and queer. Norbert loves the city, but social tensions are proving challenging. Despite support from his family, Norbert is considering emigrating—a step many queer people in Hungary have already taken.\n\nZsu and Enikő are a young lesbian couple from Budapest. They recently bought a house in the countryside and plan to move there soon. But how will they fare as outsiders in a rural community?\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #LGBTQ+ #hungary \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

They discuss how AI tools are transforming developer workflows, making developers about 20% faster on simple tasks while being 19% slower on complex ones.\n\nThe conversation covers critical topics including code quality and trust, security concerns with AI-generated code, the importance of education and best practices, and how developer roles are shifting from syntax experts to system architects. Both experts emphasize that AI tools serve as amplifiers rather than replacements, with humans remaining essential in the loop for quality, security, and licensing compliance.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nPhil Winder • Reinforcement Learning • https://amzn.to/3t1S1VZ\nAlex Castrounis • AI for People and Business • https://amzn.to/3NYKKTo\nHolden Karau, Trevor Grant, Boris Lublinsky, Richard Liu &amp; Ilan Filonenko • Kubeflow for Machine Learning • https://amzn.to/3JVngcx\nKelleher &amp; Tierney • Data Science (The MIT Press Essential Knowledge series) • https://amzn.to/3AQmIRg\nLakshmanan, Robinson &amp; Munn • Machine Learning Design Patterns • https://amzn.to/2ZD7t0x\nLakshmanan, Görner &amp; Gillard • Practical Machine Learning for Computer Vision • https://amzn.to/3m9HNjP\n\n\nBluesky (https://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com) \nTwitter (https://twitter.com/GOTOcon) \nInstagram (https://www.instagram.com/goto_con) \nLinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-) \nFacebook (https://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences) \n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
