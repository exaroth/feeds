Exciting players like Vincent Keymer,\nArjun Erigaisi, Nodirbek Abdusattorov\nand Hans Niemann should light up the competition. World Champion Gukesh might be struggling\nat the moment but you'd want him in your tournament, especially\nas he only just missed out last year following a tie-break\nmatch with the eventual winner Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa. Dutch number one Anish Giri\nis the oldest player in the field at 32, he has enjoyed\none of his best years, the highlight of which was his\nqualification for the Candidates by taking clear first place in the Grand Swiss Tournament in Samarkand. \n</p>",
