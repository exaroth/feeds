      "content": " There were three decisive games in the first round of the Tata Steel Masters, there could even have\nbeen a couple more. The first story was that the start to the tournament was delayed, climate\nprotesters targeting Tata Steel drew attention to their heavy use of coal and the environmental\ndamage it causes. The start of play was delayed for a couple of hours but perhaps this disruption caused\nearly uncharacteristic blunders from a couple of the players. Hans Moke Niemann was still in theory\nwhen Vladimir Fedoseev miscalculated and he had to resign in 16 moves. Anish\nGiri played the inferior 21...Rb8 then just blundered a piece with 22...Bxd4 and also had to resign immediately.\nArjun Erigaisi beat defending champion Praggnanandhaa in 32 moves.\n<p>\nJavokhir Sindarov hung on to draw a lost position against \nWorld Champion Gukesh. Jorden Van Foreest drew a 27 move Petroff against Thai Dai Van Nguyen\nbut it might have been a very different matter if Nguyen had played 21...f5!.\nYagiz Kaan Erdogmus drew against Nodirbek Abdusattorov and Chithambaram Aravindh drew against \nMatthias Bluebaum.
