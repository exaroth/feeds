In every enterprise, value emerges from connections: customers to products, suppliers to shipments, molecules to targets. This talk introduces Relational Foundation Models (RFMs)—a new class of models that reason over interactions, not just data points. Drawing on advances in graph neural networks and large-scale ML systems, I’ll show how RFMs capture structure, enable richer reasoning, and deliver measurable business impact. Audience will learn where relational modeling drives the biggest wins, how to build the data backbone for it, and how to operationalize these models responsibly and at scale.</p><p>Jure Leskovec is the co-founder of Kumo.AI, an enterprise AI company pioneering AI foundation models that can reason over structured business data. He is also a Professor of Computer Science at Stanford University and a leading researcher in artificial intelligence, best known for pioneering Graph Neural Networks and creating PyG, the most widely used graph learning toolkit. Previously, Jure served as Chief Scientist at Pinterest and as an investigator at the Chan Zuckerberg BioHub. His research has been widely adopted in industry and government, powering applications at companies such as Meta, Uber, YouTube, Amazon, and more. He has received top awards in AI and data science, including the ACM KDD Innovation Award.</p><p>Please watch Jure's keynote:</p><p>~~~~~~~~ ✌️Connect With Us ✌️ ~~~~~~~</p>",

Following a childhood marred by illness and death, John earned a medical degree before returning to run the Sanitorium – a health and wellness centre – in his hometown, where he prescribed a variety of treatments both sensible and surreal, including a vegetarian diet, fresh air and exercise, hydrotherapy, and regular enemas! He was soon joined in his wellness venture by his business-minded brother Will, and together they invented a breakfast cereal we still know and love today: cornflakes. But after years of John’s bullying, Will left to launch his own business: the Kellogg company.</p><p>This episode tells the story of these battling brothers and their food and wellness business ventures, exploring everything from their sibling relationship and the competing stories they tell about the invention of their most famous cereal, to John’s Seventh Day Adventist beliefs and his pioneering wife with her meat-free meal replacements.</p><p>This is a radio edit of the original podcast episode.

After his father’s death the family grew up in rural poverty, but after a visit to Paris as a teenager, Dumas fell in love with the city and its theatre. Using his father’s connections he found a job there and was soon a successful playwright, before turning his attention to novels. He was a prolific author, writing such blockbusters as The Three Musketeers and The Count of Monte Christo. But amidst the writing, Dumas also found plenty of time for romantic dalliances, political entanglements, and global travel. This episode explores his extraordinary life and the incredible works of literature he created, set against the turbulent background of French politics in the years after the Napoleonic wars.</p><p>This is a radio edit of the original podcast episode.

Andy Pernsteiner joins the podcast to talk about what it actually takes to build production-grade AI systems that aren’t held together by brittle ETL scripts and data copies. He unpacks why unifying data - rather than moving it - is key to real-time, secure inference, and how event-driven, Kubernetes-native pipelines are reshaping the way developers build AI applications.

Theoretical astrophysicist Priya Natarajan explores whether JWST’s findings truly “blow up” our current understanding of the universe. What surprises Priya most? What new questions do these discoveries raise about dark matter, dark energy, and the Big Bang itself? Discover how JWST challenges existing cosmological models, what the early universe looked like in unprecedented detail, and why new data might redefine cosmic history.\n\nNatarajan's book, \"Mapping the Heavens: The Radical Scientific Ideas That Reveal the Cosmos\", is available for purchase now: https://amzn.to/4o9wR4l\n\nPriyamvada \"Priya\" Natarajan is a theoretical astrophysicist and professor in the departments of astronomy and physics at Yale University.

Materialism is counting on neuroscience to explain consciousness eventually, though this expectation is challenged because mental states seem so radically distinct from brain states.

      "content": "<p>Greg Jenner is joined in twelfth-century England by Dr Gabrielle Storey and comedian Cariad Lloyd to learn all about Empress Matilda and the medieval civil war known as the Anarchy.</p><p>A granddaughter of William the Conqueror, Matilda was born into England’s new Norman royal family. As a young girl she was used as a dynastic pawn by her father and sent to Germany to marry the Holy Roman Emperor. Here she was crowned empress and trained to rule.</p><p>When her younger brother died, followed by her husband, Matilda returned to England to take her place as her father’s heir. But after her father’s death she was beaten to the throne by her cousin Stephen, and so began the medieval civil war known as the Anarchy. Although Matilda ultimately lost, her son, Henry, was made Stephen’s heir, and he went on to rule with support and advice from his royal mother. So who was the real winner?</p><p>This episode traces Matilda’s dramatic life from daughter of a king to empress of Germany to queen-in-waiting of England. Along the way, we ask whether medieval sexism prevented her from taking the throne, and look at the ways a woman could rule in twelfth-century Europe.</p><p>This is a radio edit of the original podcast episode.
