Constructed in the early 15th century as the hidden heart of imperial power, it was a city within a city — sealed off from the world, governed by rigid ritual, political intrigue, and absolute authority.</p><p>How did a daring coup bring this colossal complex into existence? What was daily life really like behind its towering walls? And, how did it endure revolution, the rise and fall of dynasties, and catastrophe to become a symbol of China itself? Dan travels to the heart of Beijing to reveal its extraordinary story.&nbsp;</p><p>Produced by Mariana Des Forges and edited by Dougal Patmore</p>",

We'll dive into a real incident in a live Kubernetes environment with a Jenkins deployment, where the audience will see the AI agent in action, and how I prompt the agent to triage the incident, decide on the next steps, and act on it. Attendees will see how teams are cutting incident response time by utilizing Skyflo and it's human-in-the-loop approach.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\n    Learn how I cut down incident response time by 50% at Storylane by using an AI copilot\n    See how to use an AI copilot to speed up your Kubernetes, Argo, Helm, and Jenkins workflows\n    Understand the human-in-the-loop architecture of Skyflo and behind the scenes of how it works\n\n\nLive Demo Plan (70% time):\n1) Trigger a deployment on Jenkins using Skyflo\n2) Wait for the agent to report back with the status of the deployment\n3) The pipeline will succeed, but the deployment in Kubernetes will fail\n4) The agent will go through a process of discovery to find the root cause of the issue\n5) The agent will decide on the next steps and act on it\n\nUnder-the-Hood (30% time):\n\n    Brief Architecture Tour: How LangGraph and MCP are used to power the Skyflo agent\n    Custom MCP Server: kubectl/helm/argo/jenkins with typed parameters and validation\n    Streaming over SSE: Live events over Redis pub/sub and server-sent events over MCP\n\n---\n\nFull schedule, including slides and other resources:\nhttps://pretalx.devconf.info/devconf-in-2026/schedule/</article>",

      "content": "<p>Greg Jenner is joined in twentieth-century America by Dr Hannah Thuraisingam Robbins and comedian Desiree Burch to learn all about singer and Hollywood actress Lena Horne. Born into a middle class Black family in New York, a young Lena Horne soon followed in the footsteps of her actress mother and made her début at the famous Cotton Club aged only 16. After making her name as a singer and performer – and following the end of her tumultuous first marriage – Horne transferred to the west coast and bagged a Hollywood contract with MGM. There, she appeared in a number of classic films, including Stormy Weather and Cabin in the Sky. Over the next several years, she would also perform for the troops in the Second World War, fall in love with and marry a white composer and arranger, undertake an international tour, and become one of the most popular nightclub performers of the post-war era. But the racism of segregation-era America would also shape and limit the career of the woman known as ‘the first Black pin-up girl’, eventually leading her to the civil rights movement and Black activism in the 1960s. This episode traces Lena’s journey from young dancer to Hollywood star and renowned vocalist, along the way exploring her connections with figures including Billie Holliday and Martin Luther King Jr., and the injustice she spent so much of her career fighting against. \n \nIf you’re a fan of the history of cinema, mid-century America, and Black cultural icons, you’ll love our episode on Lena Horne.\n \nIf you want more musical icons with Desiree Burch, listen to our episodes on Paul Robeson, Josephine Baker, and Broadway Musicals. And for more film history, check out our episodes on the history of Bollywood and Sarah Bernhardt. \n \nYou’re Dead To Me is the comedy podcast that takes history seriously. Every episode, Greg Jenner brings together the best names in history and comedy to learn and laugh about the past.\n \nHosted by: Greg Jenner\nResearch by: Rosalyn Sklar\nWritten by: Dr Emmie Rose Price-Goodfellow, Dr Emma Nagouse, and Greg Jenner\nProduced by: Dr Emmie Rose Price-Goodfellow and Greg Jenner\nAudio Producer: Steve Hankey\nProduction Coordinator: Gill Huggett\nSenior Producer: Dr Emma Nagouse\nExecutive Editor: Philip Sellars</p>",

For users of screen readers, a missing announcement can mean confusion, distrust, or exclusion—yet the issue often remains invisible to most developers and designers. In this talk, we’ll explore how the absence of spoken feedback impacts accessibility, trust, and user experience, particularly for people navigating dynamic web interfaces. Drawing on real-world examples and practical scenarios, we’ll examine the root causes of “silent failures” (such as missing ARIA live regions, improper roles, stale live-region content) and discuss how seemingly minor markup decisions ripple into major accessibility barriers. Attendees will walk away with a clear framework for diagnosing and remedying these silent gaps: from audit strategies and end-user testing through to implementable code patterns, best practices for dynamic announcements, and how to integrate these into your UI/component library workflow. Whether you’re working in React, Web Components, or template-driven apps, you’ll gain actionable insights to ensure your components announce properly, your users feel heard, and your silent UI becomes truly inclusive.\n\n**Key take-aways:**\n\nWhy missing announcements matter: the user-experience impact beyond visual cues\n\nCommon pitfalls in dynamic content, live regions, and state changes\n\nA developer-friendly approach to audit, test, and fix announcement gaps\n\nHow to bake these practices into your component library or design system (for example, your team’s work with PatternFly and a custom theme)\n\nTips for collaboration between developers, UX designers, and accessibility testers to maintain accessibility as your product evolves\n---\n\nFull schedule, including slides and other resources:\nhttps://pretalx.devconf.info/devconf-in-2026/schedule/</article>",

While ArgoCD excels in managing applications within a single Kubernetes cluster, deploying and managing workloads across a fleet of clusters can introduce complexity. This session introduces the ArgoCD Agent, a powerful component designed to simplify and secure multi-cluster GitOps workflows. Modern enterprises run multiple clusters to balance compliance, resilience, and team autonomy across global operations. Attendees will learn what the ArgoCD Agent is, how it addresses challenges in a distributed environment, why it was developed, how it solves the scaling problem and see a live demonstration of it in action.

      "content": "<article>Title: MPI Meets Machine Learning: Unlocking PyTorch distributed for scaling AI workloads\n\nSpeaker(s): Mansi Agarwal\n\n---\n\nThe world of High-Performance Computing (HPC) and modern deep learning share a core DNA: the demand for near-linear scaling across hundreds of nodes. The core challenges remain the same—managing communication, balancing load, and coordinating resources but the abstractions and tooling are now defined by PyTorch Distributed.\n\nThis talk bridges the gap between traditional HPC paradigms and PyTorch's distributed computing ecosystem, designed specifically for deep learning workloads. We'll explore how familiar HPC concepts like collective operations, point-to-point communication, and process groups, manifest in PyTorch's distributed APIs. We'll discover how PyTorch builds upon battle-tested communication backends (NCCL, Gloo, MPI) while introducing novel primitives optimized for gradient synchronization and model parallelism. We then move beyond basic data parallelism to explore advanced memory-saving techniques like Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP), PyTorch's native answer to memory scaling and touch upon the nascent Tensor and Pipeline Parallelism APIs, demonstrating how these techniques compose to train massive models.\n\nThis session equips you with a comprehensive understanding of PyTorch's distributed architecture and reveals the inner workings of one of the most actively developed areas in modern ML infrastructure. By mapping distributed systems concepts to PyTorch's implementation, you'll see how familiar patterns from parallel computing manifest in PyTorch's ecosystem and where there is still room for innovation and improvement.\n\n---\n\nFull schedule, including slides and other resources:\nhttps://pretalx.devconf.info/devconf-in-2026/schedule/</article>",

Modern machine learning pipelines, from data collection and training to inference, are vulnerable to a wide range of adversarial manipulations. This talk provides a practitioner-focused exploration of how attackers compromise AI systems, using real research and case studies. Equally important, the session outlines defensive strategies grounded in current academic and industry work. \n\nAttendees will leave with a clear, realistic understanding of how adversarial attacks work, what defenses are actually effective today, and how to architect AI systems that remain trustworthy even under adversarial pressure.\n\n---\n\nFull schedule, including slides and other resources:\nhttps://pretalx.devconf.info/devconf-in-2026/schedule/</article>",

Federated Learning (FL) offers the following two advantages for model update: (1) It aggregates learnings from data patterns of fleet of vehicles to provide a sophisticated model that has been trained on wide range of scenarios. (2) It protects the privacy of the vehicle user without sending raw data to the central repository for model updates. With simulated vehicle data and Flower FL framework, a range prediction solution has been developed in a manner so as to easily port to an embedded edge Texas Instruments platform. The edge component can run as a quality managed (QM) component where as the central model aggregation can run as a containerized application on-prem or cloud where communication is established using gRPC.\n\n---\n\nFull schedule, including slides and other resources:\nhttps://pretalx.devconf.info/devconf-in-2026/schedule/</article>",

This is not just a low bandwidth problem. it is a fundamental design flaw.

This session shows how Terraform Actions, combined with the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform (AAP), transforms Terraform from a provisioning tool into an operational control plane. With Terraform managing infrastructure state and Ansible executing configuration and remediation workflows, teams can unify provisioning and operations into a single, governed workflow. Using the new Terraform action for AAP, a single terraform apply can trigger Event-Driven Ansible (EDA) to execute dynamic automation across Red Hat environments. The result is a repeatable, policy-driven model for Day-2 operations that reduces operational friction, eliminates ad-hoc access, and improves reliability at scale.\n\n**Target Audience:** Developers, Architects, DevOps, Security, SRE\n\n---\n\nFull schedule, including slides and other resources:\nhttps://pretalx.devconf.info/devconf-in-2026/schedule/</article>",

You’ll learn the key building blocks — jobs, groups, clients, and allocations — and see how Nomad’s minimalist architecture can run production-grade workloads on a single binary. We’ll end with a live demo of deploying and scaling a containerized web app, showing that “easy to run” doesn’t mean “less capable.”\n\n---\n\n### **Key Takeaways**\n\n- **Understand** Nomad’s lightweight architecture and how it differs from Kubernetes.  \n- **See** a live demo of deploying and scaling a containerized service in minutes.  \n- **Discover** where Nomad fits — from small teams to hybrid and edge environments.\n---\n\nFull schedule, including slides and other resources:\nhttps://pretalx.devconf.info/devconf-in-2026/schedule/</article>",

      "content": "<p>Greg Jenner is joined in 17th-century France by Dr Jonathan Spangler and comedian Tom Allen to learn all about Philippe, Duc d’Orléans, Louis XIV’s younger brother. King Louis XIV is one of the most famous monarchs in French history: the man who built and presided over the glittering court at Versailles, established himself as an absolute ruler, and whose 72-year reign is still the longest in European history. But what about his younger brother, Philippe? Who was the man who grew up and lived in the shadow of the Sun King? Raised to defer to his brother at all costs, his promising military career was cut short when it seemed like he might outshine Louis. When all eyes were on him as heir to the throne, he would wear dresses to provoke shock at courtly balls. He balanced his marriage to his witty German wife, Liselotte, with a decades-long relationship with his aristocratic male lover, the Chevalier de Lorraine – and other men of the court. And he maintained an image as a louche and irresponsible courtier while increasing his personal wealth through clever financial management. This episode explores the complexities and contradictions of Philippe’s life, and examines the difficult position of second sons in royal history.</p><p>If you’re a fan of royal sibling rivalries, the gossip and glamour of the French court, and queer history, you’ll love our episode on Philippe, Duc d’Orléans.</p><p>If you want more fascinating French royals, listen to our episodes on Catherine de Medici and Marie Antoinette. And for more LGBTQ+ history, check out our episodes on heretical lesbian nun Benedetta Carlini and the Bloomsbury Group.</p><p>You’re Dead To Me is the comedy podcast that takes history seriously.

From humble beginnings as simple pictograms tracking beer and grain, to the wedge-shaped signs that recorded myths, laws and epic tales long before the Bible, this episode explores how cuneiform spread across Sumer, Babylon, Assyria and Persia — and why these clay tablets remain one of archaeology’s richest windows into the ancient world.</p><p><strong>The World's Oldest Letters</strong></p><p>Presented by Tristan Hughes.
