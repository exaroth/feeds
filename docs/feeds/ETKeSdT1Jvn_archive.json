In 218 BCE, the Second Punic War began between the two powers, with the Carthaginian army led by a man named Hannibal Barca. Famously, Hannibal took his forces – including a contingent of war elephants – over the Alps and into Italy, finally marching on Rome itself. But eventually the Carthaginians were beaten back, and Hannibal ended his days in exile. In this episode we explore his epic life, from his childhood in Spain, to his tactical brilliance as a general, to his post-war career as a reformist politician.</p><p>This is a radio edit of the original podcast episode.

Our capacity, as conscious subjects, to make things explicit, so that what-is presents itself as “that-it-is” or “that-it-is-the-case” is at the heart of the mystery of human being. Philosopher Raymond Tallis explores how explicitness connects with fundamental ontological, metaphysical, and epistemological questions.\n\nTallis' latest book, \"Circling Round Explicitness: The Heart of the Mystery of Human Being\", is available for purchase now: https://amzn.to/3MUX5Ke\n\nRaymond Tallis trained in medicine at Oxford University and at St Thomas’ Hospital London before becoming Professor of Geriatric Medicine at the University of Manchester. He was elected a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences for his research in clinical neuroscience. He retired from medicine in 2006 to become a full-time writer. His books have ranged across many subjects—from philosophical anthropology to literary and cultural criticism—but all are characterized by a fascination for the infinite complexity of human lives and the human condition.

Currently part of the Kingdom of Denmark, an American takeover of Greenland would pose a serious crisis for NATO. But how much authority does Denmark have to protect Greenland? Why does Trump want it, and why are there already American troops&nbsp;&nbsp;stationed there?</p><p>In this episode, first released in January 2025, Dan and Professor Robert Rix from the University of Copenhagen trace the occupation of Greenland from the first Vikings to the arrival of the Americans in the mid-20th century, as well as explain its relationship with Denmark and explore previous attempts from American administrations to acquire it.</p><p>You can discover more about the history of Greenland in Robert's book 'The Vanished Settlers of Greenland: In Search of a Legend and Its Legacy'.&nbsp;</p><p>Produced by James Hickmann, Mariana Des Forges and edited by Dougal Patmore.</p>",

Fresh from its victory over Athens in the year 404, Sparta stood unrivalled. Yet within decades, its power would be shattered, its authority broken, and its golden age over. From decisive battles against resurgent rivals Thebes and Corinth to over-ambitious kings and a defining clash with a warband of sacred lovers, it is a gripping story of sky-high stakes and two-faced duplicity; of brutal power struggles and the cut-throat scramble to become the hegemonic power of ancient Greece.</p><p>Sparta vs Athens: The Greek World War</p><p>Presented by Tristan Hughes.

He talks about how his team developed the model, why it outperforms similar models from OpenAI and Google, and its wide use cases across different domains. </p><p>~~~~~~~~ ✌️Connect With Us ✌️ ~~~~~~~</p><p>Connect with Zengyi on LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/qinzy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">/qinzy/</a></p><p>[00:00] AI and Human Interaction</p><p>[08:19] Why Expensive Models Lost</p><p>[06:30] Bigger Models Are Lazy</p><p>[10:24] Training Computer-Use vs LLMs</p><p>[13:53] World Models and Sandboxes</p><p>[19:42] Dealing with Non-Stationary States</p><p>[23:56] Training with Software</p><p>[26:44] Sandbox Training Process</p><p>[41:33] Infrastructure for Computer Models</p>",

From their Yorkshire parsonage to their tiny books written in doll-sized handwriting, the Brontës were bursting with creativity. But their lives were also filled with heartbreak, illness and rejection.</p><p>Discover how the sisters used gender-neutral pen names to get published, how their brother Branwell tried (and mostly failed) to join in, and how their novels, Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights and Agnes Grey, were shaped by their real-life experiences as governesses, teachers and grieving siblings.</p><p>Expect parodies, sketch comedy, and a quiz to test what you’ve learned. There’s a mournful bell for every tragic twist and a goat who’s surprisingly good at literary criticism. It’s history with heart, humour and high production value.
