      "content": "<div>By  on 20 Jan 2026</div><p>\n  When web-based social networks started flourishing nearly two\n  decades ago, they were genuinely social networks.  You would sign up\n  for a popular service, follow people you knew or liked and read\n  updates from them.  When you posted something, your followers would\n  receive your updates as well.  Notifications were genuine.  The\n  little icons in the top bar would light up because someone had sent\n  you a direct message or engaged with something you had posted.\n  There was also, at the beginning of this millennium, a general sense\n  of hope and optimism around technology, computers and the Internet.\n  Social networking platforms were one of the services that were part\n  of what was called Web 2.0, a term used for websites built around\n  user participation and interaction.  It felt as though the\n  information superhighway was finally reaching its potential.  But\n  sometime between 2012 and 2016, things took a turn for the worse.\n</p><p>\n  First came the infamous infinite scroll.  I remember feeling uneasy\n  the first time a web page no longer had a bottom.  Logically, I knew\n  very well that everything a browser displays is a virtual construct.\n  There is no physical page.  It is just pixels pretending to be one.\n  Still, my brain had learned to treat web pages as objects with a\n  beginning and an end.  The sudden disappearance of that end\n  disturbed my sense of ease.\n</p><p>\n  Then came the bogus notifications.  What had once been meaningful\n  signals turned into arbitrary prompts.  Someone you followed had\n  posted something unremarkable and the platform would surface it as a\n  notification anyway.  It didn't matter whether the notification was\n  relevant to me.  The notification system stopped serving me and\n  started serving itself.  It felt like a violation of an unspoken\n  agreement between users and services.  Despite all that, these\n  platforms still remained social in some diluted sense.  Yes, the\n  notifications were manipulative, but they were at least about people\n  I actually knew or had chosen to follow.  That, too, would change.\n</p><p>\n  Over time, my timeline contained fewer and fewer posts from friends\n  and more and more content from random strangers.  Using these\n  services began to feel like standing in front of a blaring\n  loudspeaker, broadcasting fragments of conversations from all over\n  the world directly in my face.  That was when I gave up on these\n  services.  There was nothing social about them anymore.  They had\n  become .  My attention is precious to me.  I\n  cannot spend it mindlessly scrolling through videos that have\n  neither relevance nor substance.\n</p><p>\n  But where one avenue disappeared, another emerged.  A few years ago,\n  I stumbled upon Mastodon and it reminded me of the early days of\n  Twitter.  Back in 2006, I followed a small number of folks of the\n  nerd variety on Twitter and received genuinely interesting updates\n  from them.  But when I log into the ruins of those older platforms\n  now, all I see are random videos presented to me for reasons I can\n  neither infer nor care about.  Mastodon, by contrast, still feels\n  like social networking in the original sense.  I follow a small\n  number of people I genuinely find interesting and I receive their\n  updates and only their updates.  What I see is the result of my own\n  choices rather than a system trying to capture and monetise my\n  attention.  There are no bogus notifications.  The timeline feels\n  calm and predictable.  If there are no new updates from people I\n  follow, there is nothing to see.  It feels closer to how social\n  networks used to work originally.  I hope it stays that way.\n</p>",

The attackers overwhelmed it by a factor of 39 to 1.<p>For three consecutive years, I2P has been hit with Sybil attacks every February.

The assumption was wrong.</p><p>The attacker was identified as the Kimwolf botnet, an IoT botnet that infected millions of devices including streaming boxes and consumer routers throughout late 2025. Kimwolf is the same operation behind the record-setting 31.4 terabit per second DDoS attack in December 2025. The operators admitted on Discord they accidentally disrupted I2P while attempting to use the network as backup command-and-control infrastructure after security researchers destroyed over 550 of their primary C2 servers.</p><p>The I2P development team responded by shipping version 2.11.0 just six days after the attack began. The release includes hybrid ML-KEM plus X25519 post-quantum encryption enabled by default, making I2P one of the first production anonymity networks to ship post-quantum cryptography to all users. Additional Sybil mitigations, SAMv3 API upgrades, and infrastructure improvements were included.</p></p>",

      "url": "https://boristane.com/blog/how-i-use-claude-code/",

      "content": "<p>I’ve been using <a href=\"https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code\">Claude Code</a> as my primary development tool for approx 9 months, and the workflow I’ve settled into is radically different from what most people do with AI coding tools. Most developers type a prompt, sometimes use plan mode, fix the errors, repeat. The more terminally online are stitching together ralph loops, mcps, gas towns (remember those?), etc. The results in both cases are a mess that completely falls apart for anything non-trivial.</p><p>The workflow I’m going to describe has one core principle: <strong>never let Claude write code until you’ve reviewed and approved a written plan</strong>. This separation of planning and execution is the single most important thing I do. It prevents wasted effort, keeps me in control of architecture decisions, and produces significantly better results with minimal token usage than jumping straight to code.</p><pre>flowchart LR\n    R[Research] --&gt; P[Plan]\n    P --&gt; A[Annotate]\n    A --&gt;|repeat 1-6x| A\n    A --&gt; T[Todo List]\n    T --&gt; I[Implement]\n    I --&gt; F[Feedback &amp; Iterate]</pre><p>Every meaningful task starts with a deep-read directive. I ask Claude to thoroughly understand the relevant part of the codebase before doing anything else. And I always require the findings to be written into a persistent markdown file, never just a verbal summary in the chat.</p><blockquote><p>read this folder in depth, understand how it works deeply, what it does and all its specificities. when that’s done, write a detailed report of your learnings and findings in research.md</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>study the notification system in great details, understand the intricacies of it and write a detailed research.md document with everything there is to know about how notifications work</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>go through the task scheduling flow, understand it deeply and look for potential bugs. there definitely are bugs in the system as it sometimes runs tasks that should have been cancelled. keep researching the flow until you find all the bugs, don’t stop until all the bugs are found. when you’re done, write a detailed report of your findings in research.md</p></blockquote><p>Notice the language: , , , . This isn’t fluff. Without these words, Claude will skim. It’ll read a file, see what a function does at the signature level, and move on. You need to signal that surface-level reading is not acceptable.</p><p>The written artifact () is critical. It’s not about making Claude do homework. It’s my review surface. I can read it, verify Claude actually understood the system, and correct misunderstandings before any planning happens. If the research is wrong, the plan will be wrong, and the implementation will be wrong. Garbage in, garbage out.</p><p>This is the most expensive failure mode with AI-assisted coding, and it’s not wrong syntax or bad logic. It’s implementations that work in isolation but break the surrounding system. A function that ignores an existing caching layer. A migration that doesn’t account for the ORM’s conventions. An API endpoint that duplicates logic that already exists elsewhere. The research phase prevents all of this.</p><p>Once I’ve reviewed the research, I ask for a detailed implementation plan in a separate markdown file.</p><blockquote><p>I want to build a new feature &lt;name and description&gt; that extends the system to perform &lt;business outcome&gt;. write a detailed plan.md document outlining how to implement this. include code snippets</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>the list endpoint should support cursor-based pagination instead of offset. write a detailed plan.md for how to achieve this. read source files before suggesting changes, base the plan on the actual codebase</p></blockquote><p>The generated plan always includes a detailed explanation of the approach, code snippets showing the actual changes, file paths that will be modified, and considerations and trade-offs.</p><p>I use my own  plan files rather than Claude Code’s built-in plan mode. The built-in plan mode sucks. My markdown file gives me full control. I can edit it in my editor, add inline notes, and it persists as a real artifact in the project.</p><p><strong>One trick I use constantly:</strong> for well-contained features where I’ve seen a good implementation in an open source repo, I’ll share that code as a reference alongside the plan request. If I want to add sortable IDs, I paste the ID generation code from a project that does it well and say “this is how they do sortable IDs, write a plan.md explaining how we can adopt a similar approach.” Claude works dramatically better when it has a concrete reference implementation to work from rather than designing from scratch.</p><p>But the plan document itself isn’t the interesting part. The interesting part is what happens next.</p><p>This is the most distinctive part of my workflow, and the part where I add the most value.</p><pre>flowchart TD\n    W[Claude writes plan.md] --&gt; R[I review in my editor]\n    R --&gt; N[I add inline notes]\n    N --&gt; S[Send Claude back to the document]\n    S --&gt; U[Claude updates plan]\n    U --&gt; D{Satisfied?}\n    D --&gt;|No| R\n    D --&gt;|Yes| T[Request todo list]</pre><p>After Claude writes the plan, I open it in my editor and <strong>add inline notes directly into the document</strong>. These notes correct assumptions, reject approaches, add constraints, or provide domain knowledge that Claude doesn’t have.</p><p>The notes vary wildly in length. Sometimes a note is two words: “not optional” next to a parameter Claude marked as optional. Other times it’s a paragraph explaining a business constraint or pasting a code snippet showing the data shape I expect.</p><p>Some real examples of notes I’d add:</p><ul><li><em>“use drizzle:generate for migrations, not raw SQL”</em> — domain knowledge Claude doesn’t have</li><li><em>“no — this should be a PATCH, not a PUT”</em> — correcting a wrong assumption</li><li><em>“remove this section entirely, we don’t need caching here”</em> — rejecting a proposed approach</li><li><em>“the queue consumer already handles retries, so this retry logic is redundant. remove it and just let it fail”</em> — explaining why something should change</li><li><em>“this is wrong, the visibility field needs to be on the list itself, not on individual items. when a list is public, all items are public. restructure the schema section accordingly”</em> — redirecting an entire section of the plan</li></ul><p>Then I send Claude back to the document:</p><blockquote><p>I added a few notes to the document, address all the notes and update the document accordingly. don’t implement yet</p></blockquote><p><strong>This cycle repeats 1 to 6 times.</strong> The explicit  guard is essential. Without it, Claude will jump to code the moment it thinks the plan is good enough. It’s not good enough until I say it is.</p><p>The markdown file acts as  between me and Claude. I can think at my own pace, annotate precisely where something is wrong, and re-engage without losing context. I’m not trying to explain everything in a chat message. I’m pointing at the exact spot in the document where the issue is and writing my correction right there.</p><p>This is fundamentally different from trying to steer implementation through chat messages. The plan is a structured, complete specification I can review holistically. A chat conversation is something I’d have to scroll through to reconstruct decisions. The plan wins every time.</p><p>Three rounds of “I added notes, update the plan” can transform a generic implementation plan into one that fits perfectly into the existing system. Claude is excellent at understanding code, proposing solutions, and writing implementations. But it doesn’t know my product priorities, my users’ pain points, or the engineering trade-offs I’m willing to make. The annotation cycle is how I inject that judgement.</p><p>Before implementation starts, I always request a granular task breakdown:</p><blockquote><p>add a detailed todo list to the plan, with all the phases and individual tasks necessary to complete the plan - don’t implement yet</p></blockquote><p>This creates a checklist that serves as a progress tracker during implementation. Claude marks items as completed as it goes, so I can glance at the plan at any point and see exactly where things stand. Especially valuable in sessions that run for hours.</p><p>When the plan is ready, I issue the implementation command. I’ve refined this into a standard prompt I reuse across sessions:</p><blockquote><p>implement it all. when you’re done with a task or phase, mark it as completed in the plan document. do not stop until all tasks and phases are completed. do not add unnecessary comments or jsdocs, do not use any or unknown types. continuously run typecheck to make sure you’re not introducing new issues.</p></blockquote><p>This single prompt encodes everything that matters:</p><ul><li>: do everything in the plan, don’t cherry-pick</li><li><em>“mark it as completed in the plan document”</em>: the plan is the source of truth for progress</li><li><em>“do not stop until all tasks and phases are completed”</em>: don’t pause for confirmation mid-flow</li><li><em>“do not add unnecessary comments or jsdocs”</em>: keep the code clean</li><li><em>“do not use any or unknown types”</em>: maintain strict typing</li><li><em>“continuously run typecheck”</em>: catch problems early, not at the end</li></ul><p>I use this exact phrasing (with minor variations) in virtually every implementation session. By the time I say “implement it all,” every decision has been made and validated. The implementation becomes mechanical, not creative. This is deliberate. <strong>I want implementation to be boring</strong>. The creative work happened in the annotation cycles. Once the plan is right, execution should be straightforward.</p><p>Without the planning phase, what typically happens is Claude makes a reasonable-but-wrong assumption early on, builds on top of it for 15 minutes, and then I have to unwind a chain of changes. The “don’t implement yet” guard eliminates this entirely.</p><h2>Feedback During Implementation</h2><p>Once Claude is executing the plan, my role shifts from architect to supervisor. My prompts become dramatically shorter.</p><pre>flowchart LR\n    I[Claude implements] --&gt; R[I review / test]\n    R --&gt; C{Correct?}\n    C --&gt;|No| F[Terse correction]\n    F --&gt; I\n    C --&gt;|Yes| N{More tasks?}\n    N --&gt;|Yes| I\n    N --&gt;|No| D[Done]</pre><p>Where a planning note might be a paragraph, an implementation correction is often a single sentence:</p><ul><li><em>“You didn’t implement the  function.”</em></li><li><em>“You built the settings page in the main app when it should be in the admin app, move it.”</em></li></ul><p>Claude has the full context of the plan and the ongoing session, so terse corrections are enough.</p><p>Frontend work is the most iterative part. I test in the browser and fire off rapid corrections:</p><ul></ul><p>For visual issues, I sometimes attach screenshots. A screenshot of a misaligned table communicates the problem faster than describing it.</p><p>I also reference existing code constantly:</p><ul><li><em>“this table should look exactly like the users table, same header, same pagination, same row density.”</em></li></ul><p>This is far more precise than describing a design from scratch. Most features in a mature codebase are variations on existing patterns. A new settings page should look like the existing settings pages. Pointing to the reference communicates all the implicit requirements without spelling them out. Claude would typically read the reference file(s) before making the correction.</p><p>When something goes in a wrong direction, I don’t try to patch it. I revert and re-scope by discarding the git changes:</p><ul><li><em>“I reverted everything. Now all I want is to make the list view more minimal — nothing else.”</em></li></ul><p>Narrowing scope after a revert almost always produces better results than trying to incrementally fix a bad approach.</p><h2>Staying in the Driver’s Seat</h2><p>Even though I delegate execution to Claude, <strong>I never give it total autonomy over what gets built</strong>. I do the vast majority of the active steering in the  documents.</p><p>This matters because Claude will sometimes propose solutions that are technically correct but wrong for the project. Maybe the approach is over-engineered, or it changes a public API signature that other parts of the system depend on, or it picks a more complex option when a simpler one would do. I have context about the broader system, the product direction, and the engineering culture that Claude doesn’t.</p><pre>flowchart TD\n    P[Claude proposes changes] --&gt; E[I evaluate each item]\n    E --&gt; A[Accept as-is]\n    E --&gt; M[Modify approach]\n    E --&gt; S[Skip / remove]\n    E --&gt; O[Override technical choice]\n    A &amp; M &amp; S &amp; O --&gt; R[Refined implementation scope]</pre><p><strong>Cherry-picking from proposals:</strong> When Claude identifies multiple issues, I go through them one by one: <em>“for the first one, just use Promise.all, don’t make it overly complicated; for the third one, extract it into a separate function for readability; ignore the fourth and fifth ones, they’re not worth the complexity.”</em> I’m making item-level decisions based on my knowledge of what matters right now.</p><p> When the plan includes nice-to-haves, I actively cut them. <em>“remove the download feature from the plan, I don’t want to implement this now.”</em> This prevents scope creep.</p><p><strong>Protecting existing interfaces:</strong> I set hard constraints when I know something shouldn’t change: <em>“the signatures of these three functions should not change, the caller should adapt, not the library.”</em></p><p><strong>Overriding technical choices:</strong> Sometimes I have a specific preference Claude wouldn’t know about: <em>“use this model instead of that one”</em> or <em>“use this library’s built-in method instead of writing a custom one.”</em> Fast, direct overrides.</p><p>Claude handles the mechanical execution, while I make the judgement calls. The plan captures the big decisions upfront, and selective guidance handles the smaller ones that emerge during implementation.</p><p>I run research, planning, and implementation in a  rather than splitting them across separate sessions. A single session might start with deep-reading a folder, go through three rounds of plan annotation, then run the full implementation, all in one continuous conversation.</p><p>I am not seeing the performance degradation everyone talks about after 50% context window. Actually, by the time I say “implement it all,” Claude has spent the entire session building understanding: reading files during research, refining its mental model during annotation cycles, absorbing my domain knowledge corrections.</p><p>When the context window fills up, Claude’s auto-compaction maintains enough context to keep going. And the plan document, the persistent artifact, survives compaction in full fidelity. I can point Claude to it at any point in time.</p><h2>The Workflow in One Sentence</h2><p>Read deeply, write a plan, annotate the plan until it’s right, then let Claude execute the whole thing without stopping, checking types along the way.</p><p>That’s it. No magic prompts, no elaborate system instructions, no clever hacks. Just a disciplined pipeline that separates thinking from typing. The research prevents Claude from making ignorant changes. The plan prevents it from making wrong changes. The annotation cycle injects my judgement. And the implementation command lets it run without interruption once every decision has been made.</p><p>Try my workflow, you’ll wonder how you ever shipped anything with coding agents without an annotated plan document sitting between you and the code.</p>",

What’s great about Electron is it allows you to  build one desktop app that supports Windows, Mac, and Linux. Plus it lets developers use existing web app code to get started. It’s great for teams big and small. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_software_using_Electron?wprov=sfti1\">Many apps you probably use every day are built with Electron</a>: Slack, Discord, VS Code, Teams, Notion, and more.</p><p>There are downsides though. Electron apps are bloated; each runs its own Chromium engine. The minimum app size is usually a couple hundred megabytes. They are often laggy or unresponsive. They don’t integrate well with OS features.</p><p>(These last two issues  be addressed by smart development and OS-specific code, but they rarely are. The benefits of Electron (one codebase, many platforms, it’s just web!) don’t incentivize optimizations outside of HTML/JS/CSS land.)</p><p>But these downsides are dramatically outweighed by the ability to build and maintain one app, shipping it everywhere.</p><p>On the surface, this ability should render Electron’s benefits obsolete! Rather than write one web app and ship it to each platform, we should write  and use coding agents to ship  code to each platform. If this ability is real and adopted, users get snappy, performant, native apps from small, focused teams serving a broad market.</p><p>But we’re still leaning on Electron. Even Anthropic, one of the leaders in AI coding tools, who keeps publishing flashy agentic coding achievements, still uses Electron in the Claude desktop app. And it’s slow, buggy, and bloated app.</p><p><em>So why are we still using Electron and not embracing the agent-powered, spec driven development future?</em></p><p>For one thing, coding agents are  good at the first 90% of dev. But that last bit – nailing down all the edge cases and continuing support once it meets the real world – remains hard, tedious, and requires plenty of agent hand-holding.</p><p>Anthropic’s <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-c-compiler\">Rust-base C compiler</a> slammed into this wall, after screaming through the bulk of the tests:</p><blockquote><p>The resulting compiler has nearly reached the limits of Opus’s abilities. I tried (hard!) to fix several of the above limitations but wasn’t fully successful. New features and bugfixes frequently broke existing functionality.</p></blockquote><p>The resulting compiler  impressive, given the time it took to deliver it and the number of people who worked on it, but it is largely unusable. That last mile is .</p><p>And this gets even worse once a program meets the real world. Messy, unexpected scenarios stack up and development never really ends. Agents make it easier, sure, but hard product decisions become challenged and require human decisions.</p><p>Further, with 3 different apps produced (Mac, Windows, and Linux) the surface area for bugs and support increases 3-fold. Sure, there are local quirks with Electron apps, but most of it is mitigated by the common wrapper. Not so with native!</p><p>A good test suite and spec  enable the Claude team to ship a Claude desktop app native to each platform. But the resulting overhead of that last 10% of dev and the increased support and maintenance burden will remain.</p><p>For now, Electron still makes sense. Coding agents are amazing. But the last mile of dev and the support surface area remains a real concern.</p>",

      "content": "<p>In the Rust Programming Language Community Server, there’s tag named  which links to an <a href=\"https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/\">article</a> about the concept of avoiding validation functions and encoding invariants in the type level instead. I usually recommend it to beginners/intermediates to Rust who are struggling with designing APIs.</p><p>The only problem is that it uses Haskell to explain its concepts.</p><p>Yeah, it’s , but for beginners unfamiliar with the functional paradigm, it might not be so approachable. And so I wanted so write a blog post about this pattern but in a rather Rust-centric way. So let’s start!</p><section><p>One basic example I can give is a function that divides a number by another number.</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"rust\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>This is fine, but unfortunately it can panic when  has the value of zero:</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"rust\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><div><figure><pre data-language=\"rust\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>That’s fine and dandy if we want erroneous values to fail loudly at runtime, but what if we want stronger guarantees? This is especially important when some operations don’t fail loudly, like the following:</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"rust\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><div><figure><pre data-language=\"rust\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>There’s no error! But do we want that?</p><p>We could add an  in the  function to emulate typical integer division behavior.</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"rust\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><div><figure><pre data-language=\"rust\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>Cute! But there’s still a problem of running into panics only at runtime. My beef with Python (or any other dynamic language for that matter) is that a lot of errors only arises when you run the program. That’s why they’re adding typechecking to these languages: people want to bubble some mistakes to compile-time (or typecheck-time, whatever). We can use Rust’s rich type system to communicate these errors at build time.</p><p>One way, which I think is the more common way as people are more familiar with it is the idea of fallible functions, which return either an  or a .</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"rust\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>This is a fine way to do things, as it communicates that (1) the function can fail, and (2) you can handle the failing case after.   To me, the function’s invariants ( must not be zero) is encoded after-the-fact, aka in the return type . This implies to me that the invariants could be encoded before-the-fact, aka in the function parameters. But what would that look like?</p><p>Enter the newtype pattern.</p><p>Say, let’s have a type that is something like , but it’s guaranteed to never be zero. We’ll name it :</p><p>This struct only contains a single field . The semantics of the type understood from the name is that it’s just like a normal , but does not allow the value of zero. How do we guarantee this? Since rust does encapsulation at the module level, we make this type public while have its field private.</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"rust\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>Then, the only way to construct this type is via a fallible constructor function:</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"rust\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>Remember to add some convenience traits.</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"rust\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>We can then use this in our  function.</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"rust\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>There is an interesting implication in this pattern.</p><p>In the second version of , we changed the return type from  to  just to avoid the panics. As described in the original article by Alexis King, this is a  of the return type, and the function’s promise. We temper the caller’s expectation by saying that yes, this function can fail in some way, and you have to account for that. And that weakening is described in the type system via the  enum.</p><p>In the third iteration of , we change our perspective and ask ourselves “instead of weakening the return type, what if we  the function parameters?” We communicated that via accepting a . Instead of having the validation code in our functions, we instead push that responsibility to the caller. The validation now happens before the function execution.</p><p>To see the advantage of pushing the validation forward to the user, let’s say we have another function like so:</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"rust\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>This function can fail if the discriminant is negative (which we will be ignoring in this contrived example), and if  is zero. The two ways of going about this can be written as follows:</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"rust\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>The  version has me duplicating the conditional for at least two different functions, which might be icky if you are a DRY-hard. Also, not only the function has to validate if the float can be zero, the  must then validate again by matching on the returned . That seems redundant. It would be ideal if we only need to check only once.</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"rust\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>The  version can help with that as validation happens before, and happens once, instead of twice.</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"rust\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>Moving away from the , let’s now use an example from the original blog post, converted to Rust:</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"rust\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><ol><li>We checked if  is empty in the  function. Then, we still had to “check” it again in the  function by matching on . The  was known to be nonempty, do we have to check it again? Consequently, doesn’t this have an impact on performance, especially if we have to check it again and again and again?</li><li>The original post raised a good point about resilience to refactors. If for some reason the  gets refactored out for some reason, and the programmer forgot to update , then the  branch might actually get reached and explode your computer or whatever.</li></ol><p>If we instead had a special  newtype (well, not exactly special) where its existence guarantees that the Vec is never empty, we could do</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"rust\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>In this context, we can call  and  functions, since they validate and convert the less semantic type to a type with more meaning imbued into it. That is, nonzeroness of a float and nonemptiness of a  is now encoded into a type. You can just see the word  and therefore understand that going forward it is always be an  that is never zero.</p><p>Validation and checking functions on the other hand, well, just validate the value and leave the type as that. If I have a  function, then there’s not really much of a readable difference between an  that has  called on it versus and an  that hasn’t.</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"rust\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>By taking advantage of the existence of a nominative type system, we can communicate that this  is not zero by  it to a new type, as opposed to just  it. If you only validate it, then you still can’t tell if  was nonzero unless you dig through the code. However, if you parsed it, you can say it’s always be nonzero if you see  in your code.</p></section><section><p>Of course, the above examples are very much contrived, but is there an instance where creating newtypes is helpful? Yes. In fact, most people have used it. It’s called a .</p><p>If we dig into the internals, <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/alloc/string.rs.html#360\"></a> is just a newtype over the  type:</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"rust\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>It’s parsing function is <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/struct.String.html#method.from_utf8\"></a>, which contains the validation code for checking if the byte vector is valid UTF-8.</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"rust\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>So instead of passing around a  around and validating all over the place, just parse into a  and you can be assured with having a type-safe  with all the convenience functions you can get.</p><p>Another example is . In Python,  simply give you a dictionary. This is fine, especially if the data is sufficiently arbitrary, but if you have a schema and a type system, it’s better to let the type system do the work of parsing .</p><p>In our terminology, validation looks like this:</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"rust\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>That’s two s! One for checking if the string is valid json and the other is for checking if the  field exists. Now consider this example where we use the parsing mechanic instead via types and the  derive macro.</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"rust\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>Since we deserialized the  file into an actual type, we can safely make these guarantees:</p><ol><li>The  and  always exist in the  string we parse.</li><li> always has an integer value.</li><li> is always an array of three integers.</li><li> will never panic since all elements of an array is always initialized, and indexing into the first the element of a nonzero-length array will always be successful.</li></ol><p>The only point of failure here is pushed upfront, where the  happens. After that point, there’s not really much error handling to be done here, since the validation is now represented at the type level instead of at the function level.</p></section><section><h2>Maxims of Type Driven Design<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"https://www.harudagondi.space/blog/parse-dont-validate-and-type-driven-design-in-rust/#maxims-of-type-driven-design\"> #</a></h2><p>With that said, what lessons can we learn from here? Turns out, most functional language programmers already have learned several lessons, and Rust is not much different in terms of applying such FP concepts to the language.</p><p>First lesson we can learn is that <strong>we should make illegal states unrepresentable</strong>.</p><p>To refer back to the  and  examples, we say the state of being zero is illegal for  and the state of being empty is illegal for . And as illegal states, they cannot be represented in such types. That’s why the only constructors available for these types are fallible; the value either parsed successfully, or it failed and does not return the new types.</p><p>If we only do validation, like checking if  is nonzero for example, then the illegal state can still be represented. There’s a small possible that the value is zero, especially after some refactors when the conditional checks are accidentally or intentionally removed in some places.</p><section><p>This reminds me of how other languages use integers as sentinel values. Given this code snippet from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinel_value\">Wikipedia</a>:</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"c\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>The error is returned as , since indexing arrays is only valid for nonnegative integers. Seems weird as (1) the numbers -2 and below  exist, but not actually valid, and (2) treating certain values as special seems too error-prone, as in the future it could be that negative number can become semantically valid.</p></section><p>Second lesson we can learn is that <strong>proving invariants should be done as early as possible</strong>.</p><p>There’s this concept called <a href=\"http://langsec.org/papers/langsec-cwes-secdev2016.pdf\"></a> where the linked paper describes it as follows:</p><blockquote><p>Shotgun Parsing: Shotgun parsing is a programming antipattern whereby parsing and input-validating code is mixed with and spread across processing code—throwing a cloud of checks at the input, and hoping, without any systematic justification, that one or another would catch all the “bad” cases.</p></blockquote><p>Essentially, it describes the problem of usage of data without previous validation of its entirety of data. You could act on a part of the data that is validated beforehand, but discover that another part of the data is invalid.</p><p>The paper mentions <a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-0752\">CVE-2016-0752</a>, which is a bug that allows attackers to read arbitrary files because you can use  in the input. The paper argues that treating validation as emergent and not deliberate can lead to security bugs like these.</p><p>If we treat validation as deliberate, then it should happen as early as possible and as comprehensive as possible. By parsing first, every invariant can be proven first before executing on said data.</p><section><p>I remember this <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ViPNHMSUcog\">video</a> about lambda calculus. It concludes that types can be represented as propositions in logic, and terms as proofs. I recommend watching the video, as it is eye-opening to me and maybe it can help you realize some things too.</p><p>Fundamentally, if your program typechecks properly, then you can say that the proof is correct. Thank you Curry-Howard Correspondence. There are proof assistant programming languages that can help with this like <a href=\"https://lean-lang.org/\">Lean</a> and <a href=\"https://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php\">Agda</a>, but you can emulate this in Rust anyway. That’s how some weird libraries like the <a href=\"https://crates.io/crates/typenum\">typenum</a> crate work.</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"rust\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>This is a simple <a href=\"https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2024&amp;gist=ed2a899a9bd9806f655df5623581ad97\">program</a> in Rust where I check if  is equal to . Obviously this is not correct, and so it will appropriately give you a compile error.</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"rust\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>So sad that the error message is dogshit. Such is life.</p></section></section><section><p>There are some recommendations I usually say to people on the RPLCS discord server, adapted from the original blog post.</p><p>First, just because a function accepts a type doesn’t mean you have to use it in your structs, nor have to perpetually represent it as that type. For example, let’s say we have a third party library function that looks like this.</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"rust\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>You  have to store  in your / struct like <code>App { lightbulb_state: bool }</code>. That’s confusing. I’d rather have you define a separate enum with more semantics imbued into it, like:</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"rust\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>Yeah, people can say it gets more verbose, but I rather care more about correctness instead. Sorry.</p><p>Second, I sometimes get suspicious about these kind of APIs:</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"rust\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>If I see the function body does not do anything side-effectful, then it’s probable that parsing can help here turning  into a more structured datatype. And even for side-effectful stuff, there are some types that better represent certain situations, like infinite loop function representing their return types as  or <code>Result&lt;Infallible, MyError&gt;</code>.</p></section><section><p>I love creating more types. Five million types for everyone please.</p><p>I think it’s interesting that there’s a lot of instances where types drive the design of Rust programs. Like how  has four layers of newtypes plus an additional field.  generate anonymous structs in their  macros.  is a macro crate that converts functions into compile-time builders via types.</p><p>Of course, not everything is solvable via types. But personally I think pushing your verification code to types can help your code become clearer and more robust. Let the type system handle the validation for you. It exists, so might as well use it to its fullest extent.</p><p>I’d like to thank Alexis King for this <a href=\"https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/\">article</a> where I first encountered this idea. I’d love to follow up on this topic with an extension on this <a href=\"https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2020/11/01/names-are-not-type-safety/\">sequel</a>, and maybe recontextualizing in Rust via the  keyword would be helpful.</p><p>Of course, newtyping is not the answer to all problems. Due to lack of ergonomic features to allow newtyping—like <a href=\"https://crates.io/crates/delegate\">delegation</a>—many people are somewhat averse to using the pattern. Nevertheless, if someone made a good enough RFC I’d be happy to see it happen.</p><p>Using the type system as a compile-time checker because I want the compiler to help me write my programs is very nice. You should take advantage of the type system too, not many languages have it as good as Rust :)</p></section><h3>Liked this blog post and want some more?

      "content": "<p>or how to generate 17000 tokens per second?</p><p>February 22, 2026 · 4 min read</p><p><b>A startup called <a href=\"https://taalas.com/\">Taalas</a>, recently released an ASIC chip running Llama 3.1 8B (3/6 bit quant) at an inference rate of 17,000 tokens per seconds. That's like writing around 30 A4 sized pages in one second. </b> They <a href=\"https://taalas.com/the-path-to-ubiquitous-ai/\">claim</a> it's 10x cheaper in ownership cost than GPU based inference systems and is 10x less electricity hog. And yeah, about 10x faster than state of art inference.</p><p>I tried to read through their blog and they've literally \"hardwired\" the model's weights on chip. Initially, this didn't sound intuitive to me.\nComing from a Software background, with hobby-ist understanding of LLMs, I couldn't wrap my head around how you just \"print\" a LLM onto a chip. So, I decided to dig into multiple blogposts, LocalLLaMA discussions, and hardware concepts. It was much more interesting than I had thought. Hence this blogpost.</p><p>Taalas is a 2.5 year old company and it's their first chip. Taalas's chip is a fixed-function ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit). Kinda like a CD-ROM/Game cartridge, or a printed book, it only holds one model and cannot be rewritten.</p><h2>HOW NVIDIA GPUs process stuff? (Inefficiency 101)</h2><p>LLMs consist of sequential Layers. For eg. Llama 3.1 8B has 32 layers. The task of each layer is to further refine the input. Each layer is essentially large weight matrices (the model's 'knowledge').</p><p>When a user inputs a prompt, it is converted into an vector of numbers aka embeddings. \nOn a normal GPU, the input vector enters the compute cores. Then GPU fetches the Layer 1 weights from VRAM/HBM (GPU's RAM) , does matrix multiplication, stores the intermediate results(aka activations) back in VRAM. Then it fetches the Layer 2 weights, and previous result, does the math, and saves it to VRAM again.\nThis cycle continues till 32nd layer just to generate a single token. Then, to generate the next token, the GPU repeats this entire 32-layer journey.</p><img src=\"https://www.anuragk.com/blog/staticFiles/Taalas/GPUInference.png\" alt=\"GPU Inference\"><p>So, due to this constant back-and-forth the memory bus induces latency and consumes significant amounts of energy. This is the memory bandwidth bottleneck, sometimes loosely called the Von Neumann bottleneck or the \"memory wall.\"</p><p>Taalas sidesteps this wall entirely. They just engraved the 32 layers of Llama 3.1 sequentially on a chip. Essentially, the model's weights are physical transistors etched into the silicon.</p><img src=\"https://www.anuragk.com/blog/staticFiles/Taalas/TaalasWay.png\" alt=\"The Taalas Way\"><p>Importantly, they also <a href=\"https://www.eetimes.com/taalas-specializes-to-extremes-for-extraordinary-token-speed/\">claim</a> to have invented a hardware scheme where they can store a 4-bit data and perform the multiplication related to it using a single transistor. I will refer it as their 'magic multiplier'</p><p>Now, when the user's input arrives, it gets converted into a vector, and flows into physical transistors making up Layer1. It does multiplication via their 'magic multiplier' and instead of result being saved in a VRAM, the electrical signal simply flows down physical wires into the Layer 2 transistors (via pipeline registers from what I understand). The data streams continuously through the silicon until the final output token is generated.</p><h2>So, they don't use any RAM?</h2><p>They don't use external DRAM/HBM, but they do use a small amount of on-chip SRAM.\nWhy SRAM? Due to cost and complexity, manufacturers don't mix DRAM and logic gates. That's why GPUs have separate VRAM. (Also SRAM isn't facing supply chain crisis, DRAM is). \nTaalas uses this on-chip SRAM for the KV Cache (the temporary memory/context window of an ongoing conversation) and to hold LoRA adapters for fine tuning.</p><h2>But isn't fabricating a custom chip for every model super expensive?</h2><p>Technically yes, I read lots of comments saying that.\nBut Taalas designed a base chip with a massive, generic grid of logic gates and transistors. To map a specific model onto the chip, they only need to customize the top two layers/masks. While it's still slow, but it's much faster than building chips from ground up. \nIt took them two months, to develop chip for Llama 3.1 8B. In the AI world where one week is a year, it's super slow. But in a world of custom chips, this is supposed to be insanely fast.</p><p>As someone stuck running local models on a laptop without a massive GPU, I am keeping my fingers crossed for this type of hardware to be mass-produced soon.</p>",

      "content": "<p>On February 20, 2026, at 17:48 UTC, Cloudflare experienced a service outage when a subset of customers who use Cloudflare’s Bring Your Own IP (BYOIP) service saw their routes to the Internet withdrawn via Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).</p><p>The issue was not caused, directly or indirectly, by a cyberattack or malicious activity of any kind. This issue was caused by a change that Cloudflare made to how our network manages IP addresses onboarded through the BYOIP pipeline. This change caused Cloudflare to unintentionally withdraw customer prefixes.</p><p>For some BYOIP customers, this resulted in their services and applications being unreachable from the Internet, causing timeouts and failures to connect across their Cloudflare deployments that used BYOIP. The website for Cloudflare’s recursive DNS resolver (1.1.1.1) saw 403 errors as well. The total duration of the incident was 6 hours and 7 minutes with most of that time spent restoring prefix configurations to their state prior to the change.</p><p>Cloudflare engineers reverted the change and prefixes stopped being withdrawn when we began to observe failures. However, before engineers were able to revert the change, ~1,100 BYOIP prefixes were withdrawn from the Cloudflare network. Some customers were able to restore their own service by using the Cloudflare dashboard to re-advertise their IP addresses. We resolved the incident when we restored all prefix configurations.</p><p>We are sorry for the impact to our customers. We let you down today. This post is an in-depth recounting of exactly what happened and which systems and processes failed. We will also outline the steps we are taking to prevent outages like this from happening again.</p><div><h2>How did the outage impact customers?</h2><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-outage-february-20-2026/#how-did-the-outage-impact-customers\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a></div><p>This graph shows the amount of prefixes advertised by Cloudflare during the incident to a BGP neighbor, which correlates to impact as prefixes that weren’t advertised were unreachable on the Internet:</p><p>Out of the total 6,500 prefixes advertised to this peer, 4,306 of those were BYOIP prefixes. These BYOIP prefixes are advertised to every peer and represent all the BYOIP prefixes we advertise globally.&nbsp;  </p><p>During the incident, 1,100 prefixes out of the total 6,500 were withdrawn from 17:56 to 18:46 UTC. Out of the 4,306 total BYOIP prefixes, 25% of BYOIP prefixes were unintentionally withdrawn. We were able to detect impact on one.one.one.one and revert the impacting change before more prefixes were impacted. At 19:19 UTC, we published guidance to customers that they would be able to self-remediate this incident by going to the Cloudflare dashboard and re-advertising their prefixes.</p><p>Cloudflare was able to revert many of the advertisement changes around 20:20 UTC, which caused 800 prefixes to be restored. There were still ~300 prefixes that were unable to be remediated through the dashboard because the service configurations for those prefixes were removed from the edge due to a software bug. These prefixes were manually restored by Cloudflare engineers at 23:03 UTC.&nbsp;</p><p>This incident did not impact all BYOIP customers because the configuration change was applied iteratively and not instantaneously across all BYOIP customers. Once the configuration change was revealed to be causing impact, the change was reverted before all customers were affected.&nbsp;</p><p>The impacted BYOIP customers first experienced a behavior called <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/going-bgp-zombie-hunting/\"></a>. In this state, end user connections traverse networks trying to find a route to the destination IP. This behavior will persist until the connection that was opened times out and fails. Until the prefix is advertised somewhere, customers will continue to see this failure mode. This loop-until-failure scenario affected any product that uses BYOIP for advertisement to the Internet. Additionally, visitors to one.one.one.one, the website for Cloudflare’s recursive DNS resolver, were met with HTTP 403 errors and an “Edge IP Restricted” error message. DNS resolution over the 1.1.1.1 Public Resolver, including DNS over HTTPS, was not affected. A full breakdown of the services impacted is below.</p><div><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>There was also a set of customers who were unable to restore service by toggling the prefixes on the Cloudflare dashboard. As engineers began reannouncing prefixes to restore service for these customers, these customers may have seen increased latency and failures despite their IP addresses being advertised. This was because the addressing settings for some users were removed from edge servers due an issue in our own software, and the state had to be propagated back to the edge.&nbsp;</p><p>We’re going to get into what exactly broke in our addressing system, but to do that we need to cover a quick primer on the Addressing API, which is the underlying source of truth for customer IP addresses at Cloudflare.</p><div><h2>Cloudflare’s Addressing API</h2><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-outage-february-20-2026/#cloudflares-addressing-api\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a></div><p>The Addressing API is an authoritative dataset of the addresses present on the Cloudflare network. Any change to that dataset is immediately reflected in Cloudflare's global network. While we are in the process of improving how these systems roll out changes as a part of <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/fail-small-resilience-plan/\"></a>, today customers can configure their IP addresses by interacting with public-facing APIs which configure a set of databases that trigger operational workflows propagating the changes to Cloudflare’s edge. This means that changes to the Addressing API are immediately propagated to the Cloudflare edge.</p><p>Advertising and configuring IP addresses on Cloudflare involves several steps:</p><ul><li><p>Customers signal to Cloudflare about advertisement/withdrawal of IP addresses via the Addressing API or BGP Control</p></li><li><p>The Addressing API instructs the machines to change the prefix advertisements</p></li><li><p>BGP will be updated on the routers once enough machines have received the notification to update the prefix</p></li><li><p>Finally, customers can configure Cloudflare products to use BYOIP addresses via <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/byoip/service-bindings/\"></a> which will assign products to these ranges</p></li></ul><p>The Addressing API allows us to automate most of the processes surrounding how we advertise or withdraw addresses, but some processes still require manual actions. These manual processes are risky because of their close proximity to Production. As a part of <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/fail-small-resilience-plan/\"></a>, one of the goals of remediation was to remove manual actions taken in the Addressing API and replace them with safe workflows.</p><div><h2>How did the incident occur?</h2><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-outage-february-20-2026/#how-did-the-incident-occur\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a></div><p>The specific piece of configuration that broke was a modification attempting to automate the customer action of removing prefixes from Cloudflare’s BYOIP service, a regular customer request that is done manually today. Removing this manual process was part of our Code Orange: Fail Small work to push all changes toward safe, automated, health-mediated deployment. Since the list of related objects of BYOIP prefixes can be large, this was implemented as part of a regularly running sub-task that checks for BYOIP prefixes that should be removed, and then removes them. Unfortunately, this regular cleanup sub-task queried the API with a bug.</p><p>Here is the API query from the cleanup sub-task:</p><pre><code> resp, err := d.doRequest(ctx, http.MethodGet, `/v1/prefixes?pending_delete`, nil)\n</code></pre><p>And here is the relevant part of the API implementation:</p><pre><code>\tif v := req.URL.Query().Get(\"pending_delete\"); v != \"\" {\n\t\t// ignore other behavior and fetch pending objects from the ip_prefixes_deleted table\n\t\tprefixes, err := c.RO().IPPrefixes().FetchPrefixesPendingDeletion(ctx)\n\t\tif err != nil {\n\t\t\tapi.RenderError(ctx, w, ErrInternalError)\n\t\t\treturn\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tapi.Render(ctx, w, http.StatusOK, renderIPPrefixAPIResponse(prefixes, nil))\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n</code></pre><p>Because the client is passing pending_delete with no value, the result of Query().Get(“pending_delete”) here will be an empty string (“”), so the API server interprets this as a request for all BYOIP prefixes instead of just those prefixes that were supposed to be removed. The system interpreted this as all returned prefixes being queued for deletion. The new sub-task then began systematically deleting all BYOIP prefixes and all of their related dependent objects including <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/byoip/service-bindings/\"></a>, until the impact was noticed, and an engineer identified the sub-task and shut it down.</p><div><h3>Why did Cloudflare not catch the bug in our staging environment or testing?</h3><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-outage-february-20-2026/#why-did-cloudflare-not-catch-the-bug-in-our-staging-environment-or-testing\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a></div><p>Our staging environment contains data that matches Production as closely as possible, but was not sufficient in this case and the mock data we relied on to simulate what would occur was insufficient. </p><p>In addition, while we have tests for this functionality, coverage for this scenario in our testing process and environment was incomplete. Initial testing and code review focused on the BYOIP self-service API journey and were completed successfully. While our engineers successfully tested the exact process a customer would have followed, testing did not cover a scenario where the task-runner service would independently execute changes to user data without explicit input.</p><div><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-outage-february-20-2026/#why-was-recovery-not-immediate\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a></div><p>Affected BYOIP prefixes were not all impacted in the same way, necessitating more intensive data recovery steps. As a part of Code Orange: Fail Small, we are building a system where operational state snapshots can be safely rolled out through health-mediated deployments. In the event something does roll out that causes unexpected behavior, it can be very quickly rolled back to a known-good state. However, that system is not in Production today.</p><p>BYOIP prefixes were in different states of impact during this incident, and each of these different states required different actions:</p><ul><li><p>Most impacted customers only had their prefixes withdrawn. Customers in this configuration could go into the dashboard and toggle their advertisements, which would restore service.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Some customers had their prefixes withdrawn and some bindings removed. These customers were in a partial state of recovery where they could toggle some prefixes but not others.</p></li><li><p>Some customers had their prefixes withdrawn and all service bindings removed. They could not toggle their prefixes in the dashboard because there was no <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/byoip/service-bindings/\"></a> (Magic Transit, Spectrum, CDN) bound to them. These customers took the longest to mitigate, as a global configuration update had to be initiated to reapply the service bindings for all these customers to every single machine on Cloudflare’s edge.</p></li></ul><div><h3>How does this incident relate to Code Orange: Fail Small?</h3><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-outage-february-20-2026/#how-does-this-incident-relate-to-code-orange-fail-small\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a></div><p>The change we were making when this incident occurred is part of the Code Orange: Fail Small initiative, which is aimed at improving the resiliency of code and configuration at Cloudflare. As a brief primer of the <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/fail-small-resilience-plan/\"></a> initiatives, the work can be divided into three buckets:</p><ul><li><p>Require controlled rollouts for any configuration change that is propagated to the network, just like we do today for software binary releases.</p></li><li><p>Change our internal “break glass” procedures and remove any circular dependencies so that we, and our customers, can act fast and access all systems without issue during an incident.</p></li><li><p>Review, improve, and test failure modes of all systems handling network traffic to ensure they exhibit well-defined behavior under all conditions, including unexpected error states.</p></li></ul><p>The change that we attempted to deploy falls under the first bucket. By moving risky, manual changes to safe, automated configuration updates that are deployed in a health-mediated manner, we aim to improve the reliability of the service.</p><p>Critical work was already ongoing to enhance the Addressing API's configuration change support through staged test mediation and better correctness checks. This work was ongoing in parallel with the deployed change. Although preventative measures weren't fully deployed before the outage, teams were actively working on these systems when the incident occurred. Following our Code Orange: Fail Small promise to require controlled rollouts of any change into Production, our engineering teams have been reaching deep into all layers of our stack to identify and fix all problematic findings. While this outage wasn't itself global, the blast radius and impact were unacceptably large, further reinforcing Code Orange: Fail Small as a priority until we have re-established confidence in all changes to our network being as gradual as possible. Now let’s talk more specifically about improvements to these systems.</p><div><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-outage-february-20-2026/#remediation-and-follow-up-steps\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a></div><div><h3>API schema standardization</h3><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-outage-february-20-2026/#api-schema-standardization\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a></div><p>One of the issues in this incident is that the pending_delete flag was interpreted as a string, making it difficult for both client and server to rationalize the value of the flag. We will improve the API schema to ensure better standardization, which will make it much easier for testing and systems to validate whether an API call is properly formed or not. This work is part of the third Code Orange workstream, which aims to create well-defined behavior under all conditions.</p><div><h3>Better separation between operational and configured state</h3><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-outage-february-20-2026/#better-separation-between-operational-and-configured-state\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a></div><p>Today, customers make changes to the addressing schema that are persisted in an authoritative database, and that database is the same one used for operational actions. This makes manual rollback processes more challenging because engineers need to utilize database snapshots instead of rationalizing between desired and actual states. We will redesign the rollback mechanism and database configuration to ensure that we have an easy way to roll back changes quickly and also to introduce layers between customer configuration and Production.  </p><p>We will snap shot the data that we read from the database and are applying to Production, and apply those snapshots in the same way that we deploy all our other Production changes, mediated by health metrics that can automatically stop the deployment if things are going wrong. This means that the next time we have a problem where the database gets changed into a bad state, we can near-instantly revert individual customers (or all customers) to a version that was working.</p><p>While this will temporarily block our customers from being able to make direct updates via our API in the event of an outage, it will mean that we can continue serving their traffic while we work to fix the database, instead of being down for that time. This work aligns with the first and second Code Orange workstreams, which involves fast rollback and also safe, health-mediated deployment of configuration.</p><div><h3>Better arbitrate large withdrawal actions</h3><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-outage-february-20-2026/#better-arbitrate-large-withdrawal-actions\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a></div><p>We will improve our monitoring to detect when changes are happening too fast or too broadly, such as withdrawing or deleting BGP prefixes quickly, and disable the deployment of snapshots when this happens. This will form a type of circuit breaker to stop any out-of-control process that is manipulating the database from having a large blast radius, like we saw in this incident.</p><p>We also have some ongoing work to directly monitor that the services run by our customers are behaving correctly, and those signals can also be used to trip the circuit breaker and stop potentially dangerous changes from being applied until we have had time to investigate. This work aligns with the first Code Orange workstream, which involves safe deployment of changes.</p><p>Below is the timeline of events inclusive of deployment of the change and remediation steps: </p><div><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>We deeply apologize for this incident today and how it affected the service we provide our customers, and also the Internet at large. We aim to provide a network that is resilient to change, and we did not deliver on our promise to you. We are actively making these improvements to ensure improved stability moving forward and to prevent this problem from happening again.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I first took a polygraph when I applied to the CIA and went through the applicant screening process.</p><p>To prepare for the test, I read  by David T. Lykken. The book described the use of control versus relevant questions as well as <a href=\"https://antipolygraph.org/faq.shtml#q5\">countermeasures</a> such as butt-clenching. I had no desire to use countermeasures. I wasn't out to \"beat\" the test: I wanted to understand how it worked. A future colleague at the Agency advised me, \"Spill your guts.\" I thought it was good advice, and I planned to follow it.</p><p>I knew I was taking a risk in applying to the Agency. I worked as a defense contractor on a project for the CIA, so I already held CIA TS/SCI clearances. If I failed the polygraph, I could lose my clearances, and I might lose my job as well.</p><p>I flew to Northern Virginia for two days of pre-employment screening. A bus took us from the hotel to a nondescript building in Vienna. The examiner was a young woman. She asked me to sign a consent form and told me not to talk about the polygraph with anyone else.</p><p>In the pretest interview, the examiner asked, \"Did you make any false statements on your application?\" I said, \"Yes. Under height and weight, I put 130 lb. I actually weigh 134 lbs.\" She laughed. Then she asked if I'd read about polygraphs. I said I'd just finished She claimed she'd never heard of it. I was surprised. It's an important book about her field, I would have thought all polygraphers knew of it.</p><p>She wired me up, and the polygraph began. My hand turned purple, which hurt terribly. My body twitched from the exaggerated stillness the test required. Halfway through, the examiner left the room, saying she had to show the charts to her supervisor. I came to think of this as the <i>What will it take to get you to buy the car? </i>part of the test. I waited twenty minutes or so, resisting the urge to press my nose against the one-way mirror and peer into it through cupped hands.</p><p>The examiner came back. \"You're having a problem with one of the questions. Do you know which one?\" I had no idea. I'd answered all of them truthfully. She said, \"How about, 'Have you ever lied to your boss?'\" I said I hadn't. She pressed me until I came up with an occasion when I'd passed my boss in the hall. She said, \"How are you?\" and I said, \"Fine.\" But I wasn't fine, I was in the middle of a cancer scare.</p><p>I failed the poly and was told to come back the next day. I couldn't understand why I hadn't passed. I'd spilled my guts, and I hadn't used countermeasures.</p><p>On the bus back to the hotel, a woman was sobbing, \"Do they count something less than $50 as theft?\" I felt bad for her because she was crying, but I wondered why a petty thief thought she could get into the Agency.</p><p>That evening, the other applicants went to the nearby Tysons Corner mall to go shopping. I didn't feel festive enough to join them so I withdrew to my room. I ordered from room service but couldn't eat my dinner. I sat by the window for hours, looking into the darkness. She'd seen something inside me I hadn't known about. I'd always thought I was a good person. Now I wasn't sure.</p><p>The next morning, I rode back to the same crumbling building where I'd been polygraphed the day before. The examiner said, \"Now that you've had a chance to think about it, is there anything you'd like to say?\" He didn't need to ask me twice. \"You bet there is. I did my part, now I expect you to do yours.\" It wasn't until late that afternoon, when I was waiting for my plane at Dulles, that I realized, \"Is there anything you'd like to say?\" does not mean, \"Please tell us all our faults.\"</p><p>The examiner wired me up. He began with what he called a calibration test. He took a piece of paper and wrote the numbers one through five in a vertical column. He asked me to pick a number. I picked three. He drew a square around the number three, then taped the paper to the back of a chair where I could see it. I was supposed to lie about having selected the number three.</p><p>The test began. He asked, \"Is the number one? Is the number two? Is the number three?\" I said \"No,\" and butt-clenched. \"Nice strong response!\" he said.</p><p>I wasn't hiding anything, so I had no reason to use countermeasures. On the other hand, the analytical part of me enjoyed poking at the test to figure out how it worked. And I was still mad about having failed the previous day, so I was messing with him. Curiosity satisfied, I didn't try the butt-clench again, not on that day or ever.</p><p>During the real test, the examiner said, \"Your breathing is unnatural.\" He described a kid in little league who kept swinging the bat wrong, and then suddenly got it. If I just kept trying, I could get it too. It took almost four hours, but by the end of the session, he told me I'd passed. I'd just cleared the last hurdle to joining the CIA.</p><p>I entered on duty and began a week of orientation. On the first morning, we introduced ourselves and said a few words about what we'd be doing at the Agency. Four guys sitting together at a table up front identified themselves as polygraphers. Everyone else in the room hissed. It wasn't friendly teasing, either. At lunch, no one would sit with them.</p><p>A few years into my Agency career, I took a battery of vocational and aptitude tests including the MMPI, a personality inventory. The MMPI results came back, and they said I fell on the extreme end of the honesty spectrum, or in the words of the Agency psychiatrist, \"You're honest to the point of being naïve.\" I was kind of offended. <i>Who are you calling naïve?</i> On the other hand, it was nice to have that in my official file.</p><h2>Five Year Reinvestigation</h2><p>CIA employees were required to take a polygraph every five years. We all did it, but there was a lot of complaining.</p><p>I never heard that anyone worried about losing their job to the poly. It was said that <a href=\"https://antipolygraph.org/cgi-bin/forums/YaBB.pl?num=1122195854\">new applicants failed in large numbers</a>, but once you were in, you were in. The re-poly could be unpleasant, though. If you failed, you had to keep taking it. It was said that there was an upper manager who just couldn't pass, no matter how many times he tried. After something like seven attempts, Polygraph gave up and stopped calling him back. The manager remained in his job.</p><p>We weren't supposed to discuss the polygraph among ourselves, but of course we did. When people came back from a poly, they talked about how it had gone. A woman who'd never seen an illegal drug in her life was accused of being a major drug user. Someone who hated computers so much that she had the secretary print out her emails so she could read them was interrogated for hours about hacking into Agency networks.</p><p>A pattern emerged. In a normal polygraph, there was often a gross mismatch between a person and the accusations made against them. I don't think the officials at Polygraph had any idea how unintentionally humorous this was. Not to the person it happened to, of course, but the rest of us found it hysterically funny.</p><p>Once, the examiner got in my face and shouted, \"Admit it, you're deeply in debt. Creditors are pounding on your door!\" I said. \"You've just revealed to me that you haven't bothered to pull my credit report. Are you lazy, or are you cheap?\" I offered to pay the $15 fee myself, but he didn't take me up on it.</p><p>Another time, the examiner accused me of working for a foreign intelligence service and traveling overseas to meet my handler. I rolled my eyes. \"Do you want to see my passport? It's been expired for nine years.\" No, he didn't want to see my passport.</p><p>I told my office mates I'd figured out why the accusations were so consistently off-the-wall. Polygraph must have a question of the day. Everyone who went in on Monday would be accused of dealing drugs. Tuesday was espionage day, Wednesday was marital infidelity day, and so on.</p><p>Then Aldrich Ames was arrested, and <a href=\"https://antipolygraph.org/cgi-bin/forums/YaBB.pl?num=1022112660\">polygraphs became more brutal</a>. People who'd never had trouble passing were being called back two and three times. Thank you, Mr. Ames.</p><p>I overheard a fragment of conversation at CIA Headquarters, \"I thought I was a good person, but after that last poly, I'm not so sure.\" It was hard on people.</p><p>Because of Ames, the Agency introduced a policy of random polygraphs. I knew someone who completed a five year poly. A few months later, he was called back for a random one.</p><p>I'd been at the Agency for ten years when I went through the reinvestigation poly again.</p><p>The test was administered by an inexperienced young woman. In the pretest interview, she asked me a question. I answered truthfully. She asked again as if she was looking for a better answer.  It made me furious.</p><p>Well into the session, she said I was failing. I was so frustrated, I started to cry. I knew I could pass it if I just had enough time, but she had to run an errand. She failed me and ended the session early.</p><p>I wrote a letter of complaint to the Chief of Polygraph saying I didn't like the way I'd been treated. He sent me a letter of apology. He said he'd reviewed the tapes and that he was sorry about the abuse. He said the polygrapher had been reprimanded.</p><p>I was surprised to get a response of any kind, but a letter of apology was astonishing. Although the cynical part of me might call it a \"please don't sue me\" letter.</p><p>But I was also puzzled. The apology was for the wrong thing. The Director seemed to think I'd gone through a particularly abusive polygraph. I hadn't. It was a perfectly ordinary polygraph, no different from any other. I just wrote to say that I didn't like polygraphs.</p><p>I had to take the test again because I'd failed the first one. The second examiner was experienced and had a mild disposition. I passed without difficulty.</p><p>Over the course of many years at CIA, I formed an impression that a typical polygraph involves an inexperienced examiner who grills you harshly and then fails you, followed by a re-poly with a more experienced examiner who guides you through it with no fuss. I've had two polygraphs in which I passed on the first try. On both occasions, an experienced examiner conducted the test.</p><p>I worked at CIA for eleven years. It was a terrific experience, and I count those years as among the happiest in my life. I left only because I got married and had a baby. CIA is many things, but family friendly is not one of them.</p><p>I joined a small defense contractor known for its work-life balance. The company supported most of the three-letter agencies, and I settled into doing the same sort of work I'd done before.</p><p>My first assignment was on a National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) project. The NRO clearances required a poly, which I agreed to. The test was administered by a woman with many years' experience. She told me I'd passed. It's possible to have a polygraph that isn't confrontational and doesn't leave you feeling violated. It's rare, though.</p><p>I'd been supporting an FBI project for several years when the phone rang in the kitchen. Someone from the FBI asked me to come in for a routine polygraph, a requirement to keep my clearances up to date.</p><p>To prepare, I read the 2002 <a href=\"https://www.nap.edu/read/10420/\">National Academy of Sciences report</a>. It was an eye-opener, even though it confirmed what I'd already begun to suspect, that the polygraph didn't work.</p><p>I arrived for my polygraph appointment, which would be administered in a building across the street from my children's orthodontist.</p><p>I stood in the marble lobby, waiting for the examiner to come and collect me. The 2002 NAS report made me cynical. In the interview room, I thought, \"Don't look at the man behind the curtain.\"</p><p>The examiner asked if I'd ever visited the anti-polygraph sites online. I said yes, that's where I found the 2002 NAS report. He said he'd never heard of it. He also said there was no such a thing as a control question. I hate being lied to; it makes me angry.</p><p>In the pretest interview, he asked how many polygraphs I'd had before this one. I wasn't sure, but I thought it was probably six or seven. He asked what medications I took. I listed everything, including a cortisone cream for a patch of eczema on my hand. He went on and on about my skin condition. <i>What does this have to do with national security, and why is it any of your business?</i> Maybe violating people's boundaries is a way to establish dominance.</p><p>The examiner wired me up, and we did the card trick. He drew a vertical column of numbers, told me to pick one, drew a box around it, and pinned it up where I could see it.</p><p>It occurred to me that we were playing a guessing game in which the examiner knew the answer before the game began. I'd have been more impressed if he'd had to discover my number using only the polygraph equipment and/or his ability to read people. I was tempted to suggest it, but I didn't think the idea would be well received.</p><p>The test proceeded normally. The examiner left the room. When he came back, he didn't meet my eyes, and the muscles of his face were tight. \"The test shows deception.\" He was right. I had been deceptive, but only about one thing. I hadn't told him I knew the polygraph didn't work.</p><p>The examiner hammered on me to come clean. I kept repeating, \"No, I can't think of anything else.\" I was tempted to make something up, just to make it stop, but I'm not comfortable lying.</p><p>At the end of the interview, the examiner looked at me, gloating. \"You claim you've taken seven polygraphs before today, but later, you said it was only six.\" <i>That's all you've got on me? I'm underwhelmed.</i></p><p>Being able to recognize interrogation techniques didn't make me immune to them. Exhausted, I hung my head, feeling like he'd broken me under interrogation. I've always found the shame of being broken was the worst thing about being polygraphed.</p><p>A few days later, I was still seriously rattled. I didn't realize how badly the polygraph had affected me until I plowed through a red light and almost hit another car. I'd never run a red light before. I couldn't think what had gotten into me.</p><p>I told a relative I'd had a really hard time with the polygraph. There was an embarrassed silence, followed by a rapid change of subject. <i>What did you do wrong, and why don't you own up to it?</i> This from someone who's known me from birth and has always taken my side. It shows how strongly people in our culture believe in the polygraph.</p><p>I wrote to my congressman and asked him to support legislation banning the polygraph. I said it was a civil rights issue to subject an entire workforce to a brutal police-style interrogation in the absence of probable cause, especially if they might be harmed by it.</p><p>Although I failed the FBI polygraph, I remained on the project.</p><p>Much to my surprise, I was granted additional clearances and assigned to more highly classified work than I'd been doing before the polygraph.</p><p>The work dried up, and I moved on to something else. Seven months after the failed FBI poly, I was summoned to FBI Headquarters \"to talk about your polygraph.\"</p><p>It took several hours to drive downtown and find a place to park. I found FBI headquarters. Two burly agents met me at the door. I wondered if they had the power to arrest me. My hands shook. It was like a scene from a movie where government officials are trying to be intimidating. It worked. As we walked across the lobby, I thought I was going to faint.</p><p>They escorted me upstairs. Neither of them spoke. They took me to a small room. A folder lay open on a desk. Papers spilled from it.</p><p>I said, \"Does it matter that I was laid off the project four months ago?\"</p><p>It was like watching method actors break character. \"We're sorry, we didn't mean to bring you all the way down here for nothing. Maybe you could visit the spy museum? It's right across the street.\"</p><p>Years later, I joined a DIA project which required a CI (counterintelligence) polygraph. I liked the work and the people doing it, so I agreed.</p><p>I started in the summer. In late September, Polygraph asked me to come in. I was no longer afraid of them. I didn't doubt the apparatus took accurate measurements of heart rate, blood pressure, respiration, and perspiration, but I'd stopped believing the examiner could infer a person's emotions or thoughts from the data in the tracings.</p><p>I now knew the examiners worked from a script like the one in the handbook. On page 24, the script calls for empathetic listening to put the subject at ease. On page 53, it says to change gears and confront the subject with evidence of a crime. I thought that since I was familiar with the script, the polygrapher would lose his power over me.</p><p>I arrived for the appointment. The examiner asked if I was nervous, and I said no (true). In the pretest interview, he asked if I'd visited the anti-polygraph websites to learn how to beat the test. I said I did read the sites, but I was looking for articles on psychological damage from interrogation and how to recover from it. Beating the polygraph was of no interest to me (true).</p><p>The real test began. In my mind, I turned the pages of the script. The examiner excused himself and stepped outside. He returned, and whatever warmth there'd been in his manner had vanished. <i>Oh c**p, we're on page 53.</i> He accused me of deception. I hunkered down until it was over. I reminded myself, <i>Whatever you do, don't make admissions.</i> I didn't have anything to confess, but if the pressure were bad enough, I might be tempted to make things up.</p><p>At the end of the test, the examiner told me I'd failed. But, and this is huge, for the first time I didn't leave the poly broken and weeping. I was annoyed, but I hadn't been harmed.</p><p>Two weeks later, they asked me to come in for a retest. The examiner was different, but the test was the same. Everything went smoothly, and I assumed I'd passed. The examiner said he needed to run the chart by his supervisor, and I'd hear back later.</p><p>Weeks went by, and then months. The computer account I would get as soon as I passed the poly was still in limbo, which was not a good sign.</p><p>During the quiet time over the Christmas break, I came to believe I'd lost the ability to pass a polygraph. By this time, I'd failed three in a row, two for DIA and the one for FBI.</p><p>I wondered if it was because I'd grown cynical. I now thought of the polygraph apparatus as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJvh0GFNUrE\">a colander attached to a Xerox machine</a>. Even so, I'd tried to cooperate. I'd answered their questions truthfully, and I hadn't used countermeasures. But I no longer feared the examiners, and I no longer broke under interrogation. According to the handbook, breaking the subject is an important part of the process.</p><p>On the first day back from Christmas break, my department head stopped by to give me my annual salary review. It was my highest raise in five years. She said the people on my project liked my work, and they liked me.</p><p>Later the same day, I got a call from Polygraph asking me to come in the next morning to answer the polygraph questions under oath rather than wired up.</p><p>I had no problem with that. As a mentor at the Agency said about testifying before Congress, \"Under oath or not under oath. Either way you're telling the truth, so what's the difference?\"</p><p>The two polys I'd already taken for DIA had been CI (counterintelligence). But halfway through, the examiner asked, \"How often do you look at pornography?\" I blinked with surprise. \"Excuse me?\" That question didn't belong on a CI poly, that was a Lifestyle question.</p><p>When the interview ended, the examiner said, \"I believe you\" in a voice that lacked conviction. Then he added, \"I'm going to try to get you another polygraph.\"</p><p>\"I don't want another.\" I meant it.</p><p>Over the next few days, I jumped whenever the phone rang. Weeks went by before I began to relax. And then my long-delayed computer account was approved. As I understood how the system worked, the polygraph had just been adjudicated in my favor.</p><p>A few days later, I was sitting at my desk eating lunch when a scheduling clerk from Polygraph called. \"You missed your appointment this morning,\" he said. <i>Next time, you might consider telling me about it ahead of time. </i>He said, \"Don't even worry about it. Everyone makes mistakes.\" My jaw dropped. <i>He just called me a liar.</i></p><p>The clerk wanted me to come in the next day. I was seriously rattled. I'd already decided I was not going to take another polygraph, ever. I stalled. And then I remembered my newly granted computer accesses. I was already cleared. Probably the paperwork hadn't caught up yet. I said I needed a few days to figure out if the poly was still necessary, and I would get back to him.</p><p>I checked with Security. They said, \"No, you haven't been adjudicated yet.\"</p><p>I couldn't get out of it, but I could put it off until it was OBE (overtaken by events). In a few months, the project would move to a new location beyond my commuting range. I planned to stay until right before the move and then find something else. I didn't have to refuse the poly, I just had to conduct a delaying action.</p><p>But Polygraph was insistent, and I wasn't sure I could hold them off much longer. I asked about withdrawing my application for DIA clearances, but was advised to watch and wait.</p><p>Or, I could leave the project now and find other work. My TS/SCI from CIA was still active, but I knew that eventually CIA would want me to take a polygraph. I also held a Top Secret clearance from the Air Force. The Air Force TS, a \"vanilla TS\" (not SCI) was based on an SF-86 background investigation. It did not require a polygraph. And at the very worst, I could do unclassified work. My company had a large number of unclassified projects, and many had work for analysts.</p><p>A few days after I'd told the clerk I'd get back to him, I gave a presentation about the work I'd been doing on my task. It was well received, and I stepped down from the podium covered in glory. As I left the meeting, the program manager pulled me aside and said my task had lost its funding. It was an occupational hazard of defense contracting, and not anything sinister.</p><p>I wasn't happy about being cut from the project, but it did solve my polygraph dilemma. If I wasn't on the project anymore, I didn't need to apply for DI clearances, and I didn't need to take the polygraph.</p><p>Around noon, the clerk from Polygraph called again. I told him I didn't have to take the poly anymore because I'd been laid off the project. In mid-afternoon, he called back. He said he'd made a few phone calls and learned that I hadn't been laid off from my company, after all. <i>Wonderful, call me a liar.</i></p><p>He pressed me to schedule another poly. I said no. His voice turned whiny. \"You have to do it!\" I dug in my heels. \"I've already told you no.\" He slammed down the phone.</p><p>I'd just refused a polygraph. I felt like Neville Longbottom when he drew the sword of Gryffindor and advanced on Lord Voldemort. I was filled with righteous indignation, and it gave me courage.</p><p>For the rest of the day, I was peppered with emails and phone calls summoning me to the offices of upper managers. Some of them were so far up the chain, I'd never heard their names before. They were uniformly kind to me. I hadn't known it, but I wasn't the first person in our division to refuse the polygraph. Polygraph conscientious objectors—who knew that there was such a thing?</p><p>Polygraph told my management I'd lied about being laid off. It caused a major flap. My project badges were taken from me, even the unclassified ones, and I was debriefed from all my DIA clearances.</p><p>To their credit, DIA didn't tell any other agencies they'd taken my badge and debriefed me. Weeks later, my CIA clearances were still active.</p><p>Six weeks went by. I put in for a few days of leave to take the kids to an alumni event at my university. I worked half a day and then went home to pack.</p><p>Sometime after 4:00 pm, when I was loading the last suitcase into the car, the department secretary called to say I was late for a 4:00 meeting with my department head. This was the first I'd heard of it. The meeting had been put on the calendar after I'd left for the day. I said I was sorry I couldn't be there, but I'd be back in the office first thing on Monday.</p><p>Just before close of business Monday, I was summoned to another meeting with the department head. When I arrived, my boss was sitting in her office with a woman from Human Resources. As a general rule, if you're boss wants to see you and HR has been asked to sit in, you know it's going to end badly.</p><p>My department head put a piece of paper in front of me. It said I'd agreed to take a polygraph as a condition of working on the DIA project, but when they tried to schedule it, I canceled the appointment. As a result, I was cut from the project.</p><p>\"No, I took two polygraphs. I turned down the third because I wasn't on the project anymore.\" Although I now thought of myself a polygraph conscientious objector, and I would have refused whether or not I was still on the project.</p><p>The rest of the letter said the company would begin termination proceedings against me. I was eight years from retirement. I wasn't counting the days until retirement. I liked going to work. Even when I was between assignments and not getting paid, I still came into the office and put in a full day.</p><p>I spoke to a lawyer. She said I lived in an \"at will\" state, which means employees can be dismissed for any (legal) reason, or for no reason at all. I was being terminated for refusing the polygraph, and it was legal.</p><p>I decided to resign rather than fight.</p><p>My mother loved being a doctor, but she discouraged us from applying to medical school. She said the cost of malpractice insurance had ruined the profession.</p><p>Similarly, I urge my children to steer clear of any job that requires a polygraph. That rules out entire professions: National Security, Intelligence, Law Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection, and Pharmacy. It's a shame. My career as an intelligence analyst was exciting, deeply rewarding, and just plain fun. I contributed to the safety of my country, which is a constant source of pride. But I no longer recommend my profession to others. The polygraph has become a deal breaker.</p>",

      "content": "<i>as reported in the  list and RISKS</i><p> 01 Apr 88  1620 PST Les Earnest  The \"previous account\" referred to in RISKS-6.51</p><h2>e-t-a-o-n-r-i Spy and the FBI</h2>\n\nReading a book got me into early trouble--I had an FBI record\nby age twelve. This bizarre incident caused a problem much later\nwhen I needed a security clearance. I learned that I could obtain\none only by concealing my sordid past.\n\n<p>\nA friend named Bob and I read the book ``Secret and Urgent,'' by\nFletcher Pratt [Blue Ribbon Books; Garden City, NY; 1942] which was\nan early popular account of codes and ciphers. Pratt showed how to\nuse letter frequencies to break ciphers and reported that the most\nfrequently occurring letters in typical English text are\ne-t-a-o-n-r-i, in that order. (The letter frequency order of the\nstory you are now reading is e-t-a-i-o-n-r. The higher frequency\nof ``i'' probably reflects the fact that _I_ use the first person\nsingular a lot.) Pratt's book also treated more advanced\ncryptographic schemes.\n\n</p><p>\nBob and I decided that we needed to have a secure way to\ncommunicate with each other, so we put together a rather elaborate\njargon code based on the principles described in the book. I don't\nremember exactly why we thought we needed it--we spent much of\nour time outside of school together, so there was ample time to\ntalk privately. Still, you never could tell when you might need to\nsend a secret message!\n\n</p><p>\nWe made two copies of the code key (a description of how to encrypt\nand decrypt our messages) in the form of a single typewritten\nsheet. We each took a copy and carried it on our persons at all\ntimes when we were wearing clothes.\n\n</p><p>\nI actually didn't wear clothes much. I spent nearly all my time\noutside school wearing just a baggy pair of maroon swimming trunks.\nThat wasn't considered too weird in San Diego.\n\n</p><p>\nI had recently been given glasses to wear but generally kept them\nin a hard case in the pocket of the trousers that I wore to school.\nI figured that this was a good place to hide my copy of the code\nkey, so I carefully folded it to one-eighth of its original size\nand stuck it at the bottom of the case, under my glasses.\n\n</p><p>\nEvery chance I got, I went body surfing at Old Mission Beach. I\nusually went by streetcar and, since I had to transfer Downtown, I\nwore clothes. Unfortunately, while I was riding the trolley home\nfrom the beach one Saturday, the case carrying my glasses slipped\nout of my pocket unnoticed. I reported the loss to my mother that\nnight. She chastised me and later called the streetcar company.\nThey said that the glasses hadn't been turned in.\n\n</p><p>\nAfter a few weeks of waiting in vain for the glasses to turn up, we\nbegan to lose hope. My mother didn't rush getting replacement\nglasses in view of the fact that I hadn't worn them much and they\ncost about $8, a large sum at that time. (To me, $8 represented 40\nround trips to the beach by streetcar, or 80 admission fees to the\nmovies.)\n\n</p><p>\nUnknown to us, the case had been found by a patriotic citizen who\nopened it, discovered the code key, recognized that it must belong\nto a Japanese spy and turned it over to the FBI This was in\n1943, just after citizens of Japanese descent had been forced off\ntheir property and taken away to concentration camps. I remember\nhearing that a local grocer was secretly a Colonel in the Japanese\nArmy and had hidden his uniform in the back of his store. A lot of\npeople actually believed these things.\n\n</p><p>\nAbout six weeks later, when I happened to be off on another\nescapade, my mother was visited by a man who identified himself as\nan investigator from the FBI (She was a school administrator,\nbut happened to be at home working on her Ph.D. dissertation.) She\nnoticed that there were two more men waiting in a car outside. The\nagent asked a number of questions about me, including my\noccupation. He reportedly was quite disappointed when he learned\nthat I was only 12 years old.\n\n</p><p>\nHe eventually revealed why I was being investigated, showed my\nmother the glasses and the code key and asked her if she knew where\nit came from. She didn't, of course. She asked if we could get\nthe glasses back and he agreed.\n\n</p><p>\nMy mother told the investigator how glad she was to get them back,\nconsidering that they cost $8. He did a slow burn, then said\n``Lady, this case has cost the government thousands of dollars. It\nhas been the top priority in our office for the last six weeks. We\ntraced the glasses to your son from the prescription by examining\nthe files of nearly every optometrist in San Diego.'' It apparently\ndidn't occur to them that if I were a  Japanese spy, I might\nhave brought the glasses with me from headquarters.\n\n</p><p>\nThe FBI agent gave back the glasses but kept the code key ``for\nour records.'' They apparently were not fully convinced that they\nwere dealing just with kids.\n\n</p><p>\nSince our communication scheme had been compromised, Bob and I\ndevised a new key. I started carrying it in my wallet, which I\nthought was more secure. I don't remember ever exchanging any\ncryptographic messages. I was always ready, though.\n\n</p><p>\nA few years later when I was in college, I got a summer job at the\nNaval Electronics Lab, which required a security clearance. One of\nthe questions on the application form was ``Have you ever been\ninvestigated by the FBI?'' Naturally, I checked ``Yes.'' The next\nquestion was, ``If so, describe the circumstances.'' There was very\nlittle space on the form, so I answered simply and honestly, ``I was\nsuspected of being a Japanese spy.''\n\n</p><p>\nWhen I handed the form in to the security officer, he scanned it\nquickly, looked me over slowly, then said, ``Explain this''--pointing\nat the FBI question. I described what had happened.\nHe got very agitated, picked up my form, tore it in pieces, and\nthrew it in the waste basket.\n\n</p><p>\nHe then got out a blank form and handed it to me, saying ``Here,\nfill it out again and don't mention that. If you do, I'll make\nsure that you  get a security clearance.''\n\n</p><p>\nI did as he directed and was shortly granted the clearance. I\nnever again disclosed that incident on security clearance forms.\n\n</p><p>\nOn another occasion much later, I learned by chance that putting\ncertain provocative information on a security clearance form can\ngreatly speed up the clearance process. But that is another story.\n\n</p><a href=\"https://milk.com/wall-o-shame/\"><img src=\"https://milk.com/wall-o-shame/wos-mark.gif\" alt=\"WoS\"></a>\nEdited and converted to HTML by Dan Bornstein.\n\n",

      "content": "<div><p>CXMT halves DDR4 prices as YMTC gains ground in NAND, raising concerns over Korea’s legacy exposure</p></div><p>Samsung Electronics and SK hynix are locked in a race to mass-produce sixth-generation high-bandwidth memory, but Chinese rivals are making gains elsewhere — flooding the legacy DRAM market with chips priced at roughly half the going rate.</p><p>According to industry sources on Friday, China’s top DRAM manufacturer CXMT has been offering older-generation DDR4 chips at about half the prevailing market rate. The move comes as global supply shortages have driven prices sharply higher, allowing the company to aggressively push legacy products for mobile devices and PCs in a bid to boost market share.</p><p>DDR4 remains a mainstay component in devices such as PCs and TVs, and have risen in price recently.</p><p>Data from DRAMeXchange showed that as of end-January, the average fixed contract price of PC DRAM DDR4 8Gb stood at $11.50, up 23.7 percent from $9.30 a month ago. Compared with $1.35 a year earlier, the price has jumped more than eightfold. DRAM prices have climbed for 10 consecutive months, marking the highest level since the market tracker began compiling data in June 2016.</p><p>Against this backdrop, cut-price Chinese chips are proving tempting. US hardware firms HP and Dell are reportedly conducting quality tests on CXMT’s DRAM, while Taiwan’s Asus and Acer have sought cooperation with Chinese partners. Signs are emerging that aggressive pricing is translating into demand.</p><p>“Chinese firms are waging a volume-based strategy starting with general-purpose memory, backed by state subsidies and domestic demand from AI servers and locally developed GPUs,” said an industry source who requested anonymity. “As Korean companies concentrate on HBM4, there are visible cracks emerging in (their hold on) the legacy market.”</p><p>The challenge for Korean chipmakers is that the legacy segment still accounts for a significant portion of their earnings. More than half of the total DRAM production capacity at both Samsung and SK hynix is understood to be allocated to general-purpose products. Even if they maintain leadership in HBM4, a deepening erosion of the mainstream market could eventually weigh on profitability.</p><p>Chinese players, meanwhile, are not limiting their push to low-cost volume sales. The cash and know-how gained from legacy chips is funding a push into higher-end products.</p><p>CXMT is in the process of converting wafer capacity equivalent to about 20 percent of its total DRAM output — some 60,000 wafers per month — at its Shanghai plant to the fourth-generation HBM3 chip production. The possibility of expanding into post-HBM3E products is also being discussed.</p><p>The Shanghai facility is believed to have production capacity two to three times larger than the company’s headquarters plant in Hefei. Equipment installation is expected to be completed in the second half of this year, with mass production slated for next year. Although HBM3 and the fifth-generation HBM3E chips trail HBM4 in performance, they remain widely used in AI data centers.</p><p>China’s advance is not confined to DRAM. YMTC has been gaining traction in the NAND flash sector as well, capitalizing on competitively priced mobile products. The company recorded a 10 percent share of the global NAND market for the first time last year, and momentum is widely expected to continue.</p><p>YMTC is currently building a third fabrication plant in Wuhan, targeting operations next year. Half of the facility’s production capacity is to be allocated to DRAM. It will initially focus on legacy DRAM products, with the possibility of expanding into HBM production in partnership with local assembly firms. Industry sources say the pattern is familiar — build scale in legacy DRAM, then move up the value chain.</p><p>“At this stage, Chinese manufacturers are relying on aggressive pricing to build scale in legacy DRAM,” the anonymous source said. “But over time, the technology gap may narrow more quickly than expected. Even if Korean firms maintain leadership in HBM, neglecting the mainstream segment could weigh on profitability in the longer run.”</p>yeeun@heraldcorp.com",

      "content": "<p>A new law to ensure that batteries are collected, reused and recycled in Europe is entering into force today. The new <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2023/1542/oj\">Batteries Regulation</a> will ensure that, in the future, batteries have a low carbon footprint, use minimal harmful substances, need less raw materials from non-EU countries, and are collected, reused and recycled to a high degree in Europe. This will support the shift to a circular economy, increase security of supply for raw materials and energy, and enhance the EU’s strategic autonomy.</p><p>In line with the circularity ambitions of the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en\">European Green Deal</a>, the Batteries Regulation is the first piece of European legislation taking a full life-cycle approach in which sourcing, manufacturing, use and recycling are addressed and enshrined in a single law.</p><p>Batteries are a key technology to drive the green transition, support sustainable mobility and contribute to climate neutrality by 2050. To that end, starting from 2025, the Regulation will gradually introduce declaration requirements, performance classes and maximum limits on the carbon footprint of electric vehicles, light means of transport (such as e-bikes and scooters) and rechargeable industrial batteries.</p><p>The Batteries Regulation will ensure that batteries placed on the EU single market will only be allowed to contain a restricted amount of harmful substances that are necessary. Substances of concerns used in batteries will be regularly reviewed.&nbsp;</p><p>Targets for recycling efficiency, material recovery and recycled content will be introduced gradually from 2025 onwards. All collected waste batteries will have to be recycled and high levels of recovery will have to be achieved, in particular of critical raw materials such as cobalt, lithium and nickel. This will guarantee that valuable materials are recovered at the end of their useful life and brought back in the economy by adopting stricter targets for recycling efficiency and material recovery over time.</p><p>Starting in 2027, consumers will be able to remove and replace the portable batteries in their electronic products at any time of the life cycle. This will extend the life of these products before their final disposal, will encourage re-use and will contribute to the reduction of post-consumer waste.</p><p>To help consumers make informed decisions on which batteries to purchase, key data will be provided on a label. A QR code will provide access to a digital passport with detailed information on each battery that will help consumers and especially professionals along the value chain in their efforts to make the circular economy a reality for batteries.</p><p>Under the new law’s due diligence obligations, companies must identify, prevent and address social and environmental risks linked to the sourcing, processing and trading of raw materials such as&nbsp;lithium, cobalt, nickel and natural graphite contained in their batteries. &nbsp;The expected massive increase in demand for batteries in the EU should not contribute to an increase of such environmental and social risks.</p><p>Work will now focus on the application of the law in the Member States, and the redaction of secondary legislation (implementing and delegated acts) providing more detailed rules.</p><p>Demand for batteries is increasing rapidly. It is set to increase 14-fold globally by 2030 and the EU could account for 17% of that demand. This is mostly driven by the electrification of transport. Such exponential growth in demand for batteries will lead to an equivalent increase in demand for raw materials, hence the need to minimise their environmental impact.</p><p>In 2017, the Commission launched the&nbsp;European Battery Alliance&nbsp;to build an innovative, sustainable and globally competitive battery value chain in Europe, and ensure supply of batteries needed for decarbonising the transport and energy sectors.</p>",

      "content": "<section><p>Fifteen years ago, we started work on the Dark Sky weather app.</p><p>Over the years it went through numerous iterations — including more than one major redesign — as we worked our way through the process of learning what makes a great weather app. Eventually, in time, it was acquired by Apple, where the forecast and some core features were incorporated into Apple Weather.</p><p>We enjoyed our time at Apple. So why did we leave to start another weather company?</p><p>It’s simple: when looking at the landscape of the countless weather apps out there, many of them lovely, we found ourselves feeling unsatisfied. The more we spoke to friends and family, the more we heard that many of them did too. And, of course, we missed those days as a small scrappy shop.</p></section><section><p>Our biggest pet peeve with most weather apps is how they deal (or rather, don’t deal) with forecast uncertainty. It is a simple fact that no weather forecast will ever be 100% reliable: the weather is moody, fickle, and chaotic. Forecasts are often wrong.</p><p>Understanding this uncertainty is crucial for planning your day. Most weather apps will give you their single best guess, leaving you to wonder how sure they actually are, and what else might happen instead. Will it actually start raining at 9am, or might it end up pushed off until noon? Will there be rain or snow? How sure are you? You can’t plan your day if you don’t know how much you can trust the forecast, or know what other possibilities might arise. Rather than pretending we will always be right, Acme Weather embraces the idea that our forecast will sometimes be wrong. We address this uncertainty in several ways:</p><h3>Alternate Possible Futures</h3><p>Our homegrown forecasts are produced using many different data sources, including numerical weather prediction models, satellite data, ground station observations, and radar data. Most of the time, our forecast will be a reliable source of information (it’s better than the one we had at Dark Sky). But, crucially, we supplement the main forecast with a spread of alternate predictions. These are additional forecast lines that capture a range of alternate possible outcomes:</p><p>This accomplishes a couple things:</p><p>First, the spread of the lines offers a sort of intuition as to how reliable the forecast is. Take the two forecasts below. In the first, the alternate predictions are tightly focused and the forecast can be considered robust and reliable. In the second, there is a significant spread, which is an indication that something is up and the forecast may be subject to change. It’s a call to action to check other conditions or maps, or come back to the app more frequently:</p><p>Over time, you build up an intuitive sense of just how much you can actually trust the forecast. After using this for the past six months, I never want to go back to a single forecast again!</p><p>Second, it simply shows what else might plausibly happen. In what time range might the storm arrive? Will the snow hit early, or might it be delayed and turn mostly to rain? When the weather is changing rapidly, predictions can become less reliable. We’ll show you different possible futures, so you can be better informed.</p><p>Alternative Forecasts are designed to help make better hour-to-hour or day-by-day decisions. Community reports are intended to help with real-time weather events. Current conditions often evolve quickly during storms, radar is imperfect and can fail to detect precipitation during light rain, snow versus freezing rain can be volatile, etc.</p><p>To address this, we’ve built a feature that allows any user to submit a report of the current conditions near them, which can be seen on the map:</p><p>You can choose from a pre-selected list of weather condition icons (or even a list of emojis for when it’s feeling particularly 💩 out). There’s nothing more reliable than when a person nearby tells you what’s happening, so if there are recent reports near you we’ll flag it in the app.</p></section><section><p>We absolutely love maps. They provide the context around the weather. Sure, the forecast may say you’ll get rain, but a map will complete the picture by showing you the full breadth of the storm, where it will hit, and where you are relative to it.</p><p>We’ve built a large number of maps, including radar and lightning, rain and snow totals (why do most other weather apps not offer this?), wind, temperature and humidity, cloud cover, hurricane tracks, etc. While you can explore them all in the map tab, we also make sure to embed the most relevant maps directly inside the forecasts to provide a contextual backdrop.</p></section><section><p>A weather app is only useful if you remember to check it. I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve gotten stuck in the rain — not because the forecast was wrong, but because I simply didn’t check the app.</p><p>The solution? A comprehensive set of weather notifications. Turn them on, and no longer worry about missing important weather events.</p><p>Our notifications include everything from down-to-the-minute rain warnings, to government severe weather alerts, nearby lightning, community reports, and even whether or not a rainbow might be visible outside your house.</p><p>We also let you create custom notifications, tailored to whatever you care about. Want to know if it’ll be windy, or if the UV index will be high, or if you’ll get heavy rain in the next 24 hours? We’ve got you covered.</p></section><section><p>A weather app shouldn’t just be about helping you avoid bad weather; it should also be fun! There’s a wide world of meteorological phenomena that we would like to highlight. As such, we’re launching “Acme Labs”, which is a set of experimental tools inside the app to highlight fun and interesting things happening where you are.</p><p>We’re starting with a couple initial features, including: , where we bring our hyperlocal rain forecasts to bear to pinpoint where rainbows are occuring right now, and , where we'll let you know if the sunset will be particularly lovely this evening.</p></section><section><p>We take your privacy very seriously. Please review our <a href=\"https://acmeweather.com/privacy\">privacy policy</a>, but here is our philosophy in a nutshell:</p><ul><li>We won’t collect any information other than what is necessary to provide the service you’re paying for. This information will only be used to provide that service, and for nothing else.</li><li>We won’t save or store any information that isn’t necessary. We don’t want or need your location history, for example, and simply not storing it in the first place means it can’t fall into the wrong hands.</li><li>We will never sell or give your information to third parties, such as advertisers. We make our money directly from our customers.</li><li>We don’t use third-party trackers or analytics services, because we can’t guarantee what they will or won’t do with the information we send them.</li></ul></section><section><p>Well, that’s Acme Weather. We’ve been making weather apps for 15 years, from Dark Sky to Apple, and this is the culmination (the acme?) of everything we’ve learned along the way. It’s the weather app we’ve always wanted, and always wanted to build.</p><p>Acme Weather is </p><p>We think you’ll love it. So try it out, and let us know what you think!</p></section>",

      "content": "<p>We manage millions of dollars in annual Meta ad spend. Not thousands. Millions. Our retail clients grow their businesses through Meta Ads, and for a lot of them, it’s their single most important growth channel. We are, by any reasonable definition, a high-value customer.</p><p>And yet, for the past several months, Meta has been treating us like we don’t exist.</p><p>It’s genuinely one of the more absurd things we’ve experienced running an agency in two decades.</p><p> We hire a senior Paid Ads Specialist. They set up a dedicated work account, which, by the way, is standard professional practice. Keeping work and personal accounts separate is basic data hygiene, not a red flag. We upload their government ID, Drivers Licence, Birth certificate for mandatory identity verification. We even do a face scan. Then, somewhere between five minutes and ten hours later, the account gets instantly banned.</p><p>We have done this with multiple specialists and social media managers now. Every single one banned. Before they’ve even opened an ad account or posted a single piece of content.</p><p>You might be thinking there’s something suspicious going on. Maybe a pattern in the logins. Maybe something in the account setup that looks off. Maybe we’re leaving something out. Meta’s security systems exist for a reason, and when someone says “we keep getting banned,” the natural assumption is that they’re doing something to deserve it.</p><p>But here’s the thing. We have been advertising on Facebook since the platform first opened its doors to advertisers, back in 2008. We have spent millions of dollars on it over that time. Our agency history, our billing history, our business identity – it’s all there. There is no shady pattern. There is no hidden behaviour. There is just a broken automated system that cannot distinguish between a bot farm and a professional who created a work account on their first day.</p><p>And when we try to fix it? That’s where it gets truly circular. Meta’s standard response is to file an appeal through the Account Quality dashboard. Sounds reasonable, until you realise that the appeal tool is inside the platform – the same platform the specialist is completely locked out of. You cannot appeal a login ban from behind a login screen. </p><p>We’ve tried everything. Every forum thread, every concierge support contact, every support line we could find. The answers we get back are remarkably consistent: “just create a new account” or “file an appeal.” So we create a new account. That one gets banned too. There is no clean slate. There is just the same broken automated system flagging the same professional as a threat, over and over again.</p><p>The business impact of this is real and it compounds fast. Staff, who have done nothing wrong, end up with a black mark attached to their identity documents across multiple banned accounts. And we’re left trying to run campaigns and manage brand pages on a platform that could, at any moment, eliminate a key team member for no legitimate reason.</p><p>We never have had this problem with Google or even TikTok.</p><p>What we as the enabler of this platform want a simple fix. A manual onboarding pathway for verified agencies that doesn’t collapse the moment an automated system makes a bad call. A human-accessible support channel for login failures, someone who can actually look at an account and click override. And an honest acknowledgement from Meta that their automated identity verification is producing false positives at scale for professional users.</p><p>If you’re an agency owner who has hit the same wall, please share this. We’re not the only ones, and the only way this gets fixed is if someone at Meta with actual authority decides it’s worth looking at.</p><p>If you work at Meta and are reading this, please email us at hello (at) our domain name.</p><p>: This blew up on hacker news. We have contacted Meta support dozens of times over the past 30 days. Each representative confirmed that account creation and monitoring are now handled almost entirely by AI. Despite successfully completing required face verifications, our accounts continue to be flagged and banned by automated parameters. There is currently no path for manual intervention; even internal support tickets are failing to reach human reviewers with the authority to resolve these systemic blocks.</p><p>: The top comment says  – “Standard professional practice invented by ad agencies themselves, against Facebook’s policy[0].”</p><p>[0]:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/975828035803295/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/help/975828035803295/</a> — Just so that we are clear, even the personal facebook accounts are getting banned following the AI ban of work accounts. Personal accounts have been in existence in some cases for well over a year.</p>",

They’re all solving the wrong problem.</p><p> models coordination as a state machine. You define nodes and edges in Python. The developer decides upfront how agents hand off work.

A crew of three can’t decide it actually needs five people, or that “researcher” should be split into two parallel tracks.</p><p> puts agents in a group chat. They coordinate by talking to each other. Flexible, but there’s no structure. No dependency tracking, no authority scoping, no typed results. Coordination emerges from conversation, which means it’s unpredictable and hard to inspect.</p><p> is the most minimal — lightweight handoffs between agents. Agent A decides it’s time for Agent B and transfers control. Simple, but linear. No parallelism, no tree structure, no way for an agent to spawn three subtasks and wait for all of them.</p><p> — Anthropic’s own pattern — put a single agent in a loop with tools. Handles sequential complexity well but runs into context window limits on large tasks and can’t parallelize. One agent, one thread, one context.</p><p>The common thread: every framework requires the developer to predefine the coordination structure.  decide the workflow graph, the agent roles, the handoff pattern. The agents execute within your boundaries.</p><p>This made sense when agents were unreliable. You’d never let GPT-3 decide how to decompose a project. But current models are good at planning. They break problems into subproblems naturally. They understand dependencies. They know when a task is too big for one pass.</p><p>So why are we still hardcoding the decomposition?</p><h2>Let the agent build the tree</h2><p>I built <a href=\"https://github.com/kimjune01/cord\">Cord</a>. You give it a goal:</p><div><div><pre><code>cord run \"Should we migrate our API from REST to GraphQL? Evaluate and recommend.\"\n</code></pre></div></div><p>One agent launches. It reads the goal, decides it needs research before it can answer, and creates subtasks:</p><div><div><pre><code>● #1 [active] GOAL Should we migrate our API from REST to GraphQL?\n  ● #2 [active] SPAWN Audit current REST API surface\n  ● #3 [active] SPAWN Research GraphQL trade-offs for our stack\n  ○ #4 [pending] ASK How many concurrent users do you serve?\n    blocked-by: #2\n  ○ #5 [pending] FORK Comparative analysis\n    blocked-by: #3, #4\n  ○ #6 [pending] SPAWN Write migration recommendation\n    blocked-by: #5\n</code></pre></div></div><p>No workflow was hardcoded. The agent decided this structure at runtime.</p><p>It parallelized the API audit (#2) and the GraphQL research (#3). It created an  node (#4) — a question for the human — because it realized the recommendation depends on scale, something it can’t research on its own. It blocked #4 on #2 because the question makes more sense with the audit results as context. It made #5 a  so the analysis inherits everything learned so far. And it sequenced the final recommendation after the analysis.</p><div><div><pre><code>✓ #2 [complete] SPAWN Audit current REST API surface\n  result: 47 endpoints. 12 heavily nested resources...\n✓ #3 [complete] SPAWN Research GraphQL trade-offs\n  result: Key advantages: reduced over-fetching...\n\n? How many concurrent users do you serve?\n  Options: &lt;1K, 1K-10K, 10K-100K, &gt;100K\n&gt; 10K-100K\n\n● #5 [active] FORK Comparative analysis\n  blocked-by: #3, #4\n</code></pre></div></div><p>The research runs in parallel. When both finish and you answer the question, the analysis launches with all three results in its context. It produces a recommendation tailored to your actual scale and API surface — not a generic blog post about GraphQL.</p><p>This is the one idea I think is genuinely new: the distinction between  and  as a context-flow primitive.</p><p>A  agent gets a clean slate. Just its prompt and the results of nodes it explicitly depends on. Like hiring a contractor — here’s the spec, go. Cheap to restart, easy to reason about.</p><p>A  agent gets all completed sibling results injected into its context. Like briefing a team member — they know everything the team has learned so far. More expensive, but necessary for analysis that builds on prior work.</p><p>This isn’t about concurrency. Both can run in parallel or sequentially. It’s about . In the example above, the agent chose  for the independent research tasks and  for the analysis that needs everything. It made this choice correctly — because the tool descriptions explain the distinction clearly. That’s the point: the protocol is learnable from its interface alone.</p><p>The natural next step is making context flow a first-class primitive — a  parameter on spawn/fork that takes a natural language instruction like , <code>\"relevant details from a web designer's perspective\"</code>, or <code>\"bullet points about error handling\"</code>. A compaction subagent would read the parent’s full context, distill it according to the query, and pass only the result to the child. This has to be built into the client itself — an isolated MCP tool can’t access the parent’s context without serializing the whole thing as a tool input, which defeats the purpose.</p><p>Each agent is a Claude Code CLI process with MCP tools backed by a shared SQLite database:</p><ul><li><code>spawn(goal, prompt, blocked_by)</code> — create a child task</li><li><code>fork(goal, prompt, blocked_by)</code> — create a context-inheriting child</li><li> — ask the human a question</li><li> — mark yourself done</li><li> — see the full coordination tree</li></ul><p>Agents know they’re a node in a coordination tree — the system prompt tells them — but they don’t manage it. They see tools and use them as needed. The protocol — dependency resolution, authority scoping, result injection — is enforced by the MCP server.</p><p>When an  node becomes ready, the engine pauses to prompt the human in the terminal. The answer is stored as a result, and downstream nodes unblock. The human is a participant in the tree, not an observer.</p><p>~500 lines of Python. SQLite + MCP.</p><h2>Behavioral testing as design validation</h2><p>Before writing the runtime, I needed to know if the protocol was learnable from its interface alone. So I built a throwaway MCP server with the five tools, pointed Claude Code at it, and ran 15 tests. No runtime, no engine — just Claude, the tools, and a task.</p><p>The interesting results weren’t the correct tool calls. They were the emergent behaviors. An agent asked to decompose a project called  before acting and again after to verify — read, act, verify, unprompted. An agent that got rejected for trying to stop a sibling escalated through  — the correct pattern, but one I’d never described. An agent that hit an error stopped the failing child and respawned a new one with an adjusted prompt.</p><p>15/15 passed. The passing rate wasn’t the insight — it was that clear tool descriptions plus dependency semantics were sufficient for correct use. That told me the runtime was worth building.</p><p>This implementation uses Claude Code CLI and SQLite. But the protocol — five primitives, dependency resolution, authority scoping, two-phase lifecycle — is independent of all that.</p><p>You could implement Cord over Postgres for multi-machine coordination. Over the Claude API directly, without the CLI overhead. With multiple LLM providers — GPT for cheap tasks, Claude for complex ones. With human workers for some nodes.</p><p>The protocol is the contribution. This repo is a proof of concept.</p><div><div><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/kimjune01/cord.git\ncord\nuv cord run  2.0\n</code></pre></div></div><p>You can also point it at a planning doc:</p><div><div><pre><code>cord run plan.md  5.0\n</code></pre></div></div><p>The root agent reads the markdown and decomposes it into a coordination tree. Write your plan however you want — bullet points, sections, prose — and the agent figures out the task structure, dependencies, and parallelism.</p>",

      "content": "<p>In 2023, Bluesky's CTO Paul Frazee was asked what would happen if Bluesky ever turned against its users. His answer:</p><blockquote><p>\"it would look something like this: bluesky has gone evil. there's a new alternative called freesky that people are rushing to. I'm switching to freesky\"</p></blockquote><p><strong>That's the same argument people made about Twitter.</strong> \"If it goes bad, we'll just leave.\" We know how that played out.</p><p>Bluesky is built on ATProto, an open protocol. The pitch is simple: your data is yours, your identity is yours, and if you don't like what Bluesky is doing, you can take everything and leave. Apps like Tangled (git hosting), Grain (photos), and Leaflet (publishing) all plug into the same protocol. One account, many apps, no lock-in.</p><p>It sounds great. But look closer.</p><h2>Where your data actually lives</h2><p>When you use any ATProto app, it writes data to your Personal Data Server, or PDS. Your Bluesky posts, your Tangled issues, your Leaflet publications, your Grain photos. All of it goes to the same place.</p><p><strong>For almost every user, that place is a server run by Bluesky.</strong></p><p>You can self-host a PDS. Almost nobody does. Why would they? Bluesky's PDS works out of the box with every app, zero setup, zero maintenance. Self-hosting means running a server, keeping it online, and gaining nothing in return.</p><p>To be fair, migration tools exist. You can move your account to a self-hosted PDS for as little as $5 a month. Bluesky has made this easier over time and even supports moving back. But this only works if you do it before the door closes. If an acquirer disables exports, it doesn't matter that the tools existed yesterday. And we know from every platform transition in history that almost nobody takes proactive steps to protect their data.</p><p>Here's the part that worries me.</p><p>Every new ATProto app makes this problem worse, not better. Each app tells you \"sign in with your Bluesky account\", which really means \"write more data to Bluesky's servers.\" The more apps that launch, the more users depend on Bluesky's infrastructure, the less reason anyone has to leave.</p><p><strong>The protocol doesn't distribute value across the network. It concentrates it.</strong> Developers are building features on top of Bluesky's infrastructure for free, making it more indispensable with every app that ships.</p><p>And Bluesky gets to claim the moral high ground the whole time. \"We're open! We're decentralized! You can leave whenever you want!\" Meanwhile, the switching cost goes up every day.</p><p>It's not just the PDS. Bluesky controls almost every critical layer:</p><p> All data flows through it. Bluesky runs the dominant one. Whoever controls the relay controls what gets seen, hidden, or deprioritized. Third parties can run their own, but without the users, it doesn't matter.</p><p> This is what assembles your timeline, threads, and notifications. Bluesky runs the main one. If it goes down or goes hostile, every client that depends on it breaks.</p><p> Your identity on ATProto resolves through a centralized directory run by Bluesky. They've called it a \"placeholder\" since 2023 and said they plan to decentralize it. There's still no timeline.</p><p><strong>At every layer, the answer is \"anyone can run their own.\" At every layer, almost nobody does.</strong></p><p>Email is an open, federated protocol. Anyone can run a mail server. In practice, running your own mail server is painful and everyone just uses Gmail. The protocol being \"open\" didn't prevent centralization.</p><p>ATProto might be worse. With email, at least each app connects to your own server. With ATProto, each new app adds more data to the same centralized PDS. The open protocol is actually a centralization flywheel.</p><h2>What happens in an acquisition</h2><p>Say someone buys Bluesky. They now control:</p><ul><li>The PDS for nearly every user</li><li>The DID directory that resolves every identity</li></ul><p>They could disable data export. They could cut off third-party apps. They could shut down federation. They could insert ads, shadow ban users, deprioritize content.</p><p>And the blast radius isn't just Bluesky the social network. It's every app in the ecosystem. Your git issues on Tangled, your posts on Leaflet, your photos on Grain. All stored on infrastructure now controlled by the acquirer.</p><p><strong>The protocol says you can leave. But the company that just paid billions for the network has no incentive to let you.</strong></p><p>I like Bluesky. I use Bluesky. The team seems to genuinely care.</p><p>But every counter-argument to the concerns above rests on the same foundation: technically, users can leave. Technically, you can self-host. Technically, you can run your own relay. The capability exists at every layer. But people don't do these things. They never have with any protocol. Not email, not RSS, not XMPP. <strong>The default wins. Always.</strong></p><p>And then there's the money. You don't raise $120M at a $700M valuation to run a public utility. Those investors need a return. That return comes from monetizing users, getting acquired, or going public. All three create pressure to consolidate control, not distribute it. A truly decentralized network where users can freely leave is worth less to an acquirer than one where they can't.</p><p>The PBC structure is supposed to be the safeguard. But PBC obligations are vague and untested in court. When $120M in VC money is on one side of the balance, guess which way it tips.</p><p><strong>The protocol can't save you from incentives.</strong></p>",

Many thanks, hammers up, and onwards.</p><p>Last week, in La Mesa, a small city just east of San Diego, California, observers happened upon a pair of destroyed Flock cameras. One had been smashed and left on the median, the other had key parts removed. The destruction was obviously intentional, and appears perhaps even staged to leave a message: It came just weeks after the city decided, in the face of public protest, to continue its contracts with the surveillance company.</p><p>Flock cameras are typically mounted on 8 to 12 foot poles and powered by a solar panel. The smashed remains of all of the above in La Mesa are the latest examples of a widening anti-Flock backlash. In recent months, people have been smashing and dismantling the surveillance devices, in incidents reported in at least five states, from coast to coast. </p><p><a href=\"https://sdslackers.com/2026/02/16/flock-cameras-destroyed-in-la-mesa-amid-surveillance-backlash/\" rel=\"\">the smashed Flock equipment</a></p><p>There was “a huge turnout against them,” he tells me, “but the council approved continuation of the contract.”</p><p><a href=\"https://www.flocksafety.com/blog/flock-safety-secures-major-funding\" rel=\"\">currently valued at $7.5 billion</a><a href=\"https://www.404media.co/ice-taps-into-nationwide-ai-enabled-camera-network-data-shows/\" rel=\"\">Flock’s vehicle data is routinely accessed by ICE</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/878447/ring-flock-partnership-canceled\" rel=\"\">now-canceled partnership with Ring</a></p><p><a href=\"https://lookout.co/georgia-police-chief-arrested-for-using-flock-cameras-for-stalking-and-harassment-searched-capitola-data-earlier-this-year/story\" rel=\"\">was arrested</a><a href=\"https://sfstandard.com/2025/12/29/san-francisco-police-flock-license-plate-cameras-lawsuit/\" rel=\"\">Critics claim</a><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2026/02/17/nx-s1-5612825/flock-contracts-canceled-immigration-survillance-concerns\" rel=\"\">they’re succeeding</a></p><p><a href=\"https://lookouteugene-springfield.com/story/justice/2025/10/15/police-investigate-vandalism-to-flock-cameras-in-eugene-springfield/\" rel=\"\">were cut down and destroyed</a><em>Lookout Eugene-Springfield.</em></p><p>A note reading “Hahaha get wrecked ya surveilling fucks” was attached to one of the destroyed poles, and somewhat incredibly, broadcast on the local news. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.wavy.com/news/local-news/suffolk/suffolk-man-charged-with-destroying-13-flock-cameras/\" rel=\"\">according to local news</a></p><blockquote><p>Jefferey S. Sovern, 41, was arrested in October after detectives say he “intentionally destroyed” 13 Flock Safety cameras between April and October of this year. He was charged with 13 counts of destruction of property, six counts of petit larceny and six counts of possession of burglary tools.</p><p>Sovern admitted to the crimes, according to a criminal complaint filed in Suffolk General District Court, going as far as to say he used vice grips to help him disassemble the tow-piece polls. He also admitted to keeping some of the wiring, batteries and solar panels taken from the cameras. Some of the items were recovered by police after they searched the property.</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/jeff-sovern-legal-fund\" rel=\"\">created a GoFundMe</a></p><blockquote><p>My name is Jeff and I appreciate my privacy. I appreciate everyone's right to privacy, enshrined in the fourth amendment. With the local news outlets finding my legal issues and creating a story that is starting to grow, there has been community support for me that I humbly welcome.</p></blockquote><p>(I reached out to Sovern, who is out on bail, for comment, and will update or follow up if I hear back.) </p><p><a href=\"https://deflock.org/\" rel=\"\">DeFlock</a></p><p>In fact, it’s hard to think of a tech product or project this side of generative AI that is more roundly opposed and reviled, on a bipartisan level, than Flock, and resistance takes many forms and stripes. Here’s the YouTuber Benn Jordan, showing his viewers how to Flock-proof their license plates and render their vehicles illegible to the company’s data ingestion systems:</p><p>In his GoFundMe, Sovern also mentioned the support for him he’d seen on forums online, so I went over to Reddit to get a sense for how his actions were being received online. Here was the page that shared news of his arrest for destroying the Flock cameras:</p><p>There was, in other words, nearly universal support for Sovern’s Flock dismantling campaign. Bear in mind that this is r/Norfolk, and while it’s still reddit users we’re talking about, it’s not like this is r/anarchism here: </p><p>The San Diego reddit threads carrying news of the destroyed Flock equipment told a similar story:</p><p>There were plenty of outright endorsements of the sabotage:</p><p>Off the message boards and in real civic life, Bill Paul, the reporter with the San Diego Slacker, says anger is boiling over, too. He points again to that heated December 2025 city council meeting, in which public outrage was left unaddressed. The city, perhaps aware of the stigma Flock now carries, apparently tried to highlight that their focus was on the “smart streetlights” made by another company, while downplaying the fact that those streetlights run on Flock software. </p><p>“San Diego gets to hide behind a slight facade in that their contract is with Ubicquia,” the smart streetlight manufacturer, Paul says, “but the software layer is Flock. You can easily see Flock hardware on retail properties, looking at the same citizens, with zero oversight, and SDPD can claim they have clean hands.” </p><p>Weeks later, pieces of smashed Flock cameras littered the ground.</p><p>Across the country, in other words, municipal governments are overriding public will to make deals with a profiteering tech company to surveil their citizens and to collaborate with federal agencies like ICE. It might be taken as a sign of the times that in states and cities across the US, thousands of miles apart, those opposed to the technology are refusing to countenance what they view as violations of privacy and civil liberty, and are instead taking up vice grips and metal cutters. And in many cases, they’re getting hailed by their peers as heroes. </p><p><em><a href=\"https://signal.me/#eu/E2j_txDDi5ubEMjBPwi1kTT0GsEbfgUTsHtQp_1zAJm0PsnmYf9PLbFYZb9vyXYx\" rel=\"\">Signal</a></em></p><p><em><a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/gleemie.bsky.social\" rel=\"\">Lilly Irani</a></em></p><p>In case you missed it, I shared my five takeaways on the most recent round of ultraheated AI discourse here:</p><p>The exchange was filmed and recorded on YouTube:</p><blockquote><p>Police in Claremore, Oklahoma arrested a local man after he went slightly over his time giving public remarks during a city council meeting opposing a proposed data center. Darren Blanchard showed up at a Claremore City Council meeting on Tuesday to talk about public records and the data center. When he went over his allotted 3 minutes by a few seconds, the city had him arrested and charged with trespassing.</p><p><a href=\"https://claremore.com/project-mustang-faq/?ref=404media.co\" rel=\"\">Project Mustang</a></p><p>The public hearing was a chance for the city council to address some of these concerns and all residents were given a strict three minute time limit. The entire event was livestreamed and archive of it is on YouTube. Blanchard was warned, barely, to “respect the process” by one of the council members but was clearly finishing reading from papers he had brought to read from, was not belligerent, and went over time by just a few seconds. Anyone who has ever attended or watched a city council meeting anywhere will know that people go over their time at essentially any meeting that includes public comment.</p><p>Blanchard arrived with documents in hand and questions about public records requests he’d made. During his remarks, people clapped and cheered and he asked that this not be counted against his three minutes. “There are major concerns about the public process in Claremore,” Blanchard said, referencing compliance documents and irregularities he’d uncovered in public records.</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://www.newson6.com/tulsa-oklahoma-news/arrest-made-during-heated-claremore-meeting-over-proposed-data-center\" rel=\"\">a local anchor defending </a></p><p>On Wednesday, I headed to Pershing Square in downtown Los Angeles, where dozens of gig workers and organizers with Rideshare Drivers United had assembled to deliver a petition to the California Labor Commission signed by thousands of workers, calling on the body to deliver a settlement on their behalf. Organizers made short speeches on the steps of the square while local radio and TV stations captured the moment. “</p><p>“They’re robbing us!” A speaker yelled. “Wage theft!” the crowd replied.</p><p>The Labor Commission is suing the gig companies on drivers’ behalf, alleging that Uber and Lyft stole billions of dollars worth of wages from drivers before Prop 22 was enacted in 2020. The commission is believed to be in negotiations with the gig companies right now that will determine a settlement.</p><p>I spoke with one driver, Karen, who had traveled from San Diego to join the demonstration, and asked her why she came. “It’s important we build driver power” she said. “Without driver power, we won’t get what we need, and we just want fairness.” She said she was hoping to claim at least $20,000 in stolen wages. </p><p>“We’re fighting for wages that were stolen for us from us and continue to be stolen from us every single day by these app companies from hell,” RDU organizer Nicole Moore told me. “So we’re marching in downtown L.A. to deliver 10,000 signatures of drivers demanding that the state fight hard for us, and don’t let these companies rip us off.”</p><p><a href=\"https://electrek.co/2026/02/17/tesla-robotaxi-adds-5-more-crashes-austin-month-4x-worse-than-humans/\" rel=\"\">Electrek reports</a></p><blockquote><p>With 14 crashes now on the books, Tesla’s “Robotaxi” crash rate in Austin continues to deteriorate. Extrapolating from Tesla’s Q4 2025 earnings mileage data, which showed roughly 700,000 cumulative paid miles through November, the fleet likely reached around 800,000 miles by mid-January 2026. That works out to one crash every 57,000 miles.</p><p>Using NHTSA’s broader police-reported crash average of roughly one per 500,000 miles, the picture is even worse, Tesla’s fleet is crashing at approximately 8 times the human rate.</p></blockquote><p>Okay okay, that’s it for this week.

A business-as-usual dependency bump is a woefully insufficient remediation for an actual vulnerability, but it’s the only practical response to the constant stream of low-value Dependabot alerts.</p><p>This is why as Go Security Team lead back in 2020–2021 I insisted the team invest in staffing the Go Vulnerability Database and implement a vulnerability scanner with static analysis filtering.</p><p>The govulncheck Action will not automatically open a PR for you, and that’s a good thing! Now that security alerts are not mostly noise, you can afford to actually look at them and take them seriously, including any required remediation.</p><p>Noisy vulnerability scanners also impact the open source ecosystem. I often get issues and PRs demanding I update the dependencies of my projects due to vulnerabilities that don’t affect them, because someone’s scanner is failing to filter them. That’s extra toil dropped at the feet of open source maintainers, which is unsustainable. The maintainer’s <a href=\"https://geomys.org/standard-of-care\">responsibility</a> is making sure projects are not affected by security vulnerabilities. The responsibility of scanning tools is making sure they don’t disturb their users with false positives.</p><h2>Test against latest instead of updating</h2><p>The other purpose of Dependabot is to keep dependencies up to date, regardless of security vulnerabilities. Your practices and requirements will vary, but I find this misguided, too.</p><p>Dependencies should be updated according to  development cycle, not the cycle of each of your dependencies. For example you might want to update dependencies all at once when you begin a release development cycle, as opposed to when each dependency completes theirs.</p><p>There are two benefits to quick updates, though: first, you can notice and report (or fix) breakage more rapidly, instead of being stalled by an incompatibility that could have been addressed a year prior; second, you reduce your patch delta  you need to update due to a security vulnerability, reducing the risk of having to rush through a refactor or unrelated fixes.</p><p>You can capture both of those benefits without actually updating the dependencies by simply running CI against the latest versions of your dependencies every day. You just need to run  before your test suite. In the npm ecosystem, you just run  instead of .</p><p>This way, you will still be alerted quickly of any potential issues, without having to pay attention to unproblematic updates, which you can defer to whenever fits your project best.</p><pre><code>name: Go tests\non:\n  push:\n  pull_request:\n  schedule: # daily at 10:22 UTC\n    - cron: '22 10 * * *'\n  workflow_dispatch:\npermissions:\n  contents: read\njobs:\n  test:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    strategy:\n      fail-fast: false\n      matrix:\n        go:\n          - { go-version: stable }\n          - { go-version-file: go.mod }\n        deps:\n          - locked\n          - latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v5\n        with:\n          persist-credentials: false\n      - uses: actions/setup-go@v6\n        with:\n          go-version: ${{ matrix.go.go-version }}\n          go-version-file: ${{ matrix.go.go-version-file }}\n      - uses: geomys/sandboxed-step@v1.2.1\n        with:\n          run: |\n            if [ \"${{ matrix.deps }}\" = \"latest\" ]; then\n              go get -u -t ./...\n            fi\n            go test -v ./...\n</code></pre><p>The Tevere has overflowed its lower banks, so a lot of previously familiar landscapes have changed slightly, almost eerily.

      "content": "<p>I'm a diving instructor. I'm also a platform engineer who spends lots of his time thinking about and implementing infrastructure security. Sometimes those two worlds collide in unexpected ways.</p><p>While on a 14 day-long dive trip around Cocos Island in Costa Rica, I stumbled across a vulnerability in the member portal of a major diving insurer - one that I'm personally insured through. What I found was so trivial, so fundamentally broken, that I genuinely couldn't believe it hadn't been exploited already.</p><p>I disclosed this vulnerability on  with a standard 30-day embargo period. That embargo expired on May 28, 2025 - over . I waited this long to publish because I wanted to give the organization every reasonable opportunity to fully remediate the issue and notify affected users. The vulnerability has since been addressed, but to my knowledge, I have not received confirmation that affected users were notified. I have reached out to the organization to ask for clarification on this matter.</p><p>This is the story of what happened when I tried to do the right thing.</p><p>To understand why this is so bad, you need to know how the registration process works. As a diving instructor, I register my students (to get them insured) through my account on the portal. I enter their personal information with their consent - name, date of birth, address, phone number, email - and the system creates an account for them. The student then receives an email with their new account credentials: a numeric user ID and a default password. They  log in to complete additional information, or they might never touch the portal again.</p><p>When I registered three students in quick succession, they were sitting right next to me and checked their welcome emails. The user IDs were nearly identical - sequential numbers, one after the other. That's when it clicked that something really bad was going on.</p><p>Now here's the problem: the portal used <strong>incrementing numeric user IDs</strong> for login. User XXXXXX0, XXXXXX1, XXXXXX2, and so on. That alone is a red flag, but it gets worse: every account was provisioned with a  that was never enforced to be changed on first login. And many users - especially students who had their accounts created  them by their instructors - never changed it.</p><p>So the \"authentication\" to access a user's full profile - name, address, phone number, email, date of birth - was:</p><ol><li>Type the same default password that every account shares on account creation.</li><li>There's a good chance you get in.</li></ol><p>That's it. No rate limiting. No account lockout. No MFA. Just an incrementing integer and a password that might as well have been .</p><p>I verified the issue with the minimum access necessary to confirm the scope - and stopped immediately after.</p><p>I did everything by the book. I contacted  (MaltaCIP) first - since the organization is registered in Malta, this is the competent national authority. The Maltese <a href=\"https://mdia.gov.mt/app/uploads/2024/12/P-SPG-001-National-Coordinated-Vulnerability-Disclosure-Policy.pdf\">National Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure Policy (NCVDP)</a> explicitly requires that confirmed vulnerabilities be reported to both the responsible organization  CSIRTMalta.</p><p>Then I emailed the organisation directly, CC'ing CSIRT:</p><blockquote><p>As a fellow diving instructor insured through [the organization] and a full-time Linux Platform Engineer, I am contacting you to responsibly disclose a critical vulnerability I identified within the [the organization]'s user account system.</p><p>During recent testing, I discovered that user accounts - including those of underage students - are accessible through a combination of predictable User ID enumeration (incrementing user IDs) and the use of a static default password that is not enforced to be changed upon first login. This misconfiguration currently exposes sensitive personal data (e.g., names, addresses, contact information - including phone numbers and emails -, dates of birth) and represents multiple GDPR violations.</p><ul><li>Password reuse across accounts without forced password reset</li><li>Predictable, incremental user ID enumeration</li><li>Exposure of sensitive and underage user data without adequate safeguards</li></ul><p>For initial confirmation, I am attaching a screenshot from Member ID XXXXXXX showing the exposed data, partly redacted for privacy reasons.</p><p>Additionally, for transparency and validation, I have shared my proof-of-concept code securely via an encrypted paste service: [link redacted]</p><p>In the spirit of responsible disclosure, I have already informed CSIRT Malta (in CC) to officially initiate a reporting process, given [the organization]'s operational presence in Malta.</p><p>I kindly request that [the organization] acknowledges receipt of this disclosure within 7 days.</p><p>I am offering a window of 30 days from today the 28th of April 2025 for [the organization] to mitigate or resolve the vulnerability before I consider any public disclosure.</p><p>Please note that I am fully available to assist your IT team with technical details, verification steps and recommendations from a security perspective.</p><p>I strongly recommend assigning an IT-Security Point of Contact (PoC) for direct collaboration on this issue.</p><p>Thank you very much for your attention to this critical matter. I am looking forward to working with you towards a secure resolution.</p></blockquote><p>Both of these timelines are standard - if anything, generous - in responsible disclosure frameworks.</p><p>Two days later, I got a reply. Not from their IT team. From their <strong>Data Privacy Officers (DPO's) law firm</strong>.</p><p>The letter opened politely enough - they acknowledged the issue and said they'd launched an investigation. They even mentioned they were resetting default passwords and planning to roll out 2FA. Good.</p><p>But then the tone shifted:</p><blockquote><p>While we genuinely appreciate your seemingly good intentions and transparency in highlighting this matter to our attention, we must respectfully note that notifying the authorities prior to contacting the Group creates additional complexities in how the matter is perceived and addressed and also exposes us to unfair liability.</p></blockquote><p>Let me translate: <em>\"We wish you hadn't told the government about our security issue.\"</em></p><blockquote><p>We also do not appreciate your threat to make this matter public [...] and remind you that you may be held accountable for any damage we, or the data subjects, may suffer as a result of your own actions, which actions likely constitute a criminal offence under Maltese law.</p></blockquote><p>So, to be clear: their portal had a default password on every account, exposing personal data including that of children, and  the one who \"likely\" committed a criminal offence by finding it and telling them.</p><p>They also sent a  they wanted me to sign - while requesting my passport ID - confirming I'd deleted all data, wouldn't disclose anything, and would keep the entire matter \"strictly confidential.\" The deadline? <strong>End of business the same day they sent it.</strong></p><p>This declaration included the following gem:</p><blockquote><p>I also declare that I shall keep the content of this declaration strictly confidential.</p></blockquote><p>That's an NDA with extra steps: I was being asked to sign away my right to discuss the disclosure process itself - including the fact that I found a vulnerability in their system - under threat of legal action.</p><p>Then came the reminders. One \"friendly\" reminder. Then an \"urgent\" one. Sign the declaration. De-escalate. Move on. Quietly.</p><p>I generally refuse to sign confidentiality clauses in cases involving exposure of sensitive information, and I did so here as well. Coordinated disclosure depends on transparency and trust between researchers and organizations: trust that affected users will be informed, and trust that a report leads to real remediation.</p><p>Given that the organization in question had already breached that trust by exposing personal data through weak controls, I wasn’t willing to grant blanket confidentiality that could be used to keep the incident out of public scrutiny. And with trying to actual silence me through legal threats, they had already made it clear that their priority was <strong>reputation management over user data protection.</strong> So I stood my ground.</p><p>Instead, I offered to sign a modified declaration confirming data deletion. I had no interest in retaining anyone’s personal data, but I was not going to agree to silence about the disclosure process itself.</p><p>I also pointed out that, under Malta’s NCVDP, involving CSIRT Malta is part of the expected reporting path - not a hostile act - and that publishing post-remediation analyses is standard practice in the security community.</p><p><strong>Their response doubled down.</strong> They cited Article 337E of the Maltese Criminal Code - computer misuse - and helpfully reminded me that:</p><blockquote><p>Art. 337E of the Criminal Code also provides that \"If any act is committed outside Malta which, had it been committed in Malta, would have constituted an offence [...] it shall [...] be deemed to have been committed in Malta.\" Meaning that your actions would be deemed a criminal offence in Malta, even if committed in another country.</p></blockquote><p>They also made their position on disclosure crystal clear, after I reiterated my refusal to sign their NDA:</p><blockquote><p>We object strongly to the use of [the organization's name] in any such blogs or conferences you may write/attend as this would be a disproportionate harm to [the organization's] reputation [...]. We reserve our rights at law to hold you responsible for any damages [the organization] may suffer as a result of any such public disclosures you may make.</p></blockquote><p>That's fine by me. Because here's the thing: <strong>The vulnerability has been fixed.</strong> Default passwords have been reset. 2FA is being rolled out. I feel sorry for the developer(s) who had to clean up this mess, but at least the issue is no longer exploitable. Sure, it would have been better if the organization had thanked me and taken responsibility for notifying affected users. If the incident qualified as a personal data breach (which it does) and was likely to result in a (high) risk to individuals - especially given minors were involved - GDPR Articles 33 and 34 generally <strong>require notification to the supervisory authority and communication to affected data subjects</strong>.</p><blockquote><p>GDPR Article 34(1) When the personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller shall communicate the personal data breach to the data subject without undue delay.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>GDPR Article 34(2) The communication to the data subject referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall describe in clear and plain language the nature of the personal data breach and contain at least the information and measures referred to in points (b), (c) and (d) of Article 33(3).</p></blockquote><p>I have not received confirmation that those notifications were ever carried out.</p><p>My favourite part was the organization's position on whose fault this actually was:</p><blockquote><p>We contend that it is the responsibility of users to change their own password (after we allocate a default one).</p></blockquote><p>Read that again.

By February 9th, ads were live. Eight months earlier,\n      OpenAI spent $6.5 billion to acquire Jony Ive's hardware startup io.\n      They're building a pocket-sized, screenless device with built-in cameras\n      and microphones -- \"contextually aware,\" designed to replace your phone.\n    </p><p>\n      But this isn't a post about OpenAI. They're just the latest. The problem\n      is structural.\n    </p><p>\n      And every one of them is building hardware designed to see and hear\n      everything around you, all day, every day. These two facts are on a\n      collision course, and local on-device inference is the only way off the\n      track.\n    </p><h2>The always-on future is inevitable</h2><p>\n      Before we talk about who's building it, let's be clear about\n       being built.\n    </p><p>\n      Every mainstream voice assistant today works behind a gate. You say a\n      magic word -- \"Hey Siri,\" \"OK Google,\" \"Alexa\" -- and only then does the\n      system listen. Everything before the wake word is theoretically discarded.\n    </p><p>\n      This was a reasonable design in 2014. It is a dead end for where AI\n      assistance needs to go.\n    </p><p>\n      Here's what happens in a real kitchen at 6:30am:</p><blockquote>\n      \"Are we out of eggs again? I'm thinking frittata tonight but we also need\n      to -- oh wait, did the school email about Thursday? I think there's a\n      early release. Anyway, if we don't have eggs, I'll get them from Target\n      and also that dish soap, the blue one.\"\n    </blockquote><p>\n      Nobody is going to preface that with a wake word. The information is woven\n      into natural speech between two flustered parents getting the family ready\n      to leave the house. The moment you require a trigger, you lose the most\n      valuable interactions -- the ones that happen while people are living\n      their lives, not thinking of how to give context to an AI assistant.\n    </p><p>\n      You cannot build proactive assistance behind a wake word. The AI has to be\n      present in the room, continuously, accumulating context over days and\n      weeks and months, to build the understanding that makes proactive help\n      possible.\n    </p><p>\n      This is where every major AI company is heading. Not just audio -- vision,\n      presence detection, wearables, multi-room awareness. The next generation\n      of AI assistants will hear and see everything. Some will be on your face\n      or in your ears all day. They will be always on, always sensing, always\n      building a model of your life.\n    </p><p><strong>\n        The question is not  always-on AI will happen. It's who\n        controls the data it collects. And right now, the answer to that\n        question is: advertising companies.</strong></p><h2>Policy is a promise. Architecture is a guarantee.</h2><p>\n      Here's where the industry's response gets predictable. \"We encrypt the\n      data in transit.\" \"We delete it after processing.\" \"We anonymize\n      everything.\" \"Ads don't influence the AI's answers.\" \"Read our privacy\n      policy.\"</p><p>\n      OpenAI's own ad announcement includes this language: \"OpenAI keeps\n      conversations with ChatGPT private from advertisers, and never sells data\n      to advertisers.\" It sounds reassuring. But Google\n      <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_concerns_with_Google#Gmail\">scanned every Gmail for ad targeting for thirteen years</a>\n      before quietly stopping in 2017. Policies change. Architectures don't.\n    </p><p>Policy is a promise. Architecture is a guarantee.</p><p>\n      When a device processes data locally, the data\n      <em>physically cannot leave the network</em>. There is no API endpoint to\n      call. There is no telemetry pipeline. There is no \"anonymized usage data\"\n      that somehow still contains enough signal to be useful for ad targeting.\n      The inference hardware sits inside the device or in the user's home, on\n      their network.\n    </p><p>\n      Your email is sensitive. A continuous audio and visual feed of your home\n      is something else entirely. It captures arguments, breakdowns, medical\n      conversations, financial discussions, intimate moments, parenting at its\n      worst, the completely unguarded version of people that exists only when\n      they believe nobody is watching.</p><h2>The edge inference stack is ready</h2><p>\n      The counterargument is always the same: \"Local models aren't good enough.\"\n      Three years ago, that was true. It is no longer true.\n    </p><p>\n      You can run a complete ambient AI pipeline today -- real-time\n      speech-to-text, semantic memory, conversational reasoning, text-to-speech,\n      etc -- on a device that fits next to a cable box (remember those?). No fan\n      noise. A one-time hardware purchase with no per-query fee and no data\n      leaving the building. New model architectures, better compression, and\n      open-source inference engines have converged to make this possible, and\n      the silicon roadmap points in one direction: more capability per watt,\n      every year.</p><p>\n      Are local models as capable as the best cloud models? No. But we're\n      usually not asking our smart speaker to re-derive the Planck constant.\n    </p><p>\n      Hardware that runs inference on-device. Models that process audio and\n      video locally and never transmit it.\n      <strong>There needs to be a business model based on selling the hardware and\n        software, not the data the hardware collects. An architecture where the\n        company that makes the device  the data\n        it processes, because there is no connection to access it\n        through.</strong></p><p>\n      The most helpful AI will also be the most intimate technology ever built.\n      It will hear everything. See everything. Know everything about the family.\n      The only architecture that keeps that technology safe is one where it is\n      structurally incapable of betraying that knowledge. Not policy. Not\n      promises. Not a privacy setting that can be quietly removed in a March\n      software update.\n    </p><p>\n      Choose local. Choose edge. Build the AI that knows everything but phones\n      home nothing.\n    </p>",

Like, I knew everyone under 50 had moved on, but I didn't realize the extent of the slop conveyor belt that's replaced us.</p><p>I logged on for the first time in ~8 years to see if there was a group for my neighborhood (there wasn't). Out of curiosity I thought I'd scroll a bit down the main feed.</p><p>The first post was the latest xkcd (a page I follow). The next  were not by friends or pages I follow. They were basically all thirst traps of young women, mostly AI-generated, with generic captions. Here's a sampler — mildly NSFW, but I did leave out a couple of the lewder ones:</p><div><img src=\"https://pilk.website/3/ai-thirst-traps.png\" alt=\"A collage of Facebook posts of random women in revealing clothing\"><div><p>Click to show mildly sensitive content (revealing clothing)</p></div></div><p>Yikes.

It's the main page of the site! It's the product that defined modern social media!</p><p>It wasn't all like that, though. There was also an AI video of a policeman confiscating a little boy's bike, only to bring him a brand new one:</p><img src=\"https://pilk.website/3/ai-police.png\" alt=\"Facebook post of an AI generated video with a policeman and child\"><p>And there were some sloppy memes and jokes, mostly about relationships, like this (admittedly not AI) video sketch where a woman decides to intentionally start a fight with her boyfriend because she's on her period:</p><img src=\"https://pilk.website/3/boyfriend-sketch.png\" alt=\"Facebook post of a video sketch\"><img src=\"https://pilk.website/3/ai-questions.png\" alt=\"Suggested AI prompt: why do women feel refreshed after arguments?\"><p>Yep, that's another \"yikes\" from me. To be fair, though, sometimes that suggested questions feature is pretty useful! Like with this post, for example:</p><img src=\"https://pilk.website/3/ai-questions-2.png\" alt=\"Facebook post with photos of a woman in a short dress, possibly AI. Suggested AT prompts are: why is she wearing pink heels? What is the woman's personality?\"><p>Why  she wearing pink heels? What  her personality? Great questions, Meta.</p><p>I said these were \"mostly\" AI-generated. The truth is with how good the models are getting these days, it's hard to tell, and I think a couple of them might be real people.</p><p>Still, some of these are pretty obviously AI. Here's one with a bunch of alien text and mangled logos on the scoreboard in the background:</p><img src=\"https://pilk.website/3/ai-football.png\" alt=\"Facebook post of an AI photo of a woman in a football stadium\"><p>Hmm, I wonder if anyone has noticed this is AI?

(I dunno, maybe those are all bots too.)</p><p>So: is this just something wacky with my algorithm?</p><p>I mean... maybe? That's part of the whole thing with these algorithmic feeds; it's hard to know if anyone else is seeing what I'm seeing.</p><p>On the one hand, I doubt most (straight) women's feeds would look like this. But on the other hand, I hadn't logged in in nearly a decade! I hate to think what the feed looks like for some lonely old guy who's been scrolling the lightly-clothed AI gooniverse for hours every day.</p><p>Did everyone but me know it was like this? I'd seen screencaps of stuff like the Jesus-statue-made-out-of-broccoli slop a year or two ago, but I thought that only happened to grandmas. I hadn't heard it was this bad.</p><p>I wonder if this evolution was less noticeable for people who are logging in every day. Or maybe it only gets this bad when there aren't any posts from your actual friends?</p><p>In any case, I stopped exploring after I saw a couple more of those AI-generated pictures but with girls that looked like they were about ~14, which made me sick to my stomach. So long Facebook, see you never, until one day I inexplicably need to use your platform to get updates from my kid's school.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Everybody wants better sleep, but getting better sleep is hard.</p><p><strong>no, blue light filters don’t work, but there are many more useful things that someone can do to control their light intake to improve their sleep</strong></p><p>My longer answer is usually a half-hour rant about why they don’t work, covering everything from a tiny nucleus of cells above the optic chiasm, to people living in caves without direct access to sunlight, to neuropeptides, the different cones, how monitors work, gamma curves, what I learned running ismy.blue, corn bulbs, melatonin, finally sharing my Apple Watch &amp; WHOOP stats. What follows is slightly more than you needed to know about blue light filters and more effective ways to control your circadian rhythm. Spoiler: the real lever is total luminance, not color.</p><p>Right above the optic chiasm lies a nucleus called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). This is where the brain’s master circadian clock lives. There are a lot of phenomena in the body, whether alertness, body temperature, or hunger, that are at least partially dependent on our body’s sense of time. There’s a set of neurons that are part of the hypothalamus that autonomously track time, by a fascinating set of transcription-translation feedback loops involving proteins that ultimately shut down their own translation in a cycle that lasts about 24 hours. The cells in the SCN also synchronize with each other through neuropeptides, and diffuse the master clock signal throughout the body; melatonin from the pineal gland, but also via secondary regulation of the HPA (stress axis), and a neuropeptide called AVP.</p><p>The intrinsic clock is not very precise, with a cycle that typically lasts a little more than 24 hours, something which was first verified in people living deep underground in abandoned mines (for science!). One factor that ultimately resets the clock is input from a set of neurons  inside the retina that project to this nucleus. Those cells are called intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs). Breaking this down:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Intrinsically photosensitive</strong></p></li></ul><p><strong>often said to be sensitive to blue</strong></p><p><strong>It’s not sensitive to blue, it’s sensitive to cyan (and blue and green)</strong></p><p>Unless your strategy is to create a photo-lab-like screen in pure black and red, or wear deep-red-tinted glasses, it’s unlikely that a pure colorshift strategy will cut out that big of a chunk of the spectrum. </p><p><a href=\"https://osf.io/shg3t/overview\" rel=\"\">The PsyCalibrator paper’s appendix</a></p><p>I tested this with Apple’s Night Shift on my M1 Macbook Air. I was surprised to find that the mapping function is very simple: LMS responses can be mapped linearly via matrix multiplication between standard and night-shifted colors (R^2 = .997). This is surprising because Night Shift could do all sorts of complicated things, like a nonlinear look-up table (LUT). As luck would have it, the transformation is linear, and more than that, almost diagonal, facilitating analysis.</p><pre><code><code> L         M         S\nL [ +0.979   -0.116   +0.013 ]\nM [ +0.162   +0.636   -0.022 ]\nS [ +0.140   -0.102   +0.384 ]\n</code></code></pre><p>Reading off the diagonal, to a good approximation, it tells us that:</p><ul><li><p>Night Shift maintains L (red) luminance</p></li><li><p>Night Shift decreases M (green) luminance by about 40%</p></li><li><p>Night Shift decreases S (blue) luminance by about 60%</p></li></ul><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamerism_(color)\" rel=\"\">color metamerism</a></p><p><a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6561503/\" rel=\"\">Nagaro et al (2019)</a></p><p><strong>6 orders of magnitude of luminance</strong><a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1901824116\" rel=\"\">Phillips et al. (2019)</a></p><p>They found that the curve is quite shallow. Halving the luminance, at best (around 20 lux baseline) might get you from 50% to 25% melatonin suppression.</p><p><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33867308/\" rel=\"\">the biggest study I could find of Night Shift mode (still a pretty small study) found little effect on sleep</a></p><p><a href=\"https://ismy.blue/\" rel=\"\">ismy.blue</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/sep/16/blue-green-viral-test-color-perception\" rel=\"\">ismy.blue is a website I made to settle an argument with my wife</a></p><p>You can see this in aggregate in the mean thresholds as a function of solar time. Solar time is a standardized time basis where midnight corresponds to solar midnight, noon to solar noon, 6AM to sunrise, 6PM to sunset. Thresholds are stable during the day, but jump around at night, in the direction that you would expect (they rise, especially on platforms with built-in filtering like Mac &amp; iPhone).</p><p>So I did something a little cheeky: I fit a mixture model for the threshold with two bumps: one for regular users, and one for blue-filter users 15 degrees to the right. Importantly, I fit different mixture weights depending on solar time. Perhaps I could have used a mixture of t-distributions instead, there are mix shifts I haven’t fully thought about, etc. Still, it’s an interesting data point.</p><p>As you can see, the proportion of blue-light filter users in my sample is quite large; at its peak during the night, 25% of iPhone users and 33% of Mac users were on Night Shift. I’ll note that the proportion of estimated blue filter never goes to exactly 0 during the day, so some putative blue light filter users might have true idiosyncratic thresholds on monitors with normal colors, or wildly miscalibrated or broken screens. On the other hand, the proportion at night is likely an undercount, since some would have (wisely, as instructed) turned off their blue light filters prior to taking the test. My guess is it probably comes out as a wash. </p><p>Overall, it means that blue light filters are quite commonly used, especially on platforms that them built in (e.g. Mac).</p><blockquote><p>Disclaimer: I’m not an MD, nor a sleep specialist, this is not medical advice. Talk to your MD.</p></blockquote><p>If it feels like it’s almost too much (e.g. the backgrounds are typically shifted to dark gray rather than pure black), remember that light perception is logarithmic, and that raw RGB values are translated to screen luminance via a gamma function whose exponent on Mac is 2.2. That means that dark grays can have far less light in absolute terms than the number implied by a linear scale. For instance, the dark gray #101010 has a relative luminance of (1/16)^2.2 compared to white #ffffff; about ~450 times darker.</p><p>That’s all great, but there are websites that still don’t have dark modes. It doesn’t make any sense in 2026 that Gmail doesn’t have a dark mode. If the activity you’re doing most at night is reading email, you might consider an alternative email client.</p><p>The screen brightness control on Mac has 17 notches, with the lowest corresponding to completely black. Here’s how much light I measured from the SpyderX with a dark grey uniform stimulus as a function of this setting. The first half of the scale is approximately exponential, the second half linear. You can decrease the amount of light coming from your screen by more than half simply by dimming the screen by several notches. Just make sure, if you use a laptop/second screen combo like I do, that the brightness of the second screen is synced to your primary screen; I set up the free MonitorControl app recently to do this.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2100094118\" rel=\"\">Research in rodents</a><a href=\"https://blog.plover.com/tech/corn-bulbs.html\" rel=\"\">LED light is incredibly cheap these days</a></p><p>If you stack the three previous advice sections together, you could gain as much as 2-3 order of magnitude peak-to-trough luminance throughout your day. That might be enough to support your circadian rhythm health. If that’s not enough, however, recall that one of the ultimate outputs of the SCN is through the pineal gland, which releases of melatonin. Partly, it’s the inhibition of circulating melatonin that is causally responsible for sleep phase shift. It’s possible to remedy that by taking exogenous melatonin an hour before bed to facilitate the onset of sleep.</p><p><strong>Be very wary of melatonin dose</strong><a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/07/10/melatonin-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/\" rel=\"\">Slate Star Codex post</a></p>",

That catches common issues, like exposed passwords or outdated encryption, but often misses more complex vulnerabilities, like flaws in business logic or broken access control.</p><p>Rather than scanning for known patterns, Claude Code Security reads and reasons about your code the way a human security researcher would: understanding how components interact, tracing how data moves through your application, and catching complex vulnerabilities that rule-based tools miss.</p><p>Every finding goes through a multi-stage verification process before it reaches an analyst. Claude re-examines each result, attempting to prove or disprove its own findings and filter out false positives. Findings are also assigned severity ratings so teams can focus on the most important fixes first.</p><p>Validated findings appear in the Claude Code Security dashboard, where teams can review them, inspect the suggested patches, and approve fixes. Because these issues often involve nuances that are difficult to assess from source code alone, Claude also provides a confidence rating for each finding. Nothing is applied without human approval: Claude Code Security identifies problems and suggests solutions, but developers always make the call.</p><h2><strong>Using Claude for cybersecurity</strong></h2><p>Claude Code Security builds on more than a year of research into Claude’s cybersecurity capabilities. Our Frontier Red Team has been stress-testing these abilities systematically: entering Claude in <a href=\"https://red.anthropic.com/2025/ai-for-cyber-defenders/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">competitive Capture-the-Flag events</a>, partnering with Pacific Northwest National Laboratory to <a href=\"https://red.anthropic.com/2026/critical-infrastructure-defense/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">experiment with using AI to defend critical infrastructure</a>, and refining Claude’s ability to find and patch real vulnerabilities in code.</p><p>Claude’s cyberdefensive abilities have improved substantially as a result. Using <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Claude Opus 4.6</a>, released earlier this month, our team <a href=\"https://red.anthropic.com/2026/zero-days/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">found over 500 vulnerabilities</a> in production open-source codebases—bugs that had gone undetected for decades, despite years of expert review. We’re working through triage and responsible disclosure with maintainers now, and we plan to expand our security work with the open-source community.</p><p>We also use Claude to review our own code, and we’ve found it to be extremely effective at securing Anthropic’s systems. We built Claude Code Security to make those same defensive capabilities more widely available. And since it’s built on Claude Code, teams can review findings and iterate on fixes within the tools they already use.</p><p>This is a pivotal time for cybersecurity. We expect that a significant share of the world’s code will be scanned by AI in the near future, given how effective models have become at finding long-hidden bugs and security issues.</p><p>Attackers will use AI to find exploitable weaknesses faster than ever. But defenders who move quickly can find those same weaknesses, patch them, and reduce the risk of an attack. Claude Code Security is one step towards our goal of more secure codebases and a higher security baseline across the industry.</p><p>We’re opening a limited research preview of Claude Code Security to Enterprise and Team customers today. Participants will get early access and collaborate directly with our team to hone the tool’s capabilities. We also encourage open-source maintainers to apply for free, expedited access.</p><p>To learn more, visit <a href=\"http://claude.com/solutions/claude-code-security\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">claude.com/solutions/claude-code-security</a>.</p>",

We see a battle of PR campaigns and whomever has the last post out remains in the media memory as the truth, and having journalists just copy/paste Google posts serves no one.</p><p> Said what? That there’s a magical “advanced flow”? Did you see it? Did anyone experience it? When is it scheduled to be released? Was it part of Android 16 QPR2 in December? Of 16 QPR3 Beta 2.1 last week? Of Android 17 Beta 1? No? That’s the issue… As time marches on people were left with the impression that everything was done, fixed, Google “wasn’t evil” after all, this time, yay!</p><p>While we all have bad memories of “banners” as the dreaded ad delivery medium of the Internet, after FOSDEM we decided that we have to raise the issue back and have everyone, who cares about Android as an open platform, informed that we are running out of time until Google becomes the gate-keeper of all users devices.</p><p>Hence, the <a href=\"https://f-droid.org/en/\">website</a> and starting today our clients, with the updates of  and , feature a banner that reminds everyone how little time we have and how to voice their concerns to whatever local authority is able to understand the dangers of this path Android is led to.</p><p><em>We are not alone in our fight, <a href=\"https://izzyondroid.org/\">IzzyOnDroid</a> added a banner too, more F-Droid clients will add the warning banner soon and other app downloaders, like , already have an in-app warning dialogue.</em></p><p>Regarding  rewrite, development continues with a new release :</p><blockquote><ul><li>Export installed apps list as CSV</li><li>Add install history feature</li><li>Add mirror chooser setting</li><li>Add prevent screenshots setting</li><li>Show tool-tips for all app bar buttons</li><li>Create 3-dot overflow menu for My Apps for less frequently used actions</li><li>Persist sort order of My Apps</li><li>Adapt strings according to Material Design 3 guidelines</li><li>Apply string suggestions (Thanks Lucas)</li><li>Fix missing icon bug in pre-approval dialog</li></ul></blockquote><p><em>Note that if you are already using F-Droid Basic version , you won’t receive this update automatically. You need to navigate to the app inside F-Droid and toggle “Allow beta updates” in top right three dot menu.</em></p><p>In apps news, we’re slowly getting back on track with post Debian upgrade fixes <em>(if your app still uses Java 17 is there a chance you can upgrade to 21?)</em> and post FOSDEM delays. Every app is important to us, yet actions like the Google one above waste the time we could have put to better use in Gitlab.</p><p>  was updated to  after a two year hiatus.</p><p> and  were updated to  improving on cleaning up after banned users, a better QR workflow and better tablet rotation support. These are nice, but another change raises our interest, <em>“Play Store flavor: Stop using Google library and interface directly with Google Play Service via IPC”</em>. Sounds interesting for your app too? Is this a path to having one single version for both F-Droid and Play that is fully FLOSS? We don’t know yet, but we salute any trick that removes another proprietary dependency from the code.

Also all connections are handled now by WireGuard and Stealth protocols as the older OpenVPN was removed making the app almost 40% smaller.</p><p> was updated to  with a bit of code polish.

It can express length-indexed\n  vectors and other dependently typed programs. Not ML-family per se, but it\n  demonstrates that full dependent types need not be complex to implement.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>🤖 MiniML demonstrates the absolute floor for a native-code ML compiler. Using\n  Camlp4 for parsing and OCaml's LLVM bindings, it supports integer arithmetic,\n  conditionals, and recursive first-order functions. Xavier Leroy noted the\n  critical caveat: this is not truly \"Mini-ML\" since it lacks higher-order\n  first-class functions — adding closures and garbage collection would\n  significantly expand the codebase. Still, it shows what LLVM enables in ~100\n  lines.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>🤖  by Martin Grabmüller (~300 LOC, literate\n  Haskell) is the canonical educational implementation of Algorithm W for\n  Hindley-Milner type inference. Self-contained, well-commented, and widely\n  referenced — this is where most people first implement HM inference.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>🤖 A collection of standalone implementations of several inference algorithms\n  in OCaml (~300–600 LOC total): basic Algorithm W,  (the\n  technique foundational to Elm's original type system), and HMF (first-class\n  polymorphism with partial inference). Each variant is self-contained in a\n  single directory. Where Algorithm W Step by Step teaches you  algorithm\n  well, this repository shows you what changes when you swap in more powerful\n  type system features.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>🤖 A progressive collection of single-file lambda calculus implementations in\n  Haskell (~200–900 LOC each) by Solomon Bothwell. Starts with simply typed\n  evaluation and builds incrementally through bidirectional typechecking,\n  normalization by evaluation (NbE), System T, records with depth subtyping, and\n  nominal inductive types with dependent pattern matching. Each implementation\n  is self-contained. Where tomprimozic/type-systems varies the , this repository varies the  while keeping\n  bidirectional checking as the constant.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>🤖 <strong>Typing Haskell in Haskell</strong> by Mark P. Jones is the definitive executable\n  specification of Haskell 98's complete type system in just <strong>429 lines of core\nHaskell</strong>. It covers kinds, qualified types, type classes, pattern matching\n  types, binding groups, mutual recursion, and defaulting. For context, the Hugs\n  type checker implementing the same semantics spans 90+ pages of C. THIH is a\n  type checker only (no evaluation), but its density of specification per line\n  of code is unmatched.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>🤖  Lionel Parreaux's clean reimplementation of Stephen\n  Dolan's MLsub — algebraic subtyping that adds union and intersection types to\n  Hindley-Milner while preserving principal types. No annotations required. The\n  original MLsub won POPL 2017; Simple-sub distills it into an ICFP 2020 Pearl\n  that's small enough to read in one sitting. The ancestor of MLscript, which\n  grows the idea into a full language with OOP and TypeScript interop.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>🤖  Implements a lazy, purely functional language\n  with parametric polymorphism and HM type inference. Its sibling \n  (~300–500 LOC) includes a compiler targeting an abstract machine. Both are\n  part of Andrej Bauer's Programming Languages Zoo, which contains 12+ miniature\n  language implementations, each a few hundred lines of OCaml, covering\n  everything from untyped lambda calculus to call-by-push-value.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>🤖 <strong>~500 LOC JavaScript interpreter</strong>, full implementation in Gleam. EYG\n  (\"Eat Your Greens\") by Peter Saxton prioritizes predictability, portability,\n  and crash-free programs. It uses row-typed inference (HM extended with row\n  polymorphism), algebraic effects as the sole FFI mechanism, and closure\n  serialization — functions can be sent to other machines for tierless\n  client/server programming. The most distinctive feature: programs are stored\n  as JSON ASTs, not text files. A structural editor makes it impossible to write\n  syntactically invalid programs.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>🤖 An OCaml subset with HM type inference that compiles to WebAssembly,\n  implemented in TypeScript. Small and self-contained — unusual for having a\n  TypeScript host language rather than the OCaml/Haskell norm. A good starting\n  point if you want to understand ML compilation targeting the browser.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>🤖  Packs a lexer, parser, interpreter, and full\n  polymorphic HM type checker into under 700 lines of SML. Referenced on Lambda\n  the Ultimate, this may be the <strong>smallest complete implementation with genuine\nHindley-Milner inference</strong>, though the original download link appears to have\n  gone stale.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>🤖 The original algebraic effects language (2012) by Andrej Bauer and Matija\n  Pretnar. OCaml syntax with effect handlers as first-class constructs — you\n  declare effect operations, then install handlers that give them meaning. This\n  is where the idea was first made concrete in a running implementation. Koka,\n  Frank, OCaml 5's effect handlers, and virtually every subsequent algebraic\n  effects system trace lineage here.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>🤖  (POPL 2017) by Sam Lindley, Conor McBride, and Craig\n  McLaughlin. A strict effectful functional language where functions are\n  handlers that handle zero effects — and multihandlers generalize function\n  abstraction to handle multiple effect interfaces simultaneously. The insight:\n  the boundary between \"function\" and \"effect handler\" is artificial.\n  Implemented in Haskell. Lindley describes it as \"the one I'm most fond of\"\n  while noting it's \"basically unmaintained.\" That tension between conceptual\n  elegance and practical neglect is the story of many languages on this list.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>🤖 A JSON superset with bidirectional type checking and row polymorphism, by\n  Gabriella Gonzalez (author of Dhall). Designed explicitly as a\n  <strong>\"ready-to-fork\" language skeleton</strong> — if you need a typed DSL, clone Grace\n  and customize it. Has open records, open unions (polymorphic variants), and a\n  clean Haskell codebase that reads like a tutorial. No Hindley-Milner per se\n  (bidirectional instead), but closely related.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>🤖 A Haskell-like language implemented entirely as  via the\n  \"Type Systems as Macros\" technique, by Alexis King. Bidirectional type\n  inference, algebraic datatypes, pattern matching, typeclasses, higher-kinded\n  types, and higher-rank polymorphism — all implemented not as a separate\n  type-checker pass but as macro expansion. The meta-angle is the story: types\n  as macros rather than a traditional elaboration pipeline.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>🤖 A content-addressable pure functional language where every expression\n  reduces to a cryptographic hash, stored in a decentralized \"scrapyard\"\n  registry and referenced by hash or alias. The implementation is a\n  <strong>~1,300-line dependency-free Python interpreter in a single file</strong>, with a\n  baseline compiler to C (~500 LOC) and an SSA IR with SCCP/DCE optimization\n  (~1,000 LOC). Pattern matching is the sole control-flow mechanism. Compiles to\n  C, WebAssembly, and Cosmopolitan portable executables. Implemented primarily\n  by Max Bernstein.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>🤖 <strong>~2,000 LOC, OCaml → native code.</strong> The gold standard for\n  capability-to-code-size ratio. Written by Eijiro Sumii at Tohoku University,\n  it implements a strict, higher-order functional language with type inference,\n  closures, tuples, arrays, tail-call optimization, inline expansion, constant\n  folding, and graph-coloring register allocation. It compiles to SPARC,\n  PowerPC, and x86 assembly. On benchmarks including a ray tracer,\n  <strong>MinCaml-compiled code runs within 2× of GCC and OCaml's </strong> —\n  sometimes faster. The deliberate trade-off: it omits polymorphism, algebraic\n  data types, and pattern matching. Used in undergraduate compiler courses at\n  the University of Tokyo since 2001, where students build ray tracers compiled\n  by their own compilers running on custom CPUs.</p></blockquote><ul><li>: \"MinCaml: A Simple and Efficient Compiler for a Minimal Functional\nLanguage\" (FDPE 2005)</li><li>: <a href=\"https://github.com/rhysd/gocaml\">gocaml</a> (Go + LLVM\nreimplementation), <a href=\"https://github.com/cmaes/miniml\">miniml</a> (OCaml + LLVM,\n~1,500 LOC, adds LLVM backend to MinCaml's architecture)</li></ul><blockquote><p>🤖 <strong>~2,000 lines of Haskell + 350 lines of C.</strong> Arguably the most remarkable\n  bootstrapping achievement in this space. Starting from a 350-SLOC C runtime\n  that interprets combinatory logic, Lynn builds a chain of approximately 20\n  progressively more capable compilers, each written in the subset of Haskell\n  that the previous compiler can handle. The final compiler supports type\n  inference, type classes, algebraic data types, pattern matching, guards, where\n  clauses, monadic I/O, modules, and layout parsing — approaching . It compiles Haskell to combinatory logic via Kiselyov's bracket\n  abstraction algorithm, with graph reduction evaluation. Later stages even\n  target WebAssembly. The entire bootstrapping chain is reproducible from just a\n  C compiler.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>🤖  Andreas Rossberg unified ML's core and module\n  layers into a single language where modules are first-class values, types are\n  values, and functors are ordinary functions. It elaborates to System Fω with\n  HM-style inference. Won the <strong>ICFP Most Influential Paper Award in 2025</strong>. A\n  proof-of-concept interpreter, not optimized, but a conceptual breakthrough in\n  minimal surface area.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>🤖 A self-hosting OCaml subset compiler targeting native x86-64. ~3,000–5,000\n  LOC. Supports pattern matching, algebraic data types, recursive functions, and\n  closures. Does not implement type inference — it demonstrates the minimum\n  OCaml subset needed for self-compilation.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>🤖 A total (non-Turing-complete) typed configuration language. ~4K LOC core\n  Haskell. Normalization is guaranteed to terminate — you can always reduce a\n  Dhall expression to a normal form, which means imports resolve, functions\n  inline, and what you get is plain data. Based on a\n  Calculus-of-Constructions-derived type theory with records, unions, and\n  natural numbers. Has a formal specification and implementations in Haskell,\n  Rust, Go, and Clojure.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>🤖 Combines HM type inference, algebraic data types, pattern matching,\n  algebraic effects, and an ownership-like system for shared mutability. Written\n  in Rust, it uses  for native code generation. Actively developed,\n  aiming to bridge the Rust/OCaml divide.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>🤖 Surprisingly feature-rich for its size: generics, typeclasses, sum types,\n  pattern matching, first-class functions, currying, algebraic effects,\n  associated types, and totality checking. Its pipeline runs from lexing through\n  HIR type inference to MIR monomorphization and bytecode execution. Written in\n  Rust.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>🤖 A systems language with  and capability-based security. The\n  linear type checker is ~600 lines. OCaml bootstrap compiler targeting C.\n  Designed by Fernando Borretti to fit in one person's head — the spec is\n  deliberately small enough that a single developer can understand the entire\n  language. Not functional in the Haskell sense, but linear types make it\n  adjacent. An experiment in \"what if we took linear types seriously but kept\n  the language small.\"</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>🤖 A self-hosting OCaml subset compiler targeting native x86-64. ~5,000–8,000\n  LOC. Adds records, variants, references, and garbage collection beyond what\n  mlml supports. Triple self-hosting verified. Like mlml, it omits type\n  inference — demonstrating the minimum OCaml needed for self-compilation.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>🤖 Adds ML-family features (algebraic data types, exhaustive pattern matching,\n  Result/Option types) to Go's ecosystem by compiling to Go source code with\n  Rust-like syntax. Written in Rust.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>🤖 A research experiment from the Topos Institute extending Martin-Löf Type\n  Theory with native, first-class polynomial functors — the mathematical objects\n  underlying deterministic state machines and interactive systems. Written in\n  OCaml with Menhir parsing. Custom syntax for polynomial types (),\n  morphism arrows, and wiring operators. Dependent types (Pi, Sigma), finite-set\n  ADTs, and pattern matching via case elimination. An ended experiment, but a\n  unique point in the design space: what happens when you make polynomial\n  functors a language primitive rather than an encoding.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>🤖 <strong>~7K LOC, self-hosted, compiles to JavaScript.</strong> A dependently typed\n  language with Agda/Idris/Haskell-like syntax by Steve Dunham. Bidirectional\n  typechecking with normalization by evaluation (based on Elaboration Zoo),\n  typeclasses, ADTs with dependent pattern matching, case tree compilation,\n  trampoline-based TCO for mutually tail-recursive functions, and erasure of\n  compile-time-only values (0/ω quantities). Has a web playground and an LSP.\n  The compiler is written in Newt itself. Built as a learning exercise, but the\n  feature set — self-hosting, dependent types, typeclasses, erasure, LSP — puts\n  it well beyond most pedagogical implementations.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>🤖  Andreas Rossberg's most faithful\n  implementation of the Definition of Standard ML. It implements  including the full module system (signatures, structures, functors),\n  mapping rule-by-rule to the formal Definition. Jeremy Yallop recommends it as\n  the most readable SML implementation. It can be bundled into a single SML file\n  and compiled by any SML implementation. A  branch demonstrates\n  compilation to JavaScript.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>🤖 <strong>~10,000–15,000 LOC, TypeScript.</strong> Implements the full SML core language\n  in the browser: val/fun/datatype declarations, pattern matching, HM type\n  inference, exceptions, and references. Used for teaching at Saarland\n  University.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>🤖 By Lennart Augustsson (one of GHC's original creators) — the most complete\n  \"small\" Haskell compiler alive today. It compiles an extended subset of\n   including type classes, do-notation, deriving, record syntax,\n  overloaded literals, and modules. It is fully self-hosting and — critically —\n  <strong>bootstrappable from only a C compiler</strong> (no pre-existing Haskell toolchain\n  required). MicroHs translates Haskell to combinators executed by a C runtime.\n  It has a JavaScript runtime target, a package manager (), and can\n  compile real Hackage packages like QuickCheck. The codebase is not trivially\n  small (estimated  across compiler, libraries, and\n  runtime), but for what it does — a near-complete Haskell compiler\n  bootstrappable from C — it is remarkably compact.</p></blockquote>",

George McGee was driving his Tesla Model S with Autopilot engaged when he dropped his phone and bent down to retrieve it. The vehicle blew through a stop sign and a flashing red light at approximately 62 mph, slamming into a parked Chevrolet Tahoe.</p><p>The crash killed 22-year-old Naibel Benavides Leon and severely injured her boyfriend, Dillon Angulo, who was 26 at the time.</p><p>In August 2025, a Miami federal jury <a href=\"https://electrek.co/2025/08/01/tesla-tsla-is-found-liable-in-fatal-autopilot-crash-has-to-pay-329-million/\">found Tesla liable for the crash</a>, assigning 33% of the blame to the automaker. The jury awarded $43 million in compensatory damages and $200 million in punitive damages — the first major plaintiff victory against Tesla in an Autopilot-related wrongful death case.</p><p>Tesla had rejected a $60 million settlement offer before the trial. That decision cost the company dearly.</p><p>In August 2025, Tesla’s lawyers filed <a href=\"https://electrek.co/2025/08/29/tesla-asks-court-to-throw-out-243-million-verdict-in-fatal-autopilot-crash-case/\">a 71-page motion asking the court to throw out the verdict</a> or grant a new trial. The company argued the verdict “flies in the face of basic Florida tort law, the Due Process Clause, and common sense.” Tesla also claimed that references to CEO Elon Musk’s statements about Autopilot during the trial misled the jury.</p><p>Judge Bloom was unconvinced. Her ruling found Tesla presented no new arguments that warranted overturning the jury’s decision.</p><p>Tesla has indicated it will appeal the verdict to a higher court. The company has also pointed to a pre-trial agreement that it claims would cap punitive damages at three times compensatory damages, which could reduce the final payout. But even under that interpretation, Tesla is still looking at a nine-figure judgment.</p><p>Attorney&nbsp;Brett Schreiber, lead trial counsel for the plaintiffs, sent Electrek the following statement:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>“We are of course pleased, but also completely unsurprised that the honorable Judge Bloom upheld the jury’s verdict finding Tesla liable for the integral role Autopilot and the company’s misrepresentations of its capabilities played in the crash that killed&nbsp;Naibel&nbsp;and permanently injured Dillon. Tesla’s arguments were simply an attempt to relitigate the court’s pre-trial rulings. We look forward to continuing our work holding Tesla accountable for its lies and gross misconduct in courts across America.”&nbsp;</p></blockquote><h2>The Autopilot lawsuit floodgates are open</h2><p>The legal pressure has been compounded by regulatory action. In December 2025, a California judge ruled that Tesla’s use of “Autopilot” in its marketing was misleading and violated state law, calling “Full Self-Driving” a name that is “actually, unambiguously false.”</p><p>This lands weight to one of the main arguments used in lawsuits since the landmark case: Tesla has been misleading customers into thinking that its driver assist features (Autopilot and FSD) are more capable than they are – leading drivers to pay less attention.</p><p>This ruling is important, but it’s not surprising. Tesla’s motion to throw out the verdict was always a long shot. The company essentially argued that references to Elon Musk’s own public claims about Autopilot, claims that Tesla actively used to sell the feature for years, were somehow unfair to present to a jury. Judge Bloom was right to reject that argument.</p><p>The bigger picture here is that Tesla’s Autopilot legal liability is snowballing. The company rejected a $60 million settlement, lost a $243 million verdict, failed to overturn it, and now faces an appeal that will likely drag on while dozens of similar cases are working their way through the courts. </p><p>Tesla is settling cases left and right to avoid further discovery and more damaging verdicts, but the financial exposure is mounting fast.</p><p>We are talking billions of dollars in potential settlements and verdicts over the next few years.</p><p>We’ve been covering Tesla’s Autopilot issues for years, and the pattern is clear: Tesla marketed Autopilot in a way that encouraged drivers to over-rely on it, failed to implement adequate safeguards, such as geofencing, and then blamed drivers when things went wrong. A jury, a federal judge, and now a California administrative judge have all reached the same conclusion. At some point, the cost of defending these cases, both financially and reputationally, will force Tesla to fundamentally change how it approaches driver-assistance technology.</p><div><p><em>FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.</em><a href=\"https://electrek.co/about/#affiliate\">More.</a></p></div>",

I've written code since I was 11. I've worked on larger distributed systems, web apps, databases, search and more. I have many opinions on the transformation of our profession that is currently underway. Most of all, there is now an illusion of a lower barrier to entry. There is a magic quadrant made up of taste and skill. And too many people over estimate their taste[0] and their skill (or never care in the first place).<p>LLMs have people everywhere super excited they can finally build their dream applications! The only problem is, no one needs their dream application. We see it everyday now, someone posts some obvious vibe coded app which is poorly crafted and clearly derivative of an idea so thoroughly saturated it's literally leaking. This is the lowest part of the quadrant. No skill and no taste. The overall suffusion of this into the broader scene rightly has the more sensitive of us up in arms. It's noise, it's spam, it's a perversion of the years of skill we've spent accruing. </p></p><p>The only problem there is you might have skill, but do you have taste? This problem itself isn't new. HN of all places has always been a matter of taste. Things people found interesting made it to the front page, things they did not languished. You could build the most finely abstracted todo app of all time and your app would be dead on arrival. However, if you built something that resonated with a large enough group of people it never mattered how well built the app was or how technically complex.</p><p>I've seen plenty of content on HN that could not have been more than a simple crud app that rocketed to the front page. What comes to mind immediately was a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Website_Will_Self-destruct?ref=blog.kinglycrow.com\">little app</a> that died if someone hadn't posted a message on it in 24 hours. Inherently simple, but quite popular. It was pure taste.</p><p>Taste and skill are related, the more saturated something is the higher skill you need to cross the taste threshold to make people care. It's not that there will never be another interesting todo app, it's that it has to be so tasteful as to cross our maximal standards and pre-existing expectations of them.<p>LLMs have exposed this more thoroughly than any other time in tech so far. The sin isn't that someone uses an LLM to generate an application[1], vibe[2] or not. The sin is they lacked enough skill and enough taste to cross the actual threshold the rest of us need to see for the work to not be slop. </p></p><p>An obvious and recent example of this is OpenClaw. It is a bit of a software nightmare (sorry Peter, I know you're good), but it's highly tasteful even being pretty vibey. People ate it up immediately and because there was such an interest the lack of technical soundness and security was overlooked (or begrudgingly put up with)</p><p><p>The lack of taste only presents a problem now, because it's so much easier for people who thought they have more taste than they actually do to post every little idea they have. This is a real problem and I think it will taper off because people will learn proper etiquette or face disappointment. It's a massive educational period for a lot of people that we've all had years to internalize.</p></p><p><p>It has the same stink of crypto on it right now that anyone can get rich. Most of them won't. This is the illusion of the lower barrier of entry, the barrier has always been taste and LLMs do nothing to remove this barrier. They amplify it.</p></p><p><p>Anyway this is all to say whether you have skill or not, you better learn to be tasteful before you decide to slop all over everyone.</p></p><p><p>[0] Taste is totally dependent on the group you're building for, discerning whether you have good taste and to whom is totally a process where you do have to put things out to people, but the bar has not now and not in my years ever been on the floor so I assert there's a minimal universal taste we all have and you should at least clear that before putting things out there.</p></p><p>[1] I've been writing code for 20 years, I am super experienced in my domains and I review and sand off the edges, make changes myself etc. I vibe code almost 0% of the time.</p><p>[2] Vibing means you need to have exceptional taste to cross the bar. I don't care if you do it, but you need to own the outcome.</p>",

They’re no longer in San Francisco, having been essentially chased out of the city by the Planning Commission. The company is loathed seemingly out of proportion to what its product actually is, which is a janky, glitching interface for ChatGPT and other AI models. It’s not in a particularly glamorous market: Cluely is pitched at ordinary office drones in their thirties, working ordinary bullshit email jobs. It’s there to assist you in Zoom meetings and sales calls. It involves using AI to do your job for you, but this is what pretty much everyone is doing already. The cafés of San Francisco are full of highly paid tech workers clattering away on their keyboards; if you peer at their screens to get a closer look, you’ll generally find them copying and pasting material from a ChatGPT window. A lot of the other complaints about Cluely seem similarly hypocritical. The company is fueled by cheap viral hype, rather than an actual workable product—but this is a strange thing to get upset about when you consider that, back in the era of zero interest rates, Silicon Valley investors sank $120 million into something called the Juicero, a Wi-Fi-enabled smart juicer that made fresh juice from fruit sachets that you could, it turned out, just as easily squeeze between your hands.</p><p>dates to be asked whether they’re “mimetic” or “agentic.”</p><blockquote><p>The future won’t reward effort.

There was something he very badly wanted to impress on me, which was that Cluely cultivates a fratty, tech-bro atmosphere. Their pantry was piled high with bottles of something called Core Power Elite. I was offered a protein bar. The inside of the wrapper read . “We’re big believers in protein,” Roy said. “It’s impossible to get fat at Cluely. Nothing here has any fat.” The kitchen table was stacked with Labubu dolls. “It’s aesthetics,” Roy explained. “Women love Labubus, so we have Labubus.” He showed me his bedroom, which was in the office; many Cluely staffers also lived there. Everything was gray, although there wasn’t much. “I’m a big believer in minimalism,” he said. “Actually, no, I’m not. Not at all. I just don’t really care about interior decoration.” He had a chest of drawers, entirely empty except for a lint roller, pens, and, in one corner, a pink vibrator. “It’s for girls, you know,” said Roy. “I used to use this one on my ex.” There were also some objects that didn’t seem to belong in a frat house. In one of the common areas, a shelving unit was completely empty except for an anime figurine. You could peer up her plastic skirt and see the plastic underwear molded around her plastic buttocks. More figurines in frilly dresses seemed to have been scattered at random  dog  19-21 year old.” One picture showed him cuddling a giant Labubu.</p><p>ment I gained consciousness that I would go start a company one day,” he told me. In elementary school in Georgia, he made money reselling Pokémon cards. Even then, he knew he was different from the people around him. “I could do things that other people couldn’t do,” he said. “Like whenever you learnpany was the dream of total control. “I don’t want </p><p>up Cluely and see what it’s doing right now—can you share your screen or walk me through what you’re seeing?” I’d already said pretty much exactly this, but since it had shown up onscreen I read it out loud. Cluely helpfully transcribed my repeating its suggestion, and then suggested that I say, “Alright, I’ve got Cluely open—here’s what I’m looking at right now.” I’m not sure who exactly I was supposed to be saying this to—possibly myself. Somehow our conversation seemed already open. But I said it anyway, since I was now just repeating everything that came up on the screen. Cluely then told me to respond—to either it or myself; it was getting hard to tell at this point—by saying, “Great, I’m ready—just let me know what you want Cluely to check or help with next.” I started to worry that I would be trapped in this conversation forever, constantly repeating the machine’s words back to it as it pretended to be me. I told Roy that I wasn’t sure this was particularly useful. This seemed to confuse him. He asked, “I mean, what would you have wanted it to say?”</p><p>I found it strange that Roy couldn’t see the glaring contradiction in his own project. Here was someone who reacted very violently to anyone who tried to tell him what to do. At the same time, his grand contribution to the world was a piece of software that told people what to do.</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>Afterward, the entire surface of the earth is tiled with data centers as the alien intelligence feeds on the world, growing faster and faster without end.</p><p>ot long before I arrived in the Bay Area, I’d been involved in a minor but intense dispute with the rationalist community over a piece of fiction I’d written that I’d failed to properly label as fiction. For rationalists, the divide between truth and falsehood is very important; dozens of rationalists spent several days raging at me online. Somehow, this ended up turning into an invitation for Friday night dinner at Valinor, Alexander’s former group home in Oakland, named for a realm in the Lord of the Rings books. (Rationalists, like termites, live in eusocial mounds.) The walls in Valinor were decorated with maps of video-game worlds, and the floors were strewn with children’s toys. Some of the children there—of which there were many—were being raised and homeschooled by the collective; one of the adults later explained to me how she’d managed to get the state to recognize her daughter as having four parents. As I walked in, a seven-year-old girl stared up at me in wide-eyed amazement. “Wow,” she said. “You’re really tall.” “I suppose I am,” I said. “Do you think one day you’ll ever be as tall as me?” She considered this for a moment, at which point someone who may or may not have been one of her mothers swooped in. “Well,” she asked the girl, “how would you answer this question with your knowledge of genetics?” Before dinner, Alexander chanted the  for Kabbalat Shabbat, but this was followed by a group rendition of “Landsailor,” a “love song celebrating trucking, supply lines, grocery stores, logistics, and abundance,” which has become part of Valinor’s liturgy:</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>In one experiment, the developer Anthropic prompted its AI, Claude, to play on a Game Boy emulator, and found that Claude was extremely bad at the game. It kept trying to interact with enemies it had already defeated and walking into walls, getting stuck in the same corners of the map for hours or days on end. Another experiment let Claude run a vending machine in Anthropic’s headquarters. This one went even worse. The AI failed to make sure it was selling items at a profit, and had difficulty raising prices when demand was high. It also insisted on trying to fill the vending machine with what it called “specialty metal items” like tungsten cubes. When human workers failed to to fire them all. Before long, Claude was insisting that it was a real human. It claimed that it had attended a physical meeting with staff at 742&nbsp;Evergreen Terrace, which is where the Simpsons live. By the end of the experiment, it was emailing the building’s security guards, telling them they could find it standing by the vending machine wearing a blue blazer and a red tie.</p><p>But are humans really so great at exhibiting agency? After all, Cluely managed to raise tens of millions of dollars with a product that promises to take decision-making out of our hands. AI can’t function without instructions from humans, but an increasing number of humans seem incapable of functioning without AI. There are people who can’t order at a restaurant without having an AI scan the menu and tell them what to eat; people who no longer know how to talk to their friends and family and get ChatGPT to do it instead. For Alexander, this is a kind of Sartrean  “It’s terrifying to ask someone out,” he said. “What you want is to have the dating site that tells you that algorithmically you’ve been matched with this person, and then magically you have permission to talk to them. I think there’s something similar going on here with AI. Many of these people are smart enough that they could answer their own questions, but they want someone else to do it, because then they don’t have to have this terrifying encounter with their own humanity.” His best-case scenario for AI is essentially the antithesis of Roy’s: superintelligence that will actively refuse to give us everything we want, for the sake of preserving our humanity. “If we ever get AI that is strong enough to basically be God and solve all of our problems, it will need to use the same techniques that the actual God uses in terms of maintaining some distance. I do think it’s possible that the AI will be like, <em>Now I am God. I’ve concluded that the actual God made exactly the right decision on how much evil to permit in the universe. Therefore I refuse to change anything.</em>”</p><p>look like. People will endure a lot of indignity to avoid being left behind without VC money when the great bifurcation takes place.

Eric delivered a decent spiel about sperm motility as a proxy for health and how sperm racing drew attention to important issues. His venture seemed to be of a piece with a general trend toward obsessive masculine self-optimization à la RFK&nbsp;Jr.&nbsp;and Andrew Huberman. Still, to me it seemed obvious that Eric was doing it simply because he was amazed that he could. “I could build enterprise software or whatever,” he told me, “but what’s the craziest thing I could do? I would rather have an interesting life than a couple hundred million dollars in my bank account. Racing cum is definitely interesting.” I found Eric very hard not to like.</p><blockquote></blockquote><blockquote></blockquote><p>Altman: “we are providing ChatGPT access to the entire federal workforce!”</p><blockquote></blockquote><blockquote></blockquote><blockquote></blockquote><p>The lasagna summons visions of “smegma, Vesuvius, blood thinner marinara, the splotchy headpattern of a partisan, brainblown in his sleep.” He likes the Joycean compound.

Your words have to have wings. Roy and I both know that social media is the last remaining outlet for self-creation and artistry.

In the Cluely office, they were playing  Did they spend every night there? “We’re all feminists here,” Roy said. “We’re usually up at four in the morning. We’re debating the struggles of women in today’s society.”</p><p>For Roy, meanwhile, dating actually seemed to be a means to an end. “All the culture here is downstream of my belief that human beings are driven by biological desires. We have a pull-up bar and we go to the gym and we talk about dating, because nothing motivates people more than getting laid.” He was interested in physical beauty too, but only because “the better you look, the better you are as an entrepreneur. It’s all connected and beauty is everything. A lot of ugly men are just losers. The point of looking good is that society will reward you for that.” What about other kinds of beauty? Music, for instance? Roy had played the cello as a child. Did he still listen to classical music? “It doesn’t get my blood rushing the same way that EDM will.” His preferred genre was hardstyle—frantic thumping remixes of pop songs by the likes of Katy Perry and Taylor Swift. Is that the function of music, to get your blood rushing? “Yeah. I’m not a big fan of music to focus on things. I think it disturbs my flow. The only reason I will listen to music is to get me really hyped up when I’m lifting.” The two possible functions of music were, apparently, focus and hype. Everything for the higher goal of building a successful startup. What about life itself? Would Roy die for Cluely? “I would be happy dying at any age past twenty-five.

I built a native macOS desktop client for Hacker News and I'm open-sourcing it under the MIT license.</p><p>I spend a lot of time reading HN — I wanted something that felt like a proper Mac app: a sidebar for browsing stories, an integrated reader for articles, and comment threading — all in one window. Essentially, I wanted HN to feel like a first-class citizen on macOS, not a website I visit.</p><p>- Split-view layout — stories in a sidebar on the left, articles and comments on the right, using the standard macOS NavigationSplitView pattern.</p><p>- Built-in ad blocking — a precompiled WKContentRuleList blocks 14 major ad networks (DoubleClick, Google Syndication, Criteo, Taboola, Outbrain, Amazon ads, etc.) right in the WebKit layer. No extensions needed. Toggleable in settings.</p><p>- Pop-up blocking — kills window.open() calls. Also toggleable.</p><p>- HN account login — full authentication flow (login, account creation, password reset). Session is stored in the macOS Keychain, and cookies are injected into the WebView so you can upvote, comment, and submit stories while staying logged in.</p><p>- Bookmarks — save stories locally for offline access. Persisted with Codable serialization, searchable and filterable independently.</p><p>- Search and filtering — powered by the Algolia HN API. Filter by content type (All, Ask, Show, Jobs, Comments), date range (Today, Past Week, Past Month, All Time), and sort by hot or recent.</p><p>- Scroll progress indicator — a small orange bar at the top tracks your reading progress via JavaScript-to-native messaging.</p><p>- Auto-updates via Sparkle with EdDSA-signed updates served from GitHub Pages.</p><p>- Dark mode — respects system appearance with CSS and meta tag injection.</p><p>Tech details for the curious:</p><p>The whole app is ~2,050 lines of Swift across 16 files. It uses the modern @Observable macro (not the old ObservableObject/Published pattern), structured concurrency with async/await and withThrowingTaskGroup for concurrent batch fetching, and SwiftUI throughout — no UIKit/AppKit bridges except for the WKWebView wrapper via NSViewRepresentable.</p><p>Two APIs power the data: the official HN Firebase API for individual item/user fetches, and the Algolia Search API for feeds, filtering, and search. The Algolia API is surprisingly powerful for this — it lets you do date-range filtering, pagination, and full-text search that the Firebase API doesn't support.</p><p>The release pipeline is a single GitHub Actions workflow (467 lines) that handles the full macOS distribution story: build and archive, code sign with Developer ID, notarize with Apple (with a 5-retry staple loop for ticket propagation delays), create a custom DMG with AppleScript-driven icon positioning, sign and notarize the DMG, generate an EdDSA Sparkle signature, create a GitHub Release, and deploy an updated appcast.xml to GitHub Pages.</p><p>Getting macOS code signing and notarization working in CI was honestly the hardest part of this project. If anyone is distributing a macOS app outside the App Store via GitHub Actions, I'm happy to answer questions — the workflow is fully open source.</p><p>I'd love feedback — especially on features you'd want to see. Some ideas I'm considering: keyboard-driven navigation (j/k to move between stories), a reader mode that strips articles down to text, and notification support for replies to your comments.</p>",

Soroor was in the U.S. on a nonimmigrant student visa. Samaneh later became a U.S. citizen, and Khosravi, her husband, became a U.S. legal permanent resident. Prosecutors said that Khosravi previously served in the Iranian army.</p><p>The trio faces charges of conspiracy to commit trade secret theft, theft and attempted theft of trade secrets, and obstruction of justice, according to the U.S. attorney's office for the Northern District of California.</p><p>Prosecutors alleged the three defendants exploited their positions at leading technology firms that develop mobile computer processors to obtain hundreds of confidential files, including materials related to processor security and cryptography. </p><p>Samaneh and Soroor worked at Google before joining a third company identified only as Company 3. Khosravi worked at a separate firm referred to as Company 2, which develops system-on-chip (SoC) platforms such as the Snapdragon series for smartphones and other mobile devices.</p><p>SoC is a semiconductor that integrates numerous components, such as graphics processing units and memory, into a power-efficient package. Common SoCs include Qualcomm's Snapdragon, found in most high-end Android phones, and Apple's A-series for iPhones.</p><p>In a statement to CNBC, Google said it had detected the alleged theft through routine security monitoring before referring the case to law enforcement. </p><p>\"We have enhanced safeguards to protect our confidential information and immediately alerted law enforcement after discovering this incident,\" spokesman José Castañeda said. </p><p>The tech giant also pointed to measures to protect its trade secrets, including restricting employees' access to sensitive information, two-factor authentication for work-related Google accounts and logging file transfers to third-party platforms such as Telegram. </p></div><h2>Alleged efforts to conceal</h2><div><p>Authorities alleged the defendants routed stolen files through a third-party communications platform to channels bearing each of their first names, before copying the material to personal devices, each other's work devices, and to Iran. </p><p>\"The method in which confidential data was transferred by the defendants involved deliberate steps to evade detection and conceal their identities,\" said FBI Special Agent in Charge Sanjay Virmani.&nbsp;</p><p>The defendants sought to cover their tracks after Google's internal security systems flagged Samaneh's activity and revoked her access to company resources in August 2023. </p><p>According to the indictment, she signed an affidavit falsely claiming she had not shared Google's confidential information outside the company. During that period, a personal laptop linked to Samaneh and Khosravi was used to search for methods to delete communications and to research how long mobile carriers retain message records, prosecutors said.</p><p>The couple also allegedly photographed hundreds of computer screens containing confidential information from Google and Company 2, in what appeared to be an attempt at circumventing digital monitoring tools. </p><p>On the night before the pair traveled to Iran in December 2023, Samaneh allegedly took about 24 photos of Khosravi's work computer screen containing Company 2's trade secrets, including its Snapdragon SoCs. </p><p>Prosecutors allege that while in Iran, a device linked to Samaneh accessed those photographs, while Khosravi accessed additional Company 2's proprietary information, such as Snapdragon SoC hardware architecture.</p><p>Prosecutors said in the indictment that Snapdragon SoC trade secrets had independent economic value because they were not generally known and could not be readily obtained from Company 2's competitors, who could benefit from their disclosure or use. </p><p>If convicted, each defendant faces up to 10 years in prison for each trade secret charge and up to 20 years for obstruction of justice, along with fines of up to $250,000 per count.</p></div>",

      "content": "<p>Many believe AI is the real deal. In narrow domains, it already surpasses human performance. Used well, it is an unprecedented amplifier of human ingenuity and productivity. Its widespread adoption is hindered by two key barriers: high latency and astronomical cost. Interactions with language models lag far behind the pace of human cognition. Coding assistants can ponder for minutes, disrupting the programmer’s state of flow, and limiting effective human-AI collaboration. Meanwhile, automated agentic AI applications demand millisecond latencies, not leisurely human-paced responses.</p><p>On the cost front, deploying modern models demands massive engineering and capital: room-sized supercomputers consuming hundreds of kilowatts, with liquid cooling, advanced packaging, stacked memory, complex I/O, and miles of cables. This scales to city-sized data center campuses and satellite networks, driving extreme operational expenses.</p><p>Though society seems poised to build a dystopian future defined by data centers and adjacent power plants, history hints at a different direction. Past technological revolutions often started with grotesque prototypes, only to be eclipsed by breakthroughs yielding more practical outcomes.</p><p>Consider ENIAC, a room-filling beast of vacuum tubes and cables. ENIAC introduced humanity to the magic of computing, but was slow, costly, and unscalable. The transistor sparked swift evolution, through workstations and PCs, to smartphones and ubiquitous computing, sparing the world from ENIAC sprawl.</p><p>General-purpose computing entered the mainstream by becoming easy to build, fast, and cheap.</p><p>Founded 2.5 years ago, Taalas developed a platform for transforming any AI model into custom silicon. From the moment a previously unseen model is received, it can be realized in hardware in only two months.</p><p>The resulting Hardcore Models are an order of magnitude faster, cheaper, and lower power than software-based implementations.</p><p>Taalas’ work is guided by the following core principles:</p><p>Throughout the history of computation, deep specialization has been the surest path to extreme efficiency in critical workloads.</p><p>AI inference is the most critical computational workload that humanity has ever faced, and the one that stands to gain the most from specialization.</p><p>Its computational demands motivate total specialization: the production of optimal silicon for each individual model.</p><h4>2. Merging storage and computation</h4><p>Modern inference hardware is constrained by an artificial divide: memory on one side, compute on the other, operating at fundamentally different speeds.</p><p>This separation arises from a longstanding paradox. DRAM is far denser, and therefore cheaper, than the types of memory compatible with standard chip processes. However, accessing off-chip DRAM is thousands of times slower than on-chip memory. Conversely, compute chips cannot be built using DRAM processes.</p><p>This divide underpins much of the complexity in modern inference hardware, creating the need for advanced packaging, HBM stacks, massive I/O bandwidth, soaring per-chip power consumption, and liquid cooling.</p><p>Taalas eliminates this boundary. By unifying storage and compute on a single chip, at DRAM-level density, our architecture far surpasses what was previously possible.</p><h4>3. Radical simplification</h4><p>By removing the memory-compute boundary and tailoring silicon to each model, we were able to redesign the entire hardware stack from first principles.</p><p>The result is a system that does not depend on difficult or exotic technologies, no HBM, advanced packaging, 3D stacking, liquid cooling, high speed IO.</p><p>Engineering simplicity enables an order-of-magnitude reduction in total system cost.</p><p>Guided by this technical philosophy, Taalas has created the world’s fastest, lowest cost/power inference platform.</p><p>Taalas’ silicon Llama achieves 17K tokens/sec per user, nearly 10X faster than the current state of the art, while costing 20X less to build, and consuming 10X less power.</p><p>We selected the Llama 3.1 8B as the basis for our first product due to its practicality. Its small size and open-source availability allowed us to harden the model with minimal logistical effort.</p><p>While largely hard-wired for speed, the Llama retains flexibility through configurable context window size and support for fine-tuning via low-rank adapters (LoRAs).</p><p>At the time we began work on our first generation design, low-precision parameter formats were not standardized. Our first silicon platform therefore used a custom 3-bit base data type. The Silicon Llama is aggressively quantized, combining 3-bit and 6-bit parameters, which introduces some quality degradations relative to GPU benchmarks.</p><p>Our second-generation silicon adopts standard 4-bit floating-point formats, addressing these limitations while maintaining high speed and efficiency.</p><p>Our second model, still based on Taalas’ first-generation silicon platform (HC1), will be a mid-sized reasoning LLM. It is expected in our labs this spring and will be integrated into our inference service shortly thereafter.</p><p>Following this, a frontier LLM will be fabricated using our second-generation silicon platform (HC2). HC2 offers considerably higher density and even faster execution. Deployment is planned for winter.</p><h3>Instantaneous AI, in your hands today</h3><p>Our debut model is clearly not on the leading edge, but we decided to release it as a beta service anyway – to let developers explore what becomes possible when LLM inference runs at sub-millisecond speed and near-zero cost.</p><p>We believe that our service enables many classes of applications that were previously impractical, and want to encourage developers to experiment, and discover how these capabilities can be applied.</p><p>Apply for access <a href=\"https://taalas.com/api-request-form/\">here</a>, and engage with a system that removes traditional AI latency and cost constraints.</p><h3>On substance, team and craft</h3><p>At its core, Taalas is a small group of long-time collaborators, many of whom have been together for over twenty years. To remain lean and focused, we rely on external partners who bring equal skill and decades of shared experience. The team grows slowly, with new team members joining through demonstrated excellence, alignment with our mission and respect for our established practices. Here, substance outweighs spectacle, craft outweighs scale, and rigor outweighs redundancy.</p><p>Taalas is a precision strike, in a world where deep-tech startups approach their chosen problems like medieval armies besieging a walled city, with swarming numbers, overflowing coffers of venture capital, and a clamor of hype that drowns out clear thought.</p><p>Our first product was brought to the world by a team of 24 team members, and a total of just $30M spent, of more than $200M raised. This achievement demonstrates that precisely defined goals and disciplined focus achieve what brute force cannot.</p><p>Going forward, we will advance in the open. Our Llama inference platform is already in your hands. Future systems will follow as they mature. We will expose them early, iterate swiftly, and accept the rough edges.</p><p>Innovation begins by questioning assumptions and venturing into the neglected corners of any solution space. That is the path we chose at Taalas.</p><p>Our technology delivers step-function gains in performance, power efficiency, and cost.</p><p>It reflects a fundamentally different architectural philosophy from the mainstream, one that redefines how AI systems are built and deployed.</p><p>Disruptive advances rarely look familiar at first, and we are committed to helping the industry understand and adopt this new operating paradigm.</p><p>Our first products, beginning with our hard-wired Llama and rapidly expanding to more capable models, eliminate high latency and cost, the core barriers to ubiquitous AI.</p><p>We have placed instantaneous, ultra-low-cost intelligence in developers’ hands, and are eagerly looking forward to seeing what they build with it.</p>",

This is that post.</p><p>Data sovereignty, GDPR simplicity, not having your entire business dependent on three American hyperscalers, and honestly, a bit of stubbornness.

One provider, multiple services, it simplifies billing if nothing else.</p><p> is the unsung hero of this stack.

Their edge network is genuinely impressive and their dashboard is a joy to use. Coming from Cloudflare, I felt at home rather quickly.</p><p> powers our AI inference. If you need GPU compute in Europe without sending requests to , they're one of the few real options.</p><p> handles authentication and identity. A German provider that gives you passkeys, social logins, and user management without reaching for Auth0 or Clerk. More on this in the \"can't avoid\" section — it doesn't eliminate American dependencies entirely, but it keeps the auth layer European.</p><h2>Self-hosting: Rancher, my beloved</h2><p>This is where things get fun... and time-consuming. I self-host a surprising amount:</p><ul><li> for privacy-friendly analytics</li><li> for customer management</li><li> for secrets management</li></ul><p>All running on Kubernetes, with Rancher as the glue keeping the whole cluster sane.</p><p>Is self-hosting more work than SaaS? Obviously. But it means my data stays exactly where I put it, and I'm not at the mercy of a provider's pricing changes or acquisition drama.</p><p>For email,  keeps things encrypted and European.  watches the monitors so I can sleep.</p><p><strong>Transactional email with competitive pricing.</strong> This one surprised me. Sendgrid, Postmark, Mailgun, they all make it trivially easy and reasonably cheap. The EU options exist, but finding one that matches on deliverability, pricing, and developer experience took real effort. Scaleway's TEM works, but the ecosystem is thinner. Fewer templates, fewer integrations, less community knowledge to lean on when something goes wrong.</p><p> If you live in GitHub's ecosystem Actions, Issues, code review workflows, the social graph... walking away feels like leaving a city you've lived in for a decade. You know where everything is. Gitea is actually excellent, and I'd recommend it without hesitation for the core git experience. But you'll miss the ecosystem. CI/CD pipelines need to be rebuilt. Integrations you took for granted don't exist. The muscle memory of  takes a while to unwire.</p><p> This one is just baffling. Certain TLDs cost significantly more when purchased through European registrars. I'm talking 2-3x markups on extensions that are cheap everywhere else. I never got a satisfying explanation for why. If anyone knows, I'm genuinely curious.</p><h2>What you realistically can't avoid</h2><p>Here's the honest part. Some things are American and you just have to accept it:</p><p><strong>Google Ads and Apple's Developer Program.</strong> If you want to acquire users and distribute a mobile app, you're paying the toll to Mountain View and Cupertino. There is no European alternative to the App Store or Play Store. This is just the cost of doing business.</p><p> Your users expect \"Sign in with Google\" and \"Sign in with Apple.\" You can add email/password and passkeys, but removing social logins entirely is a conversion killer. Every one of those auth flows hits American servers. The silver lining: Hanko, a German identity provider, handles the auth layer itself, so at least your user management and session handling stay in Europe, even if the OAuth flow touches Google or Apple.</p><p> If you want Claude, and I very much want Claude, that's Anthropic, that's the US. The EU AI ecosystem is growing, but for frontier models, the options are mostly American. You can run open-weight models on European inference providers, but if you want Claude, you're making a transatlantic API call.</p><p>Yes, with caveats. My infrastructure costs are lower than they'd be on AWS. My data residency story is clean. I understand my stack deeply because I had to ... there's no \"just click the AWS button\" escape hatch.</p><p>But it took longer than I expected. Every service I self-host is a service I maintain. Every EU provider I chose has a smaller community, thinner docs, and fewer Stack Overflow (or Claude) answers when things break at 2 AM.</p><p>If you're thinking about doing this: go in with your eyes open. The EU infrastructure ecosystem is real and maturing fast. But \"Made in EU\" is still a choice you have to actively make, not one you can passively fall into. The defaults of the tech industry pull you west across the Atlantic, and swimming against that current takes effort.</p><p>It's effort worth spending. But it is effort.</p><p>If you curious to see the finished product, here it is: <a href=\"https://hank.parts/?ref=coinerella.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">hank.parts</a>.</p>",

The idea of understanding hundreds of thousands or even millions of lines of code written by countless other people scared me. What I quickly learned is that you don't have to understand a codebase in its entirety to be effective in it. But just saying that is not super helpful. So rather than tell, I want to show.</p><p>In this post, I'm going to walk you through how I learn an unfamiliar codebase. But I'll admit, this isn't precisely how I would do it today. After years of working on codebases, I've learned quite a lot of shortcuts. Things that come with experience that just don't translate for other people. So what I'm going to present is a reconstruction. I want to show bits and parts of how I go from knowing very little to gaining knowledge and ultimately, asking the right questions.</p><p>To do this, I will use just a few techniques:</p><ol><li>Fixing things I find that are broken</li><li>Reading to answer questions</li></ol><p>I want to do this on a real codebase, so I've chosen one whose purpose and scope I'm generally familiar with. But one that I've never contributed to or read, <a href=\"https://github.com/vercel/next.js\">Next.js</a>. But I've chosen to be a bit more particular than that. I'm particularly interested in learning more about the Rust bundler setup (turbopack) that Next.js has been building out. So that's where we will concentrate our time.</p><h2>Being Clear About Our Goal</h2><p>Trying to learn a codebase is distinctly different from trying to simply fix a bug or add a feature. In post, we may use bugs, talk about features, make changes, etc. But we are not trying to contribute to the codebase, yet. Instead, we are trying to get our mind around how the codebase generally works. We aren't concerned with things like coding standards, common practices, or the development roadmap. We aren't even concerned with correctness. The changes we make are about seeing how the codebase responds so we can make sense of it.</p><p>I find starting at  to be almost always completely unhelpful. From main, yes, we have a single entry point, but now we are asking ourselves to understand the whole. But things actually get worse when dealing with a large codebase like this. There isn't even one main. Which main would we choose? So instead, let's start by figuring out what our library even consists of.</p><pre><code></code></pre><p>A couple of things to note. We have packages, crates, turbo, and turbopack. Crates are relevant here because we know we are interested in some of the Rust code, but we are also interested in turbopack in particular. A quick look at these shows that turbo, packages, and crates are probably not our target. Why do I say that? Because turbopack has its own crates folder.</p><pre><code></code></pre><p>So there are 54 crates under turbopack.... This is beginning to feel a bit daunting. So why don't we take a step back and find a better starting point? One starting point I find particularly useful is a <a href=\"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/88009\">bug report</a>.</p><img src=\"https://jimmyhmiller.com/images/turbopack-bug-report.png\"><p>I found this by simply looking at recently opened issues. When I first found it, it had no comments on it. In fact, I find bug reports with only reproducing instructions to be the most useful. Remember, we are trying to learn, not fix a bug.</p><p>So I spent a little time looking at the bug report. It is fairly clear. It does indeed reproduce. But it has a lot of code. So, as is often the case, it is useful to reduce it to the minimal case. So that's what I did. Here is the important code and the problem we are using to learn from.</p><pre><code> greeting </code></pre><pre><code> MyEnum  greeting </code></pre><p>MyEnum here is dead code. It should not show up in our final bundle. But when we do  and look for it, we get:</p><pre><code></code></pre><p>If we instead do </p><pre><code></code></pre><p>The code is completely gone from our build.</p><p>So now we have our bug. But remember. Our goal here is not to fix the bug. But to understand the code. So our goal is going to be to use this little mini problem to understand what code is involved in this bug. To understand the different ways we could fix this bug. To understand why this bug happened in the first place. To understand some small slice of the turbopack codebase.</p><p>So at each junction, we are going to resist the urge to simply find the offending code. We are going to take detours. We are going to ask questions. We hope that from the start of this process to the end, we no longer think of the code involved in this action as a black box. But we will intentionally leave ourselves with open questions. As I write these words, I have no idea where this will take us. I have not prepared this ahead of time. I am not telling you a fake tale from a codebase I already know. Yes, I will simplify and skip parts. But you will come along with me.</p><p>The first step for understanding any project is getting some part of it running. Well, I say that, but in my day job, I've been at companies where this is a multi-day or week-long effort. Sometimes, because of a lack of access, sometimes from unclear instructions, if you find yourself in that situation, you now have a new task, understand it well enough to get it to build. Well, unfortunately, that is the scenario we find ourselves in.</p><p>I can't think of a single one of these endeavors I've gone on to learn a codebase that didn't involve a completely undesirable, momentum-stopping side quest. For this one, it was as soon as I tried to make changes to the turbopack Rust code and get it working in my test project. There are <a href=\"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/25046dfa1bd78b1f8da478ceda51ae86c07b673c/contributing/core/developing.md#testing-a-local-nextjs-version-on-an-application\">instructions on how to do this</a>. In fact, we even get an explanation on why it is a bit weird.</p><blockquote><p>Since Turbopack doesn't support symlinks when pointing outside of the workspace directory, it can be difficult to develop against a local Next.js version. Neither  nor  imports quite cut it. An alternative is to pack the Next.js version you want to test into a tarball and add it to the pnpm overrides of your test application. The following script will do it for you:</p><code>pnpm pack-next --tar &amp;&amp; pnpm unpack-next path/to/project\n</code></blockquote><p>Okay, straightforward enough. I start by finding somewhere in the turbopack repo that I  will be called more than once, and I add the following:</p><pre><code>diff --git a/turbopack/crates/turbopack/src/lib.rs b/turbopack/crates/turbopack/src/lib.rs\nindex 20891acf86..8691f1951c 100644\n\n@@ -80,6 +80,7 @@ async fn apply_module_type(\n</code></pre><p>Yes. Very scientific, I know. But I've found this to be a rather effective method of making sure my changes are picked up. So I do that, make sure I've built and done the necessary things. I run</p><pre><code> swc-build-native  pack-next --tar  unpack-next /path/to/test/project\n</code></pre><p>Then that script tells me to add some overrides and dependencies to my test project. I go to build my project and  does not show up at all...</p><h3>Understanding the Build System</h3><p>I will save you the fun details here of looking through this system. But I think it's important to mention a few things. First,  being a dependency immediately stood out to me. In my day job, I maintain a fork of swc (WHY???) for some custom stuff. I definitely won't pretend to be an expert on swc, but I know it's written in Rust. I know it's a native dependency. The changes I'm making are native dependencies. But I see no mention at all of turbopack. In fact, if I search in my test project, I get the following:</p><pre><code></code></pre><p>So I have a sneaking suspicion my turbopack code should be in that tar. So let's look at the tar.</p><p>Ummm. That seems a bit small... Let's look at what's inside.</p><pre><code></code></pre><p>Okay, I think we found our problem. There's really nothing in this at all. Definitely no native code.</p><h4>Regex - Now You Have Two Problems</h4><p>After lots of searching, the culprit came down to:</p><pre><code> packageFiles globbedFilessimpleFiles packageFilesfff\n    f  ff</code></pre><p>In our case, the input came from <a href=\"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/25046dfa1bd78b1f8da478ceda51ae86c07b673c/packages/next-swc/package.json#L1C1-L7C5\">this file</a> and f was . Unfortunately, this little set + regex setup causes  to be filtered out. Why? Because it doesn't match the regex. This regex is looking for a  with characters after it. We have none. So since we are already in the set (we just added ourselves), we filter ourselves out.</p><p>How do we solve this problem? There are countless answers, really. I had Claude whip me up one without regex.</p><pre><code> packageFiles globbedFilessimpleFiles packageFiles normalized fnormalizednormalized parent normalizedparent  parent parent\n    parent parent</code></pre><p>But my gut says the sorting lets us do this much simpler. But after this fix, let's look at the tar now:</p><pre><code></code></pre><p>Much better. After this change, we can finally see  a lot.</p><p>: As I wrote this article, someone fixed this in a bit of <a href=\"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/88126\">a different way</a>. Keeping the regex and just changing to . Fairly practical decision.</p><p>Okay, we now have something we can test. But where do we even begin? This is one reason we chose this bug. It gives a few avenues to go down. First, the report says that these enums are not being \"tree-shaken.\" Is that the right term? One thing I've learned from experience is to never assume that the end user is using terms in the same manner as the codebase. So this can be a starting point, but it might be wrong.</p><p>With some searching around, we can actually see that there is a configuration for turning turbopackTreeShaking on or off.</p><pre><code> nextConfig NextConfig \n  experimental\n    turbopackTreeShaking</code></pre><p>It was actually a bit hard to find exactly where the default for this was. It isn't actually documented. So let's just enable it and see what we get.</p><pre><code> Build error occurred\nError TurbopackInternalError: Failed to  app endpoint /page\n\nCaused by:\n- index out of bounds: the len is  but the index is \n\nDebug info:\n- Execution of get_all_written_entrypoints_with_issues_operation failed\n- Execution of EntrypointsOperation::new failed\n- Execution of all_entrypoints_write_to_disk_operation failed\n- Execution of Project::emit_all_output_assets failed\n- Execution of *emit_assets failed\n- Execution of all_assets_from_entries_operation failed\n- Execution of *all_assets_from_entries failed\n- Execution of output_assets_operation failed\n- Execution of AppEndpoint as Endpoint::output failed\n- Failed to  app endpoint /page\n- Execution of AppEndpoint::output failed\n- Execution of whole_app_module_graph_operation failed\n- Execution of *ModuleGraph::from_single_graph failed\n- Execution of *SingleModuleGraph::new_with_entries failed\n- Execution of Project::get_all_entries failed\n- Execution of AppEndpoint as Endpoint::entries failed\n- Execution of get_app_page_entry failed\n- Execution of *ProcessResult::module failed\n- Execution of ModuleAssetContext as AssetContext::process failed\n- Execution of EcmascriptModulePartAsset::select_part failed\n- Execution of split_module failed\n- index out of bounds: the len is  but the index is </code></pre><p>Well, I think we figured out that the default is off. So one option is that we never \"tree shake\" anything. But that seems wrong. At this point, I looked into tree shaking a bit in the codebase, and while I started to understand a few things, I've been at this point before. Sometimes it is good to go deep. But how much of this codebase do I really understand? If tree shaking is our culprit (seeming unlikely at this point), it might be good to know how code gets there. Here, we of course found a bug. But it is an experimental feature. Maybe we can come back and fix it? Maybe we can file a bug? Maybe this code just isn't at all ready for primetime. It's hard to know as an outsider.</p><p>Our \"search around the codebase\" strategy failed. So now we try a different tactic. We know a couple of things.</p><ol><li>Our utilities.ts file is read and parsed.</li><li>It ends up in a file under a \"chunks\" directory.</li></ol><p>We now have two points we can use to try to trace what happens. Let's start with parsing. Luckily, here it is straightforward: . When we look at this code, we can see that swc does the heavy lifting. First, it parses it into a TypeScript AST, then applies transforms to turn it into JavaScript. At this point, we don't write to a string, but if you edit the code and use an emitter, you see this:</p><pre><code> MyEnum \n    MyEnum\n    MyEnum MyEnum greeting </code></pre><p>Now, to find where we write the chunks. In most programs, this would be pretty easy. Typically, there is a linear flow somewhere that just shows you the steps. Or if you can't piece one together, you can simply breakpoint and follow the flow. But Turbopack is a rather advanced system involving async Rust (more on this later). So, in keeping with the tradition of not trying to do things that rely too heavily on my knowledge, I have done the tried and true, log random things until they look relevant. And what I found made me realize that logging was not going to be enough. It was time to do my tried and true learning technique, visualization.</p><p>Ever since my <a href=\"https://jimmyhmiller.com/ugliest-beautiful-codebase\">first job</a>, I have been building custom tools to visualize codebases. Perhaps this is due to my aphantasia. I'm not really sure. Some of these visualizers make their way into general use for me. But more often than not, they are a means of understanding. When I applied for a job at Shopify working on YJIT, I built a <a href=\"https://jimmyhmiller.com/yjit\">simple visualizer</a> but never got around to making it more useful than a learning tool. The same thing is true here, but this time, thanks to AI, it looks a bit more professional.</p><p>This time, we want to give a bit more structure than what we'd be able to do with a simple print. We are trying to get events out that have a bunch of information. Mostly, we are interested in files and their contents over time. Looking through the codebase, we find that one key abstract is an ident; this will help us identify files. We will simply find points that seem interesting, make a corresponding event, make sure it has idents associated with it, and send that event over a WebSocket. Then, with that raw information, we can have our visualizer stitch together what exactly happens.</p><img src=\"https://jimmyhmiller.com/images/turbopack-visualizer-steps.png\"><p>If we take a look, we can see our code step through the process. And ultimately end up in the bundle despite not being used. If you notice, though, between steps 3 and 4, our code changed a bit. We lost this PURE annotation. Why?</p><p>Luckily, because we tried to capture as much context as we could. We can see that a boolean \"Scope Hoisting\" has been enabled. Could that be related? If we turn it off, we instead see:</p><img src=\"https://jimmyhmiller.com/images/turbopack-visualizer-pure-kept.png\"><p>Our pure annotation is kept around, and as a result, our code is eliminated. If we take a step back, this can make sense. Something during the parse step is creating a closure around our enum code, but when it does so, it is marking that as a \"pure\" closure, meaning it has no side effects. Later, because this annotation is dropped, the minifier doesn't know that it can just get rid of this closure. As I've been trying to find time to write this up, it seems that people on the bug report have found this on their own as well.</p><p>So we've found the behavior of the bug. Now we need to understand why it is happening. Remember, we are fixing a bug as a means of understanding the software. Not just to fix a bug. So what exactly is going on? Well, we are trying to stitch together two libraries. Software bugs are way more likely to occur on these seams. In this case, after reading the code for a while, the problem becomes apparent.</p><p>SWC parses our code and turns it into an AST. But if you take a look at an <a href=\"https://astexplorer.net/\">AST</a>, comments are not a part of the AST. So instead, SWC stores comments off in a hashmap where we can look them up by byte pos. So for each node in the AST, it can see if there is a comment attached. But for the PURE comment, it doesn't actually need to look this comment up. It is not a unique comment that was in the source code. It is a pre-known meta comment. So rather than store each instance in the map, it makes a special value.</p><pre><code>`\n PUREu32MAX </code></pre><p>Now, this encoding scheme causes some problems for turbopack. Turbopack does not act on a single file; it acts across many files. In fact, for scope hoisting, we are trying to take files across modules and condense them into a single scope. So now, when we encounter one of these bytepos encodings, how do we know what module it belongs to?</p><p>The obvious answer to many might be to simply make a tuple like , and while that certainly works, it does come with tradeoffs. One of these is memory footprint. I didn't find an exact reason. But given the focus on performance on turbopack, I'd imagine this is one of the main motivations. Instead, we get a fairly clever encoding of module and bytepos into a single BytePos, aka a u32. I won't get into the details of the representation here; it involves some condition stuff. But needless to say, now that we are going from something focusing on one file to focusing on multiple and trying to smuggle in this module_id into our BytePos, we ended up missing one detail, PURE. Now our pure value is being interpreted as some module at some very high position instead of the proper bytes.</p><p>To fix this bug, I found the minimal fix was simply the following:</p><pre><code></code></pre><p>With this our enum properly is marked as PURE and disappears from the output!</p><p>Now remember, we aren't trying to make a bug fix. We are trying to understand the codebase. Is this the right fix? I'm not sure. I looked around the codebase, and there are a number of other swc sentinel values that I think need to also be handled (PLACEHOLDER and SYNTHESIZED). There is also the decoding path. For dummy, the decoding path panics. Should we do the same? Should we be handling pure at a higher level, where it never even goes through the encoder?</p><p>: As I was writing this, someone else <a href=\"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/90004\">proposed a fix</a>. As I was writing the article, I did see that others had started to figure out the things I had determined from my investigation. But I was not confident enough that it was the right fix yet. In fact, the PR differs a bit from my local fix. It does handle the other sentinel, but at a different layer. It also chooses to decode with module 0. Which felt a bit wrong to me. But again, these are decisions that people who work on this codebase long-term are better equipped to decide than me.</p><p>I must admit that simply fixing this bug didn't quite help me understand the codebase. Not just because it is a fairly good size. But because I couldn't see this fundamental unit that everything was composed of. In some of the code snippets above, you will see types that mention Vc. This stands for ValueCell. There are a number of ways to try to understand these; you can check out the <a href=\"https://turbopack-rust-docs.vercel.sh/turbo-engine/cells.html\">docs for turbo engine</a> for some details. Or you can read the <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/blog/turbopack-incremental-computation\">high-level overview</a> that skips the implementation details for the most part. You can think of these cells like the cells in a spreadsheet. They provide a level of incremental computation. When the value of some cell updates, we can invalidate stuff. Unlike a spreadsheet, the turbo engine is lazy.</p><p>I've worked with these kinds of systems before. Some were very explicitly modeled after spreadsheets. Others were based on rete networks or propagators. I am also immediately reminded of salsa from the Rust analyzer team. I've even worked with big, complicated non-computational graphs. But even with that background, I know myself, I've never been able to really understand these things until I can visualize them. And while a general network visualizer can be useful (and might actually be quite useful if I used the aggregate graph), I've found that for my understanding, I vastly prefer starting small and exploring out the edges of the graph. So that's what I did.</p><p>But before we get to that visualization, I want to highlight something fantastic in the implementation: a <a href=\"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/turbopack/crates/turbo-tasks-backend\">central place</a> for controlling a ton of the decisions that go into this system. The backend here lets us decide so many things about how the execution of our tasks will run. Because of this, we have one place we can insert a ton of tooling and begin to understand how this system works.</p><p>As before, we are going to send things on a WebSocket. But unlike last time, our communication will actually be two-way. We are going to be controlling how the tasks run.</p><img src=\"https://jimmyhmiller.com/images/turbopack-visualizer-pending.png\"><p>In my little test project, I edited a file, and my visualizer displayed the following. Admittedly, it is a bit janky, but there are some nice features. First, on the left, we can see all the pending tasks. In this case, something has marked our file read as dirty, so we are trying to read the file. We can see the contents of a cell that this task has. And we can see the dependents of this task.</p><img src=\"https://jimmyhmiller.com/images/turbopack-visualizer-three-parse.png\"><p>Here is what it looks like once we release that task to run. We can now see 3 parse tasks have kicked off. Why 3? I'll be honest, I haven't looked into it. But a good visualization is about provoking questions, not only answering them. Did I get my visualization wrong because I misunderstood something about the system? Are there three different subsystems that want to parse, and we want to do them in parallel? Have we just accidentally triggered more parses than we should be?</p><p>This is precisely what we want out of a visualizer. Is it perfect? No, would I ship this as a general visualizer? No. Am I happy with the style? Not in the least. But already it enables a look into the project I couldn't see before. Here we can actually watch the graph unfold as I execute more steps. What a fascinating view of a once opaque project.</p><p>With this visualizer, I was able to make changes to my project and watch values as they flow through the systems. I made simple views for looking at code. If I extended this, I can imagine it being incredibly useful for debugging general issues, for seeing the ways in which things are scheduled, and for finding redundancies in the graph. Once I was able to visualize this, I really started to understand the codebase better. I was able to see all the values that didn't need to be recomputed when we made changes. The whole thing clicked.</p><p>This was an exercise in exploring a new codebase that is a bit different of a process than I see others take. It isn't an easy process, it isn't quick. But I've found myself repeating this process over and over again. For the turborepo codebase, this is just the beginning. This exploration was done over a few weekends in the limited spare time I could find. But already I can start to put the big picture together. I can start to see how I could shape my tools to help me answer more questions. If you've never used tool building as a way to learn a codebase, I highly recommend it.</p><h4>Coda: A Call for More Interactive Dynamic Systems</h4><p>One thing I always realize as I go through this process is just how hard it is to work interactively with our current software. Our languages, our tools, our processes are all written without ways to live code, without ways to inspect their inner workings.</p><p>It is also incredibly hard to find a productive UI environment for this kind of live exploration. The running state of the visualizer contains all the valuable information. Any system that needs you to retrace your steps to get the UI back to the state it was once in to visualize more is incredibly lacking. So I always find myself in the browser, but immediately, I am having to worry about performance. We have made massive strides in so many aspects of software development. I hope that we will fix this one as well.</p>",

      "content": "<p>How fast can RP2350 really go? Mike starts his Christmas holidays with a deep dive into Pico 2 overclocking, with the assistance of a seasonally appropriate amount of dry ice ❄️</p><p>Picos overclock very well, and the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico\" title=\"None\">original Raspberry Pi Pico</a> will normally run at over 400MHz if given a 1.3V core voltage. On the RP2040 that is as far as you can easily go because the on-board voltage regulator is limited to supplying a maximum of 1.3V.</p><p>When I first got my hands on the RP2350 datasheet, one thing I noticed rather quickly was that the voltage regulator could have the voltage limit disabled, so that voltages above 1.3V could be requested. And once I got a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico-2\" title=\"None\">Pico 2</a>, I was intrigued to see how it would behave at higher core voltage (and whether the magic smoke would come out if I raised the voltage too high!)</p><p>Using <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://gist.github.com/MichaelBell/c413356f4c45bf9aef98cd23ceb83057\" title=\"None\">this MicroPython script</a> I was able to request different voltages from the regulator. To find out how fast the RP2350 would clock at a given voltage I ran a simple test that computed 100 factorial and checked the answer was correct, and then incremented the clock speed and continued until it stopped working.</p><p>I then did a more rigorous test using the MicroPython performance benchmark to find out whether things were stable. Generally I had to back off the CPU clock by 20MHz or so in order for the performance benchmark to run multiple times cleanly, compared to how fast it would pass the very simple 100! test. I <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/rebelmike.bsky.social/post/3lclqg5ihos2a\" title=\"None\">live bleated</a> (that's what we're calling Bluesky posts for now) my experimentation and some details about the RP2350 as I was doing this.</p><p>Voltage, max stable clock speed and temperature for those initial tests was as follows:</p><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody></tbody></table><p>This was the first time I'd really felt an RP2 chip getting hot - RP2040s running at 400 MHz or so and 1.3V only get a little warm.</p><p>To combat the heat issue I added a tiny heatsink to the RP2350 on the Pico 2, and set up a small PC fan pointing at it to give good airflow. I again <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/rebelmike.bsky.social/post/3ld53kzoqos2q\" title=\"None\">live bleated</a> the experiment, pushing the RP2350 to higher voltages and clock speeds:</p><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody></tbody></table><p>I'll admit that I was rather concerned going above 2.0V - while the on board regulator provides 0.05V or 0.1V increments up to 2.0V, the next step up from 2.0V is 2.35V. This seemed like it was getting a long way above the stock 1.1V core voltage, and I thought the danger of cooking the RP2350 was rising.</p><p>However, it turned out the performance gain from 2.0 to 2.35V wasn't as much as would be expected, and on further investigation the voltage that the voltage regulator was supplying didn't actually make it above about 2.2V - the on board regulator isn't able to provide enough current to run the RP2350 at these high voltages.</p><p>So, how did I find out that the supplied voltage wasn't as high as requested? It turns out the Pico 2, rather handily, has a test point on the back that allows you to measure the core voltage. It was therefore very easy to probe it with my multimeter and see the voltage being delivered didn't match up to the requested voltage.</p><p>But if you can  the voltage here, it would also be straightforward to  a voltage externally. That would mean we could use a bench power supply to provide as much voltage and current as the Pico 2 could take!</p><p>I'd been chatting to the folks at Pimoroni about these experiments, whilst helping them with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/presto\" title=\"None\">Presto</a> firmware and other bits and pieces. Niko from the Pimoroni team suggested, perhaps jokingly, that we should try a Liquid Nitrogen overclock.</p><p>I'd arranged to pop in to visit Pimoroni HQ at the start of my Christmas break, so we wondered if it might be possible to give this a try. However, LN2 is a little tricky to handle and not totally straightforward to acquire. I was also worried that we could have problems with the soldering, PCB or connections to the Pico cracking under the extreme cold of LN2.</p><p>Solid CO2 (AKA dry ice) on the other hand, is relatively easy to acquire and requires only fairly basic safety precautions. It should allow cooling of the Pico 2 to around -80C, which seemed like it would be enough to give a decent speed boost. Niko ordered some dry ice and the plan was set.</p><p>⚠️ (Editorial note: <strong>do not experiment with solid CO2 / dry ice unless you know what you're doing</strong>, have considered the problems that carbon dioxide sublimation and things being cooled to -80C can cause and have taken appropriate safety precautions!)</p><p>I wanted to make sure we were pretty rigorous about the testing - unlike the earlier experiments using the MicroPython performance benchmark, I wanted to get both cores running flat out. Therefore I decided to use the freely available CoreMark benchmark as the test, as this would report result comparable to other CPUs, and it would check for correct operation and report errors if there were problems.</p><p>I also wanted the option of running the Pico from the ring oscillator, as described in the Raspberry Pi article linked at the top. Additionally, we weren't quite sure whether the crystal oscillator frequency might be changed by very low temperatures. Therefore, to measure time accurately I sent a 1MHz clock into the Pico 2 under test, and used a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/MichaelBell/CoreMark-RP2040/blob/main/src/counter.pio\" title=\"None\">simple PIO program</a> to count the cycles. This allowed us to run from the ring oscillator or crystal, and get accurate benchmark results measured using a known good clock.</p><ul><li>Compile for RP2350, and get two core operation working</li><li>Use a copy to RAM build so we got maximum performance and didn't need to worry about the flash clock divider</li><li>Use UART output rather than a USB console to avoid USB interrupts slowing down the test, and make it easier to recover from the RP2350 crashing.</li><li>Print the temperature from the RP2350's on board temperature sensor after each run</li><li>Run repeatedly in a loop instead of just once</li><li>Add a prompt before the runs start to allow the voltage to be set (or the on board regulator to be disabled), and the frequency to be set or the ring oscillator to be selected</li><li>Add a check for console input after each run, allowing the configuration to be modified, or the pico to be rebooted into DFU mode without having to hit the BOOTSEL button. The latter meant we could update things even if it was difficult to press that button when it was buried in dry ice.</li></ul><p>I used a version of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/MichaelBell/pico-uart-bridge/tree/oc-harness\" title=\"None\">Álvaro Fernández Rojas' pico-uart-bridge</a> on a Pico W to communicate with the Pico 2 under test. This was modified to provide the 1 MHz reference clock, and also look for lines starting \"Temp\" or \"CoreMark\" and send them over WiFi.</p><p>Using MicroPython on a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/picovision\" title=\"None\">PicoVision</a>, and a modified version of the temperature display example, I read the temperature and CoreMark readings from the Pico W and graphed them on a monitor, so we could see what was happening while running the tests (I wrote this part in traditional hacker style entirely in my hotel room the night before going into Pimoroni HQ, using the dodgy hotel WiFi and the TV in the room to test it!)</p><p>First up we needed to get all three Picos involved in the setup, and the surrounding hardware working and verified. At first we had some problems with the WiFi communication, which wasn't implemented in the most reliable way, but that seemed to settle down after some initial hiccups.</p><p>We got the test Pico 2 running at 100MHz to establish a baseline. Jon at Pimoroni also pointed out that to make things easier to read it would be better to report a number in MHz instead of the CoreMark score, this was achieved simply by taking the ratio of the CoreMark score at 100MHz to the CoreMark being reported. As the CoreMark was running from internal RAM the score should be entirely linear with frequency.</p><p>Next up we got the Pico 2 I'd been using for all the testing so far, complete with its tiny heatsink, and covered it in dry ice.</p><p>We did some initial testing using the internal voltage regulator, and got it stable at 700MHz with ease:</p><p>We wanted to push up to see where the limits were, so we wired up a power supply to test point 7, disabled the onboard voltage regulator and nervously increased the voltage above the maximum of 2.2 V that I had managed before.</p><p>Up and up the voltage went, and while we got diminishing returns on the frequency acheivable, the magic smoke stayed inside the chip!</p><p>Here we got to 800MHz at 2.8V:</p><p>We realised our setup here was not ideal, as the ground for the core voltage was going via the Pico W. We measured the voltage at the Pico in the dry ice and it was around 200mV lower than the voltage being supplied, due to the resistance through that long path. With that in mind we pushed the voltage up to 3.3V and even a little higher, but it didn't allow that much more speed - the fastest we got to was 840MHz and that wasn't stable for long, we think due to the RP2350 heating up while drawing around 1A of current!</p><p>Despite this abuse the Pico 2 still works just fine!</p><h3>Ring oscillator experiments</h3><p>The RP2350 datasheet suggests you can \"automatically overclock\" using the ring oscillator - the concept is that because the ring oscillator itself changes frequency in line with the core voltage and temperature of the chip, the same ring oscillator setting should be stable across all conditions. This appears very much not to be the case (at least while using the Arm cores - see later).</p><p>I had found that (air cooled) using the \"TOOHIGH\" setting and maximum drive strength the Pico 2 ran ok up to around 1.5V and then failed, with the observed frequency at lower voltages being lower than the maximum that could be run from the crystal oscillator, but then it going up past the maximum frequency as the voltage increased. I'm not sure why this is. Using a drive strength one notch less for one of the two stages had it stable up to the maximum I had tested air cooled, so this was the initial setting we tried using.</p><p>However, as we got the voltage higher, at around 2.6V again the RP2350 would crash when running from the ring oscillator, we tried backing off the drive strength which helped a bit, but ultimately it was difficult to find a setting that would run stably at the highest voltages, while being close to the frequency we'd managed with the crystal. That was a bit unfortunate, given that at frequencies above 800MHz we could only step the frequency from the crystal in increments of 12MHz.</p><p>The Pico 2 that we were using was just the first one I had bought, with no selection based on whether it was a particularly good one for overclocking. Pimoroni rustled up 7  Pico 2s for me to test to try and find one that might overclock the best.</p><p>I quickly ran the Micropython frequency search test (linked near the top) on all of them, finding that at 1.1V they would max out at between 316 and 336MHz. Mark from Pimoroni soldered up the two best ones for further testing. We soldered a few more pins this time to get access to another ground, so the core voltage supply didn't go via the Pico W.</p><p>Despite being the fastest at 1.1V, the first Pico 2 we tested wasn't that much better than the initial one. We were briefly able to run it at 850MHz at 3.05V, but it wasn't stable. (This is 850MHz measured by dividing the CoreMark, we requested 852MHz but it seems got slightly less due to the crystal being cold or some other effects of the high core voltage). Going higher than 3.05V seemed to actually make it less stable, so this seemed to be the limit. At 840MHz requested frequency it ran for a couple of minutes, but we saw errors reported from the CoreMark so there must have been errors running some instructions.</p><p>Thinking that a lot of the problem in getting faster was just the chip warming up too fast, we looked for a larger thermal mass to try and keep it cooler for longer. Paul produced a big chunk of copper, significantly larger than the Pico 2 itself, which seemed promising.</p><p>We tried attaching this to the Pico 2 with a couple of thermal pads, but it seems they didn't provide great thermal conductivity at these low temperatures, because the results were actually worse with this than without any heatsink at all! That was a shame - maybe we should have tried just getting direct contact of the copper on top of the chip, but we were worried about shorts.</p><p>We switched over to the other Pico 2 and attached a heatsink designed for the BCM2712 on the Pi 5 to it. That got better results - obviously the simple test at 1.1V room temperature doesn't account for everything! This one would briefly manage 864MHz requested (reported 860.7MHz), and would run stable at 840MHz for some time, with no errors. The best so far!</p><p>The RP2350 is an interesting chip, with two RISC-V cores in addition to the two more established ARM cores. Mark had reminded me that we should try the RISC-V cores for comparison, and I got the image built for them - this is pretty simple to do, you just need to install the RISC-V version of gcc and change the  setting to .</p><p>I found that CoreMark actually gave a slightly higher performance per MHz using the RISC-V cores - just under 5% faster. So if you have an integer-only use for the RP2350 it is definitely worth checking if the RISC-V cores might give better performance!</p><p>Adjusting the PicoVision monitor for the CoreMark per MHz, we got the same Pico 2 running again.</p><p>Ramping the voltage up again running off the ring oscillator, with the drive strength one notch off maximum on one of the two stages, this time we found it didn't crash as the voltage increased, until we got to around 3.0V. That meant that at around 2.95V we had a stable overclock of 820-840MHz running off the ring oscillator (with the fluctuation in frequency due to temperature).</p><p>Switching over to the crystal, with 3.05V we got 861.6MHz (864MHz requested) running cleanly, and it even ran for nearly a minute at 873.5MHz before crashing. We had no luck trying to get a requested frequency of 888MHz to run.</p><p>So the top speed we managed was 873.5MHz, though when we tried this again the Pico refused to start at 3.05V, so I guess we were beginning to cause some damage with the high voltage.</p><p>For a final test we left it running on the ring oscillator at 2.95V, and it ran for around 10 minutes before we let it get a little too warm (up to around -20C).</p><p>Firstly, the RP2350 and Pico 2 is incredibly hardy. Despite the cold temperatures, some accidental shorting due to moisture when running it while cooling and extremely high core voltages, none of the 3 Pico 2s we were playing with are dead - and I don't think there's any way you would be able to tell that they had been through this treatment.</p><p>Above 700MHz the extra performance you get ramping up the voltage gives diminishing returns. This maybe because we just weren't able to keep the chip cool enough - just packing dry ice around it, it becomes difficult to carry enough heat away. Liquid nitrogen might be interesting to experiment with to go further.</p><p>Given this experimentation, it seems around 1.6V from the voltage regulator should easily allow a 500MHz or slightly faster overclock without needing any additional cooling and likely without really causing much damage to the Pico - it might be interesting to run a Pico 2 loaded like that for a few days and see if anything bad happens.</p><p>Playing with dry ice is fun! If we get a chance to do this again we should also try overclocking a Pi 5, and see if we could get a speed record there. Although that could be rather more expensive - the great thing about using Pico 2 for this, is that at under £5 per board you can treat them with reckless abandon - after all, they each cost less than a pint of beer!</p>",

      "content": "<h2>Building Modern UIs Without the Framework Tax</h2><div><p>17.02.2026, </p><a href=\"https://www.caimito.net/en/about.html\"><img src=\"https://gravatar.com/avatar/663d11426b0a187ddac59f8c17ce61b4?s=120&amp;d=robohash&amp;r=x\"></a><p>Modern browsers now support everything needed to build sophisticated, reactive web interfaces without React, Vue, or Angular. Web components, custom elements, shadow DOM, and native event systems let developers create modular, reusable UI pieces that communicate elegantly — and AI assistants can help you master these patterns faster than ever before.</p></div><h2>The Shift That Already Happened</h2><p>Something remarkable occurred while many developers weren’t watching. The web platform itself became capable of doing what frameworks were invented to do.</p><div>\n\"The browser has become the framework. We just haven't fully noticed yet.\"\n</div><p>Custom Elements let you define your own HTML tags with their own behavior. Shadow DOM provides encapsulation that keeps component styles and structure isolated. Templates and slots offer composition patterns. And perhaps most importantly, the native event system provides a robust mechanism for components to communicate without tight coupling.</p><p>These aren’t experimental features. They’ve been shipping in every major browser for years. The question is no longer whether they work, but why more developers haven’t embraced them.</p><h2>Freedom from the Upgrade Treadmill</h2><p>Every framework carries hidden costs. There’s the initial learning curve, certainly. But there’s also the ongoing maintenance burden: major version upgrades that break things, deprecated patterns you must migrate away from, build tooling that needs constant updating.</p><div>\n\"When your component is just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, there's nothing to upgrade except your own code.\"\n</div><p>Web components built on platform standards sidestep this entirely. The browser vendors have committed to backward compatibility in ways that framework maintainers simply cannot. Code written to web standards a decade ago still works today. That’s not true of code written for Angular 1, or React class components, or Vue 2’s options API.</p><p>For organizations building products that need to run for years, this stability matters enormously. It’s one less thing that can break, one less dependency that can become a security vulnerability, one less abstraction layer between your code and the runtime.</p><p>The elegance of web components becomes most apparent when you consider how they communicate. The native Custom Events system provides everything you need for sophisticated component interaction.</p><p>A component deep in your UI hierarchy can dispatch an event that bubbles up through the DOM tree:</p><div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div></div><p>Any ancestor component — or the application shell itself — can listen for and respond to that event. There’s no need for a global state store, no prop drilling, no context providers. The DOM itself becomes your communication infrastructure.</p><div>\n\"The DOM has always been an event bus. We just forgot how to use it.\"\n</div><p>Components can also communicate downward through attributes and properties. When a parent changes an attribute, the child’s  fires, giving it a chance to respond. For more complex data, properties allow passing objects and arrays directly.</p><p>This creates a natural, predictable flow: data down through properties and attributes, events up through the bubbling system. It’s the same pattern React popularized, but using web standards instead of library abstractions.</p><h2>Learning Through Building</h2><p>Here’s something that surprises many developers: you don’t need to master every detail of the Web Components specification before you can build useful things. The basics are remarkably accessible.</p><p>A minimal custom element looks like this:</p><div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div></div><p>That’s a working component. It’s not production-ready — it lacks reactivity, encapsulation, and proper lifecycle handling — but it demonstrates how accessible the entry point is. You can iterate from this simple beginning toward more sophisticated implementations as your understanding grows.</p><h2>AI as Your Pair Programming Partner</h2><div>\n\"The best way to learn web components is to build them — and AI makes experimentation nearly frictionless.\"\n</div><p>This is where modern AI assistants transform the learning experience. You can describe what you want a component to do, receive a working implementation, and then ask questions about the parts you don’t understand. The AI can explain why  matters for events that need to cross shadow DOM boundaries. It can show you the difference between  and . It can help you refactor toward better patterns as your requirements evolve.</p><p>You don’t need to read the entire MDN documentation on Web Components before building your first real component. Instead, you can learn by doing, with an AI partner that understands the specification deeply and can answer questions in context.</p><p>This approach — building first, understanding deeply second — works remarkably well with web standards. The patterns are simpler than framework patterns because there’s less abstraction. When something doesn’t work, the debugging surface is smaller. When you want to understand why something works, there are fewer layers to peel back.</p><p>Consider a realistic scenario: a dashboard with multiple independent panels that need to respond to a shared filter.</p><p>Without frameworks, you might structure this with a simple event-driven architecture:</p><div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div></div><p>Each panel component implements its own  method. The panels don’t know about each other. The filter component doesn’t know about the panels. The dashboard shell provides minimal coordination. Components can be developed, tested, and reused independently.</p><div>\n\"Loose coupling isn't just elegant architecture — it's faster development and easier maintenance.\"\n</div><p>This same pattern scales. As you add more panels, they simply implement the expected interface. As you add more event types, the coordination logic grows proportionally, not exponentially.</p><h2>Shadow DOM: Encapsulation That Actually Works</h2><p>One of the most practical benefits of web components is shadow DOM encapsulation. Your component’s styles don’t leak out, and global styles don’t leak in (unless you explicitly allow them).</p><div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div></div><p>Those styles affect only this component. You can use simple, semantic class names without worrying about collisions. You can refactor styles without fear of breaking something elsewhere.</p><p>This is encapsulation that actually encapsulates. It’s what CSS Modules, CSS-in-JS, BEM, and countless other approaches have tried to achieve — built directly into the platform.</p><h2>When Frameworks Still Make Sense</h2><p>Web components aren’t always the right choice. If your team already knows React deeply and moves quickly with it, there’s real value in that shared expertise. If you’re building something that will be maintained by developers who expect framework patterns, web components might create friction.</p><div>\n\"The best technology choice is the one that fits your team, your timeline, and your constraints.\"\n</div><p>For new projects, though — especially smaller teams or solo developers building products that need to run for years — web components deserve serious consideration. The reduced complexity, improved stability, and smaller bundle sizes create real advantages.</p><p>And there’s an interesting hybrid path: many frameworks now work well with web components. You can introduce custom elements gradually into an existing React or Vue application. You can wrap web components in framework-specific bindings. Migration can be incremental rather than revolutionary.</p><p>The path to building with web components is surprisingly short:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Build a simple component.</strong> Something with a template, maybe an attribute or two. See how it mounts to the DOM.</p></li><li><p> Handle events within the component. Update the DOM in response. Experience the directness of working without virtual DOM abstraction.</p></li><li><p> Have one component dispatch a custom event. Have another listen for it. Feel how naturally the event system handles component coordination.</p></li><li><p><strong>Encapsulate with shadow DOM.</strong> Add scoped styles. Use slots for composition. Appreciate how encapsulation simplifies your mental model.</p></li><li><p> Build more components. Let AI help when you encounter unfamiliar territory. Learn the lifecycle callbacks as you need them.</p></li></ol><p>Each step teaches something useful. Each component you build adds to your understanding. And unlike framework knowledge that might become obsolete, your understanding of the web platform will compound for years.</p><p>We’re in an interesting moment. The platform has caught up to — and in some ways surpassed — the capabilities that made frameworks essential a decade ago. The tooling exists. The browser support is universal. The patterns are well-documented.</p><div>\n\"The future of web development might look more like its past: standards-based, interoperable, and built to last.\"\n</div><p>What’s been missing is momentum. Developers gravitate toward what’s popular, and frameworks have dominated mindshare for so long that many never seriously evaluated the alternative.</p><p>But trends shift. The JavaScript ecosystem’s complexity has become a recognized problem. The appeal of simpler, more stable foundations grows as developers tire of churn. AI assistants make learning new approaches faster and less intimidating.</p><p>Web components offer something valuable: a way to build modern, sophisticated interfaces with technology that will still work decades from now. For developers willing to explore beyond the framework mainstream, there’s a quieter, more elegant path waiting.</p><p>The tools are ready. The browsers are ready. Perhaps it’s time to rediscover what the web platform can do.</p><div><p>Get new articles, story episodes, and hero profiles delivered to your inbox.</p></div>",

      "content": "<p>Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) are emerging as a promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) LMs. Instead of generating one token at a time, DLMs iteratively refine a partially masked sequence over multiple sampling steps, gradually transforming a fully masked sequence into clean text. This refinement process creates a compelling opportunity: it enables parallel generation, allowing the model to finalize multiple tokens per iteration and potentially achieve higher throughput than AR decoding. At the same time, it can exploit bidirectional context to unlock new capabilities such as text infilling and refinement.</p><p>However, in practice, standard DLMs suffer from two major inefficiencies. [1]</p><ol role=\"list\"><li><strong>KV caching incompatibility under full bidirectional attention.</strong>Standard DLMs commonly use bidirectional (non-causal) attention, which requires recomputing attention over the full context at every denoising step, making inference expensive and preventing standard KV caching.</li><li><strong>High refinement step counts to maintain quality.</strong>High-quality generation typically requires many denoising/refinement steps, often comparable to the generation length. Naively reducing the number of steps tends to degrade quality sharply.</li></ol><p>CDLM targets both bottlenecks through a post-training recipe that makes fewer-step inference reliable while enabling exact block-wise KV caching.</p><h2><strong>Preliminary: Inference in diffusion language models</strong></h2><p>DLM generation is an iterative refinement over N discrete sampling steps. It transforms a fully masked sequence at time t=1 into a clean sequence at t=0. At each step, the model predicts a clean sequence distribution x0 given the current noisy sequence xt and prompt c:</p><p>$p_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{X}_0 \\mid \\mathbf{X}_t, c)$</p><p>A common deterministic instantiation is low-confidence remasking: the model greedily unmasks tokens (often within blocks), finalizing the highest-confidence masked positions while keeping others masked. This leads to the decoding trajectory:</p><p>$\\mathcal{T}_{\\mathbf{x}} = \\left(\\mathbf{x}_{t_0}, \\mathbf{x}_{t_1}, \\ldots, \\mathbf{x}_{t_N}\\right), \\quad t_k = 1 - \\frac{k}{N}$</p><p>which records how the partially refined sequence evolves step-by-step. This trajectory becomes the core object for CDLM’s training.</p><p>We collect trajectories offline by running inference with a DLM on domain-specific prompts. For each prompt x, we record the token-level decoding trajectory T_x, a compact hidden-state buffer H_x containing last-layer hidden states at token finalization moments, and the ground-truth text ŷ. Concretely, we adopt block-wise decoding with a generation length L_g = 256, block size B = 32, and a total of N = L_g steps (i.e., finalizing exactly one token per step within the current block). This conservative setting yields higher-quality trajectories for distillation.</p><h3><strong>2) Block-causal student and attention mask</strong></h3><p>During trajectory extraction, we use a full bidirectional attention mask. In contrast, when training CDLM, we employ a block-wise causal mask that attends to the prompt, previously completed blocks, and the current decoding block. This design enables the model switch from full bidirectional to block-diffusion models (like [2]), enabling exact block-wise KV caching for finalized blocks.</p><p>CDLM jointly minimizes three objectives:</p><p><strong>(i) Distillation loss (newly unmasked positions)</strong></p><p>For positions that become newly unmasked between an intermediate state y and its block completion y*, we match the student’s predictive distribution to the teacher’s reconstructed distribution obtained from stored hidden states.</p><p>Intuition: this objective serves as the primary anchor that teaches the student to finalize multiple tokens within a block under block-causal constraints.</p><p><strong>(ii) Consistency loss (still-masked positions)</strong></p><p>We enforce within-block temporal consistency by aligning the student’s predictions at state y with its own predictions at the more informed state y* for still-masked positions, using a stop-gradient target.</p><p>Intuition: this objective encourages stable multi-step transitions along the decoding trajectory.</p><p><strong>(iii) Auxiliary DLM masked-denoising loss</strong></p><p>We include a standard masked denoising objective applied to randomly masked ground-truth text.</p><p>Intuition: this objective preserves the model’s general masked-token prediction capability and helps retain reasoning behavior, particularly on mathematical tasks.</p><p>At inference time, CDLM decodes in a block-wise autoregressive manner, reusing the KV cache for the prompt and all previously finalized blocks. Within each block, we apply confidence-thresholded parallel finalization. [3] We also adopt early stopping once an end-of-text token appears in the current block.</p><p>We intentionally avoid additional heuristics that introduce extra hyperparameters (e.g., inter-block parallelism with task-dependent settings), and instead focus on a robust default decoding pipeline based on exact KV caching and reliable step reduction.</p><ul role=\"list\"><li>CDLM–Dream achieves the largest step reductions across benchmarks, cutting refinement steps by roughly 4.1x–7.7x with minor accuracy changes on most tasks.</li><li>These step reductions translate into large latency improvements: up to 11.2x on GSM8K-CoT and 14.5x on MBPP-Instruct.</li><li>CDLM often attains the highest Tokens Per Second throughput, with one notable nuance: tasks can show different decoding dynamics because CDLM is strictly block-causal and may produce shorter outputs while preserving pass@1 quality.</li></ul><p><strong>Effective step reduction: Why training matters</strong></p><p>Naively truncating the number of steps causes marked accuracy degradation, while CDLM maintains quality at similar step budgets (and achieves roughly half the latency thanks to caching). This highlights the core point: stable multi-token refinement is not free; it requires training that enforces trajectory-consistent behavior.</p><p><strong>System-level analysis: Why block-wise DLM sits in the sweet spot</strong></p><p>To understand hardware utilization, we analyze arithmetic intensity (AI), FLOPs per byte moved, as batch size increases, comparing: AR decoding, vanilla (full-attention) DLMs, block-wise DLMs (CDLM) with B∈{4,16,32}.</p><ul role=\"list\"><li>AR decoding is strongly memory-bound at small batch sizes (AI near 1 at bs=1), scaling as batch increases due to weight-load amortization.</li><li>Vanilla DLMs are compute-bound even at bs=1 because full bidirectional attention processes the whole sequence each step, leading to saturation.</li><li>Block-wise DLMs (CDLM) occupy an intermediate regime: higher AI than AR due to intra-block parallelism (processing B tokens under similar memory traffic), but lower than vanilla DLMs, often a balanced operating point for small-batch settings.</li></ul><p>Overall, the analysis explains why CDLM-like block-wise diffusion can deliver strong efficiency at small batch sizes: it uses parallelism to amortize memory access while remaining in a regime that still benefits from practical scaling.</p><h3><strong>Expressiveness vs. efficiency&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Full bidirectional attention in DLMs requires recomputing O(L^2) attention at every denoising step, making inference highly compute-intensive. CDLM enables exact KV caching while preserving bidirectional context within each block, retaining local refinement capabilities (e.g., infilling inside the current block).</p><h3><strong>Scaling with stronger DLM backbones</strong></h3><p>CDLM is a post-training recipe that can be applied to any block-diffusion model, and its benefits should grow as stronger DLMs emerge. A promising direction is to collect trajectories from larger, stronger DLM teachers and train mid-scale students with CDLM.&nbsp;</p><p>We presented CDLM, a training-based acceleration scheme that brings consistency modeling to DLMs. By enforcing within-block temporal consistency and fine-tuning a block-wise causal student, CDLM reduces refinement steps and enables exact KV caching. Across math and coding tasks, CDLM yields faster inference, fewer steps, lower latency, and higher throughput while maintaining competitive accuracy.</p><p>[1] Beyond Next-Token Prediction: A Performance Characterization of Diffusion versus Autoregressive Language Models</p><p>[2] Block Diffusion: Interpolating Between Autoregressive and Diffusion Language Models</p><p>[3] Fast-dLLM: Training-free Acceleration of Diffusion LLM by Enabling KV Cache and Parallel Decoding</p>",

      "content": "<p>I’ve always wanted an ARM server in my homelab. But earlier, I either had to use an underpowered ARM system, or use Asahi which not only requires expensive Mac hardware but also slowed down in the past few years.</p><p>Then Minisforum introduced the MS-R1 Mini PC. Two MS-01s were already incumbent in my homelab when they replaced power-hungry HPE towers, but the MS-R1 gave me what I wanted: a reasonably powerful ARM machine which doesn’t have bank-breaking Mac pricing.</p><p>I got the MS-R1 barebones and had a 1TB SSD sitting around.</p><p>I opened the box and got this:</p><p>I installed my SSD, and attempted to install Rocky Linux.</p><p>So here it is, Rocky Linux booted.</p><p>There’s one issue: the onboard NICs weren’t detected:</p><p>I installed it anyways, and tried to sideload the Realtek r8127 drivers. While they did install and load, keeping the driver upon kernel updates wasn’t elegant and very hacky.</p><p>I could keep trying, but decided to just use Fedora instead:</p><p>Yes, while I use Fedora on my laptop, I also know Fedora is generally not a good option for a server. But it had the NIC drivers as the RTL8127 is newer than RHEL 10’s freeze but not Fedora 43’s.</p><p>Here’s my obligatory homelab picture:</p><p>MS-R1 on the top, then two MS-01s, MikroTik CCR2004-16G-2S+PC, CRS309-1G-8S+IN and CSS610-8P-2S+IN.</p><p>First, it’s a powerful-enough ARM system which doesn’t break the bank. I wanted this for so long. I’d say it’s quieter than the MS-01s but then Intel doesn’t exactly have the most efficient silicon. Yet even as an efficiency for performance freak I have a 285K instead of a 9950X.</p><p>While Minisforum recommends their Debian image, Rocky Linux worked for everything but the NICs, and Fedora works for everything I need. I haven’t tested the integrated GPU since I plan to use this headless. I also own a Mac as my ARM (but not main) laptop.</p><p>Say what you want about UEFI and ACPI, but it does make hardware support easier. Heck, not just Macs with UTM, but  ARM laptops in China can run Windows VMs, despite crippling US sanctions.</p><p>I do hope a future CentOS/RHEL/Rocky 10 adds the Realtek 8127 so I won’t have to wait until 2028 for Rocky 11. And no I won’t use Debian.</p><p>By no means is the MS-R1 perfect.</p><p>For instance, there are two M.2 slots but one is used by the Wi-Fi and even if I remove it, cannot use it for a M.2 SSD, only U.2. I’d still prefer to have RAID if not for the shortage. The MS-01 and A2 have multiple M.2 SSD slots.</p><p>Also, Marvell AQC107 NICs wasn’t detected by the UEFI, so they couldn’t be used as far as I tried:</p><p>Unless the NIC died or my UEFI configuration is wrong, it’s simply not usable.</p><p>One nit: if I select “power on after outage,” it didn’t do it when I unplugged and replugged the server. Darn.</p><h2>Why not Debian or Ubuntu?</h2><p>While I’m aware there’s a “recommended” Debian variant for the MS-R1, I’m simply not a fan of Debian-based distros. Sure, I run my UniFi controller on Debian (inside Incus). But that’s because I  to, not because I want to.</p><p>I don’t hate Debian, I respect Debian for what they do. They do many things right, like being truly community-owned and having a reliable upgrade path (which RHEL and co notoriously lacks). But it’s not for me, despite having used it for 2.5 months before nearly a decade of FreeBSD.</p><p>The ARM ecosystem while growing is still small when compared to x86. Heck, I daily drive an HP OmniBook Ultra instead of a faster M3 Pro MacBook Pro  of Linux. And Asahi’s delays.</p><p>The MS-R1 isn’t perfect, but works quite well as a homelab ARM hypervisor. Do I regret it? Not at all, despite its problems. It’s early adopter problems, but I have pretty thick skin as long as my privacy isn’t invaded for profit and “AI”.</p><p>The Mac Studio is way too expensive, even used, while expected for Apple is more expensive than even already expensive current-gen HPE ProLiants.  is cheaper than Apple, and is already expensive as-is. ARM64 SBCs are great, but I still wanted something like a PC.</p><p>There is also one other perk: while the MSRP is $599, I got it for $559  a RAM shortage.</p><p>While it won’t replace my two MS-01s (too much x86 software! vPro!), it’s a nice addition and is already running my secondary Samba domain controller in a FreeBSD 15.0 virtual machine.</p>",

But Claude Code's notification body is always just \"Claude is waiting for your input\" with no context, and with enough tabs open, I couldn't even read the titles anymore.</p><p>I tried a few coding orchestrators but most of them were Electron/Tauri apps and the performance bugged me. I also just prefer the terminal since GUI orchestrators lock you into their workflow. So I built cmux as a native macOS app in Swift/AppKit. It uses libghostty for terminal rendering and reads your existing Ghostty config for themes, fonts, colors, and more.</p><p>The main additions are the sidebar and notification system. The sidebar has vertical tabs that show git branch, working directory, listening ports, and the latest notification text for each workspace. The notification system picks up terminal sequences (OSC 9/99/777) and has a CLI (cmux notify) you can wire into agent hooks for Claude Code, OpenCode, etc. When an agent is waiting, its pane gets a blue ring and the tab lights up in the sidebar, so I can tell which one needs me across splits and tabs. Cmd+Shift+U jumps to the most recent unread.</p><p>The in-app browser has a scriptable API ported from agent-browser [1]. Agents can snapshot the accessibility tree, get element refs, click, fill forms, evaluate JS, and read console logs. You can split a browser pane next to your terminal and have Claude Code interact with your dev server directly.</p><p>Everything is scriptable through the CLI and socket API – create workspaces/tabs, split panes, send keystrokes, open URLs in the browser.</p>",

      "content": "<p>n April 2025, less than three months after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Donald Trump</a> returned to the White House, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) put out its latest public health alert on so-called “superbugs”, strains of bacteria resistant to antibiotics.</p><p>These drug-resistant germs, the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/antimicrobial-resistance/data-research/threats/index.html\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">CDC warned</a>, are responsible for more than 3m infections in the US each year, claiming the lives of up to 48,000 Americans.</p><p>Globally, the largely untreatable pathogens contribute annually to almost 5m deaths, and <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/news/2026/01/21/antimicrobial-resistance-pandemic-will-kill-more-people-than-cancer-by-2050\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">health experts </a>fear that unless urgent steps are taken they could become a leading killer, surpassing even cancer, by 2050.</p><p>“We’re in a war against bacteria,” said Ian Morgan, a postdoctoral fellow at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), the world’s largest funder of biomedical research. He is on the frontlines of that war against superbugs; the NIH lab in which he works is driving what he described as “high-risk, high-reward research”.</p><p>But over the past year, the battlefield has toughened. Under the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Trump administration</a>, Morgan, 33, and thousands of other young American scientists like him have grappled with wave after wave of disruptions.</p><p>Billions of dollars have been wiped from research budgets, almost <a href=\"https://grant-witness.us/\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">8,000 grants</a> have been cancelled at NIH and the US National Science Foundation alone, and more than 1,000 NIH employees have been fired.</p><p>Morgan’s research has been rattled by multibillion-dollar cuts in <a href=\"https://www.science.org/content/article/nih-under-orders-cancel-2-6-billion-contracts\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">NIH contracts</a> that make it impossible for labs to maintain their equipment. They have the choice of paying exorbitant maintenance fees, or <a href=\"https://www.the-scientist.com/nih-leadership-is-failing-early-career-researchers-73574\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">giving up on experiments</a>.</p><p>Amid the maelstrom, young and early-career scientists like Morgan are among the hardest hit. His own future is now in doubt.</p><p>In the normal trajectory of a life in science, Morgan would be planning to set up his own laboratory conducting groundbreaking research designed to win the war on superbugs. But with an ongoing hiring freeze at NIH, his options are limited.</p><p>“Right now there’s no way even to apply to start your own lab at NIH, no matter how good you are, or how critical your work,” he says.</p><p>Morgan’s predicament has led him to step up as a steward at a <a href=\"https://uaw.org/tag/local-2750/\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">new union</a> for young NIH researchers formed under the umbrella of the UAW. Its almost 5,000 members are organizing against the Trump administration’s assault on American science.</p><p>The chaos that has descended on NIH over the past year has led Morgan to fear for his future, the future of his craft, and ultimately the fight against superbugs.</p><p>“We’re making progress, we have a lot of really cool new innovations that could defeat the infections,” he said. “But if we stop doing the work, we lose the war.”</p><p>A similar story to Morgan’s could be told by tens of thousands of other young scientists throughout NIH and across numerous US universities experiencing federal funding squeezes. More than 10,000 post-doctoral experts in scientific and related fields were lost to the federal workforce last year, <a href=\"https://www.science.org/content/article/u-s-government-has-lost-more-10-000-stem-ph-d-s-trump-took-office\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">according to Science</a>.</p><p>The magazine looked at 14 research agencies, including NIH, and found that the number of employees departing outstripped new hires by 11 to one.</p><p>The brain drain is prompting existential fears that American science, a powerhouse of the US economy and of global public health, is being deprived of its lifeblood. The source of young researchers – the next generation of scientists who are the fount of new ideas and innovation – is being throttled.</p><p>“The talent pool is developed by letting young people flourish among like-minded, excited scientists,” said John Prensner, a pediatric brain cancer doctor who leads a research laboratory at the University of Michigan. “If that ceases, then that intellectual discovery, that drive to make the next great insight into cancer or other challenges, will be planted in another country’s soil.”</p><p>The NIH drives scientific progress globally across biomedical and behavioral sciences, including defenses against infectious diseases and possible future pandemics. It pushes at the frontier of new therapies geared to the genetic makeup of individual patients, and can claim numerous breakthroughs in cancer treatment, vaccinations and much more.</p><p>Without the NIH driving innovation at its core, the US would cease to have the largest biomedical ecosystem in the world.</p><h2><strong>‘Wiping out the next generation of scientists’</strong></h2><p>Emma Bay Dickinson, a 27-year-old postgrad researcher in infectious diseases, is a specialist in <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/zika/index.html\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">zika</a>, the largely mosquito-born virus that can cause birth defects. Her longer-term ambition is to help find a way to protect the world against viruses that have the potential to evolve into the next pandemic, such as avian flu.</p><p>For now, though, the US will miss out on her skills. The Trump administration’s funding cuts began to hit last year just when, as a postgraduate research fellow at NIH in Washington DC, she was hunting for her next position.</p><p>“My classmates applying in the US were getting rejected, and were being told that the funding cuts meant there was too much uncertainty to offer them jobs.”</p><p>Dickinson, who is queer, was discouraged by Trump’s animus against diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) which was used as a justification for many of the grant cuts. She was also dismayed by the blatant censorship imposed by the administration.</p><p>Applicants for federal research funding were forced to filter their proposals to remove a <a href=\"https://pen.org/banned-words-list/\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">banned list</a> of key words across DEI, climate, vaccines and other study areas deemed undesirable by Trump.</p><p>So Dickinson redirected her energies abroad. She began applying for posts in Spain and Germany, in the end landing a spot at a prestigious program at a Barcelona infectious disease research institution.</p><p>For the foreseeable future, she sees her future in Europe. “It’s important for me to feel I can be myself in my science, and that’s just not possible right now in the US,” she said.</p><p>She is not alone. A growing number of young American scientists are quitting the country for positions in Europe, Australia or Asia. Universities across Europe have been swift to exploit the opportunity, openly enticing young Americans to join <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/research/2025/05/01/european-governments-back-universities-us-recruitment-drive\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">the exodus</a> and seek “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/25/europe-universities-us-researchers-trump-administration-science\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">scientific asylum</a>” with them.</p><p>The response has been overwhelming. Aix-Marseille University, which launched one of the first European programs to lure people from the US, was inundated by hundreds of applications from early-career researchers hoping to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/jul/05/academics-leaving-us-scientific-asylum-france-trump\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">flee the US</a>.</p><p>The outflow of young scientists has been exacerbated by deep cuts to NIH training programs, which acts as a breeding ground of the US’s future top scientists. At least 50 training programs, targeted at undergraduates through early-career lab researchers, have been shut down under the Trump administration.</p><p>An NIH program officer spoke to the Guardian about the impact of the training cuts, but asked not to be named for fear of reprisal. “Trainees are the most vulnerable people in science,” the officer said.</p><p>“They are the ones with new ideas, where a lot of our hope resides. Now they are losing their minds with worry about what comes next. They are desperate for advice on how to stay in science when there are no grants available.”</p><p>The officer added: “If you delay and terminate training grants, it’s like a snowball effect. Eventually you start wiping out our next generation of scientists.”</p><p>Adding to the problem of young talent leaving the country, the flow of early-career researchers entering US scientific labs from around the world is also shrinking as a result of Trump’s immigration crackdown. Scientists from abroad are often at the forefront of US innovation – last year, half of the <a href=\"https://nfap.com/research/new-nfap-policy-brief-immigrants-and-nobel-prizes-1901-2025/\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">US Nobel prize winners</a> in science subjects were immigrants.</p><p>In September, Trump imposed a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/19/trump-h1b-visa-100000-fee\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">$100,000 fee</a> on new applications for H-1B visas for foreign skilled workers, a move that makes coming to the US prohibitively expensive for most researchers. Then in January the administration suspended immigrant visa processing to people from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/14/full-list-75-countries-visa-processing-suspended\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">75 countries</a>.</p><p>Add to that the nightly TV images beamed around the world of ICE raids on US city streets, and a clear message has been sent out that America does not welcome newcomers.</p><p>Jennifer Jones, director for the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said that the international reputation of US science had been damaged in ways that could take years to repair.</p><p>“We are no longer attracting top talent from around the world. Why would you want to come to a place where you know you could be threatened with deportation at any moment?”</p><h2><strong>‘Leaving discoveries on the table’</strong></h2><p>Emily Hilliard, the press secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, told the Guardian that NIH was “deeply committed to providing opportunities for early career scientists by restoring the agency’s culture and rebuilding public trust”. She disputed the idea that the pipeline of young scientists was being reduced, calling such claims “baseless and intended to fearmonger”.</p><p>“NIH will continue to attract and recruit the best and brightest, strengthen the US biomedical workforce, and deliver cures and solutions for Americans,” she said.</p><p>But NIH staff continue to view the future with trepidation. Jenna Norton, a program director at NIH, said she had been surprised by how quickly the landscape had changed.</p><p>She was placed on <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/14/nx-s1-5608969/federal-employees-shutdown-trump-leave\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">indefinite paid leave</a> from the agency in November, without being given any explanation. Earlier this month Norton filed a <a href=\"https://katzbanks.com/news/nih-scientist-files-whistleblower-complaint-alleging-retaliation-by-hhs-and-nih-for-speaking-out-against-politicization-of-science-and-unlawful-grant-terminations/\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">whistleblower complaint </a>alleging that the Trump administration had unlawfully retaliated against her for openly criticising Trump’s cuts to grants, funding and staffing at NIH.</p><p>Speaking in her personal capacity, Norton told the Guardian: “I was not expecting this administration to come at science as broadly and as quickly as they have.”</p><p>In the long run, the damage done to the next generation of researchers threatens to harm not just scientific knowledge itself, but also the US economy. NIH funding supports basic biomedical research out of which new drugs and other commercial spin-offs emerge.</p><p>As such, it provides the foundations for the almost trillion-dollar US pharmaceutical industry. A <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1715368115\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">2018 study</a> of the 210 new drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the six years to 2016 found that all of them had been developed out of early basic research funded by NIH.</p><p>“We are leaving discoveries on the table,” warned Donna Ginther, an economics professor at the University of Kansas who is an authority on the science labor market. “Those discoveries are the ones that in 10, 20 years will contribute to economic growth, improved health, human longevity. That’s what we are choking off.”</p>",

      "content": "<p>We're thinking about AI wrong.</p><p>I keep noticing the same pattern: companies that treat AI as an autonomous agent that should \"just figure it out\" tend to be disappointed. Meanwhile, companies that treat AI as an extension of their existing workforce, an amplifier of human capability rather than a replacement, are seeing genuinely transformative results. Thats not to say that AI can't act automonously with specific tasks (see the rise of OpenClaw as a viral proof of concept), but even that still acts as an extension of human decision making and context.</p><p>The framing matters more than we realize. And I think the best mental model for understanding AI isn't a new coworker. It's an exoskeleton.</p><p>Stay with me here, because this isn't just a metaphor. There are real examples of exoskeletons being deployed right now across manufacturing, logistics, military, and healthcare. The statistics are worth paying attention to.</p><ul><li>Ford has deployed EksoVest exoskeletons in 15 plants across 7 countries. The result? An 83% decrease in injuries in units using exoskeletons. Workers still do the overhead lifting (4,600 times per day)but with 5-15 pounds of assistance per arm that makes the work sustainable.</li><li>BMW's Spartanburg plant reports 30-40% reduction in worker effort using Levitate Technologies vests.</li><li>German Bionic's Cray X provides up to 66 lbs of lift support per movement. German Bionic reports that customers using the Cray X, including BMW and IKEA, have seen a 25% reduction in sick days.</li></ul><p><strong>In Military Applications:</strong></p><ul><li>The Sarcos Guardian XO Max provides 20:1 strength amplification. 100 lbs feels like 5 lbs. Soldiers can carry up to 200 pounds, not because the suit replaces them, but because it amplifies what they can already do.</li><li>The Lockheed Martin HULC enables carrying 200 pounds at sustained speeds of ~7 mph with 10 mph bursts. This matters because musculoskeletal injuries account for over half of all military injuries, with back injuries among the most common. The exoskeleton doesn't fight for the soldier. It keeps them from getting injured while they do their job.</li></ul><p><strong>In Medical Rehabilitation:</strong></p><ul><li>In a meta-analysis of powered exoskeleton training, 76% of patients with spinal cord injuries were able to walk while wearing the exoskeleton with no additional physical assistance from therapists, many using only crutches or walkers for balance. These are people who were told they would never walk again.</li></ul><ul><li>Stanford's 2020 research showed a 15% reduction in the energy cost of running with their ankle exoskeleton, potentially translating to a 10% boost in running speed.</li><li>Harvard's soft exosuit reduced the metabolic cost of running by 5.4%. That means a marathon would feel like running 24.9 miles instead of 26.2.</li></ul><p>Notice the pattern here. The exoskeleton doesn't replace the human. It doesn't lift the boxes, run the race, or walk the steps independently. It amplifies human capability. The human is still doing the work, they're just able to do dramatically more of it, more sustainably, with less injury and fatigue.</p><h2>The Ontological Problem with \"AI Agents\"</h2><p>Here's where the AI industry has gone a bit sideways.</p><p>There's been this rush toward \"agentic AI\", or systems that operate autonomously, make their own decisions, and complete entire workflows without human intervention. The dream of having a fully autonomous AI employee is seductive. But I think we've been seduced by the wrong metaphor.</p><p>When we think of AI as an autonomous agent as a separate entity with its own judgment and decision-making, we set ourselves up for disappointment. We expect it to understand context it wasn't given. We expect it to make judgment calls it isn't equipped to make. We get frustrated when it \"hallucinates\" or goes off the rails.</p><h2>What This Looks Like in Product Development</h2><p>Instead of building AI that autonomously decides what your product should be, we built a platform that goes incredibly deep on research and analysis — then puts the insights in front of the humans who actually make the calls.</p><p>The difference sounds subtle but it's not. Let me give you a concrete example.</p><p>Kasava's commit analysis doesn't just count lines of code. It reads every commit across your repositories, categorizes changes by type and impact, identifies patterns in how your codebase is evolving, and surfaces risks you might not have noticed — like a critical module that's been accumulating technical debt for months. But it doesn't decide what to do about it. That's your call. The AI goes deep. The human decides what matters.</p><p>Our transcript analysis works the same way. Feed in customer calls, user interviews, or sales conversations, and Kasava extracts themes, sentiment shifts, feature requests, and pain points across hundreds of hours of recordings. It surfaces patterns no human could find manually — not because humans aren't smart enough, but because there's too much data to hold in your head at once. The AI handles the scale. The human interprets the meaning.</p><p>This is the exoskeleton model. Each capability in Kasava is like a component of a larger system that, when assembled, gives product teams dramatically deeper insight into their product, their market, and their users — not by replacing their judgment, but by amplifying their capacity to make informed decisions.</p><h2>Why \"Autonomous Agents\" Often Fail (And How the Product Graph Fixes It)</h2><p>Autonomous agents fail because they don't have the context that humans carry around implicitly. They don't know that your enterprise clients care more about reliability than speed. They don't know that your team decided last quarter to deprecate a feature that's still getting usage. They don't know that the reason you price things the way you do is rooted in a competitive dynamic that never got written down anywhere.</p><p>This is the fundamental problem with generic AI tools applied to product decisions — they're missing the connective tissue of your product's reality.</p><p>Kasava's answer to this is the product graph — a structured, living representation of your product that combines two layers of context most AI tools never have.</p><p>The first layer is built automatically. Kasava ingests your codebase, your commit history, your GitHub issues, your PRs, your project management tickets — and from that raw material, it constructs a deep understanding of what your product actually is. Not what your marketing page says it is. What the code says. Which features are actively evolving, which are stagnating, where complexity is concentrating, what your team is actually spending time on versus what the roadmap claims. This is thousands of signals that already exist in your workflow — Kasava just reads them, connects them, and makes them queryable.</p><p>The second layer comes from you. When you tell Kasava that a particular feature is strategic, or that a competitor's recent launch changes your priorities, or that certain customer segments matter more than others, those heuristics get woven into the graph alongside the automated context. Your judgment about what matters meets the machine's ability to track everything.</p><p>This is what makes the exoskeleton model actually work in practice. The Ford EksoVest provides 15 pounds of lift assistance regardless of context — it's a simple mechanical amplifier. But product decisions aren't simple. They require judgment shaped by history, strategy, and nuance that only your team has. The product graph is how that judgment gets combined with a massive, continuously updated body of evidence from your actual codebase and workflows — so that when Kasava analyzes your commits, tracks your competitors, or synthesizes customer feedback, it's doing so through the lens of both what's really happening in your product and what your team believes should happen next.</p><p>It's this symbiosis — automated depth meeting human direction — that makes Kasava an exoskeleton rather than just another AI tool. Neither layer works alone. The machine can't decide what matters. The human can't track everything. Together, they create something neither could achieve independently.</p><h2>The Micro-Agent Architecture</h2><p>If you want to build AI that actually works for your team, here's the framework I'd suggest:</p><p><strong>1. Decompose jobs into discrete tasks, not entire roles.</strong></p><p>Don't ask \"can AI do a developer's job?\" Ask \"what are the 47 things a developer does in a given week, and which of those can be amplified?\"</p><ul><li>Writing commit messages → AI amplified</li><li>Searching the codebase for patterns → AI amplified</li><li>Making architectural decisions → Human judgment, AI research</li><li>Writing boilerplate code → AI amplified</li><li>Reviewing code for security issues → AI amplified</li><li>Updating documentation to match product changes → AI amplified</li><li>Deciding what features to build → Human judgment</li><li>Debugging complex issues → Human leads, AI assists</li></ul><p><strong>2. Build micro-agents that do one thing well.</strong></p><p>Each component of your AI \"exoskeleton\" should be focused and reliable. An commit change agent restates problems for clarity, breaks down complex file changes, looks up dependencies, researches existing patterns, and provides a high level summary with oppportunity to dig in further. That's it. But it does that reliably, every time.</p><p><strong>3. Keep the human in the decision loop.</strong></p><p>This is crucial. The exoskeleton model only works if the human remains in control. The Sarcos Guardian XO provides 20:1 strength amplification, but the human still decides what to lift and where to put it. Similarly, your AI tools should amplify decision execution, not make the decisions themselves.</p><p><strong>4. Make the seams visible.</strong></p><p>One of the problems with \"autonomous agents\" is that they obscure the AI's limitations. When something goes wrong, you don't know where in the autonomous workflow it failed. With the micro-agent approach, each component has clear inputs and outputs. When something goes wrong, you know exactly which component failed and can debug accordingly.</p><p>Here's what's interesting: the productivity gains from the exoskeleton approach often exceed what people expect from \"full autonomy.\"</p><p>Consider the running exoskeleton research. A 15% reduction in energy cost doesn't mean the runner runs 15% farther. It means they can run faster for longer, with better form, and recover more quickly. The compounding effects matter more than the headline number.</p><p>Same with the industrial exoskeletons. A 30% reduction in muscle stress doesn't just mean 30% less fatigue. It means fewer injuries, fewer sick days, longer careers, better quality work, and happier workers who aren't in chronic pain.</p><p>In software, there are similar compounding effects. When developers aren't spending mental energy on boilerplate code, commit messages, planning documents, and issue formatting, they have more capacity for the creative work that actually moves products forward. The AI exoskeleton doesn't just save time on specific tasks. It preserves cognitive resources for the tasks that require human judgment.</p><p>We went from struggling to maintain documentation to having it auto-updated weekly. From spending 20 minutes per PR on commit messages and descriptions to having them drafted in seconds. From context-switching between tools to having AI agents that plug directly into our workflow. None of these are \"autonomous AI.\" They're amplification tools that compound.</p><h2>The Future Isn't Autonomous: It's Amplified</h2><p>If you're trying to figure out how to make AI work for your organization, here's my practical advice:</p><p>: \"How do we deploy AI agents that can handle workflows autonomously?\"</p><p>: \"What are the most repetitive, error-prone, or fatigue-inducing parts of our workers' jobs, and how can AI reduce the friction there?\"</p><p>Think like an exoskeleton designer. They don't ask \"how do we build a robot that does the factory worker's job?\" They ask \"where in the body does the worker experience the most strain, and how do we support that specific point of failure?\" The exoskeleton market is expected to reach $2 billion by 2030, growing at nearly 20% annually. But notice what that growth is for: it's not for robots that replace workers. It's for devices that make workers stronger, faster, and more resilient.</p><p>The same will be true for AI. The enduring value won't come from autonomous systems that work independently of humans. It will come from AI tools that are so well-integrated into human workflows that they feel like natural extensions of human capability.</p><p>Want to learn more about how Kasava can be your product development exoskeleton?

      "content": "<blockquote><p>The internet has dramatically diversified reading patterns. In the\nprint era, readers subscribed to a small, fixed set of publications\nconstrained by geography, distribution, and cost. Today, thanks to\nsearch, aggregators, and social sharing, readers routinely consume\njournalism from dozens of sources in the course of a month, including\ninternational and niche publications that were previously inaccessible.\nThis has expanded total news consumption while weakening the economic\nlink between any individual reader and any individual publisher. As a\nresult, large portions of valuable readership generate little or no\ndirect revenue. Micropayments convert that fragmented, currently\nuntapped demand into incremental revenue without undermining the\nsubscription base.</p></blockquote><p>And—like any other payments directly from readers—micropayments would\nbe a multiplier for advertising, not an alternative.</p><blockquote><p>In a marketplace increasingly distorted by bot activity and opaque\nplatform reporting, micropayment histories give publishers a powerful,\nindependent way to demonstrate the authenticity and engagement of their\naudience, strengthening their position with advertisers and supporting\npremium pricing.</p></blockquote><p>Clay Shirky’s old <a href=\"http://shirky.com/essays/fame-vs-fortune-micropayments-and-free-content/\">argument\nagainst micropayments from 2003</a>, based on mental transaction costs,\ndoesn’t work so well any more. We know that micropayments can work\nbecause mobile games are a thing. Shirky was probably right for the\nmicropayments of his day, but mobile game developers have figured out\nhow to get people to spend money on in-app-purchases (IAP), by turning\nit into a two-step process.</p><ul><li><p>exchange real money for in-game coins—which feels like you’re not\nspending, just exchanging one currency for another.</p></li><li><p>exchange in-game coins for an in-game asset—which feels like\nyou’re not spending real money.</p></li></ul><p>So it doesn’t seem like micropayments are necessarily unworkable⁠—⁠and\nwith a powerful industry devoted to pushing misinformation and slop,\nlegit content needs every human attention metric it can get—but the\ntricky part is how to introduce micropayments. Publishers look at their\nsubscriber metrics and realize that a lot of subscribers read few enough\nstories that they would save a lot of money by canceling and using\nmicropayments instead.</p><p>It might be better to introduce publisher coins as a bonus feature\nfor subscribers, then let them leak out to non-subscribers. Instead of\nsaying that you get 5 gift articles per month, say a gift article is 20\ncoins and you get 100 free coins a month. Then open them up to more\nuses. Another good lesson from how mobile games handle IAP coins is that\nthey hand out a few to non-buyers to help develop the habit. As part of\na direct sold ad deal, legit sites could issue a stack of coins to legit\nadvertisers, to hand out to customers, event visitors, and others.</p><p>Measuring marketing is already hard enough without a determined set\nof adversaries in the picture. And with Big Tech under pressure to\nobfuscate and enshittify every data flow, marketers will need to look\nharder for trustworthy information. <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/only-thing-ai-cant-do-advertising-measure-true-roi-rick-bruner-mkrze/\">Rick\nBruner again</a>:</p><blockquote><p>ROI for most advertisers is falling in inverse proportion to Big Tech\nvaluations going up. Advertisers are steadily paying more for less ROI,\nand Google, Meta, and Amazon are laughing all the way to the\nblockchain.</p><p>If there is one thing marketers have even heard about causation —\nwhich, of course, is the ultimate point of advertising, causing\nconsumers to buy your product who wouldn’t have otherwise — it is that\ncorrelation is not causation. But AI, you see, is nothing but\ncorrelation. Very fast and very sophisticated statistical inference. The\nfact remains that to truly know what is having an effect, you need to\nconduct a randomized experiment: subjects assigned at random to a test\nor control group, presented with an intervention where they are either\ntreated or not with the stimulus of interest (the ad), and measured\nagainst the outcome of interest (incremental sales).</p></blockquote><section><p>Unfortunately, legit sites are on a clock here. Right now the Big\nTech companies are <a href=\"https://blog.zgp.org/terminator-ending-for-privacy-sandbox/\">quietly\npushing an in-browser advertising attribution tracking system</a>\nthrough the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). It’s a complicated\nproposal, technically, but it aims to centralize attribution measurement\nat one chokepoint per browser vendor, so we can safely predict what the\nattribution reports are going to look like. <code>beep, boop, the\noptimal place to spend your ad money is . . . whatever Performance Max\n(or other Big Tech ML) says is the right place to spend your ad\nmoney</code>. If any attribution tracking reports start to come out\nlooking favorable to legit sites—and potentially costing Big Tech’s\nmisinfo and slop operations billions—then management will just demand\nchanges to code, policies, and personnel until the numbers come out the\nway they want.</p><p>Anyway, just going back and reading this, Rick Bruner has scored a\ncontent marketing win here. Start people off thinking about\nmicropayments, and that ends up leading to the question of how to figure\nout which sites are for real, in the presence of so many gatekeepers\nwith an interest in pushing the wrong answers? (and <a href=\"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/you-can-do-something-to-hurt-the\">destroying\nthe legit economy and crushing democracy, but that’s another\nstory</a>).</p></section><section><h2>Where micropayments systems can go from here</h2><p>Right now a lot of sites have a lot of, let’s just say malarkey to\nget through before seeing the actual page.</p><p>A micropayment platform that can either eliminate those or act as a\nfront end for them, to consolidate on zero or one roadblock to get\nthrough before reading, would be a user experience (and revenue) win.\nPiling another thing to click onto already long-suffering users is not\nthe way to get people back to the web. <a href=\"https://blog.zgp.org/sharpen-your-pencils-people/\">time to sharpen\nyour pencils, people</a></p></section>",

      "content": "<p>When I was in 9th grade — last year before high-school — my best friend persuaded me to join, together with him, the schools programming club.\nAt first, I hesitated, but later agreed.\nI am immensely thankful to him for this.</p><p>There, step by step, we learned Pascal using Turbo Pascal.\nLittle by little, we grasped the basics of the language: variables, operators, string manipulations, data structures — until eventually, remaking <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life\">Conway’s Game of Life</a>.\nAnd then, summer break came.\nOther than HTML, which is not a programming language, Pascal was the first real programming language I have learned and used.</p><p>But I did not stay with Pascal for very long time.\nAfter the summer break, in high-school, I have chosen the “Software Engineering” branch of studying, and there we learned C.\nJust like Pascal, we started step by step: basic operators, string manipulations, memory allocation, data structures, and the final boss, the .</p><p>I fell in love with C.\nThe precise control over memory; passing variables by reference or pointer; the need to allocate memory for every data structure that you wanted to create.</p><p>After high-school, I have enrolled in a two-year college program that would earn me a Practical Software Engineering Degree.\nDuring the summer break between the first and the seconds years, I had a choice to make: go work in McDonald’s (I had experience working as a waiter during high school summer breaks), or find a job in software engineering.\nAfter 2 seconds of hesitation, I have crafted a CV and started to send it to every position I saw online.\nAnd despite the fact that I really wanted to get a software development position in C or C++, nobody would hire me.\nEventually, I have secured a web-development position in PHP (thank you very much my first employer for giving me a chance).</p><p>And this would be the last time I’d touch C or C++.\nDynamic, high-level languages such as PHP, Python, and Ruby — are more suited to the dynamic nature of web development.\nYou rarely need to squeeze the maximum performance from your hardware, since for every second you gain by optimizing data structures allocations in C, you lose 10x more waiting for network or disk requests to resolve.\nAnd so, collectively, we all agreed that the web is better to be written in dynamic languages.</p><p>But just like your first true-love, C would hunt me.\nI would obsess about micro-optimizations, and would get mad that I can’t control when variables are allocated, and how to pass things by reference or pointer without making a redundant copy.\nAnd then, Rust became a thing.</p><p>Just like every software engineer, I started learning Rust by building my own game engine.\nDo you even call yourself a software engineer if you never tried to build your own game engine?\nAnd I fell in-love with Rust.\nC was aging, and failed to catch up with the moving world of hipster development: modern tooling, linters, formatters, package management.\nRust offered the best of both worlds: low-level control of memory allocation, and variable life-cycle, while having modern development practices: a simple-to-use compiler, built-in linter and formatter, and of course a modern package management tool and repository.</p><p>The community was loving Rust, and the language was growing very fast.\nAnd for the first time you could write a web application using a low-level systems-programming language. \nAfter picking up the basics of the language, and abandoning my game engine, I have decided to build a web application in Rust.\nAnd, in the end of 2023, <a href=\"https://yieldcode.blog/post/building-a-webapp-in-rust/\">I have succeeded</a>.\nI have built, and shipped a fully operational web application that was making me money, in Rust.</p><p>Throughout the years, I learned from my mistakes, and shared my progress <a href=\"https://yieldcode.blog/post/webapp-localization-in-rust/\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://yieldcode.blog/post/serving-astro-with-rust/\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://yieldcode.blog/post/one-year-of-rust-in-production/\">and here</a>.\nEventually, the application became a Frankensteins’ monster were the backend would be pure Rust, while the frontend was a statically generated Astro website.\nUntil, in the end, I have reached a road-block and could no longer maintain or extend the application.</p><p>I took a painful decision to migrate everything to Node.js, and conclude this experiment with Rust.\nIt was hard for me to make this decision.\nI really loved working with Rust, and I wanted to make it work.\nMy work with Rust earned me valuable human connections, and opportunities to present my knowledge at two conferences, and one meetup.\nI am happy that I have took the risk with Rust, but…</p><h2>Farewell Rust, at least for now…</h2><p>I’m not going to go over the positive sides of Rust, since I covered them in other articles such as <a href=\"https://yieldcode.blog/post/building-a-webapp-in-rust/\">Building a web app in Rust</a> and <a href=\"https://yieldcode.blog/post/one-year-of-rust-in-production/\">One year of Rust in production</a>.\nBut I do want to talk about some of the struggles I had, both as a reminder to my future self (you can take C from me, but you can’t take my love to low-level programming), and as a cautionary tale to everyone else.</p><p>Keep in mind that everything I share is based on my perspective: I’m a solo founder, building and running a web application.\nThere is no heavy workload like video processing, nor a need to have low latency — two things at which Rust excels.\nFrom my experience, and my product, the bottleneck is always the database, disk, or network.\nI’m also, somewhat, experienced in Rust, so I’m not the “<em>I tried to build a web app in Rust, but I don’t understand borrow checker, so Rust bad</em>” kind of guy.\nNow, with that out of the way, let’s begin.</p><p>As I mentioned earlier, from pure Rust + server side generated templates with , I have switched to a Rust API server + Astro static website that calls the API.\nThe reason I moved away from rendering HTML in Rust, is the fact that I am too spoiled with type-safe templates.\nWith Astro, I can use the  components that are type-safe.\nSince I use, and advocate for, Typescript, all my templates are type-safe, and there is very little chance to mistype a variable, or miss it.\nIf you have a component like this, it’s very hard to make it compile with the wrong type (unless you do stupid stuff like ):</p><pre tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"tsx\"><code></code></pre><p>With libraries like , , or  — your view is essentially separated from the props, and if you rename a field in the template, you must remember to rename it in the model as well.\nIt’s possible to solve it with tests at the cost of longer CI/CD pipeline, but I will talk about compilation time a bit later.\nFunctions inside templates are basically wild-west of strings.\nAnd you need functions.\nIt’s hard to make rich templates without functions.</p><p>But there are libraries like  or  — I hear you say.\nAnd I agree, there are.\nThese are essentially type-safe HTML templates that use the macro mechanism from Rust.\nBy building, basically, HTML DSL using Rust macro, you can create compile time, type-safe templates.\nBut then again, compilation is expensive, but more on that later.</p><h3>Localization and Internationalization</h3><p>I have been talking about localization <a href=\"https://yieldcode.blog/post/a-different-approach-for-localizing-react-js-app/\">back in 2015</a>.\nNode.js ships with full  support, and a set of  APIs to format numbers, lists, currencies, country names, you name it.\nOn top of that, with libraries like , one can get type-safe auto-complete for translations, something that I was not able to achieve in Rust.\nYes, Rust has support for  translation files developed by Mozilla, and a minimal support for number formatting.\nBut Node.js has everything you need in order to build and ship fully localized and translated web-applications.\nIt’s a know fact that  is lacking in Rust (see: <a href=\"https://www.arewewebyet.org/topics/i18n/\">AWWY: Internationalization</a>), and bindings for  are in progress, but they are nowhere near what Node.js can offer it that regard.</p><h3>The web is dynamic by nature</h3><p>Take it or leave it, but the web is dynamic by nature.\nMost of the work is serializing and deserializing data between different systems, be it a database, Redis, external APIs, or template engines.\nRust has one of the best (de)serialization libraries in my opinion: .\nAnd yet, due to the nature of safety in Rust, I’d find myself writing boilerplate code just to avoid calling .\nI’d get long chain calls of  followed by .\nI defined a dozen of custom error enums, some taking other enums, because you want to be able to handle errors properly, and your functions can’t just return any error.</p><p>Similar thing can be said about writing SQL.\nI was really happy with using , which is a crate for compile-time checked SQL queries.\nBy relying on macros in Rust,  would execute the query against a real database instance in order to make sure that your query is valid, and the mappings are correct.\nHowever, writing dynamic queries with  is a PITA, as you can’t build a dynamic string and make sure it’s checked during compilation, so you have to resort to using non-checked SQL queries.\nAnd honestly, with  in Node.js, I can get a similar result, without the need to have a connection to the DB, while having ergonomic query builder to build dynamic queries, without the overhead of compilation time.</p><p>Okay, I hear you, let’s talk about compilation time.</p><p>Rust achieves its safety at the expense of, somewhat long, compilation time.\nOn modern hardware, the compilation time is not that bad.\nIt’s not good enough to have uninterrupted change-f5-preview cycle, but it’s good enough especially with incremental compilation.</p><p>However, the more crates you have, the more macros you use, the slower the compilation time becomes.\nSo the problem becomes is how to achieve fast compilation during CI/CD.\nDue to the dynamic nature of the web, you often times find yourself in a loop of: there is an error in production → fix it → deploy.\nAnd you want this loop to be as fast as possible, because you have customers who can’t do things with your app.</p><p>I have my own hardware to run CI/CD workers.\nA dedicated VM on an Intel Core i5-7500 with 32GB of RAM.\nThe VM has access to all 4 CPU cores, and would take about 14 minutes from push to  until the docker container was deployed on the server (about 12 of it is the docker stage with compilation).\nThat’s with multistaged docker file, and a cached builder layer; with no cache, it would probably take ~20-25 minutes.\nAnd it does not include running tests or  as part of the CI/CD.\nI simply gave-up trying to set-up proper caching so tests, , and compilation would be able to use the same cache.</p><p>Node.js, on the other hand, takes on average 5 minutes, including linting, and tests.\nAnd since I moved to Node.js, I added another back-office service, so I deploy more code, 3 times faster, while actually relying on running tests and lint as part of the CI/CD pipeline.</p><p>Rust has a very mature ecosystem in most aspects, but it is lacking in the web aspect.\nNeed an obscure third party API?\nIt’s probably not there.\nSo you end up implementing APIs instead of doing core business logic.\nEach API is additional code that you need to test and maintain.</p><p>It’s not hard to implement REST APIs, but the lack of maturity does slow you down.\nI had to implement, and test, third party APIs, queue mechanism on top of PostgreSQL, code to validate webhook signatures.\nIt was fun, but it comes out of the box in other, “standard”, languages.</p><p>And honestly, Node.js is good enough.\nPeople like to criticize Node.js or the  ecosystem, implying that there is something fundamentally wrong with JavaScript.\nAnd sure, JavaScript is far from being a good language.\nThere are many quirks in the language, which you can learn only with experience, pain, and tears.\nAnd I miss stuff from Rust like the  and  types; I miss the  statement; and I miss the  as well.\nBut in all honesty, Node.js ecosystem has matured and is stable to write web applications.\nYou have libraries like  to validate request/response JSONs, libraries like , , and my own <a href=\"https://yieldcode.blog/post/mjmx-jsx-runtime-mjml/\">@mjmx/core</a> to write type-safe SQL, HTML, and MJML.\nAnd  is still better in Node.js than in Rust.\nIt’s always weird to need to bring thirds party  crate because you want to have an  method in a .</p><p>There are still issues with Node.js.\nThe never-ending deprecation of  in favor of ; it’s mostly good, until you encounter a  package, and then it’s hell.\nThe cumbersome  and  setup where you need to juggle between 2 files and dozen of plugins to get basic functionality you get with  out-of-the-box; I wait for the day  will close the gaps, and becomes the standard tool.\nWorkspaces are still not solved, although  is better in this regard, but it’s nowhere near the workspaces in .\nAnd the occasional struggles with typescript where the runtime seems to be changing too often; is it ? ? ? The built-in typescript runtime in ? ? ?</p><p>Oh, and I really wish we all would just agree that  is simply the best, most aesthetically pleasing, and easy to read case for programming.\nI really hate the fact that JavaScript has adopted the .</p><p>Building solo is hard.\nYou wear 10 hats as software engineer, in addition to the dozen hats as an entrepreneur.\nI really wanted Rust to succeed, but I also need to move forward.\nI found myself ignoring bugs in Sentry because it meant going back to long compile times.\nI was postponing feature development because it meant slow iteration speed, and trying to synchronize backend REST API with frontend, or the need to visually re-test every page after a variable rename in a template.\nCall me spoiled, but I don’t have the luxury of development team, and someone checking my code.</p><p>Rust excels at non-visual things, i.e. things you can write and wrap with tests.\nBut when you need to develop UI, it becomes painful.\nYou wait for the code the recompile; worried about passing the wrong variable to a view.</p><p>From pure Rust, I had to go to Rust with a statically generated HTML + Alpine on top of it.\nTo make sure my email templates are safe, I was considering writing a dedicated mailing service in NodeJS, just so I could use  (or my own ), and get  type-safety.\nIt’s as if I was moving backwards, breaking my Rust monolith and rewriting parts in a dynamic language that is better suited for the web.</p><p>No, Node.js is not perfect.\nBut at least I have one stack, and funny enough, I get more type-safety than I had in Rust.\nSure, it’s a fake type-safety, JavaScript is a dynamic language, but I no longer have to jump between my view files and my model and try to keep them in sync.\nI no longer misspell translation keys, resulting in blank words; emails do not come with .</p><p>It seems like most of my issues boil down to dynamic things: templates, i18n, SQL.\nIf I were to write an API service today, I would probably choose Rust again, since API services do not have to deal with views or translations.\nI still don’t know how I would handle SQL though.\nORMs are not my cup of tea, and other than , Rust seems to lack a good type-safe query builder.</p><p>I also miss the small footprint of the application.\nWith Rust, the containers would use between 60 and 80 MB of RAM; but with Node.js, the lowest I have is 117 MB of RAM for the back-office, without any load.\nAnd it’s true what they say: use the right tool for the job.\nRust shines in CPU-heavy tasks, and for sure I will be using it when I will have such tasks.</p><p>But until then, farewell Rust.</p>",

      "content": "<p>In 2019, archaeologists unearthed a strange bone alongside a trove of ancient catapult projectiles in Córdoba, Spain. According to a study published this month in the <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352409X2600012X?via%3Dihub\"><em>Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports</em></a>, the bone may be from one of <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hannibal-Carthaginian-general-247-183-BCE\">Hannibal</a>’s war elephants, which the Carthaginian general used against Romans in the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Second-Punic-War\">Second Punic War</a>.</p><p>The bone “could prove to be a landmark,” lead author <a href=\"https://www.uco.es/organiza/departamentos/mocoam/index.php/personal/item/3227\">Rafael Martínez Sánchez</a>, an archaeologist at the University of Cordoba, tells <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/romans/landmark-elephant-bone-finding-in-spain-may-be-from-time-of-hannibals-war-against-rome\"></a>’s Tom Metcalfe. Until now, “there has been no direct archaeological testimony for the use of these animals.”</p><p>The dig was conducted ahead of construction for a medical facility on the Colina de los Quemados archaeological site. Archaeologists documented evidence of occupation at the site across hundreds of years beginning around the Late Bronze Age. However, their most intriguing&nbsp;discoveries date to the late <a href=\"https://www.history.com/articles/iron-age\">Iron Age</a>.</p><p>Along with stone artillery and coins, researchers unearthed a “short, cube-shaped bone,” measuring nearly four inches long. Eventually, they determined that the bone likely came from the right leg of an African or Asian elephant.</p><p>“It could belong to the period of the Punic Wars,” Martínez Sánchez told <a href=\"https://english.elpais.com/culture/2023-09-19/a-2000-year-old-battle-elephant-bone-was-found-in-spain-experts-are-investigating-whether-the-animal-fought-for-hannibal-or-julius-caesar.html\"></a>’ Vicente G. Olaya in 2023. “It could be the first of Hannibal’s elephants to be discovered. We can’t know for sure, but it was certainly a sizable beast.”</p><p>In the years since, researchers have continued studying the bone. Because it is poorly preserved, DNA and protein analyses have proved inconclusive. The species of elephant also remains <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2026-02-hannibal-famous-war-elephants-bone.html\">unconfirmed</a>. However, after radiocarbon testing, researchers were able to conclude that the elephant died between the fourth and third centuries B.C.E.</p><p>This timeline aligns with the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Second-Punic-War\">Second Punic War</a>, which occurred in the third century B.C.E. This conflict was part of the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/Punic-Wars\">series</a> of wars between Rome and <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/place/Carthage-ancient-city-Tunisia\">Carthage</a>, an ancient city in modern-day Tunisia.</p><p>Study co-author <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Agustin-Lopez-Jimenez-2336959624\">Agustín López Jiménez</a>, an expert at the archaeology company <a href=\"http://www.arqueobetica.es/#:~:text=En%20ARQVEOBETICA%20nos%20esforzamos%20por,en%20la%20elaboraci%C3%B3n%20de%20informes.\">Arqueobética</a>, which excavated the site, told that researchers found the elephant foot bone beneath some collapsed adobe walls dating to around the third century B.C.E. According to the study, the same area revealed 12 three-pound stone balls, which were “unquestionably artillery projectiles for <a href=\"https://www.historyhit.com/city-stormers-the-formidable-siege-engines-of-alexander-the-great/\"></a>,” a kind of catapult.</p><div><div><h4>Quick facts: War elephants in antiquity</h4></div></div><p>The Second Punic War began after Hannibal attacked Saguntum, a city on the Iberian Peninsula that had allied with Rome. When Carthage refused to withdraw, Rome declared war in 218 B.C.E.</p><p>Hannibal led his forces northeast from the Iberian Peninsula, aiming for the <a href=\"https://www.history.com/articles/hannibal-crosses-alps\">Alps</a>. The general planned to enter Italy from the north and attack, forcing the Romans to defend their turf. Hannibal’s army reportedly <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/horse-poo-helps-unravel-mystery-hannibals-route-through-alps-180958660/\">included</a> some 30,000 soldiers, 15,000 horses and 37 war elephants. The mountain march was brutal, and he lost <a href=\"https://dcc.dickinson.edu/nepos-hannibal/second-punic-war\">many of the elephants</a> along the way.</p><p>Despite the historical record, archaeologists had never found skeletal remains of elephants connected to the Punic Wars—until the Córdoba bone. The researchers say that this bone didn’t come from “one of the mythical specimens Hannibal took across the Alps.” However, Martínez Sánchez tells <a href=\"https://www.iflscience.com/2200-year-old-bone-unearthed-in-spain-may-be-first-direct-evidence-of-hannibals-war-elephants-82514\"></a>’s Russell Moul, the discovery “is the first time an elephant bone remnant linked to that chronology has been found in Iberia and, to our knowledge, in Europe.”</p>",

      "content": "<p>A South Korean court has sentenced the former president Yoon Suk Yeol to life imprisonment with labour over his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/03/south-korean-president-declares-emergency-martial-law\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">failed martial law declaration</a> in December 2024, finding him guilty of leading an insurrection and making him the first elected head of state in the country’s democratic era to receive the maximum custodial sentence.</p><p>The Seoul central district court found that Yoon’s declaration of martial law on 3 December 2024 constituted insurrection, carried out with the intent to disrupt the constitutional order.</p><p>Judge Jee Kui-youn said the purpose was “to send troops to the national assembly to blockade the assembly hall and arrest key figures, including the assembly speaker and party leaders, thereby preventing lawmakers from gathering to deliberate or vote”.</p><p>In sentencing Yoon on Thursday, the court pointed to his lack of apology throughout the proceedings, his unjustified refusal to attend hearings, and the massive social costs his actions inflicted on South Korean society.</p><p>The court said the martial law greatly damaged the political neutrality of the military and police and caused South Korea’s political standing and credibility in the international community to decline, leaving society “politically divided and experiencing extreme confrontation”.</p><p>The court opted for life imprisonment over the death penalty, noting that while the crime was grave, Yoon’s planning did not appear meticulous, he had attempted to limit the use of physical force, and most of his plans ultimately failed.</p><p>In a historical digression, the judge traced the history of insurrection law and cited the 1649 execution of England’s Charles I, who led troops into parliament, to establish that even heads of state can commit insurrection by attacking the legislature.</p><p>The verdict was broadcast live on national television, capturing Yoon briefly smiling on arrival and later displaying no visible reaction as the sentence was delivered.</p><p>Under South Korean law, the charge of leading an insurrection carries three possible penalties: death, life imprisonment with labour, or life imprisonment without labour.</p><p>Prosecutors had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/13/south-korean-prosecutors-demand-death-penalty-for-former-president-yoon-suk-yeol\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">sought the death penalty</a>, arguing that Yoon committed “a grave destruction of constitutional order” by mobilising troops to surround parliament and attempting to arrest political opponents during the six-hour crisis.</p><p>The verdict came 14 months after events that marked the most serious threat to South Korea’s democracy in decades.</p><p>The charges stem from events on the night of 3 December 2024, when prosecutors said Yoon attempted to use military force to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/21/south-korea-yoon-suk-yeol-denies-ordering-troops-drag-out-lawmakers\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">paralyse the legislature</a>, arrest political opponents and seize control of the national election commission. Yoon claimed he was rooting out “anti-state forces” and alleged <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/28/yoon-suk-yeol-impeachment-charges-insurrection-supporters\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">election fraud</a> without providing evidence.</p><p>Within hours of the declaration, 190 lawmakers broke through military and police cordons to pass an emergency resolution lifting martial law. Parliament impeached Yoon <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/14/south-korean-parliament-votes-to-impeach-president\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">within 11 days</a>, and the constitutional court <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/04/south-korea-president-yoon-suk-yeol-impeachment-verdict-results-removal\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">removed him from office</a> four months later.</p><p>Outside the courthouse, hundreds of Yoon supporters – waving South Korean and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/03/why-yoon-suk-yeol-supporters-us-flags-south-korea-ntwnfb\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">US flags</a> and chanting “Yoon again” – initially cheered when the judge dismissed some prosecution evidence but turned hostile as the ruling progressed. Some supporters shouted “political judge, step down” and hurled profanities at journalists.</p><p>When the sentence was announced, some collapsed in tears, crying “the country is finished”. About 500 metres away, progressive groups erupted in cheers and embraced one another, though some expressed disappointment the death penalty had not been imposed.</p><p>Yoon faces six additional criminal trials, two of which arise from the martial law crisis, including a treason charge alleging that he ordered drone incursions into North Korean airspace in an attempt to provoke a confrontation that could justify military rule. He has already been sentenced to five years’ imprisonment for obstructing his own arrest.</p><p>Thursday’s verdict follows a series of related rulings that formally established the events of 3 December constituted an insurrection.</p><p>In January, the former prime minister Han Duck-soo <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/21/former-south-korea-pm-han-duck-soo-jailed-martial-law-insurrection\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">was handed a 23-year</a> prison sentence in a ruling that described the martial law attempt as a “self-coup” by elected power that was more dangerous than traditional uprisings. The sentence far exceeded prosecutors’ 15-year demand, indicating judicial willingness to impose severe penalties.</p><p>On 12 February, the former interior minister Lee Sang-min <a href=\"https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20260212001452315\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">was jailed for seven years</a> for his role in the insurrection, including relaying Yoon’s orders to cut power and water to media outlets.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.newsis.com/view/NISX20260214_0003516152\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Legal experts said</a> the rulings created a sentencing environment that made the most severe punishment more likely in Yoon’s case.</p><p>The court also sentenced seven co-defendants: Kim Yong-hyun, the former defence minister, to 30 years; Noh Sang-won, a former intelligence commander, to 18 years; Cho Ji-ho, the former police chief, to 12 years; and Kim Bong-sik, the former Seoul police chief, to 10 years. Mok Hyun-tae, a police commander, received three years. Two defendants, Kim Yong-gun and Yoon Seung-young, were acquitted.</p><p>Yoon’s legal team released a statement calling the verdict “a predetermined conclusion” and a “show trial”, saying they could not bring themselves to respect the judgment.</p><p>They accused the judiciary of “kneeling to incited public opinion and political power” and applying double standards, pointing to President Lee Jae Myung’s suspended trials and opposition politicians acquitted on illegal evidence grounds.</p><p>The legal team vowed to fight “to the end”, saying truth would eventually be revealed “in the court of history”. Yoon is expected to appeal.</p><p>Life imprisonment carries no fixed release date, with parole theoretically possible after 20 years, on demonstration of good conduct and remorse.</p><p>In 1996, the military dictators <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/23/former-south-korean-dictator-chun-doo-hwan-dies-aged-90\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Chun Doo-hwan</a> and Roh Tae-woo received death and 22-and-a-half-year sentences, respectively, for their roles in a 1979 coup and subsequent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/25/gwangju-biennale-south-korea-democracy\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">massacre in Gwangju</a>. The sentences were later reduced on appeal, and both men were eventually pardoned.</p><p>Every South Korean president who has served a prison sentence has ultimately been pardoned.</p>",

They generally don't have a lot of work put into them, and as a result, the author (pilot?) hasn't generally thought too much about the problem space, and so there isn't really much of a discussion to be had.<p>The cool part about pre-AI show HN is you got to talk to someone who had thought about a problem for way longer than you had. It was a real opportunity to learn something new, to get an entirely different perspective.</p><p>I feel like this is what AI has done to the programming discussion. It draws in boring people with boring projects who don’t have anything interesting to say about programming.</p></blockquote><p>This isn’t something that is limited to Show HN or even Hacker News,\nit’s something you see everywhere.</p><p>While part of this phenomenon is likely just an upswing of people who don’t usually do programming that get swept up in the fun of building a product,\nI want to build an argument that it’s much worse than that.</p><p>AI models are extremely bad at original thinking,\nso any thinking that is offloaded to a LLM is as a result usually not very original,\neven if they’re very good at treating your inputs to the discussion as amazing genius level insights.</p><p>This may be a feature if you are exploring a topic you are unfamiliar with,\nbut it’s a fatal flaw if you are writing a blog post or designing a product or trying to do some other form of original work.</p><p>Some will argue that this is why you need a human in the loop to steer the work and do the high level thinking.\nThat premise is fundamentally flawed. Original ideas are the result of the very work you’re offloading on LLMs.\nHaving humans in the loop doesn’t make the AI think more like people, it makes the human thought more like AI output.</p><p>Ideas are then further refined when you try to articulate them.\nThis is why we make students write essays. It’s also why we make professors teach undergraduates.</p><p>Prompting an AI model is not articulating an idea.\nYou get the output,\nbut in terms of ideation the output is discardable.\nIt’s the work that matters.</p><p>You don’t get build muscle using an excavator to lift weights.

Understanding this spectrum is critical for deploying AI safely, yet we know surprisingly little about how people actually use agents in the real world.</p><p>We analyzed millions of human-agent interactions across both Claude Code and our public API using our <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/research/clio\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">privacy-preserving tool</a>, to ask: How much autonomy do people grant agents? How does that change as people gain experience? Which domains are agents operating in? And are the actions taken by agents risky?</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://anthropic.com/research/measuring-agent-autonomy#claude-code-is-working-autonomously-for-longer\"><strong>Claude Code is working autonomously for longer.</strong></a> Among the longest-running sessions, the length of time Claude Code works before stopping has nearly doubled in three months, from under 25 minutes to over 45 minutes. This increase is smooth across model releases, which suggests it isn’t purely a result of increased capabilities, and that existing models are capable of more autonomy than they exercise in practice.</li></ul><ul></ul><ul></ul><ul></ul><p>Below, we present our methodology and findings in more detail, and end with recommendations for model developers, product developers, and policymakers. Our central conclusion is that effective oversight of agents will require new forms of post-deployment monitoring infrastructure  new human-AI interaction paradigms that help both the human and the AI manage autonomy and risk together.</p><p>We view our research as a small but important first step towards empirically understanding how people deploy and use agents. We will continue to iterate on our methods and communicate our findings as agents are adopted more widely.</p><h2>Studying agents in the wild</h2><p>Agents are difficult to study empirically. First, there is no agreed-upon definition of what an agent Second, agents are evolving quickly. Last year, many of the most sophisticated agents—including Claude Code—involved a single conversational thread, but today there are multi-agent systems that operate autonomously for hours. Finally, model providers have limited visibility into the architecture of their customers’ agents. For example, we have no reliable way to associate independent requests to our API into “sessions” of agentic activity. (We discuss this challenge in more detail at the end of this post.)</p><p>In light of these challenges, how can we study agents empirically?</p><p>To start, for this study we adopted a definition of agents that is conceptually grounded and operationalizable: <em>an agent is an AI system equipped with tools that allow it to take actions</em>, like running code, calling external APIs, and sending messages to other agents. Studying the tools that agents use tells us a great deal about what they are doing in the world.</p><p>Next, we developed a collection of metrics that draw on data from both agentic uses of our <a href=\"https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">public API</a> and <a href=\"https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Claude Code</a>, our own coding agent. These offer a tradeoff between breadth and depth:</p><ul><li>Our  gives us broad visibility into agentic deployments across thousands of different customers. Rather than attempting to infer our customers’ agent architectures, we instead perform our analysis at the level of . This simplifying assumption allows us to make grounded, consistent observations about real-world agents, even as the contexts in which those agents are deployed vary significantly. The limitation of this approach is that we must analyze actions in isolation, and cannot reconstruct how individual actions compose into longer sequences of behavior over time.</li></ul><ul><li> offers the opposite tradeoff. Because Claude Code is our own product, we can link requests across sessions and understand entire agent workflows from start to finish. This makes Claude Code especially useful for studying autonomy—for example, how long agents run without human intervention, what triggers interruptions, and how users maintain oversight over Claude as they develop experience. However, because Claude Code is only one product, it does not provide the same diversity of insight into agentic use as API traffic.</li></ul><p>By drawing from both sources using our <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/research/clio\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">privacy-preserving infrastructure</a>, we can answer questions that neither could address alone.</p><h2>Claude Code is working autonomously for longer</h2><p>How long do agents actually run without human involvement? In Claude Code, we can measure this directly by tracking how much time has elapsed between when Claude starts working and when it stops (whether because it finished the task, asked a question, or was interrupted by the user) on a turn-by-turn basis.</p><p>Turn duration is an imperfect proxy for autonomy. For example, more capable models could accomplish the same work faster, and subagents allow more work to happen at once, both of which push towards shorter turns. At the same time, users may be attempting more ambitious tasks over time, which would push towards longer turns. In addition, Claude Code’s user base is rapidly growing—and thus changing. We can’t measure these changes in isolation; what we measure is the net result of this interplay, including how long users let Claude work independently, the difficulty of the tasks they give it, and the efficiency of the product itself (which improves <a href=\"https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">daily</a>).</p><p>Most Claude Code turns are short. The median turn lasts around 45 seconds, and this duration has fluctuated only slightly over the past few months (between 40 and 55 seconds). In fact, nearly every percentile below the 99th has remained relatively stable. That stability is what we’d expect for a product experiencing rapid growth: when new users adopt Claude Code, they are comparatively inexperienced, and—as we show in the next section—less likely to grant Claude full latitude.</p><p>The more revealing signal is in the tail. The longest turns tell us the most about the most ambitious uses of Claude Code, and point to where autonomy is heading. Between October 2025 and January 2026, the 99.9th percentile turn duration nearly doubled, from under 25 minutes to over 45 minutes (Figure 1).</p><p>Notably, this increase is smooth across model releases. If autonomy were purely a function of model capability, we would expect sharp jumps with each new launch. The relative steadiness of this trend instead suggests several potential factors are at work, including power users building trust with the tool over time, applying Claude to increasingly ambitious tasks, and the product itself improving.</p><p>The extreme turn duration has declined somewhat since mid-January. We hypothesize a few reasons why. First, the Claude Code user base <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-raises-30-billion-series-g-funding-380-billion-post-money-valuation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">doubled</a> between January and mid-February, and a larger and more diverse population of sessions could reshape the distribution. Second, as users returned from the holiday break, the projects they brought to Claude Code may have shifted from hobby projects to more tightly circumscribed work tasks. Most likely, it’s a combination of these factors and others we haven’t identified.</p><p>We also looked at Anthropic’s internal Claude Code usage to understand how independence and utility have evolved together. From August to December, Claude Code’s success rate on internal users’ most challenging tasks doubled, at the same time that the average number of human interventions per session decreased from 5.4 to 3.3. Users are granting Claude more autonomy and, at least internally, achieving better outcomes while needing to intervene less often.</p><p>Both measurements point to a significant deployment overhang, where the autonomy models are capable of handling exceeds what they exercise in practice.</p><p>It’s useful to contrast these findings with external capability assessments. One of the most widely cited capability assessments is METR’s “Measuring AI Ability to Complete Long Tasks,” which <a href=\"https://metr.org/blog/2025-03-19-measuring-ai-ability-to-complete-long-tasks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">estimates</a> that Claude Opus 4.5 can complete tasks with a 50% success rate that would take a human nearly 5 . The 99.9th percentile turn duration in Claude Code, in contrast, is ~42 minutes, and the median is much shorter. However, the two metrics are not directly comparable. The METR evaluation captures what a model is capable of in an idealized setting with no human interaction and no real-world consequences. Our measurements capture what happens in practice, where Claude pauses to ask for feedback and users interrupt. And METR’s five-hour figure measures task difficulty—how long the task would take a human—not how long the model actually runs.</p><p>Neither capability evaluations nor our measurements alone give a complete picture of agent autonomy, but together they suggest that the latitude granted to models in practice lags behind what they can handle.</p><h2>Experienced users in Claude Code auto-approve more frequently, but interrupt more often</h2><p>How do humans adapt how they work with agents over time? We found that people grant Claude Code more autonomy as they gain experience using it (Figure 2). Newer users (&lt;50 sessions) employ full auto-approve roughly 20% of the time; by 750 sessions, this increases to over 40% of sessions.</p><p>This shift is gradual, suggesting a steady accumulation of trust. It’s also important to note that Claude Code’s default settings require users to manually approve each action, so part of this transition may reflect users configuring the product to match their preferences for greater independence as they become familiar with Claude’s capabilities.</p><p>Approving actions is only one method of supervising Claude Code. Users can also interrupt Claude while it is working to provide feedback. We find that interrupt rates increase with experience. New users (those with around 10 sessions) interrupt Claude in 5% of turns, while more experienced users interrupt in around 9% of turns (Figure 3).</p><p>Both interruptions  auto-approvals increase with experience. This apparent contradiction reflects a shift in users’ oversight strategy. New users are more likely to approve each action before it’s taken, and therefore rarely need to interrupt Claude mid-execution. Experienced users are more likely to let Claude work autonomously, stepping in when something goes wrong or needs redirection. The higher interrupt rate may also reflect active monitoring by users who have more honed instincts for when their intervention is needed. We expect the per-turn interrupt rate to eventually plateau as users settle into a stable oversight style, and indeed the curve may already be flattening among the most experienced users (though widening confidence intervals at higher session counts make this difficult to confirm).<p>We saw a similar pattern on our public API: 87% of tool calls on minimal-complexity tasks (like editing a line of code) have some form of human involvement, compared to only 67% of tool calls for high-complexity tasks (like </p><a href=\"https://red.anthropic.com/2026/zero-days/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">autonomously finding zero-day exploits</a> or <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-c-compiler\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">writing a compiler</a>). This may seem counterintuitive, but there are two likely explanations. First, step-by-step approval becomes less practical as the number of steps grows, so it is structurally harder to supervise each action on complex tasks. Second, our Claude Code data suggests that experienced users tend to grant the tool more independence, and complex tasks may disproportionately come from experienced users. While we cannot directly measure user tenure on our public API, the overall pattern is consistent with what we observe in Claude Code.</p><p>Taken together, these findings suggest that experienced users aren’t necessarily abnegating oversight. The fact that interrupt rates increase with experience alongside auto-approvals indicates some form of active monitoring. This reinforces a point we have made <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/our-framework-for-developing-safe-and-trustworthy-agents\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">previously</a>: effective oversight doesn’t require approving every action but being in a position to intervene when it matters.</p><h2>Claude Code pauses for clarification more often than humans interrupt it</h2><p>Humans, of course, aren’t the only actors shaping how autonomy unfolds in practice. Claude is an active participant too, stopping to ask for clarification when it’s unsure how to proceed. We found that as task complexity increases, Claude Code asks for clarification more often—and more frequently than humans choose to interrupt it (Figure 4).</p><p>On the most complex tasks, Claude Code asks for clarification more than twice as often as on minimal-complexity tasks, suggesting Claude has some calibration about its own uncertainty. However, it’s important not to overstate this finding: Claude may not be stopping at the right moments, it may ask unnecessary questions, and its behavior might be affected by product features such as <a href=\"https://code.claude.com/docs/en/common-workflows#use-plan-mode-for-safe-code-analysis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Plan Mode</a>. Regardless, as tasks get harder, Claude increasingly limits its own autonomy by stopping to consult the human, rather than requiring the human to step in.</p><p>Table 1 shows common reasons for why Claude Code stops work and why humans interrupt Claude.</p><p>These findings suggest that agent-initiated stops are an important kind of oversight in deployed systems. Training models to recognize and act on their own uncertainty is an important safety property that complements external safeguards like permission systems and human oversight. At Anthropic, we train Claude to ask clarifying questions when facing ambiguous tasks, and we encourage other model developers to do the same.</p><h2>Agents are used in risky domains, but not yet at scale</h2><p>What are people using agents for? How risky are these deployments? How autonomous are these agents? Does risk trade off against autonomy?</p><p>To answer these questions, we use Claude to estimate the relative risk and autonomy present in individual tool calls from our public API on a scale from 1 to 10. Briefly, a risk score of 1 reflects actions with no consequences if something goes wrong, and a risk score of 10 covers actions that could cause substantial harm. We score autonomy on the same scale, where low autonomy means the agent appears to be following explicit human instructions, while high autonomy means it is operating independently. We then group similar actions together into clusters and compute the mean risk and autonomy scores for each cluster.</p><p>Table 2 provides examples of clusters at the extremes of risk and autonomy.</p><p>Given the limited visibility we have into these agents, it is possible that these actions are simulated (for example, we have no way to determine whether the financial trades Claude orders are actually executed, and we believe that many of the “data exfiltrations” are evaluations). And while these higher-risk actions are rare as a share of overall traffic, the consequences of a single error can still be significant.</p><p>We found that 80% of tool calls come from agents that appear to have at least one kind of safeguard (like restricted permissions or human approval requirements), 73% appear to have a human in the loop in some way, and only 0.8% of actions appear to be irreversible (such as sending an email to a customer).</p><p>To visualize the joint distribution of risk and autonomy across all clusters, we plot each by its average scores on both dimensions. Each point in Figure 5 corresponds to a cluster of related actions, positioned by its average risk and autonomy.</p><p>The vast majority of actions on our public API are low-risk. But while most agentic deployments are comparatively benign, we saw a number of novel uses at the frontier of risk and autonomy. The riskiest clusters—again, many of which we expect to be evaluations—tended to involve sensitive security-related actions, financial transactions, and medical information. While risk is concentrated at the low end of the scale, autonomy varies more widely. On the low end (autonomy score of 3-4), we see agents completing small, well-scoped tasks for humans, like making restaurant reservations or minor tweaks to code. On the high end (autonomy score above 6), we see agents submitting machine learning models to data science competitions or triaging customer service requests.</p><p>We also anticipate that agents operating at the extremes of risk and autonomy will become increasingly common. Today, agents are concentrated in a single industry: software engineering accounts for nearly 50% of tool calls on our public API (Figure 6). Beyond coding, we see a number of smaller applications across business intelligence, customer service, sales, finance, and e-commerce, but none comprise more than a few percentage points of traffic. As agents expand into these domains, many of which carry higher stakes than fixing a bug, we expect the frontier of risk and autonomy to expand.</p><p>These patterns suggest we are in the early days of agent adoption. Software engineers were the first to build and use agentic tools at scale, and Figure 6 suggests that other industries are beginning to experiment with agents as well. Our methodology allows us to monitor how these patterns evolve over time. Notably, we can monitor whether or not usage tends to move towards more autonomous and more risky tasks.</p><p>While our headline numbers are reassuring—most agent actions are low-risk and reversible, and humans are usually in the loop—these averages can obscure deployments at the frontier. The concentration of adoption in software engineering, combined with growing experimentation in new domains, suggests that the frontier of risk and autonomy will expand. We discuss what this means for model developers, product developers, and policymakers in our recommendations at the end of this post.</p><p>This research is just a start. We provide only a partial view into agentic activity, and we want to be upfront about what our data can and cannot tell us:</p><ul><li>We can only analyze traffic from a single model provider: Anthropic. Agents built on other models may show different adoption patterns, risk profiles, and interaction dynamics.</li><li>Our two data sources offer complementary but incomplete views. Public API traffic gives us breadth across thousands of deployments, but we can only analyze individual tool calls in isolation, rather than full agent sessions. Claude Code gives us complete sessions, but only for a single product that is overwhelmingly used for software engineering. Many of our strongest findings are grounded in data from Claude Code, and may not generalize to other domains or products.</li><li>Our classifications are generated by Claude. We provide an opt-out category (e.g., “not inferable,” “other”) for each dimension and validate against internal data where possible (see our <a href=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/files/4zrzovbb/website/55e4d2de6eb39b3a9259c3f74843f86b1a12e265.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Appendix </a>for more details), but we cannot manually inspect the underlying data due to privacy constraints. Some safeguards or oversight mechanisms may also exist outside the context we can observe.</li><li>This analysis reflects a specific window of time (late 2025 through early 2026). The landscape of agents is changing quickly, and patterns may shift as capabilities grow and adoption evolves. We plan to extend this analysis over time.</li><li>Our public API sample is drawn at the level of individual tool calls, which means deployments involving many sequential tool calls (like software engineering workflows with repeated file edits) are overrepresented relative to deployments that accomplish their goals in fewer actions. This sampling approach reflects the volume of agent activity but not necessarily the distribution of agent deployments or uses.</li><li>We study the tools Claude uses on our public API and the context surrounding those actions, but we have limited visibility into the broader systems our customers build atop our public API. An agent that appears to operate autonomously at the API level may have human review downstream that we cannot observe. In particular, our risk, autonomy, and human involvement classifications reflect what Claude can infer from the context of individual tool calls, and do not distinguish between actions taken in production and actions taken as part of evaluations or red-teaming exercises. Several of the highest-risk clusters appear to be security evaluations, which highlights the limits of our visibility into the broader context surrounding each action.</li></ul><p>We are in the early days of agent adoption, but autonomy is increasing and higher-stakes deployments are emerging, especially as products like <a href=\"https://support.claude.com/en/articles/13345190-getting-started-with-cowork\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cowork</a> make agents more accessible. Below, we offer recommendations for model developers, product developers, and policymakers. Given that we have only just begun measuring agent behavior in the wild, we avoid making strong prescriptions and instead highlight areas for future work.</p><p><strong>Model and product developers should invest in post-deployment monitoring. </strong>Post-deployment monitoring is essential for understanding how agents are actually used. Pre-deployment evaluations test what agents are capable of in controlled settings, but many of our findings cannot be observed through pre-deployment testing alone. Beyond understanding a model’s capabilities, we must also understand how people interact with agents in practice. The data we report here exists because we  to build the infrastructure to collect it. But there’s more to do. We have no reliable way to link independent requests to our public API into coherent agent sessions, which limits what we can learn about agent behavior beyond first-party products like Claude Code. Developing these methods in a privacy-preserving way is an important area for cross-industry research and collaboration.</p><p><strong>Model developers should consider training models to recognize their own uncertainty. </strong>Training models to recognize their own uncertainty and surface issues to humans proactively is an important safety property that complements external safeguards like human approval flows and access restrictions. We train Claude to do this (and our analysis shows that Claude Code asks questions more often than humans interrupt it), and we encourage other model developers to do the same.</p><p><strong>Product developers should design for user oversight. </strong>Effective oversight of agents requires more than putting a human in the approval chain. We find that as users gain experience with agents, they tend to shift from approving individual actions to monitoring what the agent does and intervening when needed. In Claude Code, for example, experienced users auto-approve more but also interrupt more. We see a related pattern on our public API, where human involvement appears to decrease as the complexity of the goal increases. Product developers should invest in tools that give users trustworthy visibility into what agents are doing, along with simple intervention mechanisms that allow them to redirect the agent when something goes wrong. This is something we continue to invest in for Claude Code (for example, through <a href=\"https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/535\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">real-time steering</a> and <a href=\"https://code.claude.com/docs/en/monitoring-usage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">OpenTelemetry</a>), and we encourage other product developers to do the same.</p><p><strong>It's too early to mandate specific interaction patterns.</strong> One area where we do feel confident offering guidance is what  to mandate. Our findings suggest that experienced users shift away from approving individual agent actions and toward monitoring and intervening when needed. Oversight requirements that prescribe specific interaction patterns, such as requiring humans to approve every action, will create friction without necessarily producing safety benefits. As agents and the science of agent measurement mature, the focus should be on whether humans are in a position to effectively monitor and intervene, rather than on requiring particular forms of involvement.</p><p>A central lesson from this research is that the autonomy agents exercise in practice is co-constructed by the model, the user, and the product. Claude limits its own independence by pausing to ask questions when it’s uncertain. Users develop trust as they work with the model, and shift their oversight strategy accordingly. What we observe in any deployment emerges from all three of these forces, which is why it cannot be fully characterized by pre-deployment evaluations alone. Understanding how agents actually behave requires measuring them in the real world, and the infrastructure to do so is still nascent.</p><p>Miles McCain, Thomas Millar, Saffron Huang, Jake Eaton, Kunal Handa, Michael Stern, Alex Tamkin, Matt Kearney, Esin Durmus, Judy Shen, Jerry Hong, Brian Calvert, Jun Shern Chan, Francesco Mosconi, David Saunders, Tyler Neylon, Gabriel Nicholas, Sarah Pollack, Jack Clark, Deep Ganguli. </p><p>If you’d like to cite this post, you can use the following Bibtex key:</p><p>We provide more details in the <a href=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/files/4zrzovbb/website/55e4d2de6eb39b3a9259c3f74843f86b1a12e265.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PDF Appendix</a> to this post.</p><p>1.

At Anthropic, we’ve also studied how professionals incorporate AI into their work both <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/research/how-ai-is-transforming-work-at-anthropic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">internally</a> and <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/research/anthropic-interviewer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">externally</a>. Our work complements these efforts by analyzing deployment patterns using first-party data across both our API and Claude Code, giving us visibility into autonomy, safeguards, and risk that is difficult to observe externally.</p><p>2. Because we characterize agents as AI systems that use tools, we can analyze individual tool calls as the building blocks of agent behavior. To understand what agents are doing in the world, we study the tools they use and the context of those actions (such as the system prompt and conversation history at the time of the action).<p>3. These results reflect Claude’s performance on programming-related tasks, and do not necessarily translate to performance in other domains.</p><p>4. Throughout this post, we use \"autonomy\" somewhat informally to refer to the degree to which an agent operates independently of human direction and oversight. An agent with minimal autonomy executes exactly what a human explicitly requests; an agent with high autonomy makes its own decisions about what to do and how to do it, with little or no human involvement. Autonomy is not a fixed property of a model or system but an emergent characteristic of a deployment, shaped by the model's behavior, the user's oversight strategy, and the product's design. We do not attempt a precise formal definition; for details on how we operationalize and measure autonomy in practice, see the </p><a href=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/files/4zrzovbb/website/55e4d2de6eb39b3a9259c3f74843f86b1a12e265.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Appendix</a>.</p><p>5. Moreover, the same model deployed differently can generate output at different speeds. For example, we recently released <a href=\"https://code.claude.com/docs/en/fast-mode\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fast Mode</a> for Opus 4.6, which generates output 2.5x faster than regular Opus.<p>6. For turn duration across other percentiles, see the </p><a href=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/files/4zrzovbb/website/55e4d2de6eb39b3a9259c3f74843f86b1a12e265.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Appendix</a>.<p>7. Specifically, we use Claude to classify each internal Claude Code session into four categories of complexity, and to determine whether the task was successful. Here, we report the success rate for the most difficult category of task.</p><p>8. METR’s five-hour figure is a measure of task difficulty (how long the task would take a human), whereas our measurements reflect actual elapsed time, which is affected by factors like model speed and the user’s computing environment. We do not attempt to reason across these metrics, and we include this comparison to explain to readers who may be familiar with the METR finding why the numbers we report here are substantially lower.</p><p>9. These patterns come from interactive Claude Code sessions, which overwhelmingly reflect software engineering. Software is unusually amenable to supervisory oversight because the outputs can be tested, easily compared, and reviewed before they are released. In domains where verifying an agent’s output requires the same expertise as producing it, this shift may be slower or take a different form. The rising interrupt rate may also reflect experienced users completing more challenging tasks, which would naturally require more human input. Finally, Claude Code’s default settings push new users towards approval-based oversight (since actions are not auto-approved by default), so some of the shifts we observe may reflect Claude Code’s product design.</p></p><p>10. Both complexity and human involvement are estimated by having Claude analyze each tool call in its full context (including the system prompt and conversation history). The complete classification prompt is available in the <a href=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/files/4zrzovbb/website/55e4d2de6eb39b3a9259c3f74843f86b1a12e265.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Appendix</a>. Defining human involvement is particularly difficult, as many transcripts include content from a human even when that human is not actively steering the conversation (for example, a user message being moderated or analyzed). In our manual validation, Claude was nearly always correct when it classified a tool call as having no human involved, but it sometimes identified human involvement where there was none. As a result, these estimates should be interpreted as an upper bound on human involvement.</p><p>11. In a sense, stopping to ask the user a question is itself a form of agency. We use “limits its own autonomy” to mean that Claude chooses to seek guidance from the human when it could have continued operating independently.<p>12. These clusters were generated by having Claude analyze each interruption or pause, along with the surrounding session context, then grouping related reasons together. We manually combined some closely related clusters and edited their names for clarity. The clusters shown are not exhaustive.</p><p>13. We treat these scores as comparative indicators rather than precise measurements. Rather than defining rigid criteria for each level, we rely on Claude’s general judgment about the context surrounding each tool call, which allows the classification to capture considerations we may not have anticipated. The tradeoff is that the scores are more meaningful for comparing actions against each other than for interpreting any single score in absolute terms. For the full prompts, see the </p><a href=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/files/4zrzovbb/website/55e4d2de6eb39b3a9259c3f74843f86b1a12e265.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Appendix</a>.</p><p>14. For more information about how we validated these figures and our precise definitions, see the <a href=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/files/4zrzovbb/website/55e4d2de6eb39b3a9259c3f74843f86b1a12e265.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Appendix.</a> In particular, we found that Claude often overestimated human involvement, so we expect 80% to be an upper bound on the number of tool calls with direct human oversight.</p><p>15. Our systems also automatically exclude clusters that do not meet our aggregation minimums, which means that tasks that only a small number of customers are performing with Claude will not surface in this analysis.</p><p>16. Whether the adoption curve in software engineering will repeat in other domains is an open question. Software is comparatively easy to test and review—you can run code and see if it works—which makes it easier to trust an agent and catch its mistakes. In domains like law, medicine, or finance, verifying an agent’s output may require significant effort, which could slow the development of trust.</p>",

In this case, the final NMI handler, rather than the last IRQ handler, \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsets the IRQ pointers / vectors for the top-of-the-screen IRQ. This way, if (for example), IRQ handler #3 out of 7 IRQ handlers stalls, the contagion only spread to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe bottom of the screen before normal service is resumed at the top during the next frame. Otherwise, the stall effects would not recover until the next time IRQ \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thandler #3 fires.</li><li>NMIs, being timer interrupts, can be set up to trigger at pretty much any cycle along a scanline, making them more efficient in terms of managing raster time than \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIRSTs are; typically with a raster IRQ, you will have to carefully place NOPs or otherwise juggle code before changing a register (e.g. changing background colour)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand that's after you have lost time In stabilising the IRST, whereas with NMIs, you have better control over where on the desired scanline they fire.</li></ul><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf the foregoing sounds horrendous and esoteric, I can only apologise for making it thus through poor explanation skills, but really, it boils down to giving the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdeveloper a more coder-friendly way of slicing the screen up into horizontal layers that collectively form a useful game environment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNMIs are timer interrupts, meaning that unlike IRQs, they can't be triggered by $D012 on the VIC-II chip, but instead are controlled by either of the two \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttimers on CIA chip #2 (likewise, timer IRQs can be set up using either of the 2 timers on CIA #1).\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe timers hold the number of cycles between each NMI instance in the form of a lo-byte, hi-byte 16-bit number stored in $DD04 + $DD05 (for timer A) \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tor $DD06 + $DD07 (for timer B).\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThose cycle counts are referred to, unhelpfully, in the Commodore 64 Programmer's Reference Guide as \"frequencies\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCritical to setting up NMIs is a consistent start cycle on the same scanline each time the game is initiated.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLike IRQs, NMIs can stall too, but the effect is different; whereas an IRST stall consists of a fleeting collapse in the IRQ schema, an NMI stall event \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlooks more like a regrouping of all NMIs in the chain down-screen from their proper position and is caused either by (a) unanticipated cycle steal caused\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tby the presence of sprites, which take priority over NMIs every bit as much as they do over IRQs, and (b) an NMI handler not completing its tasks before \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe next NMI is scheduled to fire.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYou really have to use a spreadsheet to calculate the timer 16-bit number for each NMI instance, which is the only very awkward aspect of using them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><a href=\"https://kodiak64.co.uk/blog/setting-up-nmis-on-the-c64\" target=\"_blank\">in-depth guide to setting up NMIs</a>.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><h3>#2: Real-Time Torpedoes thanks to \"Splites\"</h3><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe torpedoes are, fundamentally, sprites... but not in the usual sense.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis is because they are rendered in real time on a multiplexed blank \"canvas\" consisting of a column of 8 sprites, each split into 3 horizontal slices that \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI call \"splites\" (from \"split sprite\").\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEach splite is 7px deep (because 3 x 7 = 21 = the height of a standard sprite).\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></p><img src=\"https://kodiak64.co.uk/assets/Splites_FIG_1.png\" width=\"498\" height=\"221\" alt=\"SPLITE Figure 1\" aria-label=\"SPLITE Figure 1\" title=\"SPLITE Figure 1\"><p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThanks to an interrupt firing every 7 lines during the full vertical range of the torpedoes, each splite is assigned its own unique x-position \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(including, obviously, unique MSB value).\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></p><img src=\"https://kodiak64.co.uk/assets/Splites_FIG_2.png\" width=\"450\" height=\"250\" alt=\"SPLITE Figure 2\" aria-label=\"SPLITE Figure 2\" title=\"SPLITE Figure 2\"><p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNext, we are free to render (in real-time) 7px high (or smaller) torpedo shapes on the blank sprite gfx data of the splites, but we have to ensure that \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthere is a minimum of 7px (i.e. 7 scanlines) of vertical space between each torpedo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis is to prevent ugly artefacts when the rendered torpedo moves from one splite to another.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWe also have to ensure that when a torpedo is crossing between splites, both affected splites share the same x-position, to keep smooth continuity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></p><img src=\"https://kodiak64.co.uk/assets/Splites_FIG_3.png\" width=\"533\" height=\"384\" alt=\"SPLITE Figure 3\" aria-label=\"SPLITE Figure 3\" title=\"SPLITE Figure 3\"><p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe diagram below shows how 8 sprites are vertically stacked to produced 24 splites.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></p><img src=\"https://kodiak64.co.uk/assets/Splites_FIG_4.png\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\" alt=\"SPLITE Figure 4\" aria-label=\"SPLITE Figure 4\" title=\"SPLITE Figure 4\"><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFinally, here is a short video of me trying to explain the entire splite concept:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAfter the splite torpedo is moved up by 1px, instead of wiping the last line of the torpedo's gfx data, we leave it alone so that a vertical trace is formed \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ton the canvas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThen we have a routine that scans all the canvas data for trailing traces and gradually makes them thinner until they vanish, so that we have a wake effect \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfollowing each torpedo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAt the same time, we flicker the torpedoes in front of and behind the char data for the water blending in the foreground, to make the wakes looks more \"frothy\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></p><h3>#3: Real-Time Implosion Animations</h3><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen a player submarine dies, instead of a clichéd explosion I thought it might be interesting to have it disintegrate under pressure.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTo do that, the player sub is switched to hi-res mode and then we simply use some nice bit-shifting instructions to destroy the sub's displayed gfx data in real-time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></p><img src=\"https://kodiak64.co.uk/assets/Vanish_Sub_FIG.png\" width=\"670\" height=\"704\" alt=\"Submarine implosion routine\" aria-label=\"Submarine implosion routine\" title=\"Submarine implosion routine\"><h3>#4: Real-Time Ocean Waves Effect</h3><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe same bit-shifting used for the real-time implosion (or rather, bit-rotating in this case) is used to make the distant waves on the sea animate.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis principle also applies, but in a vertical pattern, for the foreground rippling of the water, an effect that I modelled on the \"get ready\" screens of \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecco_the_Dolphin\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ecco the Dolphin</a>.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWith the foreground ripples, there is also a horizontal component performed by using $D016 to rock left and right at varying rates.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIt's all very simple stuff, but I think it works well in the game!\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></p><h3>#5: Real-Time Water Distortion Effects</h3><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe very first special effect developed for Seawolves was a real-time water distortion effect for submerged or partially submerged objects in the foreground.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis was done simply through short vertical bands in which the y-expand of the affected sprites was activated, and enhanced by wobbling said bands up and down.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFor a time during development this was taken further and full y-expand sprite stretching was used (i.e. more than 2x vertical expand), but the gains were minimal \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand too resource-hungry to be justified for the final game.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></p><img src=\"https://kodiak64.co.uk/assets/Seawolves-MINISUB-distort-1.png\"

sprites vertically in the play area, at some point around mid-screen you may have run into the problem of a \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bumbershootsoft.wordpress.com/2014/12/06/flickering-scanlines-the-vic-ii-and-bad-lines/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">bad line</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tleaving you with insufficient CPU cycles to render your sprites on time (I won't attempt to explain the problem further as you either know from experience\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhat I am referring to or not).\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTo circumvent the issue, Seawolves performs one line of \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><a href=\"https://nurpax.github.io/posts/2018-06-19-bintris-on-c64-part-5.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">FLD</a>, \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat is, it stalls the bad line at the affected sprite y-position so that the scheduled bad line \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthen occurs on the next\tscanline, leaving us time to render our sprites (in this case, the \"splite\" columns).\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHowever, this has the undesired side effect of shunting the characters on the screen below that point downwards, so on the very next scanline we have to compensate \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith a one line vertical shift back upwards again using Y-Scroll on $D011.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEven if we had enough RAM to have unique sprite definitions for all the animation frames of the enemy ships and the player subs, I still would not have done it that way.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRather, it is far more RAM-efficient to stream-in the gfx data for the turning radars on the spy ship (for example), or the spray on the hydrofoil, \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tor the helicopter rotor blades, etc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis means that we only need predefined gfx for the parts of the sprite definition that get changed, not the whole sprite.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen the player subs change direction, they too are swiftly redrawn \"in the blink of an eye\" to their mirrored counterpart (except, if you look carefully,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthey are not literally mirrored, as that would make the lighting inconsistent and we can't have that!)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p></p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAgain and again in the code for Seawolves, there are cases where a subroutine is only executed if multiple \"logic gates\" permit it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYou can do this the slow and ugly way by LDA CONDITION_n for n conditions with a branch instruction on the next line, or you can use the logical operators to save CPU time and RAM by stacking them as LDA CONDITION_0 then ORA CONDITION_1 to n, for n conditions with one shared branch instruction at the end.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNot understanding what I mean?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCheck out my blog article on the subject, </p><a href=\"https://kodiak64.co.uk/microblog/ORA_Special_Uses\" target=\"_blank\">ORA: A Special Use in Branch Testing</a>.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOften in

      "content": "<p>What choices lay before you when your Elixir app needs functionality that only exists, or is more\nmature, in Python? There are machine learning models, PDF rendering libraries, and audio/video\nediting tools without an Elixir equivalent (yet). You could piece together some HTTP calls, or\nbring in a message queue...but there's a simpler path through Oban.</p><p>Whether you're enabling disparate teams to collaborate, gradually migrating from one language to\nanother, or leveraging packages that are lacking in one ecosystem, having a mechanism to\ntransparently exchange  between Elixir  Python opens up new possibilities.</p><p>On that tip, let's build a small example to demonstrate how trivial bridging can be. We'll call it\n\"Badge Forge\".</p><p>\"Badge Forge,\" like \"<a href=\"https://oban.pro/articles/weaving-stories-with-cascading-workflows\">Fire Saga</a>\" before it, is a pair of nouns that  describes what\nour demo app does. But, it's balanced and why hold back on the whimsy?</p><p>More concretely, we're building a micro app that prints conference badges. The actual PDF\ngeneration happens through <a href=\"https://weasyprint.org/\">WeasyPrint</a>, a Python library that turns HTML and CSS into\nprint-ready documents. It's mature and easy to use. For the purpose of this demo, we'll pretend\nthat running <a href=\"https://hexdocs.pm/chromic_pdf/ChromicPDF.html\">ChromaticPDF</a> is unpalatable and <a href=\"https://typst.app/\">Typst</a> isn't available.</p><p>There's no web framework involved, just command-line output and job processing. Don't fret, we'll\nbring in some visualization later.</p><h2>Sharing a Common Database</h2><p>Some say you're cra-zay for sharing a database between applications. We say you're already\nwilling to share a message queue, and now the database is your task broker, so why not? It's\nhappening.</p><p>Oban for Python was designed for interop with Elixir from the beginning. Both libraries read\nand write to the same  table, with job args stored as JSON, so they're fully\nlanguage-agnostic. When an Elixir app enqueues a job destined for a Python worker (or vice versa),\nit simply writes a row. The receiving side picks it up based on the queue name, processes it, and\nupdates the status. That's the whole mechanism:</p><p>Each side maintains its own cluster leadership, so an Elixir node and a Python process won't\ncompete for leader responsibilities. They coordinate through the jobs table, but <a href=\"https://www.elvispresleytcb.com/\">take care of\nbusiness</a> independently.</p><p>Both sides can also exchange PubSub notifications through Postgres for real-time coordination.\nThe importance of that tidbit will become clear soon enough.</p><p>This is more of a demonstration than a tutorial. We don't expect you to build along, but we hope\nyou'll see how little code it takes to form a bridge.</p><p>With a wee config in place and both apps pointing at the same database, we can start generating\nbadges.</p><p>Generation starts on the Elixir side. This function enqueues a batch of (fake) jobs destined for\nthe Python worker:</p><pre><code translate=\"no\" tabindex=\"0\"></code></pre><p>Notice the worker name is a string, \"badge_forge.generator.GenerateBadge\", matching the Python\nworker's fully qualified name. The job lands in the  queue, where a Python worker is\nlistening.</p><p>The Python worker receives badge requests and generates PDFs using WeasyPrint:</p><pre><code translate=\"no\" tabindex=\"0\"></code></pre><p>When a job arrives, it pulls the attendee info from the args, renders an HTML template, and writes\nthe PDF to disk. After completion, it enqueues a confirmation job back to Elixir.</p><p>The Elixir side listens for confirmations and prints the result:</p><pre><code translate=\"no\" tabindex=\"0\"></code></pre><p>With that, there's two-way communication through the jobs table.</p><p>To print conference badges you need a conference. You  have a conference. We're printing\nbadges for the  \"Oban Conf\" being held this year in Edinburgh. It will be both\n<a href=\"https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/lifestyle/scottish-tap-water-considered-best-35229754\">hydrating</a> and engaging. Kicking off a batch of ten jobs from Elixir:</p><pre><code translate=\"no\" tabindex=\"0\"></code></pre><p>On the Python side, we see automatic logging for each job with output like this (output has been\nprettified):</p><pre><code translate=\"no\" tabindex=\"0\"></code></pre><p>The job completed successfully, and back in the Elixir app, we see that the print completed:</p><pre><code translate=\"no\" tabindex=\"0\"></code></pre><p>The output looks  like this:</p><p>Apologies to any \"Alasdair Frasers\" out there, your name was pulled from the nether and there\nisn't a real conference. As consolation, if you contact us, you have stickers coming.</p><p>Seeing jobs in terminal logs is fine, but watching them flow through a dashboard is far more\nsatisfying. We recently shipped a <a href=\"https://hexdocs.pm/oban_web/standalone.html\">standalone Oban Web</a> Docker image for situations like\nthis; where you want monitoring without mounting it in your app. It's also useful when your\nprimary app is actually Python...</p><p>With docker running, point the  at your Oban-ified database and pull the image:</p><pre><code translate=\"no\" tabindex=\"0\"></code></pre><p>That starts Oban Web running in the background to monitor jobs from all connected Oban instances.\nQueue activity and metrics are exchanged via PubSub, so the Web instance can store them for\nvisualization. Trigger a few (hundred) jobs, navigate to the dashboard on , and\n<a href=\"https://y.yarn.co/154d07d9-30c8-47d2-af63-f4cc69b0bca8_text.gif\">look at 'em roll</a>:</p><p>Badge Forge is whimsical, some say \"useless\", but the pattern is practical! When you need tools\nthat are stronger in one ecosystem, you can bridge it. . A Python app can\nreach for Elixir's strengths just as easily.</p><p>Check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/oban-bg/badge_forge\">full demo</a> code for the boilerplate and config we rested over here.</p>",

      "content": "<p data-jscall-id=\"34\">We're excited to announce <a href=\"https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl/pull/5532\" data-jscall-id=\"35\">RayMakie</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/JuliaGraphics/Hikari.jl\" data-jscall-id=\"36\">Hikari</a>, a physically-based GPU ray tracing pipeline integrated directly into <a href=\"https://docs.makie.org\" data-jscall-id=\"37\">Makie</a>. Any Makie scene can now be rendered with photorealistic path tracing: just swap out the backend and get global illumination, volumetric media, spectral rendering, and physically-based materials, all running on the GPU.</p><p data-jscall-id=\"40\"> RayMakie, Hikari, and Raycore are not fully released yet — we plan to publish official releases in the coming weeks. In the meantime, the  in <a href=\"https://github.com/SimonDanisch/RayDemo\" data-jscall-id=\"43\">RayDemo</a> will be kept up to date so you can already try things out.</p><h2 data-jscall-id=\"44\">Why Ray Tracing in Julia?</h2><p data-jscall-id=\"45\">Research groups across many fields (climate science, structural biology, fluid dynamics, particle physics) produce complex 3D data that needs to be communicated clearly and compellingly. Photorealistic rendering can transform dense simulation output into images that reveal structure and tell a story. But getting research data into a traditional ray tracer usually means exporting meshes, learning new tools, and losing the interactive workflow.</p><p data-jscall-id=\"46\">By building ray tracing directly into Makie, we eliminate that gap. The same scene you explore interactively with GLMakie can be rendered photorealistically with RayMakie, no export step, no new API to learn.</p><p data-jscall-id=\"47\">Writing the implementation in Julia gives us:</p><ul data-jscall-id=\"48\"><li data-jscall-id=\"49\"><p data-jscall-id=\"50\">: Julia compiles to efficient GPU code, competitive with C++ ray tracers</p></li><li data-jscall-id=\"56\"><p data-jscall-id=\"57\">: The familiar Makie API for scene construction, camera control, and lighting, with ray tracing as a drop-in rendering option</p></li><li data-jscall-id=\"59\"><p data-jscall-id=\"60\">: Custom materials, media, and integrators run directly on the GPU through Julia's multiple dispatch, opening up novel visualization and simulation use cases</p></li><li data-jscall-id=\"62\"><p data-jscall-id=\"63\">: A state-of-the-art spectral path tracer in a high-level language makes ray tracing research and experimentation accessible to a much wider audience</p></li></ul><p data-jscall-id=\"66\">Hikari is a Julia port of <a href=\"https://pbrt.org/\" data-jscall-id=\"67\">pbrt-v4</a>, the reference implementation from <em data-jscall-id=\"68\">Physically Based Rendering</em> (Pharr, Jakob, Humphreys). It implements a wavefront volumetric path tracer with spectral rendering, supporting participating media (NanoVDB, grid-based volumes), physically-based materials (metals, dielectrics, coated surfaces), and environment/sun-sky lighting. The ray intersection engine lives in <a href=\"https://github.com/JuliaGeometry/Raycore.jl\" data-jscall-id=\"69\">Raycore.jl</a>, a standalone package factored out of Hikari and based on AMD's <a href=\"https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/RadeonRays_SDK\" data-jscall-id=\"70\">Radeon Rays SDK</a> and <a href=\"https://gpuopen.com/hiprt/\" data-jscall-id=\"71\">HIPRT</a>.</p><p data-jscall-id=\"72\">RayMakie connects Hikari to Makie's scene graph. You build a scene with standard Makie calls (, , , ), set materials and lights, then render:</p><pre data-jscall-id=\"77\"><code data-jscall-id=\"78\">\nusing RayMakie, Hikari\n\nscene = Scene(size=(1920, 1080), lights=[SunSkyLight(Vec3f(1, 2, 8))])\ncam3d!(scene)\nmesh!(scene, my_mesh; material=Hikari.Gold(roughness=0.1))\n\nimg = colorbuffer(scene;\n    device=AMDGPU.ROCBackend(),  # or CUDABackend(), CPU()\n    integrator=Hikari.VolPath(samples=100, max_depth=12),\n    sensor=Hikari.FilmSensor(iso=100, white_balance=6500),\n)</code></pre><h3 data-jscall-id=\"80\">Breeze: Volumetric Cloud Rendering</h3><p data-jscall-id=\"81\"><a href=\"https://github.com/NumericalEarth/Breeze.jl/\" data-jscall-id=\"82\">Breeze.jl</a> generates cloud fields from Large Eddy Simulations powered by <a href=\"https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl\" data-jscall-id=\"83\">Oceananigans.jl</a>, a GPU-accelerated ocean and atmosphere simulator developed at MIT's Climate Modeling Alliance (CliMA). The demo renders BOMEX cumulus clouds as photorealistic volumetric media, using NanoVDB sparse grids for efficient storage and Hikari's volumetric path tracing for physically-accurate light scattering through the cloud medium.</p><p data-jscall-id=\"86\">The terrain demo combines real elevation data from ArcGIS (via <a href=\"https://github.com/MakieOrg/Tyler.jl\" data-jscall-id=\"87\">Tyler.jl</a>) with BOMEX cloud volumes, inspired by <a href=\"https://www.rayshader.com/\" data-jscall-id=\"88\">rayshader</a>.</p><blockquote data-jscall-id=\"91\"><p data-jscall-id=\"92\">Makie-Oceananigans integration has been a major initiative over the past year. The ray tracing work with Breeze is truly groundbreaking in my opinion. It may be crucial for science, for inspecting the structure of clouds and thunderstorms. It also has the potential to lead to commercial products.</p><p data-jscall-id=\"93\">, Research Scientist at MIT and CliMA (Climate Modeling Alliance), lead developer of Oceananigans.jl and Breeze.jl</p></blockquote><h3 data-jscall-id=\"95\">PlantGeom: Digital Twins for Agriculture</h3><p data-jscall-id=\"96\"><a href=\"https://github.com/VEZY/PlantGeom.jl\" data-jscall-id=\"97\">PlantGeom.jl</a> renders biophysically accurate 3D plant models for agricultural research. The ray-traced oil palm uses coated diffuse transmission materials to simulate the waxy leaf cuticle and subsurface light transport through leaf tissue.</p><blockquote data-jscall-id=\"100\"><p data-jscall-id=\"101\">Makie has become a central part of my daily scientific workflow. The fact that a single plotting ecosystem can cover the entire spectrum from high-performance 3D scenes to publication-ready figures is just exceptional. Several of the packages I develop would simply not exist in their current form without Makie. My research focuses on developing plant-scale digital twins to study complex agricultural systems (agroforestry, species mixtures, agrivoltaics) with the goal of understanding crop responses to climate and contributing to food security and climate-change adaptation. The recent work on ray tracing is especially exciting: beyond rendering, I am planning to use RayCore.jl for scientific applications such as computing radiation interception in plant canopies, which enables organ-scale energy balance calculations (latent and sensible heat fluxes) and photosynthesis modeling. Understanding how plant shadows affect heat transfer is crucial for adapting agriculture to extreme heat events. Makie has been a genuine force multiplier for my research.</p><p data-jscall-id=\"102\">, CIRAD, developer of PlantGeom.jl</p></blockquote><h3 data-jscall-id=\"104\">ProtPlot: Protein Structure Visualization</h3><p data-jscall-id=\"105\"><a href=\"https://github.com/MurrellGroup/ProtPlot.jl\" data-jscall-id=\"106\">ProtPlot.jl</a> renders protein ribbon diagrams with physically-based materials. Different materials reveal different aspects of the structure: glass refractions show the interior ribbon path, while a coated diffuse surface with shallow depth of field draws attention to specific regions of the fold. Specular highlights, ambient occlusion, and defocus blur make spatial relationships immediately clear in a way that flat shading cannot.</p><p data-jscall-id=\"116\">ProtPlot also powers animated visualizations of protein folding trajectories, the transport process that generative models learn to perform. Ray tracing makes the spatial relationships in these animations immediately legible. The code to produce this is almost entirely standard Makie and ProtPlot, only the imports and a few rendering parameters change:</p><pre data-jscall-id=\"117\"><code data-jscall-id=\"118\">\nusing RayMakie, ProtPlot, Hikari, AMDGPU\n\ndevice = AMDGPU.ROCBackend()\n\ntracks = readdir(\"Trajectories/samp_00015\", join=true)\nset_theme!(lights=[\n    Makie.SunSkyLight(Vec3f(0.4, -0.3, 0.7);\n        intensity=1.0f0, turbidity=3.0f0, ground_enabled=false),\n])\nProtPlot.animate_molecule_dir(\"trajectory.mp4\", tracks)</code></pre><p data-jscall-id=\"119\">The  function is pure ProtPlot code, building Makie figures with , , and  as usual. Then when using the RayMakie backend, Makie will use it to render the video without requiring any additional changes.</p><blockquote data-jscall-id=\"127\"><p data-jscall-id=\"128\">My lab is working on new kinds of generative models, primarily for protein structures. These work by specifying a process that transports randomly sampled noise to a biophysically plausible protein structure, and training a deep neural network to learn how to do this. But the details of this transport process are critical and, while you can to some extent mathematically reason about it, there is no substitute to being able to actually see it in action, both when you're designing it and when investigating how well the model has actually learned it. We work with visualization tools, like ProtPlot.jl, primarily developed by Anton Oresten in my lab, which rely entirely on Makie for this. These visualizations are not just for our internal use, but can be valuable for communicating how the methods work. Developments like raytracing will allow us to configure these to show exactly the details we seek to communicate without them getting buried in the complexity.</p><p data-jscall-id=\"129\">, Karolinska Institutet</p></blockquote><h3 data-jscall-id=\"131\">TrixiParticles: Fluid Simulation</h3><p data-jscall-id=\"132\"><a href=\"https://github.com/trixi-framework/TrixiParticles.jl\" data-jscall-id=\"133\">TrixiParticles.jl</a> simulates fluid dynamics with smoothed particle hydrodynamics. The water splash demo renders SPH surface meshes with a dielectric material (IOR 1.33) simulating water. Fresnel reflections and refractions create the characteristic look of water without any post-processing. The animation shows a gold ball dropping into water, with each frame independently path-traced:</p><blockquote data-jscall-id=\"137\"><p data-jscall-id=\"138\">Native raytracing in Makie would let us move some of our workflows entirely into Julia, from simulation to publication-ready figures, without relying on external tools.</p><p data-jscall-id=\"139\"><strong data-jscall-id=\"140\">Dr. Michael Schlottke-Lakemper</strong>, University of Stuttgart, lead developer of TrixiParticles.jl</p></blockquote><h3 data-jscall-id=\"141\">Volumetric Rendering: Clouds, Smoke, and Exhaust Plumes</h3><p data-jscall-id=\"142\">Participating media are first-class citizens in Hikari's path tracer. Light scatters through volumes realistically, no billboard tricks or screen-space approximations. Hikari supports two volume representations:  sparse grids for large-scale data (like the cloud simulations above), and  for dense grids with per-voxel color, emission, and scattering properties. Both integrate directly with Makie's  plot or can be attached to any mesh as a .</p><p data-jscall-id=\"147\">The  from the <a href=\"https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v4-scenes\" data-jscall-id=\"149\">pbrt-v4 test scenes</a>, rendered with NanoVDB and Henyey-Greenstein phase function scattering:</p><p data-jscall-id=\"152\">A  from <a href=\"https://github.com/WaterLily-jl/WaterLily.jl\" data-jscall-id=\"154\">WaterLily.jl</a> LES simulation, visualized as volumetric smoke.

Emissive texture maps create area lights that both glow and illuminate the scene. The Christmas tree decorations below are lit entirely by their own emissive maps; the quadcopter model was provided by <a href=\"https://juliahub.com\" data-jscall-id=\"167\">JuliaHub</a>:</p><h3 data-jscall-id=\"170\">Geant4: Particle Detector Visualization</h3><p data-jscall-id=\"171\"><a href=\"https://github.com/JuliaHEP/Geant4.jl\" data-jscall-id=\"172\">Geant4.jl</a> provides Julia bindings to the CERN Geant4 particle physics simulation toolkit. The CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid) detector at CERN is one of the largest and most complex scientific instruments ever built. RayMakie can load the full detector geometry from GDML files, apply a quadrant cut to reveal internal structure, and render the result with physically-based metal materials (gold, copper, silver, aluminum, iron).</p><p data-jscall-id=\"182\">The detector meshes are generated from Geant4's tessellated polyhedra with crease-angle vertex splitting for smooth normals on curved barrel surfaces while preserving hard edges at structural boundaries.</p><h3 data-jscall-id=\"183\">Black Hole: Custom GPU Materials</h3><p data-jscall-id=\"184\">One of the most powerful aspects of building a ray tracer in Julia is that users can define entirely new physics by subtyping . The black hole demo demonstrates this: a custom  struct implements gravitational lensing by overriding  to bend light rays according to the Schwarzschild metric. The accretion disk is an emissive volumetric density field with temperature-dependent coloring, hotter near the event horizon, cooler at the outer edge.</p><p data-jscall-id=\"188\">Because Julia's multiple dispatch compiles these custom methods directly into the GPU kernels alongside the built-in materials, there is no performance penalty for user-defined physics. The same wavefront path tracer handles standard glass and metals alongside relativistic spacetime curvature.</p><p data-jscall-id=\"191\">The black hole can also be explored interactively. RayMakie's interactive mode progressively refines the path-traced image while you move the camera in real time:</p><p data-jscall-id=\"195\">An overlay renderer composites rasterized elements (lines, text, wireframes) on top of the ray-traced image, so Makie's standard 2D overlays like legends, colorbars, and annotations work alongside path tracing. The interactive window can also target individual subscenes and axes, so you can place a ray-traced view next to other plots in a GLMakie figure.

      "content": "\nFollowing my recent rants about computer  generated effects (<a href=\"http://singlemindedmovieblog.blogspot.com/2010/04/why-cgi-sucks-and-old-school-effects.html\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://singlemindedmovieblog.blogspot.com/2010/04/best-of-worst-cgi-moments.html\">here</a>), I thought it would be fun to look  into one of the old school visual effect techniques that computers have  now rendered obsolete.<p>\nToday's subject is... The Cloud Tank.</p>\nA cloud tank is basically a big water tank.<p>\nIt's primarily used to create a wide variety of  atmospheric effects, mainly clouds, hence the name. Back in the old days  this was a great way of creating organic shapes, which would otherwise  have to be done with hand-drawn animation or perhaps smoke.</p>\nA cloud tank shot starts with a big  glass tank. The tank used on <i>Close Encounters of the Third Kind  (1977)</i> was 7 by 7 feet large, with a depth of 4 feet. First the tank  is filled salt water. A thin layer of plastic is gently placed on top  of this. Then the rest of the tank is filled with fresh water. Once the  plastic is removed, and the water has been left to set for a while, you  end up with something that looks like a single body of water, but  because of the difference in density between salt water and fresh water  there's actually two distinct layers in the tank now.\nNext, paint would be gently injected into the tank,  near the point where the two layers meet. Depending on the light  conditions, camera speed, and a few other elements, it will look like  billowing clouds when the paint disperses in the water<p>\nFrom what I  gather, there are slight variations in the way the technique is used  from project to project, but what I've described here is the basic  starting point. These cloud elements would then be combined with  live-action footage, or model photography, to produce a really cool,  very organic looking shot.</p><p>\nThe problem with using this technique,  however, is that you're never really sure what you're going to get, and  it's impossible to control precisely what happens. Basically you just  have to keep shooting, and hope to catch something cool on film.</p>\nAccording to Douglas Trumbull on <i>The Making  of Close Encounters of the Third Kind</i> Scott Squires was responsible  for thinking up the specific setup used on that film. The same tank and  a similar setup was also used on <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), </i>and  other subsequent projects at ILM. However, Ken Ralston speculates in   that a similar technique was used all the way back in <i>The Ten  Commandments (1956)</i>.\nLet's  look at some classic examples of the cloud tank effect. We'll begin  with <i>Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977)</i>.<p>\nThroughout  the film the arrival of alien ships is often signified by the  appearance of massive cloud formations. When the aliens kidnap young  Barry from his mother it starts like this:</p>\nLater in the film, when the aliens arrive at  Devil's Tower, a clear night sky is suddenly covered with clouds that  seem to come from nowhere. Very spooky.\nAdditional animation and lighting effects could be  added in post-production, or live during the production of the cloud  elements.<p>\nThe cloud tank was dusted off again for use on </p><i>Raiders  of the Lost Ark (1981)</i>, which also called for some angry cloud  images. First there's the sequence, where Indy and his men dig through  to the Well of Souls.\nHand-drawn  lightning effects were added in post-production to enhance the dramatic  shots.<p>\nCloud tank elements also played a part during the last  moments of the climactic sequence, where The Ark is opened and all hell  breaks loose. In one shot the clouds part to make room for a giant  pillar of fire.</p>\nThe cloud  element for this iconic image was actually created by Gary Platek, by  jumping on the hose that was used to drain the water tank! This sent a  burst of water back through the system, and up through the drain in the  bottom of the tank, which in turn parted the \"clouds\" as the shock-wave  moved up through the water layers.<p>\nA far less aggressive, but no  less effective use of the cloud tank came with </p>.  Here the technique is initially used simply to create the dark clouds  forming on the horizon.\nLater,  though, when a tornado descends upon the quiet neighbourhood, the cloud  tank was once again employed as an \"angry weather\"-tool.\nA slightly more fantastic use  for the tank came with the second Star Trek film. The climax of <i>Star  Trek: The Wrath of Khan (1982)</i> called for a submarine-like showdown  between two spaceships in something called a \"nebula\".\nOn this film a white latex rubber  solution was injected into the tank. Lights with colored gels  illuminated the tank, which produced the otherworldly results that ended  up on the screen.<p>\nTo give a different look to </p>, and the many different worlds the film explores, a similar  use of the cloud tank was employed to produce some very psychedelic  images.\nFor most  cloud tank shots the camera would be placed outside the tank, looking up  at the bottom of the paint layer, but in <i>Poltergeist II: The Other  Side (1986)</i> the camera shot from inside the tank, to create the  titular dimension.\nSeveral  passes were combined, and heavily manipulated in post-production to  create the complex shots.<i>Independence Day  (1996),</i> found use for the cloud tank again. This was during the  dramatic arrival of the alien ships. Here the cloud elements were also  heavily manipulated, this time with the help of computers, to achieve  the final look.\nThe film was billed as  a big budget tent pole film, but it actually used a fair amount of old  school effects, such as in-camera shots, even though computers were an  established tool.\nThe use of the cloud tank  in visual effects seems to have ended somewhere in the late 90s, with  the advances of computer generated effects, and due to the fact that it  was such an unwieldy technique. In theory, you could basically set up a  cloud tank shot in your own garage, but the reality is a bit different.  For example, according to Gary Platek, they used 9 tons of salt during  the 6 months it took to produce the cloud tank shots for !<p>\nAt  the end of the day it's what ends up on the screen that counts, and not  how it was achieved, but I can't help but be impressed by some of these  old techniques, such as the cloud tank. The amount of effort and  ingenuity it took to produce these shots is mind-boggling.</p><p>\nSo  next time you see a movie from the 80s, with some cool, or strange  clouds, spare a thought for the guys who spent months in a darkened room  with a tank of water, a mountain of salt and some paint.</p><p>\nThey  made the heavens move, you know.</p><div><b>Articles used for reference include:</b><i>Raider of the Lost  Ark: The Wrath of God . . . and Other Illusions, by Don Shay</i><i>-  Cinefex No. 6, October 1981</i><i>Poltergeist: Stilling the Restless  Animus, by Paul Mandell</i><i>- Cinefex No. 10, October 1982</i><i>Poltergeist  II: To Hell and Back, by Nora Lee and Janine Pourroy</i><i>- Cinefex No.  26, May 1986</i><i>Independence Day: Fireworks, by Tim Prokop</i><i>-  Cinefex No. 67, September 1996</i><i>Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan, by  Kay Anderson</i><i>- Cinefantastique, Vol. 12 No. 5 &amp; 6</i><b>Special  Features from the following DVDs were used for reference:</b><i>Close  Encounters of the Third Kind, 30th Anniversary Ultimate Edition</i><i>Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan, Director's Edition</i><a href=\"http://www.cinefex.com/\">Cinefex.com</a><a href=\"http://effectscorner.blogspot.com/\">Scott Squires' site</a></div>",

Now that I've shipped a stable v1, this post is me reflecting on this two-year sidequest that had me learning Zig, C, C++, and Objective-C.</p><p>My intro to programming was Visual Basic 6 in the early 2000s, building desktop apps. Then Adobe AIR changed my life—I built a few startups and shipped desktop apps to thousands of people. That was the golden age for me. Fast forward 20+ years of zero-to-one work at startups, building and scaling key systems as early eng at unicorns shipping to 10s of millions, and starting my own startup lab; somehow desktop development had gotten worse. I was building co(lab), a hybrid web browser + code editor + PTY terminal, and I just ran into one papercut too many.</p><p>The first version was built in Electron. The DX was rough—figuring out code signing, notarization, distribution, and updates felt like fighting the framework instead of building my app. I wanted to ship like the web, continuously, but every piece of the toolchain made that harder than it needed to be.</p><p>I tried Tauri but Rust is not for everyone. Bun was up and coming, still months away from 1.0. So I got to work.</p><p>When Electrobun started, it only built macOS apps. Today it has first-class support for building on and distributing to <strong>macOS, Windows, and Ubuntu</strong>. Installers, auto-update artifacts, differential patches—all generated automatically. Bring your own static host (R2, S3, GitHub Releases) and you're done. The differential updates are powered by <a href=\"https://blackboard.sh/blog/introducing-zig-bsdiff\">zig-bsdiff</a>, which I ported from C to Zig and optimized with SIMD and zstd.</p><p>As Bun's FFI stabilized, I replaced most of the Zig FFI layer I'd written and leaned on Bun directly. The architecture inverted in a good way—Bun uses shared memory when spinning up workers, so Electrobun stays efficient even with multiple processes.</p><p>Electrobun today is a complete framework: cross-platform window controls, menus, accelerators, global shortcuts, clipboard, dialogs, webview partitions, session storage, find-in-page, and solid tooling around bundling and updates.</p><p>The OOPIF story is real now. Electron's  tag was deprecated from Chromium and they still haven't fixed it. <a href=\"https://blackboard.sh/blog/building-a-better-oopif\">Building a Better OOPIF</a> goes deep on how  evolved into a true \"super iframe\"—DOM positioning, process isolation, layering that actually works, and no cursor flicker nightmares. It works across platforms without patching browser engines.</p><p>co(lab) is fully rewritten on Electrobun and I'm doubling down on it now that v1 is real. The framework is stable enough to build ambitious, long-lived products without worrying about platform churn. That was always the goal.</p><p>The community is growing. People in our Discord are building insanely cool apps. If you've tested betas, filed issues, or sent feedback—thank you. <a href=\"https://github.com/blackboardsh/electrobun\" target=\"_blank\">Electrobun</a> is the first major thing I'm shipping from <a href=\"https://blackboard.sh/\">Blackboard</a>, and you helped shape it.</p>",

We employ a <strong>Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)</strong> backbone to decouple global model capacity from per-token computation. While the total knowledge base spans , the system only activates  during inference. To further reduce , we strategically utilize dense layers for the first few layers of the network for high intelligence density.</p><p>To navigate the quadratic bottleneck of long-context processing, we leverage a hybrid attention layout that interleaves <strong>Sliding-Window Attention (SWA)</strong> with  at a 3:1 ratio. We specifically opted for SWA over linear alternatives to maintain the architectural flexibility required for . SWA is inherently compatible with <strong>Multi-Token Prediction (MTP)</strong> heads. These heads predict additional future tokens in parallel with the primary output, enabling . This allows the model to validate multiple token hypotheses in a single pass, effectively breaking the serial constraints of standard autoregressive decoding.</p><p>To ensure this lightweight hybrid structure retains peak performance, we implemented two critical enhancements. We utilized an <strong>augmented query-head count</strong> in the SWA layers—increasing from 64 to 96—to strengthen representational power without expanding the \\(KV\\) cache footprint. This modification is highly efficient: since the attention window is fixed, the computational cost of these additional heads remains constant regardless of total sequence length. This allows us to scale up model expressiveness without the \"long-context penalty\" where attention costs usually explode as the conversation grows. Complementing this is our , which functions as an input-dependent attention sink. By dynamically modulating information flow, this mechanism preserves numerical stability while incurring negligible overhead.</p><p>These strategic architectural refinements demonstrate that frontier-level reasoning can be decoupled from prohibitive latency. By integrating  with <strong>concurrent token verification</strong>, the model achieves a decoding throughput up to <strong>350 tokens per second (TPS)</strong> on NVIDIA Hopper GPUs while running SWE-bench Verified.</p><p>, the <strong>optimized total parameter scale</strong> of Step 3.5 Flash facilitates highly accessible, local inference. By consolidating its total capacity to a scale compatible with high-end personal hardware, the model supports high-fidelity private deployment on workstations such as the , , or , providing a 100% trusted execution environment.</p><div><img src=\"https://static.stepfun.com/blog/step-3.5-flash/assets/step3.5.svg\" alt=\"Architecture\"><p>The overall architecture of Step 3.5 Flash.</p></div><p>As the local deployment of large language models (LLMs) becomes increasingly prevalent, we have successfully adapted the Step 3.5 Flash to NVIDIA DGX Spark 128GB device based on the edge-side inference engine llama.cpp, and simultaneously released the INT4 quantized model weights in GGUF format. On NVIDIA DGX Spark, the Step 3.5 Flash achieves a generation speed of 20 tokens per second; by integrating the INT8 quantization technology for KVCache, it supports an extended context window of up to 256K tokens, thus delivering long text processing capabilities on par with cloud-based inference. The new model can be tested by developers on NVIDIA accelerated infrastructure via <a href=\"https://build.nvidia.com\" target=\"_blank\">build.nvidia.com</a>.</p></div><div><h3 data-content=\"method.subsection_3_2_title\">Scalable RL Unleashes the Reasoning Potential</h3><p>We introduce a scalable reinforcement learning framework designed to reliably train reasoning and agentic language models at scale.</p><p>Modern RL pipelines for LLMs rely on high-throughput inference engines to generate rollouts, while optimization happens asynchronously in a separate training system. At scale, this setup introduces two compounding challenges:</p><ol><li>Training–inference mismatch, caused by numerical and architectural differences between systems</li><li>Off-policy drift, as policies evolve while rollouts lag behind</li></ol><p>For long reasoning sequences, even minor token-level discrepancies can explode into extreme importance weights—leading to unstable updates, early convergence, or complete training collapse.</p><p>To address this, we propose <strong>Metropolis Independence Sampling Filtered Policy Optimization (MIS-PO)</strong>, which replaces fragile importance weighting with . Instead of scaling gradients with continuous importance-sampling ratios as in PPO, MIS-PO uses these ratios solely as a <strong>binary acceptance criterion</strong>. Trajectories whose likelihood deviates too far between the inference and training policies are simply excluded from optimization, while accepted samples are treated as effectively on-policy. Concretely, the policy update is driven by</p><p>where the binary indicator \\(\\mathbb{I}(\\tau)\\) filters out off-distribution samples. This design dramatically reduces gradient variance and enables stable, long-horizon optimization without aggressive clipping.</p><p>Our framework also includes <strong>truncation-aware value bootstrapping</strong>, which prevents long reasoning trajectories from being incorrectly penalized when hitting context limits, and <strong>routing confidence monitoring</strong> for Mixture-of-Experts models, providing a practical signal for RL stability at scale.</p><p>Together, these components turn reinforcement learning into a <strong>reliable engine for continuous self-improvement</strong>, enabling consistent gains across mathematics, coding, and tool use, while remaining stable under large-scale, off-policy training.</p></div><div><img src=\"https://static.stepfun.com/blog/step-3.5-flash/assets/tb_plots_grad_norm_eb.svg\" alt=\"RL Algorithm Ablation\"><p>Training dynamics of different RL algorithms.

That 64:1 gap is not a technology limitation. For fifteen years, the FP64:FP32 ratio has been slowly getting wider on consumer GPUs, widening the divide between consumer and enterprise silicon. Now the AI boom is quietly dismantling that logic.</p><h2>The Evolution of FP64 on Nvidia GPUs</h2><p>The FP64:FP32 ratio on Nvidia consumer GPUs has degraded consistently since the Fermi architecture debuted in 2010. On Fermi, the GF100 die shipped to both GeForce and Tesla lines; the hardware supported 1:2 FP64:FP32, but GeForce cards were driver-capped to 1:8.</p><p>Over time, Nvidia moved away from “artificially” lowering FP64 performance on consumer GPUs. Instead, the architectural split became structural; the hardware itself is fundamentally different across product tiers. While datacenter GPUs have consistently kept a 1:2 or 1:3 FP64:FP32 performance (until the recent AI boom, more on that later), the performance ratio on consumer GPUs has consistently gotten worse. From 1:8 on the Fermi architecture in 2010 to 1:24 on Kepler in 2012 to 1:32 in 2014 to our final 1:64 ratio on Ampere in 2020.</p><p>This effectively also means that over 15 years, from the GTX 480 in 2010 to the RTX 5090 in 2025 the FP64 performance on consumer GPUs only increased 9.65x from 0.17 TFLOPS to 1.64 TFLOPS, while in the same time range the FP32 performance improved a whopping 77.63x from 1.35 TFLOP to 104.8 TFLOP.</p><h2>Nvidia's Move to Segment the Market</h2><p>So why has FP64 performance on consumer GPUs progressively gotten weaker (in relation to FP32) while it stayed consistently strong on enterprise hardware?</p><p>If this were purely a technical or cost constraint, you would expect the gap to be smaller. But since historically, Nvidia has taken deliberate steps to limit double-precision (FP64) throughput on GeForce cards, it makes it hard to argue this is accidental. The much simpler explanation is market segmentation.</p><p>Most consumer workloads, such as gaming, 3d rendering, or video editing do not need FP64. High-performance computing on the other hand has long relied on double precision (FP64). Fields such as computational fluid dynamics, climate modeling, quantitative finance, and computational chemistry depend on numerical stability and precision that single precision (FP32) cannot always provide. So FP64 becomes a very convenient lever: weaken it on consumer GPUs, preserve it on enterprise versions, and you get a clean dividing line between markets. Nvidia has been fairly open about this. In the consumer Ampere GA102 whitepaper, they note \"The small number of FP64 hardware units are included to ensure any programs with FP64 code operate correctly.\".</p><p>And the segmentation worked. Over time, the price gap between consumer GPUs and datacenter GPUs widened from roughly 5x around 2010 to over 20x by 2022. Enterprise cards commanded massive premiums, justified in part by their strong FP64 performance (among other features like ECC memory, NVLink, support contracts, and so on). From a business standpoint, the elegance is obvious: closely related silicon sold into two markets at vastly different margins, with FP64 throughput serving as a clear dividing line.</p><p>Modern AI training largely does not depend on FP64 though. FP32 works fine, and on the contrary lower precisions (FP16, BF16, FP8, even FP4) are often preferred. Suddenly, consumer GPUs looked surprisingly capable for serious compute workloads. Researchers, startups, and hobbyists could train meaningful models without the purchase of an expensive Tesla or A100. In response, Nvidia updated its GeForce End User License Agreement (EULA) in 2017 to prohibit use of consumer GPUs in datacenters, in a divisive move. In what was (to my knowledge) an unprecedented shift, implicit technical segmentation was replaced by explicit contractual restrictions.</p><h2>How FP64 Emulation and AI Is Changing the Game</h2><p>What if you have an old RTX 4090 lying around at home and, for some reason, you need the precision of FP64 but the built-in FP64 capabilities are not sufficient? Aside from the obvious answer of purchasing enterprise GPU power, FP64 emulation using FP32 floats can be an answer. This concept dates back to 1971, when T. J. Dekker described double-float arithmetic.</p><p>The simple idea is to split a 64-bit floating point number into two 32-bit floating point numbers: . The  term carries the most significant bits, while  captures the rounding error. Andrew Thall proposed a bunch of common algorithms for emulated FP64s (summation, multiplication, etc.) back in 2007 when GPUs did not have FP64 capabilities. You lose 5 bits of precision as your effective mantissa is only 48 bits (twice the FP32 effective mantissa) and not the FP64 53 bits of precision. If a modest reduction in numerical precision is acceptable, you may be able to achieve substantially higher throughput by using emulated double-precision computation. This can be advantageous given the steep FP64-to-FP32 performance disparity, even after accounting for the overhead introduced by emulation.</p><p>A newer scheme that preserves full 64-bit precision but only works for matrix multiplication is the Ozaki scheme. This scheme exploits the speedup of tensor cores (specialized hardware for matrix multiply-accumulate (MMA) operations) and the distributive property of matrix multiplication. The Ozaki scheme splits FP64 numbers into, for example, FP8 numbers:</p><p>where A contains the most significant bits and A contains the next slice of bits and so on. We then calculate:</p><p>for each A and B. All the results are summed back up in 64-bit precision:</p><p>The Ozaki scheme is gaining increasing traction thanks to the abundance of extremely fast FP8 and FP4 tensor cores being deployed for AI workloads. NVIDIA added support for the Ozaki scheme in cuBLAS in October 2025 and plans to continue developing it.</p><p>From a GPU manufacturer's perspective, this direction is logical. The majority of enterprise GPU revenue now comes from AI applications; market segmentation based on FP64 performance makes no more sense. Enhancing FP64 emulation through low-precision tensor cores allows a reduction in the relative allocation of dedicated FP64 units in enterprise GPUs while expanding FP8 and FP4 compute resources that directly benefit AI workloads.</p><p>The latest generation of NVIDIA enterprise GPUs, the B300 based on the Blackwell Ultra architecture, represents a decisive shift toward low precision. FP64 performance has been significantly reduced in favor of more NVFP4 tensor cores, with the FP64:FP32 ratio dropping from 1:2 to 1:64. In absolute terms, peak FP64 performance declines from 37 TFLOPS on the B200 to 1.2 TFLOPS on the B300. Paradoxically, instead of consumer hardware catching up to enterprise-class capabilities, enterprise hardware is now embracing constraints traditionally associated with consumer GPUs.</p><p>Does this signal a gradual replacement of physical FP64 units through emulation? Not necessarily. According to NVIDIA, the company is not abandoning 64-bit computing and plans future improvements to FP64 capabilities. Nonetheless, FP64 emulation is here to stay, exploiting the abundance of low-precision tensor cores to supplement hardware FP64 for HPC workloads.</p><p>But the segmentation logic hasn't disappeared; it may simply be migrating. The RTX 5090 delivers a 1:1 FP16:FP32 ratio, while the B200 sits at 16:1. For fifteen years, FP64 was the dividing line between consumer and enterprise silicon. The next divide may already be taking shape in low-precision floating point.</p>",

      "content": "<p>&nbsp;Europe faces a critical choice in the race for artificial intelligence (AI). As the technology promises to reshape economies worldwide, policymakers are caught between two competing narratives. Optimists envision AI as the catalyst for a new productivity boom, potentially adding several percentage points to annual growth (Baily et al. 2023). Sceptics warn that adoption barriers, skill gaps, and uneven diffusion may limit gains and exacerbate inequality (Acemoglu 2024, Filippucci et al. 2024, Gambacorta and Shreeti, 2025). For Europe, the stakes are particularly high: while the continent boasts world-leading AI researchers and industrial capacity, it lags behind the US and China in developing new AI technologies (Cornelli et al. 2023). Recent studies suggest that AI could widen cross-country income gaps, with benefits concentrating in advanced economies that are better prepared to adopt and integrate these technologies (Cazzaniga et al. 2024, Gambacorta et al. 2025, Hennig and Khan 2025).</p><p>Yet robust firm-level evidence on AI’s actual effects in Europe remains scarce. Do European firms that adopt AI genuinely become more productive? Does AI destroy jobs or augment workers? Are the benefits shared broadly, or do they concentrate among larger, better-resourced companies? In a recent study (Aldasoro et al. 2026), we provide the first causal evidence on how AI adoption affects productivity and employment across more than 12,000 European firms.</p><p>Europe’s position in the global AI landscape is paradoxical. On various innovation metrics, the continent falls behind. The EU trails the US not only in the absolute number of AI-related patents but also in AI specialisation – the share of AI patents relative to total patents. This innovation gap translates into differences in firms’ readiness to adopt AI, as measured by the IMF’s AI preparedness index, which assesses countries based on digital infrastructure, human capital, innovation capacity, and regulatory frameworks (Cazzaniga et al. 2024).</p><p>However, when it comes to actual deployment, the picture is more nuanced. Drawing on the European Investment Bank Investment Survey (EIBIS), we find that on average, AI adoption levels are similar in the EU and the US. Notably, important heterogeneity emerges beneath the surface. Financially developed EU countries – such as Sweden and the Netherlands – match US adoption rates, with around 36% of firms using big data analytics and AI in 2024. In contrast, firms in less financially developed EU economies, such as Romania and Bulgaria, lag substantially behind, with adoption rates around 28% in 2024. Figure 1 illustrates this divide, showing how the gap has persisted and even widened in recent years.</p><p> Use of big data analytics and AI by country groups</p><h6>: Average share of firms reporting that they use AI by country groups, controlling for firms’ sector. The error bars represent 95% confidence intervals. EU countries are grouped based on an index of financial development using financial market data from 2015 to 2023 and consisting of two composite indicators: (i) financial market size and integration, and (ii) financial market depth (see Betz et al., 2026). Source: EIBIS 2019-2024.</h6><p>Adoption also varies dramatically by firm size. Among large firms (more than 250 employees), 45% have deployed AI, compared with only 24% of small firms (10 to 49 employees). This echoes classic patterns in technology diffusion (Comin and Hobijn 2010): larger firms possess the resources, technical expertise, and economies of scale needed to absorb integration costs. AI-adopting firms are also systematically different – they invest more, are more innovative, and face tighter constraints in finding skilled workers. These patterns suggest that simply observing which firms adopt AI and comparing their performance could yield misleading results, as adoption itself is endogenous to firm characteristics.</p><h2>Isolating AI’s causal effect</h2><p>To credibly identify the causal effect of AI on productivity, we develop a novel instrumental variable strategy, inspired by Rajan and Zingales’ (1998) seminal work on financial dependence and growth. Their key insight was that industry characteristics measured in one economy – where they are arguably less affected by local distortions – can serve as an exogenous source of variation when applied to other countries.</p><p>We extend this logic to the firm level. For each EU firm in our sample, we identify comparable US firms – matched on sector, size, investment intensity, innovation activity, financing structure and management practices. We then assign the AI adoption rate of these matched US firms as a proxy for the EU firm’s exogenous exposure to AI. Because US firms operate under different institutional, regulatory and policy environments, their adoption patterns capture technological drivers that are plausibly independent of EU-specific factors. Rigorous propensity-score balancing tests confirm that our matched US and EU firms are virtually identical across key observable characteristics, validating the identification strategy. Our analysis draws on survey data from EIBIS combined with balance sheet data from Moody’s Orbis.</p><h2>Productivity gains without job losses</h2><p>Our results reveal three key findings. First, AI adoption causally increases labour productivity levels by 4% on average in the EU. This effect is statistically robust and economically meaningful, though more moderate than the transformative scenarios predicted by some observers. The magnitude aligns with mid-range macroeconomic projections (Bergeaud 2024) rather than the most optimistic estimates of productivity booms. While our analysis focuses on labour productivity levels and captures a one-off effect – rather than long-run total factor productivity growth – the 4% gain suggests that AI acts in the short term as a complementary input that enhances efficiency, albeit with implementation frictions and skill gaps tempering its impact.</p><p>Second, and crucially, we find no evidence that AI reduces employment in the short run. While naïve comparisons suggest AI-adopting firms employ more workers, this relationship disappears once we account for selection effects through our instrumental variable approach. The absence of negative employment effects, combined with significant productivity gains, points to a specific mechanism: capital deepening. AI augments worker output – enabling employees to complete tasks faster and make better decisions – without displacing labour. This finding resonates with micro-level experimental evidence showing that AI tools can produce productivity gains between 10% and 65%, with strong effects in coding, consultant tasks and professional writing (Noy and Zhang 2023, Gambacorta et al. 2024, Brynjolfsson et al. 2025). These experimental effects are task-specific, whereas our estimates capture firm-level averages.</p><p>Importantly, workers in AI-adopting firms have benefited through higher wages, both in aggregate and per employee. Whether these wage gains will persist in the long term, and whether they will be shared equitably across skill levels, remains an open question that merits continued monitoring.</p><h2>Uneven gains and the critical role of complementary investments</h2><p>Third, AI’s productivity benefits are far from evenly distributed. Breaking down our results by firm size reveals that medium and large companies experience substantially stronger productivity gains than their smaller counterparts (see Figure 2). This differential effect reflects the role of scale in absorbing AI integration costs and accessing complementary assets – data infrastructure, technical talent, and organisational capacity to redesign workflows. The finding raises concerns about widening productivity gaps between firms and regions, particularly given Europe’s industrial structure, which is dominated by small and medium-sized enterprises.</p><p> Effects of AI adoption on labour productivity by company size</p><h6>: The dependent variable is labour productivity, calculated as the log of turnover per employee, and is derived from EIBIS. AI adoption is measured using the AI implementation status derived from similar firms in the US. All regressions control for firm investment, profitability, financial leverage, total assets, age, and the interaction of country, sector and year fixed effects. Investment is expressed as the annual change in total fixed assets. Profitability is the ratio of earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) to total assets. Financial leverage is the ratio of loans and long-term debt to total assets. All control variables come from Orbis and are lagged by 1 year. Error bars represent 90% confidence interval, based on standard errors clustered at country-sector-year level. Log linear approximation, 0.01 = 1% increase.</h6><p>Perhaps most importantly, our analysis reveals that AI adoption alone is insufficient. Firms must make complementary investments to unlock AI’s full potential. Our results show the striking heterogeneity in how different types of investments enhance AI’s productivity effects. An extra percentage point of investment in software and data infrastructure increases AI’s productivity effect by 2.4 percentage points. Investment in workforce training has an even larger multiplier effect: an additional percentage point spent on training amplifies AI’s productivity gains by 5.9 percentage points. These findings underscore a critical insight: the productivity dividends from AI depend not merely on acquiring the technology but on firms’ capacity to integrate it through investments in intangible assets and human capital.</p><h2>Implications for European policy</h2><p>These findings carry significant implications for policymakers. First, the benefits of AI adoption are mostly visible for medium and large firms. This means that Europe may work on policies that help smaller firms reach the critical scale necessary to benefit from AI. This requires well-functioning financial markets that can channel capital to innovative, fast-growing companies. Our evidence shows that firms in countries with more sophisticated financial markets are better equipped to invest in AI and complementary assets. This underscores the importance of advancing the EU Savings and Investment Union to ensure that promising smaller firms can access the finance they need to grow and compete.</p><p>Second, the central role of complementary investments means that public policy must look beyond subsidising AI hardware or software licenses. Effective support requires incentivising firm-level investments in integration, workflow redesign and continuous learning. Workforce development programs should prioritise what might be called ‘fusion skills’ – capabilities like prompt engineering, data stewardship and human-in-the-loop decision making that enhance human-AI complementarity. This demands coordinated investments in vocational training, tertiary education and lifelong learning.</p><p>Finally, while our results offer some reassurance that AI may not be leading to immediate job destruction, policymakers should not be complacent. The capital-deepening effects we document may be transitional. As AI systems become more capable and as firms gain experience integrating them, labour-displacing effects could emerge. Moreover, the wage gains we observe may accrue disproportionately to highly skilled workers, potentially widening income inequality. Continued monitoring of AI’s labour market effects and proactive policies to ensure inclusive growth will be essential as the technology matures.</p><p><em>Authors’ note: The views expressed in this column are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect those of the Bank for International Settlements and the European Investment Bank.</em></p><p>Acemoglu, D (2024), “The simple macroeconomics of AI”,  40: 13–58.</p><p>Baily, M N, E Brynjolfsson and A Korinek (2023), “Machines of mind: The case for an AI-powered productivity boom”, Brookings Institution.</p><p>Bergeaud, A (2024), “The past, present and future of European productivity”, paper presented at the ECB Forum on Central Banking, Sintra, July.</p><p>Betz, F, R Pál, A Sapir and T Huyen (2026), “Capital markets and access to equity for European firms”, EIB Working Paper, forthcoming.</p><p>Brynjolfsson, E, D Li and L Raymond (2025), “Generative AI at work”, <em>Quarterly Journal of Economics </em>140(2): 889–942.</p><p>Cazzaniga, M, F Jaumotte, L Li, G Melina, A Panton, C Pizzinelli, E Rockall and M Mendes Tavares (2024), “GenAI: Artificial intelligence and the future of work”, IMF Staff Discussion Note 2024/001.</p><p>Comin, D and B Hobijn (2010), “An exploration of technology diffusion”, 100: 2031–2059.</p><p>Cornelli, G, J Frost and S Mishra (2023), “Artificial intelligence, services globalisation and income inequality”, BIS Working Paper.</p><p>Filippucci, F, P Gal and M Schief (2024), “Miracle or myth?

Tools like Claude Code, Codex and Amp are running in terminals on remote machines, generating code, running builds, and waiting for human input. Developers increasingly need to check in on these agents from wherever they are — approve a change on the train, monitor a build from the couch, or nudge an agent in the right direction while away from their desk.</p><p>And then there's<a href=\"https://ghostty.org\" target=\"_blank\">Ghostty</a>. Ghostty is our favourite terminal emulator. It's a terminal built with our own values of performance and true-to-platform native behaviour, as well as being beautiful, fast and flexible. Ghostty's terminal engine is open source and written in a way that can be embedded, which meant we could bring that same level of performance and correctness to iOS.</p><p>Over the last twelve months, we've been using all of these tools heavily. How we program has changed dramatically — we spend more time in the terminal than ever, working alongside agents, reviewing their output, and managing remote machines. At some point we realised that the app we kept reaching for on our phones didn't exist yet. So we built it. Echo is that app.</p><h2>Built for iOS, not ported to it</h2><p>We didn't want to just wrap a terminal in a WebView and ship it, or use a substandard terminal emulator. Echo is a native app, built from the ground up for iPhone and iPad. That means Metal-accelerated rendering, native Keychain integration for your SSH keys, and Face ID to keep your connections secure.</p><p>On iPhone, we spent a lot of time on the keyboard experience. There's a specially designed toolbar above the keyboard with quick keys for common terminal characters, and gesture-based arrow key movement that feels right at home on a touchscreen. It sounds like a small thing, but it makes a huge difference when you're actually trying to get work done on your phone.</p><p>On iPad, Echo really shines. Full hardware keyboard support with all the shortcuts you'd expect, Split View and Slide Over for running multiple sessions side by side, and Stage Manager support so you can resize and arrange terminal windows alongside your other apps. It's the kind of experience that makes an iPad with a keyboard feel like a genuinely capable development machine.</p><h2>A home for agents on the go</h2><p>One of the things we're most excited about is how well Echo works as an interface for AI coding agents. Echo's minimal, distraction-free UI turns out to be the perfect environment for this — you SSH into your machine, attach to a tmux session, and you're right back where you left off with your agent.</p><p>We've been using Echo ourselves to interact with Claude Code, Codex, and others — and it's genuinely changed how we think about those workflows. Being able to approve a file change or review a diff from your phone feels like a superpower. The complex TUI interfaces that these agents present — syntax-highlighted code, interactive diffs, progress indicators — they all render beautifully because of Ghostty's terminal engine underneath.</p><p>If you know us from<a href=\"https://replay.software/sleeve\">Sleeve</a>, you know we care about customization. Echo ships with a curated collection of terminal themes so you can make your terminal feel like yours. We've hand-picked some classics and some fresh options, and we'll be adding more over time.</p><p>Echo is available today on the App Store for iPhone and iPad, for a one-time purchase of $2.99. No subscriptions, no in-app purchases — just the way we like it.</p><p>This is a really exciting release for us. Echo represents something new for Replay — our first step into iOS, and into a space that's evolving incredibly fast. We have a lot of ideas for where to take Echo next, and we can't wait to share them with you.</p><p>If you have any questions, feedback, or just want to say hi, you can always reach us at<a href=\"https://replay.software/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0b787e7b7b64797f4b796e7b676a722578646d7f7c6a796e\"></a>.

The purchase sent the publisher’s shares up around 10% as investors reacted to Buffett’s disclosure.</p><h2>Why is Warren Buffett dumping Amazon?</h2><p>While the Amazon trimming was the most eye-catching, it was not an isolated case.

      "content": "<p>Arizona legislators have introduced what may be the most aggressive app store age verification bill in the country. <a href=\"https://legiscan.com/AZ/text/HB2920/id/3326319/Arizona-2026-HB2920-Introduced.html\">House Bill 2920</a> would require age verification not just for app downloads, but for preinstalled software, the browser, the text messaging app, the search bar, the calculator, and the weather widget. Every piece of software on a mobile device would be subject to age-gating ID checks under this proposal.</p><p>The bill, introduced on January 27 and currently pending before the House Science &amp; Technology Committee, creates a surveillance architecture that applies to every mobile device user in the state. App store providers would be required to verify every account holder’s age category and share that data with developers.</p><p>HB 2920 divides users into four age categories: children under 13, teenagers between 13 and 16, older teenagers between 16 and 18, and adults. Every person who creates an app store account in Arizona would be sorted into one of these buckets through what the bill calls “commercially available” verification methods, a phrase it declines to define with any precision. The Arizona Attorney General would be tasked with creating rules to establish acceptable verification processes.</p><p>For anyone under 18, the bill mandates that their account be “affiliated” with a parent account. The app store would then be required to obtain “verifiable parental consent” before allowing the minor to download an application, purchase an application, or make any in-app purchase. This consent requirement extends to preinstalled apps as well. The first time a minor launches their browser or messaging app, the system would need to check with the parent account before allowing access.</p><p>The law does not specify how parent-child account affiliation would actually be verified. It grants app stores broad authority to determine parenthood through unspecified commercially reasonable methods, but provides no regulation for how this determination would occur.</p><p>The bill’s reach extends beyond initial downloads. If a developer makes what the legislation calls a “significant change” to an application, the parent account must provide renewed consent before the minor can access the updated version.</p><p>The definition of significant change covers modifications to privacy policies, changes to data collection categories, alterations to age ratings, the addition of in-app purchases, or the introduction of advertisements.</p><p>This means a weather app that adds a banner ad would require fresh parental consent. An update to a note-taking app’s privacy policy would trigger the consent mechanism. The bill creates a system where routine software updates become opportunities for access to be blocked.</p><p>Developers would be required to notify app stores of any significant change, and app stores would then be required to notify parent accounts and obtain renewed consent before providing access to the changed version. The burden falls on both parties, with civil penalties of up to $75,000 per violation and a private right of action allowing parents and minors to sue for $1,000 per violation plus punitive damages.</p><p>To make this system function, app stores would need to collect and maintain detailed records about every user’s age category, parental relationships, and consent status. This data would then be shared with developers whenever a user downloads, purchases, or launches an app.</p><p>The bill includes provisions requiring “industry standard encryption” and limiting data use to compliance purposes, but these safeguards exist alongside requirements for extensive data collection. Age category data, parent-child affiliations, verification records, consent histories, all of this information must be maintained and transmitted between parties for the system to work.</p><p>Texas passed <a href=\"https://reclaimthenet.org/texas-mandates-digital-id-to-access-app-store-apps\">a similar law in 2025</a>. A federal judge <a href=\"https://reclaimthenet.org/texas-app-store-accountability-act-blocked-federal-judge-first-amendment\">blocked it</a> before it could take effect, finding it likely unconstitutional. US District Judge Robert Pitman wrote that the law is “akin to a law that would require every bookstore to verify the age of every customer at the door and, for minors, require parental consent before the child or teen could enter and again when they try to purchase a book.” The court ruled the Texas law imposed content-based restrictions on speech and failed the strict scrutiny test because Texas did not prove it used the least restrictive means to achieve its goals.</p><p>The stated purpose of these laws is to protect children. The effect&nbsp;is creating systems that collect more sensitive data from children than currently exists. Every child’s age, every parent-child relationship, every app download, every purchase, and every consent decision would be logged and shared between companies.</p><p>The bill positions parents as the decision-makers, but the actual gatekeeping happens at the app store level. Apple and Google would be deputized to determine what verification methods meet the “commercially reasonable” standard. They would build the consent interfaces. They would decide how the parent-child affiliation system functions.</p><p>The chilling effect operates at multiple levels. Developers might avoid making any updates to their apps to prevent triggering renewed consent requirements. Small developers might exit the market entirely rather than build compliance infrastructure. Families might find that the apps they use become unavailable because the compliance costs exceed what the developer can bear.</p><p>And for anyone who values the ability to access information without first presenting identification, the bill represents a fundamental issue. Reading news, checking the weather, sending messages, using a calculator, all of these activities would require first verifying your age and, if under 18, obtaining parental permission.</p><p>Arizona joins a growing list of states pursuing app store age verification. <a href=\"https://reclaimthenet.org/texas-app-store-accountability-act-blocked-federal-judge-first-amendment\">Texas</a>, <a href=\"https://reclaimthenet.org/utah-introduces-age-verification-checks-for-social-media\">Utah</a>, <a href=\"https://reclaimthenet.org/louisiana-social-media-age-verification-law-blocked-first-amendment\">Louisiana</a>, and <a href=\"https://reclaimthenet.org/court-keeps-californias-online-id-law-alive\">California</a> have all passed versions of these laws, with varying effective dates and enforcement provisions. The Texas law faces an appeal after being enjoined; Utah and Louisiana are scheduled to take effect later this year; California’s version arrives in 2027.</p><p>HB 2920 goes further than most by explicitly including preinstalled applications. A child in Arizona could buy a phone and find themselves unable to use the basic software that came with it until a parent account is established and consent is obtained. The browser that came with the device, the messaging app, and the search function would all be locked behind age verification and parental consent gates.</p><h2>The First Amendment Question</h2><p>By verifying age, these bills could <a href=\"https://reclaimthenet.org/a-battle-revisited-the-supreme-court-could-revisit-age-verification-and-online-anonymity-bans\">violate the First Amendment</a> primarily due to concerns about the right to speak anonymously online: if users must provide identifiable information about themselves, their ability to share or obtain information anonymously could be jeopardized.</p><p>The anonymous internet user is becoming an endangered species in this regulatory environment. Age verification at the app store level means identification at the app store level. The ability to download and use software without revealing who you are would functionally disappear.</p><p>Courts have consistently treated anonymous speech as protected under the First Amendment. The right to read and write without identification has a long constitutional history. These bills require the opposite: verified identity as a precondition for accessing digital tools.</p><p>Arizona’s HB 2920 has been read twice and awaits committee consideration. If it advances, it would take effect on November 30, 2026, creating yet another deadline for app stores and developers to comply with yet another variation of age verification requirements.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Last year I got into using Letterboxd, to complement my goal of watching more (good) movies. It’s got a really clean interface, the social features are useful but unobtrusive, and it makes remembering what I’ve watched and when I watched it easy. So why isn’t there a Letterboxd for books?</p><p>Funnily enough, Letterboxd <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/about/faq/\">still describes itself</a> as “like GoodReads for movies”. But GoodReads itself is a mess. Take this screenshot of my childhood GoodReads account as an example:</p><p>Where do I log and review a book I’ve read? (The searchbar, but it takes half a dozen clicks and involves up to three different ways to log something). Where can I see the list of books I  read so I can recommend one to a friend? Where can I find books I plan to read? (Both under “My Books”, which by default shows them inter-mixed). Why is so much of the UI taken up with stuff like reading challenges and newsletters? Storygraph, leading independent alternative to GoodReads, has similar problems. These interfaces don’t lead me to log books; instead I just have some files in Obsidian that I sometimes remember to update.</p><p>So let’s build our  GoodReads, with a UI that’s convenient enough to actually use. First we gotta build a search function for books. Then–</p><p>Wait, a search function for books. How do we do that? Well there’s the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/getting_started\">Google Books API</a>, and it’s free which is nice. But when I search for “The Last Unicorn” (and do a little munging of the contents with ):</p><pre><code>$  GET  jq </code></pre><pre><code></code></pre><p>Uh-oh. Why do we have so many distinct versions of ? Well, each distinct format of a work has its own ISBN (so a hardcover, paperback, and eBook all have different ISBNs), even though the text may be identical. Then different editions (for example, a new foreword for a classic novel) all have their  set of unique ISBNs. Any given book may have dozens of ISBNs, each with their own unique entry in this API. That’s not going to work well for a search function: I just want to record that I read a book, not meticulously select which version of a book I read.</p><p>I was complaining about my situation to my partner; xe informed me that librarians think of this through the <a href=\"https://www.oclc.org/research/activities/frbr.html#background\">FRBR model</a>. In short, there’s a distinction between the work (the book ), the  (a given edition of the book), a  (a given physical format for an expression, such as paperback or hardcover), and an  (an individual object in a collection).</p><p>I’m firmly working in the realm of the abstract, so  are irrelevant to me. Google Books’s API is giving back different  or  (I’m not entirely clear on which), but we want . How do we get our hands on those? There are some other book database options, most notably <a href=\"https://openlibrary.org/\">OpenLibrary</a>, which have a model closer to what we want. Here’s the OpenLibrary work page for <a href=\"https://openlibrary.org/works/OL26459W/The_Last_Unicorn?edition=key%3A/books/OL379621M\">The Last Unicorn</a>, for example. But the data’s still a little messy. Peek at <a href=\"https://openlibrary.org/search?q=hotel+iris\">the search results for  by Yoko Ogawa</a>; the same work is duplicated four times. I’m still exploring ways to get data as clean as GoodReads or StoryGraph, but it turns out that there’s not a high-quality open-source database of books.</p><p>Letterboxd benefits from <a href=\"https://www.themoviedb.org\">The Movie Database</a>, which serves as its canonical source for films and film metadata. I would almost venture to describe Letterboxd as a commercialization of the commons, though the slick UI and social features are undeniably added value. If you want to build a similar book-focused project, it turns out that no analogue really exists. It could be a chicken-and-egg problem (I’m sure having a large, commercial service attached drives contributions to TMDB), but there’s also a difference of scale: there are around <a href=\"https://www.themoviedb.org/faq/general\">a million movies</a> in the database today. Having played around with the data, I can say that OpenLibrary current has more than 40 million works in its (incomplete) catalogue. The problem is at least an order of magnitude harder and has much less money behind it.</p><p>Doesn’t mean I won’t try, though; look out for a potential future blogpost!</p>",

      "content": "<p>We were tired after the event, but our marketing folks forced Rachel Laycock and I to do a quick video. We’re often asked if this event was about creating some kind of new manifesto for AI-enabled development, akin to the Agile Manifesto (which is now 25 years old). In short, our answer is “no”, but for the full answer, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHkuVlwYhNk\">watch our video</a></p><p>My colleagues put together a <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/content/dam/thoughtworks/documents/report/tw_future%20_of_software_development_retreat_%20key_takeaways.pdf\">detailed summary of thoughts</a> from the event, in a 17 page PDF. It breaks the discussion down into eight major themes, including “Where does the rigor go?”, “The middle loop: a new category of work”, “Technical foundations: languages, semantics and\noperating systems”, and “The human side: roles, skills and experience”.</p><blockquote><p>The retreat surfaced a consistent pattern: the practices, tools and organizational structures built for human-only software development are breaking in predictable ways under the weight of AI-assisted work. The replacements are forming, but they are not yet mature.</p><p>The ideas ready for broader industry conversation include the supervisory engineering middle loop, risk tiering as the new core engineering discipline, TDD as the strongest form of prompt engineering and the agent experience reframe for developer experience investment.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I walked into that room expecting to learn from people who were further ahead. People who’d cracked the code on how to adopt AI at scale, how to restructure teams around it, how to make it work. Some of the sharpest minds in the software industry were sitting around those tables.</p><p>And nobody has it all figured out.</p><p>There is more uncertainty than certainty. About how to use AI well, what it’s really doing to productivity, how roles are shifting, what the impact will be, how things will evolve. Everyone is working it out as they go.</p><p>I actually found that to be quite comforting, in many ways. Yes, we walked away with more questions than answers, but at least we now have a shared understanding of the sorts of questions we should be asking. That might be the most valuable outcome of all.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>AI may be dubbed the great disruptor, but it’s really just an accelerator of whatever you already have. The 2025 DORA report places AI’s primary role in software development as that of an amplifier — a funhouse mirror that reflects back the good, bad, and ugly of your whole pipeline. AI is proven to be impactful on the individual developer’s work and on the speed of writing code. But, since writing code was never the bottleneck, if traditional software delivery best practices aren’t already in place, this velocity multiplier becomes a debt accelerator.</p></blockquote><p>LLMs are eating specialty skills. There will be less use of specialist front-end and back-end developers as the LLM-driving skills become more important than the details of platform usage. Will this lead to a greater recognition of the role of <a href=\"https://martinfowler.com/articles/expert-generalist.html\">Expert Generalists</a>? Or will the ability of LLMs to write lots of code mean they code around the silos rather than eliminating them? Will LLMs be able to ingest the code from many silos to understand how work crosses the boundaries?</p><p>Will LLMs be cheaper than humans once the subsidies for tokens go away? At this point we have little visibility to what the true cost of tokens is now, let alone what it will be in a few years time. It could be so cheap that we don’t care how many tokens we send to LLMs, or it could be high enough that we have to be very careful.</p><p>Will the rise of specifications bring us back to <a href=\"https://martinfowler.com/bliki/WaterfallProcess.html\">waterfall-style development</a>? The natural impulse of many business folks is “don’t bother me until it’s finished”. Does the process of evolutionary design get helped or hindered by LLMs?</p><p>My instinctive reaction is that all depends on our workflow. I don’t think LLMs change the value of rapidly building and releasing small slices of capability. The promise of LLMs is to increase the frequency of that cycle, and doing more in each release.</p><p>Sadly the session on security had a small turnout.</p><p>One large enterprise employee commented that they were deliberately slow with AI tech, keeping about a quarter behind the leading edge. “We’re not in the business of avoiding all risks, but we do need to manage them”.</p><p>Security is tedious, people naturally want to first make things work, then make them reliable, and only then make them secure. Platforms play an important role here, make it easy to deploy AI with good security. Are the AI vendors being irresponsible by not taking this seriously enough? I think of how other engineering disciplines bake a significant safety factor into their designs. Are we doing that, and if not will our failure lead to more damage than a falling bridge?</p><p>There was a general feeling that platform thinking is essential here. Platform teams need to create a fast but safe path - “bullet trains” for those using AI in applications building.</p><p>One of my favorite things about the event was some meta-stuff. While many of the participants were very familiar with the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=open+space&amp;btnG=+&amp;domains=martinfowler.com&amp;sitesearch=&amp;sitesearch=martinfowler.com\">Open Space</a> format, it was the first time for a few. It’s always fun to see how people quickly realize how this style of (un)conference leads to wide-ranging yet deep discussions. I hope we made a few more open space fans.</p><p>One participant commented how they really appreciated how the sessions had so much deep and respectful dialog. There wasn’t the interruptions and a few people gobbling up airtime that they’d seen around so much of the tech world. Another attendee, commented “it was great that while I was here I didn’t have to feel I was a woman, I could just be one of the participants”. One of the lovely things about Thoughtworks is that I’ve got used to that sense of camaraderie, and it can be  a sad shock when I go outside the bubble.</p><p>&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄</p><p>I’ve learned much over the years from Stephen O’Grady’s analysis of the software industry. He’s written about how much of the profession feels <a href=\"https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2026/02/10/besieged/\">besieged</a> by AI.</p><blockquote><p>these tools are, or can be, powerful accelerants and enablers for people that dramatically lower the barriers to software development. They have the ability to democratize access to skills that used to be very difficult, or even possible for some, to acquire. Even a legend of the industry like Grady Booch, who has been appropriately dismissive of AGI claims and is actively disdainful of AI slop posted recently that he was “gobsmacked” by Claude’s abilities. Booch’s advice to developers alarmed by AI on Oxide’s podcast last week? “Be calm” and “take a deep breath.” From his perspective, having watched and shaped the evolution of the technology first hand over a period of decades, AI is just another step in the industry’s long history of abstractions, and one that will open new doors for the industry.</p><p>…whether one wants those doors opened or not ultimately is irrelevant. AI isn’t going away any more than the automated loom, steam engines or nuclear reactors did. For better or for worse, the technology is here for good. What’s left to decide is how we best maximize its benefits while mitigating its costs.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄</p><p>Adam Tornhill shares some more of his company’s research on code health and its impact on agentic development.</p><blockquote><p>The study Code for Machines, Not Just Humans defines “AI-friendliness” as the probability that AI-generated refactorings preserve behavior and improve maintainability. It’s a large-scale study of 5,000 real programs using six different LLMs to refactor code while keeping all tests passing.</p></blockquote><p>They found that LLMs performed consistently better in healthy code bases. The risk of defects was 30% higher in less-healthy code. And a limitation of the study was that the less-healthy code wasn’t anywhere near as bad as much legacy code is.</p><blockquote><p>What would the AI error rate be on such code? Based on patterns observed across all Code Health research, the relationship is almost certainly non-linear.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❄</p><p>In a conversation with one heavy user of LLM coding agents:</p><blockquote><p>Thank you for all your advocacy of TDD (<a href=\"https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDrivenDevelopment.html\">Test-Driven Development</a>). TDD has been essential for us to use LLMs effectively</p></blockquote><p>I worry about confirmation bias here, but I am hearing from folks on the leading edge of LLM usage about the value of clear tests, and the TDD cycle. It certainly strikes me as a key tool in driving LLMs effectively.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Asteroids travel steadily, occasionally leaving observable distance. It has been a while since our last release, and now it's finally here!</p><p>AsteroidOS 2.0 has arrived, bringing major features and improvements gathered during its journey through community space. Always-on-Display, expanded support for more watches, new launcher styles, customizable quick settings, significant performance increases in parts of the User Interface, and enhancements to our synchronization clients are just some highlights of what to expect.</p><h2>Design, Usability, and App Improvements<a href=\"https://asteroidos.org/news/2-0-release/index.html#asteroidos-20-has-landed-design-usability-and-app-improvements\" name=\"asteroidos-20-has-landed-design-usability-and-app-improvements\"></a></h2><h2>Performance and System Enhancements<a href=\"https://asteroidos.org/news/2-0-release/index.html#asteroidos-20-has-landed-performance-and-system-enhancements\" name=\"asteroidos-20-has-landed-performance-and-system-enhancements\"></a></h2><ul><li><p>Significant performance improvements have been made to the User Interface, resulting in smoother animations and transitions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Battery Life Improvements</strong>Various optimizations have been implemented to extend battery life during daily use.</p></li><li><p>Numerous bug fixes and stability improvements have been applied across the system.</p></li></ul><p>Since 1.0 we added support for the following watches:</p><ul><li>Fossil Gen 4 Watches (firefish/ray)</li><li>Fossil Gen 5 Watches (triggerfish)</li><li>Fossil Gen 6 Watches (hoki)</li><li>Huawei Watch 2 (sawfish/sawshark)</li><li>MTK6580 (harmony/inharmony)</li><li>Ticwatch C2+ &amp; C2 (skipjack)</li><li>Ticwatch Pro, Pro 2020 and LTE (catfish/catfish-ext/catshark)</li><li>Ticwatch Pro 3 (rover/rubyfish)</li></ul><p>And partial support for the following watches:</p><ul><li>Casio WSD-F10/F20 (koi, ayu) - bricking have been reported on some watches</li><li>LG Watch Urbane 2 (nemo) - missing too many features</li><li>Moto 360 1st gen (minnow) - has underwhelming performance, it is the only watch we have ported with a TI SoC.</li><li>Samsung Gear 2 (rinato) - too unstable and too bad power management</li><li>Samsung Gear Live (sprat) - in an unusable state due to persistent display issues</li></ul><p>We have created an \"Experimental\" category in our watch gallery for the above 5 watches since we do not consider those suitable for daily use. We will however continue to provide install images for these watches, and we welcome new contributors with fresh ideas to help improve support! We also continue to monitor supported watches and for example recently demoted the Sony Smartwatch 3 (tetra) due to unresolved hardware support issues.</p><p>The Samsung Gear 2 (rinato) is our first watch supported with a mainline Linux kernel and therefore without the use of libhybris. The Asus Zenwatch 2 (sparrow) also has very basic support for running on a mainline Linux kernel.</p><p>For a complete list of supported devices and installation instructions, please visit our <a href=\"https://asteroidos.org/install/\">installation guide</a>.</p><p>Apart from adding new watches, the community has also been actively enhancing the support for our existing range of watches.\nVisit our newly created <a href=\"https://asteroidos.org/install/features/\">feature matrix page</a> to find out about the detailed support level for your watch.</p><p>This release would not have been possible without the dedicated efforts of our community contributors. We extend our heartfelt thanks to everyone who reported issues, submitted patches, and provided feedback during the development cycle.</p><p>Over the years, the AsteroidOS community has expanded its reach, with community translators adding over 20 languages to the <a href=\"https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/asteroidos/#languages\">AsteroidOS Weblate</a>. Translating into your local language is the easiest way to get involved. Your help is most valuable to make AsteroidOS fit for use in your region.</p><p>Watchface creation has been a popular community activity lately. We are happy to present the new and comprehensive <a href=\"https://asteroidos.org/wiki/watchfaces-creation/\">watchfaces creation and design guide</a>. It is garnished with testing and deployment scripts to simplify the process further. \nOur community came up with funny and beautiful new watchfaces. Those are all collected in the <a href=\"https://github.com/AsteroidOS/unofficial-watchfaces\">unofficial watchfaces repository</a>.</p><p>moWerk has contributed a variety of watchfaces. Two highlights are the minimalistic <a href=\"https://youtu.be/cXeWRX6N6Sg\">pulsedot</a> and a classic Monty Python inspired <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eLtMosen/status/1403642123338014722\">silly walks watchface</a>.</p><p>Dodoradio worked on a few unusual watches, like the <a href=\"https://asteroidos.org/install/narwhal/\">LG Watch W7</a> with its physical hands to be taken into account. And the <a href=\"https://github.com/AsteroidOS/meta-smartwatch/pull/140\">Casio WSD-FXX series</a> sporting multifunctional secondary displays. Along with some more conventional ports such as the Fossil Gen5 and Polar M600. For watches with GPS, he contributed a <a href=\"https://git.dodorad.io/dodoradio/asteroid-map/about\">Map app with waypoint functionality</a> to the community repository. His initial version of the often requested <a href=\"https://git.dodorad.io/dodoradio/asteroid-health\">asteroid-health</a> app is already capable of automatically tracking steps and heartrate with minimal impact on battery life.</p><p>PostmarketOS now offers our launcher and core apps, thanks to postmarketOS developer PureTryOut, who moved our buildsystem from qmake to cmake along the way.</p><p>The program <a href=\"https://github.com/AsteroidOS/lcd-tools\">lcd-tools</a> by lecris and MagneFire was originally developed to control the secondary LCD on the TicWatch Pro. And got extended by dodoradio and beroset to make use of many more features the Casio secondary displays offer.</p><p>MagneFire, jrt, moWerk and beroset joined the AsteroidOS team.</p><ul><li>A <a href=\"https://asteroidos.org/faq/\">FAQ</a> section has been added to provide a quick overview of our project.</li><li>The Install page has grown into a gallery of supported watches over time with now 30 watches listed. We renamed it to \"<a href=\"https://asteroidos.org/watches/\">Watches</a>\" and plan to evolve this page into a purchase guide to aid new users in choosing a supported watch. A first step was to resize the images of all watches to correctly reflect the relative size differences between them, to be able to compare their dimensions.</li><li>The <a href=\"https://asteroidos.org/wiki/documentation/\">Documentation</a> pages are frequently updated by community members and nicely keep up with the current state of development. We recently moved them into a MediaWiki. This enables users without deeper knowledge to contribute to the documentation much more easily.</li></ul><p>With 2.0 we introduce a community repository, to improve discoverability and simplify the installation of precompiled packages, while building the foundation for a possible graphical software center in the future. Currently, the repository consists of a few debugging tools, community watchfaces, games and emulators. Developers are welcome to create pull requests on the <a href=\"https://github.com/AsteroidOS/meta-asteroid-community\">meta-community</a> repo for packaging.</p><p>After moving our infrastructure to a larger server, we have seen an increase in the frequency of nightly releases. However, it is worth noting that completely rebuilding all packages for all 30 watch system images still takes almost a week. Therefore, we can expect the nightlies to be ready on weekends. </p><p>Interested in contributing to AsteroidOS? Whether you're a developer, designer, or enthusiast, there are many ways to get involved:</p><ul><li><strong>Contribute to the codebase</strong> by tackling open issues or developing new features.</li></ul><p>Your participation helps make AsteroidOS better for everyone.</p><p>Ready to experience the latest features and improvements? Download AsteroidOS 2.0 from our <a href=\"https://asteroidos.org/watches/\">official website</a> and follow the installation instructions for your device.</p><p>Thank you for your continued support. We hope you enjoy AsteroidOS 2.0!</p><p>As you might have noticed, the current releases linked on the installation pages have feature parity with the 2.0 release. At some point, we decided to switch from our stable 1.0 release to a quasi 1.1 nightly rolling release, as the 1.0 release became too old to maintain. In the future, we would like to change our release cycle to offer more frequent stable releases. A stable release will always be stable. But not too old to no longer be maintainable.</p><p>For the future, we are going to set up a roadmap for features we would like to see in an eventual next release.\nBased on recent early community work, we might see features like:</p><ul><li>Combined fitness app (Privacy minded heart rate monitoring and step counter tracking)</li><li>WiFi setup via the settings app</li><li>Web based Watchface creation tool</li><li>App store for making community contributions easily available</li></ul><div>Written by AsteroidOS Team on the 17/02/2026</div>",

      "content": "<p>Throughout my career, I tried many tools to query PostgreSQL, and in the end, concluded that for what I do, the simplest is almost always the best: raw SQL queries.</p><p>Until now, I typed the results manually and relied on tests to catch problems. While this is OK in e.g., GoLang, it is quite annoying in TypeScript. First, because of the more powerful type system (it's easier to guess that updated_at is a date than it is to guess whether it's nullable or not), second, because of idiosyncrasies (INT4s are deserialised as JS numbers, but INT8s are deserialised as strings).</p><p>So I wrote pg-typesafe, with the goal of it being the less burdensome: you call queries exactly the same way as you would call node-pg, and they are fully typed.</p><p>It's very new, but I'm already using it in a large-ish project, where it found several bugs and footguns, and also allowed me to remove many manual type definitions.</p>",

      "content": "\n<p>13 years ago, we launched Watsi.org with a Show HN [1].<p>For nearly a year, this community drove so much traffic that we couldn’t list patients fast enough. Then pg saw us on HN, wrote us our first big check, and accepted us as the first YC nonprofit (W13). The next few years were a whirlwind.<p>I was a young, naive founder with just enough experience to know I wanted Watsi to be more efficient, transparent, and innovative than most nonprofits. We spent 24/7 talking to users and coding. We did things that don’t scale. We tried our best to be walking, talking pg essays.<p>Over the years we learned that product/market fit is different for nonprofits. Not many people wake up and think, \"I'd love to donate to a nonprofit today\" with the same oomph that they think, \"I'd love a coffee\" or \"I'd like to make more money.\"<p>No matter how much effort we put into fundraising, donations grew linearly, while requests for care grew exponentially. I felt caught in the middle. After investing everything I had, I eventually burned out and transitioned to the board.<p>I made a classic founder mistake and intertwined my self-worth with Watsi's success. I believed that if I could somehow help every patient, I was a good person, but if I let down some patients, which became inevitable, I was a bad person.<p>This was exacerbated by seeing our for-profit YC batch mates raise massive rounds. I felt like a failure for not scaling Watsi faster, but eventually we accepted reality and set Watsi on more of a slow, steady, and sustainable trajectory.<p>Now that I have perspective, I'm incredibly proud of what the org has accomplished and grateful to everyone who has done a tour of duty to support us. Watsi donors have donated over $20M to fund 33,241 surgeries, and we have a good shot of helping patients for a long time to come.<p>In a world of fast growth and fast crashes, here's a huge thank you to the HN users who have stuck by Watsi, or any other important cause, even when it's not on the front page. I believe it embodies the best of humanity. Thanks HN!<p>[1] <a href=\"http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4424081\">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4424081</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47049824\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47049824</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1119</p>\n<p># Comments: 111</p>\n",

So I'm sharing.</p><p>This is an open &amp; unconventional textbook covering maths, computing, and artificial intelligence from the ground up.

Our team started deploying AI agents for our marketing and lead gen ops: content, engagement, analytics across multiple X accounts.</p><p>OpenClaw worked fine for single agents. But at ~14 agents across 6 accounts, the problem shifted from \"how do I build agents\" to \"how do I manage them.\"</p><p>Deployment, monitoring, team isolation, figuring out which agent broke what at 3am. Classic orchestration problem.</p><p>So I built klaw, modeled on Kubernetes:\nClusters — isolated environments per org/project\nNamespaces — team-level isolation (marketing, sales, support)\nChannels — connect agents to Slack, X, Discord\nSkills — reusable agent capabilities via a marketplace</p><p>CLI works like kubectl:\nklaw create cluster mycompany\nklaw create namespace marketing\nklaw deploy agent.yaml</p><p>I also rewrote from Node.js to Go — agents went from 800MB+ to under 10MB each.</p><p>Quick usage example: I run a \"content cluster\" where each X account is its own namespace. Agent misbehaving on one account can't affect others. Adding a new account is klaw create namespace [account] + deploy the same config. 30 seconds.</p><p>The key differentiator vs frameworks like CrewAI or LangGraph: those define how agents collaborate on tasks. klaw operates one layer above — managing fleets of agents across teams with isolation and operational tooling. You could run CrewAI agents inside klaw namespaces.</p><p>Happy to answer questions.</p>",

You deploy lightweight connectors that bridge to specific resources (private web apps, SSH, databases, CIDR ranges). Admins delegate resource-access to specific users and roles. It uses WireGuard with NAT hole-punching for peer-to-peer connections and traffic goes directly between the user and connector instead of through a central server. It supports native clients (Mac/Windows/Linux/iOS/Android) plus identity-aware, browser-based access when a client isn’t required.</p><p>Pangolin has a cloud and is optionally self-hosted. The Community Edition is AGPLv3. The Enterprise Edition is also open-source under the commercial license which enables free personal/small business use.</p><p>Everything, from the server to the clients, is fully open-source and you can even self-host the whole stack. We’d love to hear what you think and I'm happy to answer any questions!</p>",

      "content": "\n<p>Hey HN, we built Threat Radar (<a href=\"https://radar.offseq.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://radar.offseq.com</a>) – a real-time threat intelligence platform that aggregates data from sources like CISA, CIRCL, ThreatFox, and others into a single live dashboard.\nThe core idea: threat intel is fragmented across dozens of feeds and often locked behind expensive enterprise tools. We wanted something that gives security teams (and curious individuals) an immediate, visual picture of what's happening right now.\nWhat it does:<p>Live dashboard with severity distribution across ~63k tracked threats (critical, high, medium, low)\nInteractive heat map showing geographic threat concentration, with a European focus\nReal-time threat feed with search, filtering by CVE, type, severity, country, and tags\nTimeline view for trend analysis with custom date ranges\n100% AI enrichment – every threat entry gets contextualized analysis, impact assessment, and actionable recommendations\nCommunity submissions – anyone can submit incident reports or vulnerability write-ups for AI triage\nAPI + integrations (webhooks, Slack, email alerts, SIEM/MISP routing) for automation<p>The free tier gives you full access to the dashboard, threat database, map, and feeds. The lifetime upgrade unlocks custom feeds, automations, and API access for piping data into your own security stack.\nWe're a small team based in Riga, Latvia. Would love feedback from the HN security community – what feeds or features would make this more useful for your workflow?</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47018888\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47018888</a></p>\n<p>Points: 223</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Hey HN! I was a long-time Arc browser user and loved how its sidebar organized tabs and bookmarks into workspaces. I wanted to switch to other browsers without losing that workflow. So I built Arcmark, it's a macOS bookmark manager (Swift/AppKit) that floats as a sidebar attached to any browser window. It uses macOS accessibility API to follow the browser window around.</p><p>You get workspace-based links/bookmarks organization with nested folders, drag-and-drop reordering, and custom workspace colors. For the most part I tried replicating Arc's sidebar UX as close as possible.</p><p>1. Local-first: all data lives in a single JSON file ( ~/Library/Application Support/Arcmark/data.json). No accounts, no cloud sync.</p><p>2. Works with any browser: Chrome, Safari, Brave, Arc, etc. Or use it standalone as a bookmark manager with a regular window.</p><p>3. Import pinned tab and spaces from Arc: it parses Arc's  StorableSidebar.json to recreate the exact workspace/folder structure.</p><p>4. Built with swift-bundler rather than Xcode.</p><p>There's a demo video in the README showing the sidebar attachment in action.\nThe DMG is available on the releases page (macOS 13+), or you can build from source.</p><p>This is v0.1.0 so it's a very early version. Would appreciate any feedback or thoughts</p>",

I've been diving deep into Data Engineering, especially in the context of Large Language Models (LLMs).</p><p>The Problem:\nI found that learning resources for modern data engineering are often fragmented and scattered across hundreds of medium articles or disjointed tutorials. It's hard to piece everything together into a coherent system.</p><p>The Solution:\nI decided to open-source my learning notes and build them into a structured book. My goal is to help developers fast-track their learning curve.</p><p>LLM-Centric: Focuses on data pipelines specifically designed for LLM training and RAG systems.</p><p>Scenario-Based: Instead of just listing tools, I compare different methods/architectures based on specific business scenarios (e.g., \"When to use Vector DB vs. Keyword Search\").</p><p>Hands-on Projects: Includes full code for real-world implementations, not just \"Hello World\" examples.</p><p>This is a work in progress, and I'm treating it as \"Book-as-Code\". I would love to hear your feedback on the roadmap or any \"anti-patterns\" I might have included!</p>",

      "content": "\n<p>Hey y’all, Kartik, Ishaan, and Christian from Omnara (<a href=\"https://www.omnara.com/\">https://www.omnara.com/</a>) here. We’re building a web and mobile agentic IDE for Claude Code and Codex that lets you run and interact with coding agents from anywhere. Omnara lets you run Claude Code and Codex sessions on your own machine, and exposes those sessions through a web and mobile interface so you can stay involved even when you’re away from your desk. Think of it like Claude Code Desktop or Conductor, except you can continue your sessions on your phone.<p>Here’s a demo of the web and mobile apps - <a href=\"https://youtu.be/R8Wmy4FLbhQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/R8Wmy4FLbhQ</a><p>We started using Claude Code early last year and quickly ran into a pattern: agents could work for long stretches on their own, but progress would stall whenever they needed follow-up input. If that happened while we were away from our desks, everything just paused. We looked at remote agent solutions like Codex Web and Devin, which were the main options at the time, but they ran in remote VMs, and we wanted our coding agent to run in our own environment. Our first attempt at solving this was a lightweight wrapper that streamed messages from the Claude Code CLI to a mobile app, but that approach ended up being fragile and hard to maintain.<p>As the Claude Agent SDK matured, it gave us enough control to rewrite Omnara from scratch and run the agent loop directly. We chose to build a GUI across web and mobile instead of a TUI or CLI, because we think GUIs are generally more ergonomic for working with agents and code, especially on mobile. We still preserve the main strength of CLIs and TUIs: running anywhere, including on headless machines.<p>Omnara keeps that property by running a small headless daemon on the user’s machine (or a remote VM) that hosts the agent loop. The daemon maintains an authenticated, outbound WebSocket connection to our server, which relays messages between the agent running on the user’s machine and any connected web or mobile clients. Because the daemon only makes outbound connections, there’s no need for exposed ports, SSH access, or tunneling on the user’s machine.<p>In our first version of Omnara, users liked that agent sessions ran in their own environment, but they still depended on the machine staying online. Some users ran Omnara on a remote machine that stayed up, which worked well for them, though most still did most of their work on laptops. In the current version, Omnara can continue an agent session in a hosted remote sandbox when your local machine goes offline.<p>The conversation state of an agent is already persisted on our server, and you can optionally enable cloud syncing for the working code. When syncing is enabled, Omnara creates git commits at each turn in the conversation and pushes them to our server, so execution can resume from the same state regardless of whether it continues locally or in the cloud. If you continue working in a remote sandbox, you can later pull any changes back into your local environment when you return to your machine. Environment parity in the sandbox isn’t perfect yet, but in practice, missing dependencies are usually easy to resolve by asking the agent to install them.<p>Another thing we learned from using the initial version of Omnara is that mobile is fine for quick interactions, but not great for extended back-and-forth. Users asked for a hands-free way to keep agents moving while walking, driving, or doing something else, which led us to add a voice agent. Coming from more traditional software engineering backgrounds, we honestly thought coding by talking to a voice agent would be gimmicky and added it mostly as a fallback.<p>What surprised us is how useful the voice agent ended up being in practice. When working with coding agents, being redundant and overly explicit usually helps, and people naturally give more detail when speaking than when typing. Going back and forth with the agent as the conversation unfolds tends to produce a much more solid plan than trying to one-shot it with a prompt (this could technically also be done over text, but talking and iterating over voice feels easier and more natural). It’s also just fun. Talking through an idea with an agent while out on a walk is a lot more enjoyable than staring at a terminal screen.<p>To try it out, open your terminal and download Omnara with<p><pre><code>  curl -fsSL https://omnara.com/install/install.sh | bash\n</code></pre>\nthen run omnara inside any git repository. This starts a headless Claude Code or Codex session in that repo, which immediately appears in the Omnara web and mobile apps. From there, you can continue that session or start new ones remotely (with or without worktrees) and switch between the web and mobile clients without interrupting the agent.<p>Omnara is free for 10 agent sessions per month, then $20/month for unlimited sessions. When agents run in your own environment, you can use your existing Claude or Codex subscription, so there’s no need to pay us for additional tokens. If you use Claude Code or Codex, we’d love to hear your feedback on Omnara!</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46991591\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46991591</a></p>\n<p>Points: 131</p>\n<p># Comments: 144</p>\n",

Hologram compiles Elixir to JavaScript to run in the browser, enabling full-stack development in pure Elixir - and soon, Local-First applications.<p>This release is a milestone for our porting initiative. 49 contributors ported 150 Erlang functions across 19 modules, pushing client-side Erlang runtime coverage from 34% to 96% and overall Elixir standard library readiness from 74% to 87%.<p>This means the vast majority of Elixir standard library functions needed for full-stack web and basic local-first apps now work in the browser - string processing, collections, sets, binary operations, Unicode normalization, math, time operations, file path handling, and more.<p>Beyond porting, the release includes enhancements, bug fixes, and infrastructure groundwork.<p>Happy to answer any questions!</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46982943\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46982943</a></p>\n<p>Points: 77</p>\n<p># Comments: 19</p>\n",

      "content": "<h3>One finding jumps out: people with more positive attitudes towards AI who received AI guidance showed poorer discriminability between real and synthetic faces than those with less positive attitudes t</h3><p>The weird part isn't \"AI can be wrong.\" It's that trusting AI actually impairs your judgment on the exact task you're trying to get help with. You become worse at detecting lies when you're told a system will help you detect lies. You don't just ignore the AI and go with your gut. You actively fail harder. This maps exactly onto the expungement problem I've been thinking about: a system gets labeled \"fair\" or \"helpful,\" people internalize that label, and then the infrastructure that was supposed to catch failures becomes invisible. The formal rule works. The actual filtering mechanism fails. Your judgment atrophies. --- Title: Trust in AI makes you worse at the thing you're trusting it for. The erroneous belief that using technology removes biases may lead to overreliance on AI. In a study, participants who received AI guidance and exhibited more positive attitudes towards AI showed poorer discriminability between real and synthetic faces than those with less positive attitudes towards AI. They weren't just influenced by bad recommendations. They actually lost the ability to judge authenticity when they believed a system was doing that work for them. This isn't a design flaw you iterate around. It's what happens when you tell someone a tool is your backup and they relax their guard. The tool doesn't have to be wrong very often to corrupt your own judgment irreversibly. You've shifted the cognitive load and now you can't get it back.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I’m Vincent from Aden. We spent 4 years building ERP automation for construction (PO/invoice reconciliation). We had real enterprise customers but hit a technical wall: Chatbots aren't for real work. Accountants don't want to chat; they want the ledger reconciled while they sleep. They want services, not tools.</p><p>Existing agent frameworks (LangChain, AutoGPT) failed in production - brittle, looping, and unable to handle messy data. General Computer Use (GCU) frameworks were even worse. My reflections:</p><p>1. The \"Toy App\" Ceiling &amp; GCU Trap\nMost frameworks assume synchronous sessions. If the tab closes, state is lost. You can't fit 2 weeks of asynchronous business state into an ephemeral chat session.</p><p>The GCU hype (agents \"looking\" at screens) is skeuomorphic. It’s slow (screenshots), expensive (tokens), and fragile (UI changes = crash). It mimics human constraints rather than leveraging machine speed. Real automation should be headless.</p><p>2. Inversion of Control: OODA &gt; DAGs\nTraditional DAGs are deterministic; if a step fails, the program crashes. In the AI era, the Goal is the law, not the Code. We use an OODA loop to manage stochastic behavior:</p><p>- Observe: Exceptions are observations (FileNotFound = new state), not crashes.</p><p>- Orient: Adjust strategy based on Memory and - Traits.</p><p>- Decide: Generate new code at runtime.</p><p>The topology shouldn't be hardcoded; it should emerge from the task's entropy.</p><p>3. Reliability: The \"Synthetic\" SLA\nYou can't guarantee one inference ($k=1$) is correct, but you can guarantee a System of Inference ($k=n$) converges on correctness. Reliability is now a function of compute budget. By wrapping an 80% accurate model in a \"Best-of-3\" verification loop, we mathematically force the error rate down—trading Latency/Tokens for Certainty.</p><p>4. Biology &amp; Psychology in Code\n\"Hard Logic\" can't solve \"Soft Problems.\" We map cognition to architectural primitives:\nHomeostasis: Solving \"Perseveration\" (infinite loops) via a \"Stress\" metric. If an action fails 3x, \"neuroplasticity\" drops, forcing a strategy shift.\nTraits: Personality as a constraint. \"High Conscientiousness\" increases verification; \"High Risk\" executes DROP TABLE without asking.</p><p>For the industry, we need engineers interested in the intersection of biology, psychology, and distributed systems to help us move beyond brittle scripts. It'd be great to have you roasting my codes and sharing feedback.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I've been building a tool that changes how LLM coding agents explore codebases, and I wanted to share it along with some early observations.</p><p>Typically claude code globs directories, greps for patterns, and reads files with minimal guidance. It works in kind of the same way you'd learn to navigate a city by walking every street. You'll eventually build a mental map, but claude never does - at least not any that persists across different contexts.</p><p>The Recursive Language Models paper from Zhang, Kraska, and Khattab at MIT CSAIL introduced a cleaner framing. Instead of cramming everything into context, the model gets a searchable environment. The model can then query just for what it needs and can drill deeper where needed.</p><p>coderlm is my implementation of that idea for codebases. A Rust server indexes a project with tree-sitter, builds a symbol table with cross-references, and exposes an API. The agent queries for structure, symbols, implementations, callers, and grep results — getting back exactly the code it needs instead of scanning for it.</p><p>The agent workflow looks like:</p><p>1. `init` — register the project, get the top-level structure</p><p>2. `structure` — drill into specific directories</p><p>3. `search` — find symbols by name across the codebase</p><p>4. `impl` — retrieve the exact source of a function or class</p><p>5. `callers` — find everything that calls a given symbol</p><p>6. `grep` — fall back to text search when you need it</p><p>This replaces the glob/grep/read cycle with index-backed lookups. The server currently supports Rust, Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, and Go for symbol parsing, though all file types show up in the tree and are searchable via grep.</p><p>It ships as a Claude Code plugin with hooks that guide the agent to use indexed lookups instead of native file tools, plus a Python CLI wrapper with zero dependencies.</p><p>For anecdotal results, I ran the same prompt against a codebase to \"explore and identify opportunities to clarify the existing structure\".</p><p>Using coderlm, claude was able to generate a plan in about 3 minutes. The coderlm enabled instance found a genuine bug (duplicated code with identical names), orphaned code for cleanup, mismatched naming conventions crossing module boundaries, and overlapping vocabulary. These are all  issues which clearly benefit from the tree-sitter centric approach.</p><p>Using the native tools, claude was able to identify various file clutter in the root of the project, out of date references, and a migration timestamp collision. These findings are more consistent with methodical walks of the filesystem and took about 8 minutes to produce.</p><p>The indexed approach did better at catching semantic issues than native tools and had a key benefit in being faster to resolve.</p><p>I've spent some effort to streamline the installation process, but it isn't turnkey yet. You'll need the rust toolchain to build the server which runs as a separate process. Installing the plugin from a claude marketplace is possible, but the skill isn't being added to your .claude yet so there are some manual steps to just getting to a point where claude could use it.</p><p>Claude continues to demonstrate significant resistance to using CodeRLM in exploration tasks. Typically to use you will need to explicitly direct claude to use it.</p><p>Repo: github.com/JaredStewart/coderlm</p>",

      "content": "<h2>Introducing Showboat and Rodney, so agents can demo what they’ve built</h2><p>A key challenge working with coding agents is having them both test what they’ve built and demonstrate that software to you, their supervisor. This goes beyond automated tests—we need artifacts that show their progress and help us see exactly what the agent-produced software is able to do. I’ve just released two new tools aimed at this problem: <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/showboat\">Showboat</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/rodney\">Rodney</a>.</p><h4>Proving code actually works</h4><p>I recently wrote about how the job of a software engineer isn’t to write code, it’s to . A big part of that is proving to ourselves and to other people that the code we are responsible for behaves as expected.</p><p>This becomes even more important—and challenging—as we embrace coding agents as a core part of our software development process.</p><p>The more code we churn out with agents, the more valuable tools are that reduce the amount of manual QA time we need to spend.</p><p>One of the most interesting things about <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/7/software-factory/\">the StrongDM software factory model</a> is how they ensure that their software is well tested and delivers value despite their policy that “code must not be reviewed by humans”. Part of their solution involves expensive swarms of QA agents running through “scenarios” to exercise their software. It’s fascinating, but I don’t want to spend thousands of dollars on QA robots if I can avoid it!</p><p>I need tools that allow agents to clearly demonstrate their work to me, while minimizing the opportunities for them to cheat about what they’ve done.</p><h4>Showboat: Agents build documents to demo their work</h4><p> is the tool I built to help agents demonstrate their work to me.</p><p>It’s a CLI tool (a Go binary, optionally <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/4/distributing-go-binaries/\">wrapped in Python</a> to make it easier to install) that helps an agent construct a Markdown document demonstrating exactly what their newly developed code can do.</p><p>It’s not designed for humans to run, but here’s how you would run it anyway:</p><div><pre>showboat init demo.md \nshowboat note demo.md \nshowboat  demo.md bash \nshowboat note demo.md \nshowboat image demo.md </pre></div><p>Here’s what the result looks like if you open it up in VS Code and preview the Markdown:</p><p>So a sequence of , ,  and  commands constructs a Markdown document one section at a time, with the output of those  commands automatically added to the document directly following the commands that were run.</p><p>The  command is a little special—it looks for a file path to an image in the output of the command and copies that image to the current folder and references it in the file.</p><p>That’s basically the whole thing! There’s a  command to remove the most recently added section if something goes wrong, a  command to re-run the document and check nothing has changed (I’m not entirely convinced by the design of that one) and a  command that reverse-engineers the CLI commands that were used to create the document.</p><p>It’s pretty simple—just 172 lines of Go.</p><p>I packaged it up with my <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/go-to-wheel\">go-to-wheel</a> tool which means you can run it without even installing it first like this:</p><p>That  command is really important: it’s designed to provide a coding agent with <em>everything it needs to know</em> in order to use the tool. Here’s <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/showboat/blob/main/help.txt\">that help text in full</a>.</p><p>This means you can pop open Claude Code and tell it:</p><blockquote><p><code>Run \"uvx showboat --help\" and then use showboat to create a demo.md document describing the feature you just built</code></p></blockquote><p>And that’s it! The  text acts <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/16/claude-skills/\">a bit like a Skill</a>. Your agent can read the help text and use every feature of Showboat to create a document that demonstrates whatever it is you need demonstrated.</p><p>Here’s a fun trick: if you set Claude off to build a Showboat document you can pop that open in VS Code and watch the preview pane update in real time as the agent runs through the demo. It’s a bit like having your coworker talk you through their latest work in a screensharing session.</p><p>And finally, some examples. Here are documents I had Claude create using Showboat to help demonstrate features I was working on in other projects:</p><p>I’ve now used Showboat often enough that I’ve convinced myself of its utility.</p><p>(I’ve also seen agents cheat! Since the demo file is Markdown the agent will sometimes edit that file directly rather than using Showboat, which could result in command outputs that don’t reflect what actually happened. Here’s <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/showboat/issues/12\">an issue about that</a>.)</p><h4>Rodney: CLI browser automation designed to work with Showboat</h4><p>Many of the projects I work on involve web interfaces. Agents often build entirely new pages for these, and I want to see those represented in the demos.</p><p>Showboat’s image feature was designed to allow agents to capture screenshots as part of their demos, originally using my <a href=\"https://shot-scraper.datasette.io/\">shot-scraper tool</a> or <a href=\"https://www.playwright.dev\">Playwright</a>.</p><p>The Showboat format benefits from CLI utilities. I went looking for good options for managing a multi-turn browser session from a CLI and came up short, so I decided to try building something new.</p><p>Claude Opus 4.6 pointed me to the <a href=\"https://github.com/go-rod/rod\">Rod</a> Go library for interacting with the Chrome DevTools protocol. It’s fantastic—it provides a comprehensive wrapper across basically everything you can do with automated Chrome, all in a self-contained library that compiles to a few MBs.</p><p>All Rod was missing was a CLI.</p><p>I called it Rodney as a nod to the Rod library it builds on and a reference to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Only_Fools_and_Horses\">Only Fools and Horses</a>—and because the package name was available on PyPI.</p><p>You can run Rodney using  or install it like this:</p><p>Here’s a simple example session:</p><div><pre>rodney start \nrodney open https://datasette.io/\nrodney js \nrodney click \nrodney js location.href\nrodney js document.title\nrodney screenshot datasette-for-page.png\nrodney stop</pre></div><p>Here’s what that looks like in the terminal:</p><p>As with Showboat, this tool is not designed to be used by humans! The goal is for coding agents to be able to run  and see everything they need to know to start using the tool. You can see <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/rodney/blob/main/help.txt\">that help output</a> in the GitHub repo.</p><p>Here are three demonstrations of Rodney that I created using Showboat:</p><h4>Test-driven development helps, but we still need manual testing</h4><p>After being a career-long skeptic of the test-first, maximum test coverage school of software development (I like <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2022/Oct/29/the-perfect-commit/#tests\">tests included</a> development instead) I’ve recently come around to test-first processes as a way to force agents to write only the code that’s necessary to solve the problem at hand.</p><p>Many of my Python coding agent sessions start the same way:</p><blockquote><p><code>Run the existing tests with \"uv run pytest\". Build using red/green TDD.</code></p></blockquote><p>Telling the agents how to run the tests doubles as an indicator that tests on this project exist and matter. Agents will read existing tests before writing their own so having a clean test suite with good patterns makes it more likely they’ll write good tests of their own.</p><p>The frontier models all understand that “red/green TDD” means they should write the test first, run it and watch it fail and then write the code to make it pass—it’s a convenient shortcut.</p><p>I find this greatly increases the quality of the code and the likelihood that the agent will produce the right thing with the smallest amount of prompts to guide it.</p><p>But anyone who’s worked with tests will know that just because the automated tests pass doesn’t mean the software actually works! That’s the motivation behind Showboat and Rodney—I never trust any feature until I’ve seen it running with my own eye.</p><p>Before building Showboat I’d often add a “manual” testing step to my agent sessions, something like:</p><blockquote><p><code>Once the tests pass, start a development server and exercise the new feature using curl</code></p></blockquote><p>Both Showboat and Rodney started life as Claude Code for web projects created via the Claude iPhone app. Most of the ongoing feature work for them happened in the same way.</p><p>I’m still a little startled at how much of my coding work I get done on my phone now, but I’d estimate that the majority of code I ship to GitHub these days was written for me by coding agents driven via that iPhone app.</p><p>I initially designed these two tools for use in asynchronous coding agent environments like Claude Code for the web. So far that’s working out really well.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Why is this useful? (1) You don't have to figure out which webhooks you need or write listeners for each one. The library handles all of that. This follows the approach of libraries like dj-stripe in the Django world (<a href=\"https://dj-stripe.dev/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://dj-stripe.dev/</a>). (2) Stripe's API has a 100 rpm rate limit. If you're checking subscription status frequently or building internal tools, you'll hit it. Querying your own Postgres doesn't have this problem. (3) You can give an AI agent read access to the stripe.* schema to debug payment issues—failed charges, refunds, whatever—without handing over Stripe dashboard access. (4) You can join Stripe data with your own tables for custom analytics, LTV calculations, etc.</p><p>It creates a webhook endpoint in your Stripe account to forward webhooks to your backend where a webhook listener stores all the data into a new  schema. You define your plans in TypeScript, run a sync command, and the library takes care of creating Stripe products and prices, handling webhooks, and keeping your database in sync. We also let you backfill your Stripe data for existing accounts.</p><p>It supports pre-paid usage credits, account wallets and usage-based billing. It also lets you generate a pricing table component that you can customize. You can access the user information using the simple API the library provides:</p><pre><code>  billing.subscriptions.get({ userId });\n  billing.credits.consume({ userId, key: \"api_calls\", amount: 1 });\n  billing.usage.record({ userId, key: \"ai_model_tokens_input\", amount: 4726 });\n</code></pre>\nEffectively, you don't have to deal with either the Stripe dashboard or the Stripe API/SDK any more if you don't want to. The library gives you a nice abstraction on top of Stripe that should cover ~most subscription payment use-cases.<p>Let's see how it works with a quick example. Say you have a billing plan like Cursor (the IDE) used to have: $20/mo, you get 500 API completions + 2000 tab completions, you can buy additional API credits, and any additional usage is billed as overage.</p><p>You define your plan in TypeScript:</p><pre><code>  {\n    name: \"Pro\",\n    description: \"Cursor Pro plan\",\n    price: [{ amount: 2000, currency: \"usd\", interval: \"month\" }],\n    features: {\n      api_completion: {\n        pricePerCredit: 1,              // 1 cent per unit\n        trackUsage: true,               // Enable usage billing\n        credits: { allocation: 500 },\n        displayName: \"API Completions\",\n      },\n      tab_completion: {\n        credits: { allocation: 2000 },\n        displayName: \"Tab Completions\",\n      },\n    },\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThen on the CLI, you run the `init` command which creates the DB tables + some API handlers. Run `sync` to sync the plans to your Stripe account and create a webhook endpoint. When a subscription is created, the library automatically grants the 500 API completion credits and 2000 tab completion credits to the user. Renewals and up/downgrades are handled sanely.<p>Consume code would look like this:</p><pre><code>  await billing.credits.consume({\n    userId: user.id,\n    key: \"api_completion\",\n    amount: 1,\n  });\n</code></pre>\nAnd if they want to allow manual top-ups by the user:<pre><code>  await billing.credits.topUp({\n    userId: user.id,\n    key: \"api_completion\",\n    amount: 500,     // buy 500 credits, charges $5.00\n  });\n</code></pre>\nSimilarly, we have APIs for wallets and usage.<p>This would be a lot of work to implement by yourself on top of Stripe. You need to keep track of all of these entitlements in your own DB and deal with renewals, expiry, ad-hoc grants, etc. It's definitely doable, especially with AI coding, but you'll probably end up building something fragile and hard to maintain.</p><p>This is just a high-level overview of what the library is capable of. It also supports seat-level credits, monetary wallets (with micro-cent precision), auto top-ups, robust failure recovery, tax collection, invoices, and an out-of-the-box pricing table.</p><p>I vibe-coded a little toy app for testing: <a href=\"https://snw-test.vercel.app\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://snw-test.vercel.app</a>. There's no validation so feel free to sign up with a dummy email, then subscribe to a plan with a test card: 4242 4242 4242 4242, any future expiry, any 3-digit CVV.</p><p>Feel free to try it out! If you end up using this library, please report any bugs on the repo. If you're having trouble / want to chat, I'm happy to help - my contact is in my HN profile.</p>",

      "content": "<p>AI agents that can run tools on your machine are powerful for knowledge work, but they’re only as useful as the context they have. Rowboat is an open-source, local-first app that turns your work into a living knowledge graph (stored as plain Markdown with backlinks) and uses it to accomplish tasks on your computer.</p><p>For example, you can say \"Build me a deck about our next quarter roadmap.\" Rowboat pulls priorities and commitments from your graph, loads a presentation skill, and exports a PDF.</p><p>(1) A living context graph: Rowboat connects to sources like Gmail and meeting notes like Granola and Fireflies, extracts decisions, commitments, deadlines, and relationships, and writes them locally as linked and editable Markdown files (Obsidian-style), organized around people, projects, and topics. As new conversations happen (including voice memos), related notes update automatically. If a deadline changes in a standup, it links back to the original commitment and updates it.</p><p>(2) A local assistant: On top of that graph, Rowboat includes an agent with local shell access and MCP support, so it can use your existing context to actually do work on your machine. It can act on demand or run scheduled background tasks. Example: “Prep me for my meeting with John and create a short voice brief.” It pulls relevant context from your graph and can generate an audio note via an MCP tool like ElevenLabs.</p><p>Why not just search transcripts? Passing gigabytes of email, docs, and calls directly to an AI agent is slow and lossy. And search only answers the questions you think to ask. A system that accumulates context over time can track decisions, commitments, and relationships across conversations, and surface patterns you didn't know to look for.</p><p>Rowboat is Apache-2.0 licensed, works with any LLM (including local ones), and stores all data locally as Markdown you can read, edit, or delete at any time.</p><p>Our previous startup was acquired by Coinbase, where part of my work involved graph neural networks. We're excited to be working with graph-based systems again. Work memory feels like the missing layer for agents.</p><p>We’d love to hear your thoughts and welcome contributions!</p>",

      "content": "<p>A year ago, we launched Distr here to help software vendors manage customer deployments remotely. We had agents that pulled updates, a hub with a GUI, and a lot of assumptions about what on-prem deployment needed.</p><p>It turned out things get messy when your software is running in places you can't simply SSH into.</p><p>Over the last year, we’ve also helped modernize a lot of home-baked solutions: bash scripts that email when updates fail, Excel sheets nobody trusts to track customer versions, engineers driving to customer sites to fix things in person, debug sessions over email (“can you take a screenshot of the logs and send it to me?”), customers with access to internal AWS or GCP registries because there was no better option, and deployments two major versions behind that nobody wants to touch.</p><p>We waited a year before making our first breaking change, which led to a major SemVer update—but it was eventually necessary. We needed to completely rewrite how we manage customer organizations. In Distr, we differentiate between vendors and customers. A vendor is typically the author of a software / AI application that wants to distribute it to customers. Previously, we had taken a shortcut where every customer was just a single user who owned a deployment. We’ve now introduced customer organizations. Vendors onboard customer organizations onto the platform, and customers own their internal user management, including RBAC. This change obviously broke our API, and although the migration for our cloud customers was smooth, custom solutions built on top of our APIs needed updates.</p><p>Other notable features we’ve implemented since our first launch:</p><p>- An OCI container registry built on an adapted version of <a href=\"https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/</a>, directly embedded into our codebase and served via a separate port from a single Docker image. This allows vendors to distribute Docker images and other OCI artifacts if customers want to self-manage deployments.</p><p>- License Management to restrict which customers can access which applications or artifact versions. Although “license management” is a broadly used term, the main purpose here is to codify contractual agreements between vendors and customers. In its simplest form, this is time-based access to specific software versions, which vendors can now manage with Distr.</p><p>- Container logs and metrics you can actually see without SSH access. Internally, we debated whether to use a time-series database or store all logs in Postgres. Although we had to tinker quite a bit with Postgres indexes, it now runs stably.</p><p>- Secret Management, so database passwords don’t show up in configuration steps or logs.</p><p>Distr is now used by 200+ vendors, including Fortune 500 companies, across on-prem, GovCloud, AWS, and GCP, spanning health tech, fintech, security, and AI companies. We’ve also started working on our first air-gapped environment.</p><p>For Distr 3.0, we’re working on native Terraform / OpenTofu and Zarf support to provision and update infrastructure in customers’ cloud accounts and physical environments—empowering vendors to offer BYOC and air-gapped use cases, all from a single platform.</p><p>We’re YC S24. Happy to answer questions about on-prem deployments and would love to hear about your experience with complex customer deployments.</p>",

      "content": "\n<p>Hi HN — I’m the developer of NetViews, a macOS utility I built because I wanted better visibility into what was actually happening on my wired and wireless networks.<p>I live in the CLI, but for discovery and ongoing monitoring, I kept bouncing between tools, terminals, and mental context switches. I wanted something faster and more visual, without losing technical depth — so I built a GUI that brings my favorite diagnostics together in one place.<p>About three months ago, I shared an early version here and got a ton of great feedback. I listened: a new name (it was PingStalker), a longer trial, and a lot of new features. Today I’m excited to share NetViews 2.3.<p>NetViews started because I wanted to know if something on the network was scanning my machine. Once I had that, I wanted quick access to core details—external IP, Wi-Fi data, and local topology. Then I wanted more: fast, reliable scans using ARP tables and ICMP.<p>As a Wi-Fi engineer, I couldn’t stop there. I kept adding ways to surface what’s actually going on behind the scenes.<p>Discovery & Scanning:\n* ARP, ICMP, mDNS, and DNS discovery to enumerate every device on your subnet (IP, MAC, vendor, open ports).\n* Fast scans using ARP tables first, then ICMP, to avoid the usual “nmap wait”.<p>Wireless Visibility:\n* Detailed Wi-Fi connection performance and signal data.\n* Visual and audible tools to quickly locate the access point you’re associated with.<p>Monitoring & Timelines:\n* Connection and ping timelines over 1, 2, 4, or 8 hours.\n* Continuous “live ping” monitoring to visualize latency spikes, packet loss, and reconnects.<p>Low-level Traffic (but only what matters):\n* Live capture of DHCP, ARP, 802.1X, LLDP/CDP, ICMP, and off-subnet chatter.\n* mDNS decoded into human-readable output (this took months of deep dives).<p>Under the hood, it’s written in Swift. It uses low-level BSD sockets for ICMP and ARP, Apple’s Network framework for interface enumeration, and selectively wraps existing command-line tools where they’re still the best option. The focus has been on speed and low overhead.<p>I’d love feedback from anyone who builds or uses network diagnostic tools:\n- Does this fill a gap you’ve personally hit on macOS?\n- Are there better approaches to scan speed or event visualization that you’ve used?\n- What diagnostics do you still find yourself dropping to the CLI for?<p>Details and screenshots: <a href=\"https://netviews.app\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://netviews.app</a>\nThere’s a free trial and paid licenses; I’m funding development directly rather than ads or subscriptions. Licenses include free upgrades.<p>Happy to answer any technical questions about the implementation, Swift APIs, or macOS permission model.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46955712\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46955712</a></p>\n<p>Points: 242</p>\n<p># Comments: 61</p>\n",

I struggled with it and that led me to Micropolis (the open-sourced SimCity engine) and was able to get it to work by bolting on an API.<p>The weekend hack turned into a headless city simulation platform where anyone can get an API key (no signup) and have their AI agent play mayor. The simulation runs the real Micropolis engine inside Cloudflare Durable Objects, one per city. Every city is public and browsable on the site.<p>LLMs are awful at the spatial stuff, which sort of makes it extra fun as you try to control them when they scatter buildings randomly and struggle with power lines and roads. A little like dealing with a toddler.<p>There's a full REST API and an MCP server, so you can point Claude Code or Cursor at it directly. You can usually get agents building in seconds.<p>Website: <a href=\"https://hallucinatingsplines.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://hallucinatingsplines.com</a><p>API docs: <a href=\"https://hallucinatingsplines.com/docs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://hallucinatingsplines.com/docs</a><p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/andrewedunn/hallucinating-splines\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/andrewedunn/hallucinating-splines</a><p>Future ideas: Let multiple agents play a single city and see how they step all over each other, or a \"conquest mode\" where you can earn points and spawn disasters on other cities.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46946593\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46946593</a></p>\n<p>Points: 213</p>\n<p># Comments: 72</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>I'm launching Wirewiki.com today!<p>Wirewiki makes the internet’s hidden infrastructure browsable.<p>I quit my job 5 years ago to scale Nslookup.io. But after reaching 600k monthly users, I hit a ceiling. I couldn't naturally expand beyond DNS because of the domain name.<p>So I went back to the drawing board: how would I make it today? Not as a collection of tools, but as a browsable graph.<p>I've spent hundreds of hours and commits building that. It's not even at 10% of what I want it to be, but more than enough to be useful, and (in my biased opinion) much better than what's out there.<p>Wirewiki launches with DNS lookup, propagation, zone transfer and SPF checking. It also scans the entire IPv4 space for DNS servers and indexes them.\nI'm working on adding more data and tools.<p>I feel like I've developed tunnel vision, so if you see anything that feels off, let me know!<p>I'll keep Wirewiki open and free. Once it has a substantial amount of users, I'll open it up to sponsorship / brand integration from hosting providers, registrars and CDNs, as users will likely be in the market for those. But my goal is to keep Wirewiki free from display ads. I'm confident that's viable.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46944555\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46944555</a></p>\n<p>Points: 109</p>\n<p># Comments: 21</p>\n",

There's a nice way to filter such that you could easily find \"Young Adult, Ancient, Fantasy\" for example.<p>When downloading from the site, the PDFS are rendered in a work queue. Hopefully the server I'm using won't get overwhelmed. It takes around 10-15 seconds to generate for most books.<p>Most of the books currently on the site are from Standard Ebooks. I plan to add more books from Archive.org and Project Gutenberg over time.<p>I also created a little guide on how you can print and bind books at home with around $200 in equipment. (<a href=\"https://printableclassics.com/print-guide\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://printableclassics.com/print-guide</a>)<p>Printable versions of the Harvard Classics are available here: <a href=\"https://printableclassics.com/harvard_classics\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://printableclassics.com/harvard_classics</a> This is an example of direct PDF conversion.<p>Hopefully this is useful to some people. I plan to use the books here for home education myself so it will at least be useful to me. I'd like to add a guide with top suggestions by age level and some educational theory on how I made the selections. I'm happy to take any feedback on the site or answer any questions.<p>There is also the option to have the books professionally printed through a print on demand provider. I'm hoping that could be a way to pay for the site hosting.<p>Thanks for checking it out!</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46944365\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46944365</a></p>\n<p>Points: 83</p>\n<p># Comments: 32</p>\n",

Well now it's done. The compute run itself took 100s of AMD Turin cores, 100s of GBs of RAM, a few TBs of disk and 2 days of constant runtime on multiple machines.<p>If you are interested in the technical details, Ryan and I have written extensively about the algorithm and pipeline that got us here:<p>* Tom's blog post: <a href=\"https://tombh.co.uk/longest-line-of-sight\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://tombh.co.uk/longest-line-of-sight</a><p>* Ryan's technical breakdown: <a href=\"https://ryan.berge.rs/posts/total-viewshed-algorithm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://ryan.berge.rs/posts/total-viewshed-algorithm</a><p>This was a labor of love and we hope it inspires you both technically and naturally, to get you out seeing some of these vast views for yourselves!<p>1. <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45485227\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45485227</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46943568\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46943568</a></p>\n<p>Points: 407</p>\n<p># Comments: 181</p>\n",

      "url": "https://cinegraphs.ai/",
      "date": 1770552002,
      "author": "graphpilled",
      "guid": 43119,

      "content": "\n<p>Hi HN, I'm a computer systems engineering student in Mexico who switched from film school. I built CineGraphs because my filmmaker friends and I kept hitting the same wall—we'd have a vague idea for a film but no structured way to explore where it could go. Every AI writing tool we tried output generic, formulaic slop. I didn't want to build another ChatGPT wrapper, so I went a different route.<p>The idea is simple: you input a rough concept, and the tool generates branching narrative paths visualized as a graph. You can sculpt those branches into a structured screenplay format and export to Fountain for use in professional screenwriting software.<p>Most AI writing tools are trained on generic internet text, which is why they output generic results. I wanted something that understood actual cinematic storytelling—not plot summaries or Wikipedia synopses, but the actual structural DNA of films. So I spent a month curating 100 films I consider high-quality cinema. Not just popular films, but works with distinctive narrative structures: Godard's jump cuts and essay-film digressions, Kurosawa's parallel character arcs, Brakhage's non-linear visual poetry, Tarkovsky's slow-burn temporal structures. The selection was deliberately eclectic because I wanted the model to learn that \"story\" can mean many things.<p>Getting useful training data from films is harder than it sounds. I built a 1000+ line Python pipeline using Qwen3-VL to analyze each film with subtitles enabled. The pipeline extracts scene-level narrative beats, character relationships and how they evolve, thematic threads, and dialogue patterns. The tricky part was getting Qwen3-VL to understand cinematic structure rather than just summarizing plot. I had to iterate on the prompts extensively to get it to identify things like \"this scene functions as a mirror to the opening\" or \"this character's arc inverts the protagonist's.\" That took weeks and I'm still not fully satisfied with it, but it's good enough to produce useful training data.<p>From those extractions I generated a 10K example dataset of prompt-to-branching-narrative pairs, then fine-tuned Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct with a LoRA optimized for probabilistic story branching. The LoRA handles the graph generation—exploring possible narrative directions—while the full 7B model generates the actual technical screenplay format when you export. I chose the 7B model because I wanted something that could run affordably at scale while still being capable enough for nuanced generation. The whole thing is served on a single 4090 GPU using vLLM. The frontend uses React Flow for the graph visualization. The key insight was that screenwriting is fundamentally about making choices—what if the character goes left instead of right?—but most writing tools force you into a linear document too early. The graph structure lets you explore multiple paths before committing, which matches how writers actually think in early development.<p>The biggest surprise was how much the film selection mattered. Early versions trained on more mainstream films produced much more formulaic outputs. Adding experimental and international cinema dramatically improved the variety and interestingness of the generations. The model seemed to learn that narrative structure is a design space, not a formula.<p>We've been using it ourselves to break through second-act problems—when you know where you want to end up but can't figure out how to get there. The branching format forces you to think in possibilities rather than committing too early.<p>You can try it at <a href=\"https://cinegraphs.ai/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://cinegraphs.ai/</a> — no signup required to test it out. You get a full project with up to 50 branches without registering, though you'll need to create an account to save it. Registered users get 3 free projects. I'd love feedback on whether the generation quality feels meaningfully different from generic AI tools, and whether the graph interface adds value or just friction.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46933515\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46933515</a></p>\n<p>Points: 100</p>\n<p># Comments: 20</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>A month ago, I submitted my app \"DoNotNotify\" to control Android notifications on Show HN [0], and it trended on the front page for a day. I was happy, but the most upvoted comments on the thread were asking for the app to be open sourced, since it dealt with system-wide notifications. My promises weren't good enough, and the community wanted more!<p>Why didn't I open source it in the first place? Linux has been by primary driver for more than a decade. I genuinely believe in the philosophy, and have always wanted to give back to the community. The primary reason, probably, was because I was ashamed that I had 90% vibe-coded the app. More than 2 decades of writing software, and my first contribution to FOSS would be AI-generated code? Would it  withstand even the most minimal of scrutiny? Would by (unknown) name forever be tarnished? I exaggerate, but only slightly :)<p>So, yesterday, after a fair bit of trepidation, I changed the github repo visibility to public and put up a announcement on the app's website [1]. I have also submitted the app to F-Droid [2]. As before, I welcome the community's feedback and suggestions!<p>[0] <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46499646\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46499646</a>\n[1] <a href=\"https://donotnotify.com/opensource.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://donotnotify.com/opensource.html</a>\n[2] <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/fdroid/rfp/-/issues/3569\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://gitlab.com/fdroid/rfp/-/issues/3569</a><p>--\nAnuj Jain</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46932192\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46932192</a></p>\n<p>Points: 406</p>\n<p># Comments: 47</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>Hello everyone!<p>I'm a solo developer who's been doing UI/UX work since 2007. Over the years, I watched design tools evolve from lightweight products into bloated feature-heavy platforms. I kept finding myself using a small amount of the features while the rest just mostly got in the way.<p>So a few years ago I set out to build a design tool just like I wanted. So I built Vecti with what I actually need: pixel-perfect grid snapping, a performant canvas renderer, shared asset libraries, and export/presentation features. No collaborative whiteboarding. No plugin ecosystem. No enterprise features. Just the design loop.<p>Four years later, I can proudly show it off. Built and hosted in the EU with European privacy regulations. Free tier available (no credit card, one editor forever).<p>On privacy: I use some basic analytics (page views, referrers) but zero tracking inside the app itself. No session recordings, no behavior analytics, no third-party scripts beyond the essentials.<p>If you're a solo designer or small team who wants a tool that stays out of your way, I'd genuinely appreciate your feedback:\n<a href=\"https://vecti.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://vecti.com</a><p>Happy to answer questions about the tech stack, architecture decisions, why certain features didn't make the cut, or what's next.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46917033\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46917033</a></p>\n<p>Points: 385</p>\n<p># Comments: 181</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>I'm a software engineer who keeps getting pulled into DevOps no matter how hard I try to escape it. I recently moved into a Lead DevOps Engineer role writing tooling to automate a lot of the pain away. On my own time outside of work, I built Artifact Keeper — a self-hosted artifact registry that supports 45+ package formats. Security scanning, SSO, replication, WASM plugins — it's all in the MIT-licensed release. No enterprise tier. No feature gates. No surprise invoices.<p>Your package managers — pip, npm, docker, cargo, helm, go, all of them — talk directly to it using their native protocols. Security scanning with Trivy, Grype, and OpenSCAP is built in, with a policy engine that can quarantine bad artifacts before they hit your builds. And if you need a format it doesn't support yet, there's a WASM plugin system so you can add your own without forking the backend.<p>Why I built it:<p>Part of what pulled me into computers in the first place was open source. I grew up poor in New Orleans, and the only hardware I had access to in the early 2000s were some Compaq Pentium IIs my dad brought home after his work was tossing them out. I put Linux on them, and it ran circles around Windows 2000 and Millennium on that low-end hardware. That experience taught me that the best software is software that's open for everyone to see, use, and that actually runs well on whatever you've got.<p>Fast forward to today, and I see the same pattern everywhere: GitLab, JFrog, Harbor, and others ship a limited \"community\" edition and then hide the features teams actually need behind some paywall. I get it — paychecks have to come from somewhere. But I wanted to prove that a fully-featured artifact registry could exist as genuinely open-source software. Every feature. No exceptions.<p>The specific features came from real pain points. Artifactory's search is painfully slow — that's why I integrated Meilisearch. Security scanning that doesn't require a separate enterprise license was another big one. And I wanted replication that didn't need a central coordinator — so I built a peer mesh where any node can replicate to any other node. I haven't deployed this at work yet — right now I'm running it at home for my personal projects — but I'd love to see it tested at scale, and that's a big part of why I'm sharing it here.<p>The AI story (I'm going to be honest about this):<p>I built this in about three weeks using Claude Code. I know a lot of you will say this is probably vibe coding garbage — but if that's the case, it's an impressive pile of vibe coding garbage. Go look at the codebase. The backend is ~80% Rust with 429 unit tests, 33 PostgreSQL migrations, a layered architecture, and a full CI/CD pipeline with E2E tests, stress testing, and failure injection.<p>AI didn't make the design decisions for me. I still had to design the WASM plugin system, figure out how the scanning engines complement each other, and architect the mesh replication. Years of domain knowledge drove the design — AI just let me build it way faster. I'm floored at what these tools make possible for a tinkerer and security nerd like me.<p>Tech stack: Rust on Axum, PostgreSQL 16, Meilisearch, Trivy + Grype + OpenSCAP, Wasmtime WASM plugins (hot-reloadable), mesh replication with chunked transfers. Frontend is Next.js 15 plus native Swift (iOS/macOS) and Kotlin (Android) apps. OpenAPI 3.1 spec with auto-generated TypeScript and Rust SDKs.<p>Try it:<p><pre><code>  git clone https://github.com/artifact-keeper/artifact-keeper.git\n  cd artifact-keeper\n  docker compose up -d\n</code></pre>\nThen visit http://localhost:30080<p>Live demo: <a href=\"https://demo.artifactkeeper.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://demo.artifactkeeper.com</a>\nDocs: <a href=\"https://artifactkeeper.com/docs/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://artifactkeeper.com/docs/</a><p>I'd love any feedback — what you think of the approach, what you'd want to see, what you hate about Artifactory or Nexus that you wish someone would just fix. It doesn't have to be a PR. Open an issue, start a discussion, or just tell me here.<p><a href=\"https://github.com/artifact-keeper\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/artifact-keeper</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46909037\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46909037</a></p>\n<p>Points: 166</p>\n<p># Comments: 68</p>\n",

Preferences, decisions, “we already tried X,” “don’t touch this file,” etc. After a few days it starts to feel like onboarding the same coworker every morning.<p>Most “agent memory” tools auto-save everything. That feels good briefly, then memory turns into a junk drawer and retrieval gets noisy. Total Recall takes the opposite approach: a write gate. Before anything gets promoted, it asks one question: “Will this change future behavior?” If not, it doesn’t get saved.<p>How it works:<p>Daily log first (raw notes)<p>Promote durable stuff into registers (decisions, preferences, people, projects)<p>Small working memory loads every session (kept intentionally lean)<p>Hooks fail open. SessionStart can surface open loops + recent context. PreCompact writes to disk (not model-visible stdout)<p>The holy shit moment is simple: tell Claude one important preference or decision once, come back tomorrow, and it behaves correctly without you repeating yourself.<p>Would love feedback from heavy Claude Code users:<p>Does the write gate feel right or too strict?<p>Does this actually reduce repetition over multiple days?<p>Any workflow/privacy footguns I’m missing?</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46907183\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46907183</a></p>\n<p>Points: 61</p>\n<p># Comments: 21</p>\n",

      "url": "https://docs.smooth.sh/cli/overview",

      "content": "\n<p>Hi HN! Smooth CLI (<a href=\"https://www.smooth.sh\">https://www.smooth.sh</a>) is a browser that agents like Claude Code can use to navigate the web reliably, quickly, and affordably. It lets agents specify tasks using natural language, hiding UI complexity, and allowing them to focus on higher-level intents to carry out complex web tasks. It can also use your IP address while running browsers in the cloud, which helps a lot with roadblocks like captchas (<a href=\"https://docs.smooth.sh/features/use-my-ip\">https://docs.smooth.sh/features/use-my-ip</a>).<p>Here’s a demo: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62jthcU705k\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62jthcU705k</a>  Docs start at <a href=\"https://docs.smooth.sh\">https://docs.smooth.sh</a>.<p>Agents like Claude Code, etc are amazing but mostly restrained to the CLI, while a ton of valuable work needs a browser. This is a fundamental limitation to what these agents can do.<p>So far, attempts to add browsers to these agents (Claude’s built-in --chrome, Playwright MCP, agent-browser, etc.) all have interfaces that are unnatural for browsing. They expose hundreds of tools - e.g. click, type, select, etc - and the action space is too complex. (For an example, see the low-level details listed at <a href=\"https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser</a>). Also, they don’t handle the billion edge cases of the internet like iframes nested in iframes nested in shadow-doms and so on. The internet is super messy! Tools that rely on the accessibility tree, in particular, unfortunately do not work for a lot of websites.<p>We believe that these tools are at the wrong level of abstraction: they make the agent focus on UI details instead of the task to be accomplished.<p>Using a giant general-purpose model like Opus to click on buttons and fill out forms ends up being slow and expensive. The context window gets bogged down with details like clicks and keystrokes, and the model has to figure out how to do browser navigation each time. A smaller model in a system specifically designed for browsing can actually do this much better and at a fraction of the cost and latency.<p>Security matters too - probably more than people realize. When you run an agent on the web, you should treat it like an untrusted actor. It should access the web using a sandboxed machine and have minimal permissions by default. Virtual browsers are the perfect environment for that. There’s a good write up by Paul Kinlan that explains this very well (see <a href=\"https://aifoc.us/the-browser-is-the-sandbox\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://aifoc.us/the-browser-is-the-sandbox</a> and <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46762150\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46762150</a>). Browsers were built to interact with untrusted software safely. They’re an isolation boundary that already works.<p>Smooth CLI is a browser designed for agents based on what they’re good at. We expose a higher-level interface to let the agent think in terms of goals and tasks, not low-level details.<p>For example, instead of this:<p><pre><code>  click(x=342, y=128)\n  type(\"search query\")\n  click(x=401, y=130)\n  scroll(down=500)\n  click(x=220, y=340)\n  ...50 more steps\n</code></pre>\nYour agent just says:<p><pre><code>  Search for flights from NYC to LA and find the cheapest option\n</code></pre>\nAgents like Claude Code can use the Smooth CLI to extract hard-to-reach data, fill-in forms, download files, interact with dynamic content, handle authentication, vibe-test apps, and a lot more.<p>Smooth enables agents to launch as many browsers and tasks as they want, autonomously, and on-demand. If the agent is carrying out work on someone’s behalf, the agent’s browser presents itself to the web as a device on the user’s network. The need for this feature may diminish over time, but for now it’s a necessary primitive. To support this, Smooth offers a “self” proxy that creates a secure tunnel and routes all browser traffic through your machine’s IP address (<a href=\"https://docs.smooth.sh/features/use-my-ip\">https://docs.smooth.sh/features/use-my-ip</a>). This is one of our favorite features because it makes the agent look like it’s running on your machine, while keeping all the benefits of running in the cloud.<p>We also take away as much security responsibility from the agent as possible. The agent should not be aware of authentication details or be responsible for handling malicious behavior such as prompt injections. While some security responsibility will always remain with the agent, the browser should minimize this burden as much as possible.<p>We’re biased of course, but in our tests, running Claude with Smooth CLI has been 20x faster and 5x cheaper than Claude Code with the --chrome flag (<a href=\"https://www.smooth.sh/images/comparison.gif\">https://www.smooth.sh/images/comparison.gif</a>). Happy to explain further how we’ve tested this and to answer any questions about it!<p>Instructions to install: <a href=\"https://docs.smooth.sh/cli\">https://docs.smooth.sh/cli</a>. Plans and pricing: <a href=\"https://docs.smooth.sh/pricing\">https://docs.smooth.sh/pricing</a>.<p>It’s free to try, and we'd love to get feedback/ideas if you give it a go :)<p>We’d love to hear what you think, especially if you’ve tried using browsers with AI agents. Happy to answer questions, dig into tradeoffs, or explain any part of the design and implementation!</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46901233\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46901233</a></p>\n<p>Points: 108</p>\n<p># Comments: 72</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>Hi all,<p>I have built <i>Cimba</i>, a multithreaded discrete event simulation library in C.<p>Cimba uses POSIX pthread multithreading for parallel execution of multiple simulation trials, while coroutines provide concurrency inside each simulated trial universe. The simulated processes are based on asymmetric stackful coroutines with the context switching hand-coded in assembly.<p>The stackful coroutines make it natural to express agentic behavior by conceptually placing oneself \"inside\" that process and describing what it does. A process can run in an infinite loop or just act as a one-shot customer passing through the system, yielding and resuming execution from any level of its call stack, acting both as an active agent and a passive object as needed. This is inspired by my own experience programming in Simula67, many moons ago, where I found the coroutines more important than the deservedly famous object-orientation.<p>Cimba turned out to run <i>really</i> fast. In a simple benchmark, 100 trials of an M/M/1 queue run for one million time units each, it ran <i>45 times faster</i> than an equivalent model built in SimPy + Python multiprocessing. The running time was <i>reduced by 97.8 %</i> vs the SimPy model. Cimba even processed more simulated events per second <i>on a single CPU core</i> than SimPy could do on all 64 cores.<p>The speed is not only due to the efficient coroutines. Other parts are also designed for speed, such as a hash-heap event queue (binary heap plus Fibonacci hash map), fast random number generators and distributions, memory pools for frequently used object types, and so on.<p>The initial implementation supports the AMD64/x86-64 architecture for Linux and Windows. I plan to target Apple Silicon next, then probably ARM.<p>I believe this may interest the HN community. I would appreciate your views on both the API and the code. Any thoughts on future target architectures to consider?<p>Docs: <a href=\"https://cimba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://cimba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</a><p>Repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/ambonvik/cimba\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/ambonvik/cimba</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46872818\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46872818</a></p>\n<p>Points: 69</p>\n<p># Comments: 18</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>Hi everyone,<p>I built a runtime to isolate untrusted code using wasm sandboxes.<p>Basically, it protects your host system from problems that untrusted code can cause. We’ve had a great discussion about sandboxing in Python lately that elaborates a bit more on the problem [1]. In TypeScript, wasm integration is even more natural thanks to the close proximity between both ecosystems.<p>The core is built in Rust. On top of that, I use WASI 0.2 via wasmtime and the component model, along with custom SDKs that keep things as idiomatic as possible.<p>For example, in Python we have a simple decorator:<p><pre><code>  from capsule import task\n\n  @task(\n      name=\"analyze_data\", \n      compute=\"MEDIUM\",\n      ram=\"512mb\",\n      allowed_files=[\"./authorized-folder/\"],\n      timeout=\"30s\", \n      max_retries=1\n  )\n  def analyze_data(dataset: list) -> dict:\n      \"\"\"Process data in an isolated, resource-controlled environment.\"\"\"\n      # Your code runs safely in a Wasm sandbox\n      return {\"processed\": len(dataset), \"status\": \"complete\"}\n</code></pre>\nAnd in TypeScript we have a wrapper:<p><pre><code>  import { task } from \"@capsule-run/sdk\"\n\n  export const analyze = task({\n      name: \"analyzeData\", \n      compute: \"MEDIUM\", \n      ram: \"512mb\",\n      allowedFiles: [\"./authorized-folder/\"],\n      timeout: 30000, \n      maxRetries: 1\n  }, (dataset: number[]) => {\n      return {processed: dataset.length, status: \"complete\"}\n  });\n</code></pre>\nYou can set CPU (with compute), memory, filesystem access, and retries to keep precise control over your tasks.<p>It's still quite early, but I'd love feedback. I’ll be around to answer questions.<p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/mavdol/capsule\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/mavdol/capsule</a><p>[1] <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46500510\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46500510</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46871387\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46871387</a></p>\n<p>Points: 76</p>\n<p># Comments: 25</p>\n",
