Only a few forms of communication, such as email, SMS, MMS, and one-to-one live voice calls, are explicitly excluded.</p><p>While political messaging around the vote often described the move as a “social media ban for under-16s,” the actual scope is considerably wider.</p><p>In effect, most interactive online platforms would now need to collect and verify age data from users, even where those services are not primarily aimed at children.</p><p>This represents a major expansion of identity checks across digital infrastructure, once considered neutral or privacy-protective, and one of the most disciplinarian proposals in the West.</p><p>Two key amendments advanced during the Lords debate on January 21.</p><p><a href=\"https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3909/stages/20215/amendments/10027478\">Amendment 92</a> (“Action to Prohibit the Provision of VPN Services to Children in the United Kingdom”) requires VPNs that are “offered or marketed to persons in the United Kingdom” or “provided to a significant number of persons” to implement age assurance for UK users.</p><p>The measure passed by 207 Content votes to 159 Not Content votes.</p><p><a href=\"https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3909/stages/20215/amendments/10031850\">Amendment 94a</a> (“Action to Promote the Wellbeing of Children in Relation to Social Media”) mandates that all regulated user-to-user services introduce age assurance systems to prevent under-16s from “becoming or being users.” This proposal passed with 261 Content votes to 150 Not Content votes.</p><p>Both amendments will proceed to the Bill’s next stage, the third reading in the House of Lords.</p><p>Two other amendments, both more technologically intrusive, were discussed but rejected.</p><p>Amendment 93, introduced by Lord Nash, would have compelled smartphone and tablet manufacturers, distributors, and importers to install “tamper-proof system software which is highly effective at preventing the recording, transmitting (by any means, including livestreaming) and viewing of CSAM using that device.”</p><p>The only plausible way to enforce such a measure would be through constant, automated inspection of every photo, video, and stream on a device. This form of surveillance would have converted personal devices into continuous content monitors, raising severe privacy and accuracy concerns, including potential false positives.</p><p>Lord Nash stated: “On Amendment 93, I have had a constructive discussion with Ministers on this issue and more discussions are in progress, so I will not push that to a vote today.”</p><p>Amendment 108, proposed by Lord Storey, would have required user-to-user services “likely to be accessed by children” to set their own minimum age thresholds and use age assurance to enforce them.</p><p>He argued that a single blanket ban under Amendment 94a was overly rigid. “Having different minimum ages for different platforms would be a better solution,” he said, maintaining that his version would be more effective in practice.</p><p>Neither of these amendments passed, leaving Amendments 92 and 94a as the only ones to advance.</p><p>The discussion highlights a deepening push within UK legislation to merge digital identity checks with online participation.</p><p>While described as safeguarding children, the changes embed a new layer of identity verification across tools once used for privacy, such as VPNs.</p><p>These services, designed to conceal personal browsing data and protect against profiling, would now face obligations to verify who their users are. This is a contradiction that could erode one of the few remaining shields for private internet use.</p><p>For now, the most invasive surveillance measure, client-side scanning, has been set aside. However, the fact that it was seriously considered indicates continuing interest in embedding scanning mechanisms directly into personal devices.</p><p>Whether similar proposals reappear during the third reading remains to be seen.</p>",

      "content": "<p>. Paul Kinlan is a web platform developer advocate at Google and recently turned his attention to coding agents. He quickly identified the importance of a robust sandbox for agents to operate in and put together these detailed notes on how the web browser can help:</p><blockquote><p>This got me thinking about the browser. Over the last 30 years, we have built a sandbox specifically designed to run incredibly hostile, untrusted code from anywhere on the web, the instant a user taps a URL. [...]</p><p>Could you build something like Cowork in the browser? Maybe. To find out, I built a demo called <a href=\"http://co-do.xyz\">Co-do</a> that tests this hypothesis. In this post I want to discuss the research I've done to see how far we can get, and determine if the browser's ability to run untrusted code is useful (and good enough) for enabling software to do more for us directly on our computer.</p></blockquote><p>Paul then describes how the three key aspects of a sandbox - filesystem, network access and safe code execution - can be handled by browser technologies: the <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/capabilities/web-apis/file-system-access\">File System Access API</a> (still Chrome-only as far as I can tell), CSP headers with  and WebAssembly in Web Workers.</p><p>Co-do is a very interesting demo that illustrates all of these ideas in a single application:</p><p>You select a folder full of files and configure an LLM provider and set an API key, Co-do then uses CSP-approved API calls to interact with that provider and provides a chat interface with tools for interacting with those files. It does indeed feel similar to <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/12/claude-cowork/\">Claude Cowork</a> but without running a multi-GB local container to provide the sandbox.</p><p>My biggest complaint about  remains how thinly documented it is, especially across different browsers. Paul's post has all sorts of useful details on that which I've not encountered elsewhere, including a complex <a href=\"https://aifoc.us/the-browser-is-the-sandbox/#the-double-iframe-technique\">double-iframe technique</a> to help apply network rules to the inner of the two frames.</p><p>Thanks to this post I also learned about the <code>&lt;input type=\"file\" webkitdirectory&gt;</code> tag which turns out to work on Firefox, Safari  Chrome and allows a browser read-only access to a full directory of files at once. I had Claude knock up a <a href=\"https://tools.simonwillison.net/webkitdirectory\">webkitdirectory demo</a> to try it out and I'll certainly be using it for projects in the future.</p><div>Posted <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/25/\">25th January 2026</a> at 11:51 pm</div>",

      "content": "<p>Iran’s near-total communications blackout has entered its 16th day, but that’s just a live test.</p><p>Following a repressive crackdown on protests, the government is now building a system that grants web access only to security-vetted elites, while locking 90 million citizens inside an intranet.</p><p>Government spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani confirmed international access <a href=\"https://www.rferl.org/a/iran-internet-shutdown-censorship/33654841.html\">will not be restored</a> until at least late March. Filterwatch, which monitors Iranian internet censorship from Texas, cited government sources, including Mohajerani, saying access will “<a href=\"https://filter.watch/english/2026/01/15/iran-enters-a-new-age-of-digital-isolation-2/\">never return to its previous form</a>.”</p><p>This is what makes Iran’s attempt unique: Other authoritarian states built walls before their populations went online. Iran is trying to seal off a connected economy <a href=\"https://www.crisisgroup.org/stm/middle-east-north-africa/iran-united-states/iran-crisis-time-change-within\">already in freefall</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The system is called Barracks Internet, according to confidential planning documents <a href=\"https://filter.watch/english/2026/01/15/iran-enters-a-new-age-of-digital-isolation-2/\">obtained by Filterwatch</a>. Under this architecture, access to the global web will be granted only through a strict security whitelist.</p><p>“The regime is terrified of one thing: Iranians being heard telling their own truth and having crimes documented,” Mahsa Alimardani, a digital rights researcher at U.S.-based Witness, which trains activists to use video for advocacy, told . “The question becomes: How do we give Iranians an unbreakable voice?”</p><p>The idea of tiered internet access is not new in Iran. Since at least 2013, the regime has quietly issued “white SIM cards,” giving unrestricted global internet access to approximately 16,000 people. The system gained public attention in November 2025 when X’s location feature revealed that certain accounts, including the communications minister, were <a href=\"https://iranwire.com/en/features/146582-iran-internet-ban-the-islamic-republic-filters-for-millions-of-people-not-for-its-own/\">connecting directly from inside</a> Iran, <a href=\"https://iranwire.com/en/features/146582-iran-internet-ban-the-islamic-republic-filters-for-millions-of-people-not-for-its-own/\"></a>despite X being blocked since 2009.</p><p>What is different now is scale and permanence. The current blackout tests infrastructure designed to make two-tier access the default, not a temporary crackdown.</p><p>Only a handful of nations have attempted to wall off their citizens from the global internet. North Korea’s Kwangmyong intranet was built from scratch for a population that never had connectivity. China constructed its Great Firewall over two decades while nurturing domestic alternatives such as WeChat and Alibaba. Iran is attempting to do both in weeks, with no domestic alternatives.</p><figure><blockquote><p>The question becomes: How do we give Iranians an unbreakable voice?”</p></blockquote></figure><p>The economic costs of the blackout are staggering. Iran’s deputy communications minister <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/internet-shutdown-squeezes-irans-ailing-businesses-hurt-crashing-129374950\">pegged the daily losses</a> at as much as $4.3 million. <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/internet-shutdown-squeezes-irans-ailing-businesses-hurt-crashing-129374950\">NetBlocks estimates</a> the true cost exceeds $37 million daily. More than 10 million Iranians depend directly on digital platforms for their livelihoods.</p><p>Tipax, one of Iran’s largest private delivery companies handling about 320,000 daily shipments before the protests, now processes fewer than a few hundred, <a href=\"https://filter.watch/english/2026/01/15/iran-enters-a-new-age-of-digital-isolation-2/\">according to Filterwatch</a>. The company operates a nationwide logistics network comparable to FedEx in the U.S. market.</p><p>The government <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260118-live-iran-nationwide-protests-official\">fired Irancell’s CEO</a> for failing to comply with shutdown orders. Irancell, the country’s second-largest mobile operator with 66 million subscribers, is partly owned by South Africa’s MTN Group. Alireza Rafiei was removed for disobeying orders on “restriction of internet access in crisis situations,” <a href=\"https://www.newarab.com/news/iranian-mobile-operator-ceo-fired-not-cutting-internet\">according to</a> Fars news agency.</p><p>Foreign telecom partners have left Iran in recent days under security escort, without media coverage, <a href=\"https://filter.watch/english/2026/01/15/iran-enters-a-new-age-of-digital-isolation-2/\">according to Filterwatch</a>. This may signal the end of international cooperation in critical infrastructure, replaced by the Revolutionary Guard’s construction arm or limited cooperation with Huawei.</p><p>Technical experts doubt the regime can sustain Barracks Internet without crippling the economy. Georgia Tech’s Internet Intelligence Lab, which has <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/irans-latest-internet-blackout-extends-to-phones-and-starlink-273439\">tracked Iran’s shutdowns since the Arab Spring</a>, called the blackout “the most sophisticated and most severe in Iran’s history.” Its measurements show about 3% connectivity persists, likely government officials and state services.</p><figure><blockquote><p>We need to revolutionize access to the internet.”</p></blockquote></figure><p>Kaveh Ranjbar, former chief technology officer at RIPE NCC, the body managing European internet infrastructure, calls the plan a “digital airlock” that can’t fully seal a modern economy. No country has hermetically sealed a functioning digital economy, he <a href=\"https://www.newarab.com/analysis/iran-determined-turn-its-digital-space-north-korea-20\">told </a>.</p><p>Activists have smuggled an estimated 50,000 Starlink satellite terminals into Iran since 2022, when the Biden <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/technology/395656/starlink-iran-internet-shutdown-elon-musk\">administration exempted the service</a> from sanctions. SpaceX has made the service free for Iranian users.&nbsp;</p><p>The government claims it cut off 40,000 Starlink connections and jammed some terminals during the blackout, though others remain operational after firmware updates to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/persian/articles/cj3dn49d489o\">bypass government blocking</a>. Still, the technology remains <a href=\"https://restofworld.org/2026/iran-starlink-internet-shutdown/\">vulnerable to signal jamming</a>, meaning the regime holds ultimate leverage.</p><p>“We need to revolutionize access to the internet,” said Alimardani. “And move beyond the limiting structures and norms of ‘internet sovereignty.’”</p>",

Now, scientists have linked a specific set of brain waves in a certain part of the brain to a sense of body ownership.</p><p>In a series of new experiments, researchers from Sweden and France put 106 participants through what's called the <a href=\"https://www.sciencealert.com/a-classic-fake-hand-illusion-that-tricks-the-brain-could-be-used-to-treat-ocd\">rubber hand illusion</a>, monitoring and stimulating their brain activity to see what effect it had.</p><p>This classic illusion involves hiding one of a participant's hands from their view and replacing it with a rubber one instead. When both their real and fake hands are repeatedly touched at the same time, it can evoke the eerie sensation that the rubber hand is part of the person's body.</p><p>\"We have identified a fundamental brain process that shapes our continuous experience of being embodied,\" <a href=\"https://news.ki.se/how-brain-waves-shape-our-sense-of-self\">says</a> lead author Mariano D'Angelo, a neuroscientist at Karolinska Institute in Sweden.</p><p>\"The findings may provide new insights into psychiatric conditions such as  <a href=\"https://www.sciencealert.com/schizophrenia\" data-linkid=\"73022\" data-postid=\"189533\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_self\">schizophrenia</a>, where the sense of self is disturbed.\"</p><p>In the first batch of experiments, participants had a robotic arm tap the index finger of their real and fake hands, either at the exact same time or with a delay of up to 500 milliseconds between each tap.</p><p>As expected, participants reported feeling that the fake hand was part of their body more strongly if the taps were synchronized, and the feeling steadily weakened as the gap widened between what they felt and what they saw.</p><p>The EEG readings from the second experiment added more detail to the story. The frequency of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_wave\">alpha waves</a> in the parietal cortex seemed to correlate with how well participants could detect the time delay between taps.</p><p>Those with faster alpha waves appeared to rule out fake hands even with a tiny gap in taps, while those with slower waves were more likely to feel the fake hand as their own, even if the taps were farther apart.</p><p>Finally, the researchers investigated whether the frequency of these brain waves actually controls the sensation of body ownership, or if they were perhaps both effects of some other factor.</p><p>With a third group of participants, they used a non-invasive technique called<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00317\"> transcranial alternating current stimulation</a> to speed up or slow down the frequency of a person's alpha waves. And sure enough, this seemed to correlate with how real a fake hand felt.</p><p>Speeding up someone's alpha waves gave them a tighter sense of body ownership, making them more sensitive to small timing discrepancies. Slowing down the waves had the opposite effect, making it harder for people to tell the difference between their own body and the outside world.</p><p>\"Our findings help explain how the brain solves the challenge of integrating signals from the body to create a coherent sense of self,\" <a href=\"https://news.ki.se/how-brain-waves-shape-our-sense-of-self\">says</a> Henrik Ehrsson, neuroscientist at Karolinska.</p><p>The researchers say that the findings could lead to new understanding of or treatments for conditions where the brain's body maps have gone askew, such as <a href=\"https://www.sciencealert.com/50-year-old-theory-on-schizophrenias-voices-confirmed-by-recent-study\">schizophrenia</a> or the sensation of '<a href=\"https://www.sciencealert.com/phantom-limbs-may-not-be-what-we-thought-surprising-study-finds\">phantom limbs</a>' experienced by amputees.</p>",

The African-American abolitionist Sojourner Truth, the suffrage campaigner Susan B Anthony, the Indian independence activist Mahatma Gandhi and the US civil rights campaigner Martin Luther King have all convincingly argued for the power of peaceful protest.</p><p>Yet Chenoweth admits that when she first began her research in the mid-2000s, she was initially rather cynical of the idea that nonviolent actions could be more powerful than armed conflict in most situations. As a PhD student at the University of Colorado, she had spent years <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://search.proquest.com/docview/304889579\">studying the factors contributing to the rise of terrorism</a> when she was asked to attend an academic workshop organised by the International Center of Nonviolent Conflict (ICNC), a non-profit organisation based in Washington DC. The workshop presented many compelling examples of peaceful protests bringing about lasting political change – including, for instance, the People Power protests in the Philippines.</p><p>But Chenoweth was surprised to find that no-one had comprehensively compared the success rates of nonviolent versus violent protests; perhaps the case studies were simply chosen through some kind of confirmation bias. “I was really motivated by some scepticism that nonviolent resistance could be an effective method for achieving major transformations in society,” she says</p><p>Working with Maria Stephan, a researcher at the ICNC, Chenoweth performed an extensive review of the literature on civil resistance and social movements from 1900 to 2006 – a data set then corroborated with other experts in the field. They primarily considered attempts to bring about regime change. A movement was considered a success if it fully achieved its goals both within a year of its peak engagement and as a direct result of its activities. A regime change resulting from foreign military intervention would not be considered a success, for instance. A campaign was considered violent, meanwhile, if it involved bombings, kidnappings, the destruction of infrastructure – or any other physical harm to people or property.</p><p>“We were trying to apply a pretty hard test to nonviolent resistance as a strategy,” Chenoweth says. (The criteria were so strict that India’s independence movement was not considered as evidence in favour of nonviolent protest in Chenoweth and Stephan’s analysis – since Britain’s dwindling military resources were considered to have been a deciding factor, even if the protests themselves were also a huge influence.)</p>",

For one thing, there were too many elements of classical fascism that didn’t seem to fit. For another, the term has been overused to the point of meaninglessness, especially by left-leaning types who call you a fascist if you oppose abortion or affirmative action. For yet another, the term is hazily defined, even by its adherents. From the beginning, fascism has been an incoherent doctrine, and even today scholars can’t agree on its <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://scholarworks.lib.csusb.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1160&amp;context=history-in-the-making\">definition</a>. Italy’s original version differed from Germany’s, which differed from Spain’s, which differed from Japan’s.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">I accepted President Biden’s characterization of the MAGA movement as “<a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DumazY3IEHE\">semi-fascist</a>” because some parallels were glaringly apparent. Trump was definitely an authoritarian, and unquestionably a <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/02/corruption-trump-administration/681794/\">patrimonialist</a>. Beyond that, though, the best description seemed to be a psychological one <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/trumps-stunning-ignorance-with-john\">propounded by John Bolton</a>, Trump’s first-term national security adviser: “He listens to Putin, he listens to Xi, he listens to how they talk about governing unburdened by uncooperative legislatures, unconcerned with what the judiciary may do, and he thinks to himself,  This doesn’t amount to being a fascist, in my view, [or] having a theory of how you want to govern. It’s just <i>Why can’t I have the same fun they have?</i>”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Writing a <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/02/corruption-trump-administration/681794/\">year ago</a>, I argued that Trump’s governing regime is a version of patrimonialism, in which the state is treated as the personal property and family business of the leader. That is still true. But, as I also noted then, patrimonialism is a  of governing, not a formal ideology or system. It can be layered atop all kinds of organizational structures, including not just national governments but also urban political machines such as Tammany Hall, criminal gangs such as the Mafia, and even religious cults. Because its only firm principle is personal loyalty to the boss, it has no specific agenda. Fascism, in contrast, is ideological, aggressive, and, at least in its early stages, revolutionary. It seeks to dominate politics, to crush resistance, and to rewrite the social contract.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Over Trump’s past year, what originally looked like an effort to make the government his personal plaything has drifted distinctly toward doctrinal and operational fascism. Trump’s appetite for lebensraum, his claim of unlimited power, his support for the global far right, his politicization of the justice system, his deployment of performative brutality, his ostentatious violation of rights, his creation of a national paramilitary police—all of those developments bespeak something more purposeful and sinister than run-of-the-mill greed or gangsterism.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\" data-flatplan-dropcap=\"true\">W, I change my mind. Recent events have brought Trump’s governing style into sharper focus.  best describes it, and reluctance to use the term has now become perverse. That is not because of any one or two things he and his administration have done but because of the totality. Fascism is not a territory with clearly marked boundaries but a constellation of characteristics. When you view the stars together, the constellation plainly appears.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">. From the beginning of his first presidential run in 2015, Trump deliberately crashed through every boundary of civility; he <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/trump-tweet-attack-john-mccain-229612\">mocked Senator John McCain’s war heroism</a>, <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2015/09/10/trump-fiorina-look-face/71992454/\">mocked fellow candidate Carly Fiorina’s face</a>, seemingly <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2015/08/08/politics/donald-trump-cnn-megyn-kelly-comment\">mocked</a> the Fox News host Megyn Kelly’s menstruation, <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-37230916\">slurred immigrants</a>, and much more. Today he still does it, recently making an <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/mUt5IeGco5s\">obscene gesture</a> to a factory worker and calling a journalist “<a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUO0-y_OJzA\">piggy</a>.” This is a feature of the fascist governing style, not a bug. Fascists know that what the American Founders called the “republican virtues” impede their political agenda, and so they gleefully trash liberal pieties such as reason and reasonableness, civility and civic spirit, toleration and forbearance. By mocking decency and saying the unsayable, they open the way for what William Galston <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300282290/anger-fear-domination/\">has called</a> the “dark passions” of fear, resentment, and especially domination—the kind of politics that shifts the public discourse to ground on which liberals cannot compete.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">. Also characteristic of fascism is what George Orwell called “<a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.lehman.edu/faculty/rcarey/BRSQ/06may.orwell.htm\">bully-worship</a>”: the principle that, as Thucydides famously <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/History_of_the_Peloponnesian_War_Done_In/_XwJAQAAIAAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=the+strong+do+what+they+can+and+the+weak+suffer+what+they+must&amp;pg=PA394&amp;printsec=frontcover\">put it</a>, “the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must.” This view came across in Trump’s notorious <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pxbGjvcdyY\">Oval Office meeting</a> with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump showed open contempt for what he regarded as Ukraine’s weakness; it came across explicitly, and chillingly, when Stephen Miller, the president’s most powerful aide, <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/05/politics/video/senior-white-house-aide-stephen-miller-says-us-military-threat-to-maintain-control-of-venezuela-digvid\">told CNN’s Jack Tapper</a>: “We live in a world, in the real world, that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power. These are the iron laws of the world that have existed since the beginning of time.” Those words, though alien to the traditions of American and Christian morality, could have come from the lips of any fascist dictator.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"><i>Politicized law enforcement</i>. Liberals follow the law whether they like it or not; fascists, only when they like it. Nazism featured a “<a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2025/05/trump-executive-order-lawlessness-constitutional-crisis/682112/\">dual state</a>,” where, at any moment, the protections of ordinary law could cease to apply. Trump makes no secret of despising due process of law; he has demanded countless times that his opponents be <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Z36Lqx-weFk\">jailed</a> (“Lock her up!” chants, with <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/02/politics/fact-check-trump-false-claim-lock-up-hillary-clinton\">his endorsement</a>, were a prominent feature of his 2016 campaign), and he has suggested the Constitution’s “<a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://archive.ph/u0vZk\">termination</a>” and said “<a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trump-asked-uphold-constitution-says-dont-know-rcna204580\">I don’t know</a>” when asked if he is required to uphold it. His single most dangerous second-term innovation is the repurposing of federal law enforcement to persecute his enemies (and shield <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/doj-ended-probe-border-czar-tom-homan-allegedly/story?id=125781386\">his friends</a>). No prior president has produced anything like Trump’s <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/09/donald-trump-retribution-miles-taylor-00007512\">direct and public order</a> for the Justice Department to investigate two former officials, or like his <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/10/trump-doj-prosecutions-comey-james-00601838\">blatantly retaliatory prosecutions</a> of James Comey and Letitia James. “At least 470 people, organizations and institutions have been targeted for retribution since Trump took office—an average of more than one a day,” <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-retribution-tracker/\">Reuters reported</a> in November (and today one can add others to the list, beginning with Federal Reserve Chair <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://protectdemocracy.org/work/retaliatory-action-tracker/\">Jerome Powell</a>). Had Trump done nothing else, his <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.thejusticeconnection.org/doj-tracker/\">demolition</a> of independent and apolitical law enforcement would still have moved the U.S. government closer than ever before to a fascistic model.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">. Fascism draws its legitimacy from its claims of defending the people from enemies who are animals, criminals, brutes. Trump characterizes (for instance) political opponents as “<a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/11/17/1213746885/trump-vermin-hitler-immigration-authoritarian-republican-primary\">vermin</a>” and immigrants as “<a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-describes-somali-immigrants-garbage-amid-feud-minnesota/story?id=128069199\">garbage</a>” who are “<a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/dec/16/trump-immigrants-new-hampshire-rally\">poisoning the blood of our country</a>” (language straight out of the Third Reich). Vice President Vance, as a senator, endorsed a book called <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://buildersmovement.org/2024/08/14/vance-endorses-book-dehumanizing-unhumans-language/\"></a> (a title that refers to the left). And who can forget his false claim that Haitians abduct and eat pet cats and dogs?</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">. Trump has turned ICE into a sprawling paramilitary that roves the country at will, searches and detains noncitizens and <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/us-citizen-ice-removed-minnesota-home-underwear-after-129372047\">citizens</a> without warrants, uses force ostentatiously, operates behind masks, receives <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/01/ice-new-hires-training-minneapolis-shooting/685745/\">skimpy training</a>, <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.axios.com/local/chicago/2025/12/08/dhs-claims-contradicted-video-court\">lies</a> about its activities, and has been told that it enjoys “<a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/08/politics/ice-immunity-jd-vance-minneapolis\">absolute immunity</a>.” He more than <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.govexec.com/workforce/2026/01/ice-more-doubled-its-workforce-2025/410461/\">doubled the agency’s size</a> in 2025, and its budget is now larger than those of all other federal law-enforcement agencies <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/jul/11/jon-favreau/ICE-FBI-bill-Donald-Trump-largest/\">combined</a>, and larger than the entire military budgets of all but <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/immigration-ice-bill-trump-2093456\">15 countries</a>. “This is going to affect every community, every city,” the Cato Institute scholar <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xf9TPSTiPPw\">David Bier recently observed.</a> “Really almost everyone in our country is going to come in contact with this, one way or the other.” In Minneapolis and elsewhere, the agency has behaved provocatively, sometimes <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.scrippsnews.com/politics/immigration/organized-brutality-minnesota-gov-tim-walz-condemns-ices-immigration-crackdown\">brutally</a>, and arguably <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/immigration-dhs-american-citizens-arrested-detained-against-will\">illegally</a>—behaviors that Trump and his staff have encouraged, shielded, and <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2025/ice-social-media-blitz/\">sent camera crews to publicize</a>, perhaps in the hope of eliciting violent resistance that would justify further crackdowns, a standard fascist stratagem. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s recent appearance with a <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.snopes.com/news/2026/01/14/one-of-ours-all-of-yours-noem-podium/\">sign</a> reading  seemed to nod toward another fascist standby, collective punishment—as did the administration’s decision to flood Minneapolis with thousands of officers after residents there began protesting federal tactics, a prioritization that was <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.minnpost.com/glean/2026/01/trump-promises-day-of-reckoning-and-retribution-to-minnesota-democrats-ice-lawsuit-somali-tps/\">explicitly retributive</a>.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">. Trump’s recent musing that there should be no 2026 election may or may not have been <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2026/01/15/trump-suggests-us-shouldnt-even-have-november-midterms/\">jocular</a> (as the White House has maintained), but he and his MAGA supporters believe they never lose an election, period. They went to great lengths to overturn the 2020 election, as the prosecutor Jack Smith’s <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.justice.gov/storage/US_v_Trump_23_cr_257.pdf\">indictment</a> of Trump and subsequent <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://electionlawblog.org/wp-content/uploads/report-of-special-counsel-smith-volume-1-january-2025.pdf\">report</a> detail ad nauseam. Rigging, stealing, or outright canceling elections is, of course, job one for fascists. Although Trump is term-limited, we must not expect that he and his MAGA loyalists will voluntarily turn over the White House to a Democrat in 2029, regardless of what the voters say—and the second insurrection will be far better organized than the first.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">. Classical fascism rejects the fundamental liberal distinction between the government and the private sector, per Mussolini’s <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://sjsu.edu/faculty/wooda/2B-HUM/Readings/The-Doctrine-of-Fascism.pdf\">dictum</a>: “No individuals or groups outside the State.” Among Trump’s most audacious (if only intermittently successful) initiatives are his efforts to commandeer private entities, including <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/the-law-firms--deals-with-trump-are-even-riskier-than-they-seem\">law firms</a>, <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/04/trump-upended-the-us-education-system-in-2025-its-only-the-beginning-00693857?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAc3J0YwZhcHBfaWQKNjYyODU2ODM3OQABHvHc6vF057rLHe7YD2GdFTrIm_3DZWr7ooW_NGa2LQHbKseDeUEDgCtGrJqe_aem_M1RpaU71auaYV2P8wosz7w\">universities</a>, and <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/24/trump-us-steel-nippon-golden-share.html\">corporations</a>. One of his first acts as president last year was to brazenly defy a newly enacted law by taking the ownership of TikTok into <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://bhr.stern.nyu.edu/quick-take/trump-is-defying-the-law-to-keep-tiktok-alive/\">his own hands</a>. Bolton understood this mentality when he said, “He can’t tell the difference between his own personal interest and the national interest, if he even understands what the national interest is.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"><i>Territorial and military aggression</i>. One reason I held out against identifying Trumpism with fascism in his first term was Trump’s apparent lack of interest in aggression against other states; if anything, he had seemed shy about using force abroad. Well, that was then. In his second term, he has used military force <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/4399869/trump-bombed-as-many-countries-2025-as-entire-first-term/\">promiscuously</a>. Of course, many presidents have deployed force, but Trump’s explicitly predatory use of it to <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/20/world/venezuela-oil-trump-greenland-davos.html\">grab Venezuela’s oil</a> and his gangster-style threat to take Greenland from Denmark <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/10/politics/us-will-take-greenland-the-hard-way-if-it-cant-do-it-the-easy-way-trump-says\">“the easy way” or “the hard way</a>” were 1930s-style authoritarian moves. The same goes for his contempt for international law, binding alliances, and transnational organizations such as the European Union—all of which impede the state’s unconstrained exercise of its will, a central fascist tenet. (<a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://sjsu.edu/faculty/wooda/2B-HUM/Readings/The-Doctrine-of-Fascism.pdf\">Mussolini</a>: “Equally foreign to the spirit of Fascism … are all internationalistic or League superstructures which, as history shows, crumble to the ground whenever the heart of nations is deeply stirred by sentimental, idealistic or practical considerations.”)</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">. Like <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Autocracy-Inc-Dictators-Want-World/dp/0385549938\">authoritarians generally</a>, fascists love company; the world is safer for them if there are more of them. In his second term, Trump has broken with long-standing U.S. policy by <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/04/18/nx-s1-5357511/state-department-human-rights-report-cuts\">dialing back</a> support for human rights while praising and supporting authoritarian populists and illiberal nationalists in <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/donald-trump-jr-visits-serbia-meets-president-aleksandar-vucic-2025-03-11/\">Serbia</a>, <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/06/01/polish-election-nationalist-right/\">Poland</a>, <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-wishes-best-luck-hungarys-orban-election-campaign-2026-01-09/\">Hungary</a>, <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/14/jd-vance-alice-weidel-meeting-germany-far-right\">Germany</a>, <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/article/a-green-light-for-authoritarianism-how-the-trump-administration-fuels-global-autocracy/\">Turkey</a>, <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://english.elpais.com/international/2025-08-07/trump-administration-backs-bukeles-indefinite-reelection-we-reject-comparisons-with-dictatorial-regimes.html\">El Salvador</a>, and <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/us-donald-trump-invite-populist-slovak-leader-fico-fifa-world-cup-letter/\">Slovakia</a>, among other places—and by being <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdSaLbOJwTo\">weirdly deferential</a> to the strongman Russian President Vladimir Putin. Even more striking is his de facto alignment against America’s liberal allies and their parties in Europe, which he holds in <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/09/trump-dasha-burns-interview-europe-immigration-ukraine-00682016\">contempt</a>.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"><i>Blood-and-soil nationalism</i>. A fascist trademark is its insistence that the country is not just a collection of individuals but a people, a : a mystically defined and ethnically pure group bound together by shared blood, culture, and destiny. In keeping with that idea, Trump has <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-the-meaning-and-value-of-american-citizenship/\">repudiated birthright citizenship</a>, and Vance has <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://singjupost.com/transcript-jd-vances-speech-at-the-claremont-institutes-statesmanship-award-event/\">called to</a> “redefine the meaning of American citizenship in the 21st century” so that priority goes to Americans with longer historical ties: “the people whose ancestors fought in the Civil War,” as he put it, or people whom others on the MAGA right call “<a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.persuasion.community/p/its-not-my-heritage-that-makes-me?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=61579&amp;post_id=184794121&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=false&amp;r=i5o9&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email\">heritage Americans</a>.” In other words, some Americans are more volkish than others.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"><i>White and Christian nationalism</i>. While Vance, Trump, and MAGA do not propound an explicit ideology of racial hierarchy, they make no secret of pining for a whiter, more Christian America. Trump has found many ways to communicate this: for example, by making clear his disdain for <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2025/12/trump-confirms-his-disparaging-remark-about-shithole-countries-at-immigration-meeting/\">“shithole” countries</a> and his preference for white Christian immigrants; by pointedly accepting white South Africans as political <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://za.usembassy.gov/refugee-admissions-program-for-south-africans/\">refugees</a> (while closing the door to most other asylum seekers); by <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/03/nx-s1-5454720/trumps-reversal-of-army-base-names-shines-light-on-militarys-segregationist-past\">renaming military bases</a> to share the names of Confederate generals (after Congress ordered their names removed); by saying that civil-rights laws led to whites’ being “very badly treated.” In his National Security Strategy, he castigates Europe for allowing immigration to undermine “civilizational self-confidence” and proclaims, “We want Europe to remain European,” a rallying cry of white Christian nationalists across the continent. Taking his cue, the Department of Homeland Security has propagated unashamedly <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/trump-administration-posts-echo-rhetoric-linked-to-extremist-groups\">white-nationalist</a> themes, and <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.anpr.org/release/2025/0923\">national parks</a> and <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://apnews.com/article/slavery-exhibit-removed-philadelphia-trump-executive-order-dd764277133f47ec1173e8dc16703958\">museums</a> have scrubbed their exhibits of references to slavery.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">. The use of militias and mobs to harass, rough up, and otherwise intimidate opponents is a standard fascist stratagem (the textbook example being Hitler’s Kristallnachtpogrom in 1938). As few will need reminding, the Trump-MAGA parallel is the mob and militia violence against the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021. Trump knowingly laid groundwork for this operation, calling on militia forces to “<a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-race-and-ethnicity-donald-trump-chris-wallace-0b32339da25fbc9e8b7c7c7066a1db0f\">stand back and stand by</a>” in September 2020 and later dog-whistling “<a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/07/13/1111341161/how-trumps-will-be-wild-tweet-drew-rioters-to-the-capitol-on-jan-6\">Be there, will be wild!</a>” to his supporters. His pardon of all of the Capitol attackers—<a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/05/us/politics/trump-jan-6-pardons-rioters.html\">more than 1,500</a>, including the most violent—only proved what we knew, which is that they had his blessing. While Trump has found state violence adequate to his purposes so far in his second term, street violence is self-evidently in his repertoire.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">. Since 2016, when he declared that “<a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.politico.com/video/2020/08/20/trump-at-2016-rnc-i-alone-can-fix-it-085403\">I alone can fix it</a>” and bragged that his supporters would remain loyal if he shot someone <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/09/us/evangelicals-trump-christianity.html\">on Fifth Avenue</a>, Trump has cultivated a personality cult. Although some of his efforts at self-aggrandizement can seem comical (the gilding of the Oval Office, the renaming of the Kennedy Center, the proposed triumphal arch), he understands the centrality of leader worship in a fascist-style regime. In sharp contradistinction to the American presidential tradition since George Washington, he makes no pretense of serving the people or the Constitution. His mindset, his symbolism, and his rhetoric all underscore the point he made to <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/08/briefing/trump-interview-oval-office-apple-ceo.html\">this month</a>: his own mind and morality are the only limits on his global power. This is Fascism 101.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">. As <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://bookshop.org/p/books/1984-75th-anniversary-george-orwell/aef4adf3bb37311b?ean=9780451524935&amp;next=t\">Orwell</a>, <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-origins-of-totalitarianism-with-a-new-introduction-by-anne-applebaum-anne-applebaum/a2326e15ca8f90fc?ean=9780063354487&amp;next=t\">Hannah Arendt</a>, and practically every other scholar of authoritarianism have emphasized, creating a reality-distortion field is the first thing a fascistic government will do, the better to drive its own twisted narrative, confuse the citizenry, demoralize political opponents, and justify every manner of corruption and abuse. While other presidents (including some <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://theweek.com/articles/447245/today-history-president-lies\">good ones</a>) have lied, none have come close to Trump’s deployment of Russian-style mass disinformation, as I detail in my book <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/book/the-constitution-of-knowledge/\"><i>The Constitution of Knowledge</i></a>. From the start of his first term, Trump has made “<a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/22/politics/kellyanne-conway-alternative-facts\">alternative facts</a>” a hallmark of his governing style, issuing lies, exaggerations, and half-truths at a rate of <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-fact-checker-tracked-trump-claims/2021/01/23/ad04b69a-5c1d-11eb-a976-bad6431e03e2_story.html\">20 a day</a>. Predictably, his second term has brought <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/business/trump-misinformation-false-claims.html\">more</a> of the <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/23/us/politics/trump-alternative-reality.html?unlocked_article_code=1.zE4.dM37.lKwB_tcaCnbp\">same</a>. Following his lead, a MAGA-fied <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.persuasion.community/p/the-woke-right-stands-at-the-door\">postmodern right</a> gleefully trashes objectivity as elitism and truth as a mask for power.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">. A distinctive mark of fascism is its conception of politics, best captured by <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/schmitt/\">Carl Schmitt</a>, an early-20th-century German political theorist whose doctrines legitimized Nazism. Schmitt rejected the Madisonian view of politics as a social negotiation in which different factions, interests, and ideology come to agreement, the <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/rescuing-compromise\">core idea</a> of our Constitution. Rather, he saw politics as a state of war between enemies, neither of which can understand the other and both of which feel existentially threatened—and only one of which can win. The aim of Schmittian politics is not to share the country but to dominate or destroy the other side. This conception has been evident in MAGA politics since Michael Anton (now a Trump-administration official) published his <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://claremontreviewofbooks.com/digital/the-flight-93-election/\">famous article</a> arguing that the 2016 election was a life-and-death battle to save the country from the left (a “Flight 93” election: “charge the cockpit or you die”). In the <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://halenallison.medium.com/a-storm-of-fire-and-brimstone-stephen-millers-charlie-kirk-memorial-speech-21-september-2025-77a39d16f0ac\">speech</a> given by Stephen Miller at Charlie Kirk’s memorial service, MAGA’s embrace of Schmittian totalism found its apotheosis: “We are the storm. And our enemies cannot comprehend our strength, our determination, our resolve, our passion … You are nothing. You are wickedness.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">. Although born in revolution, the American liberal tradition, especially its conservative branch, prizes continuity, stability, and incremental change guided by reason. Fascism, by contrast, “is not reactionary but revolutionary,” as Mussolini <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://sjsu.edu/faculty/wooda/2B-HUM/Readings/The-Doctrine-of-Fascism.pdf\">insisted</a>. It seeks to uproot and replace the old order and embraces bold, exhilarating action unshackled to rational deliberation. MAGA embraces its own revolutionary ethos, what Russell Vought, the administration’s Office of Management and Budget director and probably its most formidable intellect, has called “radical constitutionalism,” a doctrine that would <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.aei.org/op-eds/the-trump-executive-orders-as-radical-constitutionalism/\">vitiate many checks on presidential power</a>. In pursuit of this vision, Vought told Tucker Carlson in a <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vydAb4RR1iI\">November 2024 interview</a>, “The president has to move executively as fast and as aggressively as possible, with a radical constitutional perspective, to be able to dismantle that [federal] bureaucracy and their power centers” because “the bureaucracies hate the American people.” He predicted, “If you have a radical constitutionalism, it’s going to be destabilizing … But it’s also exhilarating.” He <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/video-donald-trump-russ-vought-center-renewing-america-maga\">said</a> he would put federal agencies “in trauma,” an idea echoed by Christopher Rufo, an architect of Trump’s attack on universities, which Rufo described as a “counterrevolution blueprint” to put universities “in an existential terror.” As Trump <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c307zq8ppj6o\">shuttered</a> a congressionally mandated agency, <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/trump-rename-gulf-mexico-gulf-america-1st-executive/story?id=117886074\">renamed</a> an international body of water, <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.aclum.org/press-releases/rumeysa-ozturk-denied-bond-remains-unlawfully-detained-louisiana/\">arrested</a> an op-ed writer, <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/world/americas/trump-migrants-deportations.html\">deported</a> immigrants to a foreign gulag, <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://open.substack.com/pub/theunpopulist/p/life-in-a-city-occupied-by-ice?r=i5o9\">terrorized</a> American cities, <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyg1jg8xkmo\">threatened</a> an ally, and more, he showed how it looks when a radicalized state abandons rational deliberation and goes to war against itself.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\" data-flatplan-dropcap=\"true\">O that there are elements of classical European fascism that are not found in Trumpism (mass rallies and public rituals, for example)—or that there are additional elements of Trumpism that belong on the list (MAGA’s <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDC_bn68jYc\">hypermasculinity</a>, <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-wants-more-support-from-women-but-hasnt-changed-how-he-talks-about-them\">misogyny</a>, and <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/maga-christians-betray-ethics-ice/685679/\">co-option of Christianity</a> all resemble fascist patterns). The exercise of comparing fascism’s various forms is not precise. If historians object that Trump is not a copy of Mussolini or Hitler or Franco, the reply is yes—but so what? Trump is building something new on old principles. He is showing us in real time what 21st-century  fascism looks like.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">If, however, Trump is a fascist , that does not mean that America is a fascist  The courts, the states, and the media remain independent of him, and his efforts to browbeat them will likely fail. He may lose his grip on Congress in November. He has not succeeded in molding public opinion, except <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/203198/presidential-approval-ratings-donald-trump.aspx\">against himself</a>. He has outrun the mandate of his voters, his coalition is <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2025/11/28/the-emerging-maga-fractures-00670643\">fracturing</a>, and he has <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/trump-first-year-powers/685670/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the-atlantic-am&amp;utm_term=The%20Atlantic%20AM\">neglected tools</a> that allow presidents to make enduring change. He and his party may defy the Constitution, but they cannot rewrite it, thank goodness.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">So the United States, once the world’s exemplary liberal democracy, is now a hybrid state combining a fascist leader and a liberal Constitution; but no, it has not fallen to fascism. And it will not.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">In which case, is there any point in calling Trump a fascist, even if true? Doesn’t that alienate his voters? Wouldn’t it be better just to describe his actions without labeling him controversially?</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Until recently, I thought so. No longer. The resemblances are too many and too strong to deny. Americans who support liberal democracy need to recognize what we’re dealing with in order to cope with it, and to recognize something, one must name it. Trump has revealed himself, and we must name what we see.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Note: this post has been revised to be split into two sections: a description of what happened, and my analysis. I hope to make it clear that, while I do not like ATProto in general, I am trying to make good-faith critcisms of specific design decisions and outcomes, and in fact, this post getting updoots on HackerNews appears to have gotten the attention of the team, so, mission accomplished. <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46760548\">ref</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/issues/3455#issuecomment-3797567431\">ref</a> My account has since been manually reinstated; this has not happened for any of the other users that have had this issue, as far as I know.</p><section><p>Today, I tried setting up an ATProto account for use with Bluesky, with did:web instead of did:plc. Let’s walk through the process:</p><ol><li><p>Set up the PDS software on a server I control. Because I use NixOS, this was very easy.</p></li><li><p>Create a did:web. This means creating a public-private keypair; I initially tried following <a href=\"https://blog.lapyst.dev/posts/14-how-to-create-a-completely-independent-bluesky-atproto-account\">this tutorial</a> from Mai Lapyst, but it’s very out of date, and doesn’t include a critical step.</p></li><li><p>With that did:web, upload the  document to my webserver and set the appropriate DNS entries. Easy enough, except that I also had to set the CORS header for the .</p></li><li><p>Create an account on my new PDS. I was able to get an invite and create an account, but it was in the “deactivated” status, and I couldn’t activate it. This had to be done by making requests manually with , reading the error outcomes in the PDS’s logs on my server.</p></li><li><p>Seek help in the ATProto Touchers Discord server, and at their advice delete the account.</p></li><li><p>Start over and re-create everything from scratch, correctly replacing the public key in my DID with the public key from <code>getRecommendedDidCredentials</code>.</p></li><li><p>Log into Bluesky (bsky.app) and get a “Profile does not exist error.”</p></li></ol><p>It was at this point that I found <a href=\"https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/issues/3455\">this GitHub issue</a>, which seems to imply that, since I deleted my (completely empty and unused) account, my did:web is blacklisted from the remaining mostly-centralized bit of the system, the AppView. The term for this is being “burned”, and it was later confirmed by some more experienced users that this is a known but undocumented behavior of the Bluesky AppView.</p><p>I had one of my friends who uses Bluesky take a look, and the failure mode is interesting. On Bluesky, I didn’t exist at all. (She could not see my likes, or my follow of her.) On Blacksky production, my display name and bio were visible, but not my posts. On Blacksky’s own AppView, it’s the opposite; my posts appeared under an “invalid” profile. I have been un-“burned” by a manual process, but not because of my support request; this post made it to the front page of Hacker News, and Bryan Newbold saw it there.</p></section><section><p>So, a while ago, I wrote a post called <a href=\"https://notes.nora.codes/atproto\">“Key Management, ATProto, and Decentralization”</a> in which I complained about ATProto’s approach to decentralization. Since then, Blacksky has spun up an AppView, which makes it theoretically possible to have an actually decentralized experience on Bluesky. This was my line in the sand, stated many times; I would make an account when and only when it was possible to do so without using anything running on Bluesky-the-company’s hardware. That’s now, so I figured I’d try it.</p><p>I use lots of systems I don’t love, like Signal, Matrix, and Mastodon. I use them because they give me access to social interaction with people I care about. ATProto, and specifically Bluesky, is the same; I have friends who don’t post anywhere else. Today, I follow them by RSS, but can’t interact with their posts. That’s where my motivation to use the network comes from, along with understanding how, and how well, the newly decentralized AppView layer works.</p><p>Very little of this process is documented. Sure, the individual endpoints are - kind of - but the only place the whole process is collected in one place is in the comments to <a href=\"https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/issues/3143\">this GitHub issue</a>… which is closed as WONTFIX. The documentation for that <code>getRecommendedDidCredentials</code> endpoint that I missed reads in full:</p><blockquote><p>Describe the credentials that should be included in the DID doc of an account that is migrating to this service.</p></blockquote><p>Note that I am  “migrating”; this account is new. Plus, the JSON keys it returns are almost, but not quite, the same as those in a DID document, and the key it returns actually has to be edited by hand in order to be usable.</p><p>This is not good!  has been held up as the “less centralized” or “bring your own trust” option, as opposed to , and it seems like there has been very little effort to make it usable, certainly not for “normal” users.</p><p>But there’s another issue, a bigger issue. Why is a centralized “burn” able to completely prevent me from interacting with people using Bluesky?</p><p>You may be aware that Mastodon has a similar system. If you set up a Mastodon server and then delete the database, anyone you’ve already federated with won’t federate with you again, because you can’t prove you’re the same instance. It’s a genuine issue - but it wouldn’t have resulted in this, because I hadn’t even made a post on my now-burned did:web identity, nor followed anyone.</p><p>Even if I had, though, that would have burned  connection, not  connections. \nMy experience would be degraded, but not ruined, and I could work with the admins of the affected servers to remediate it.\nYou could say the same here, of course; I had to get my account back by Bryan Newbold happening to see this post on Hacker News. There is only, really, one connection that matters; maybe two, if you count Blacksky, but their AppView is not generally available yet. That’s centralization. I don’t understand how you could call it anything else.</p><p>I don’t like Bluesky, or ATProto; I wish we lived in a world were community-driven projects got megabucks and we were all self-hosting little social media servers for our communities. We don’t live in that world, so we have to interoperate with VC-backed, corporate social media. When those platforms call themselves “decentralized”, I think they should deliver.</p></section>",

      "content": "<p>The Federal Aviation Administration has issued a nationwide security notice, effectively creating a moving drone no-fly zone around operations conducted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement&nbsp;(ICE)&nbsp;and other components of the Department of Homeland Security.&nbsp;</p><p>The notice, <a href=\"https://tfr.faa.gov/tfr3/?page=detail_6_4375&amp;ref=404media.co\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"\">NOTAM FDC 6/4375</a>, prohibits unmanned&nbsp;aircraft&nbsp;systems from&nbsp;operating&nbsp;within&nbsp;3,000 feet&nbsp;laterally and&nbsp;1,000 feet&nbsp;vertically of DHS facilities and mobile assets, including ground vehicle convoys and their escorts. The restriction applies nationwide and continuously, rather than at fixed locations or during defined time windows.&nbsp;</p><p>Because ICE&nbsp;operates&nbsp;under DHS and routinely conducts enforcement actions using mobile vehicle convoys in public spaces, the restriction functions as a drone no-fly zone around ICE operations, including arrests, transport activities and other field actions.&nbsp;</p><p>The FAA classifies the restricted airspace as “national defense airspace,”&nbsp;and cites its authority under federal security statutes. Drone operators who violate the restriction may face criminal prosecution, civil penalties, administrative enforcement actions, or revocation of FAA operating privileges. The notice also&nbsp;states&nbsp;that drones&nbsp;deemed&nbsp;a credible security threat may be intercepted, seized, damaged, or destroyed.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike traditional Temporary Flight Restrictions, the NOTAM does not provide geographic coordinates, activation times, or public notification when the restriction is in effect near a specific location. Instead, the restricted airspace moves with DHS assets, meaning the no-fly zone can appear wherever ICE or other DHS units&nbsp;operate.&nbsp;</p><p>The new NOTAM replaces an earlier security notice, FDC 5/6378, which covered similar federal agencies but was less explicit about mobile operations. The updated version removes ambiguity by clearly&nbsp;stating&nbsp;that the restriction applies to moving DHS assets, including vehicles and convoys, and not just fixed facilities such as offices or bases.&nbsp;</p><p>That clarification has drawn attention from drone operators&nbsp;and civil liberties groups because it creates dynamic, invisible exclusion zones that may be&nbsp;impossible&nbsp;to&nbsp;identify&nbsp;in real time. The FAA does not publish public tracking of DHS or ICE movements, and the NOTAM does not include a mechanism for drone pilots to&nbsp;determine&nbsp;when covered assets are nearby.&nbsp;</p><p>In practical terms, a drone operator flying legally in a public area could unknowingly enter restricted airspace if an ICE convoy passes within the protected radius. The FAA instructs operators to “exercise caution” when flying near DHS facilities and mobile assets, but offers no specific guidance on how to do so in environments where enforcement activity is not publicly&nbsp;disclosed.&nbsp;</p><p>The notice mentions limited exceptions. Drone operations conducted in direct support of national defense, homeland security, law enforcement, firefighting, search and rescue, or disaster response missions may be authorized with advance coordination. Operators seeking approval are instructed to coordinate with DHS or other covered&nbsp;agencies, or&nbsp;contact the FAA’s System Operations Support Center.&nbsp;</p><p>The FAA cites multiple federal statutes as the legal basis for the restriction, including laws governing national&nbsp;defense&nbsp;airspace and counter-UAS mitigation.</p>",

      "content": "<p>\n                        While I was working on a project with Wayfair, I got the opportunity to work on a system that generated daily business reports aggregated from multiple data sources flowing through event streams across Wayfair. At a high level, Kafka consumers listened to these events, hydrated them with additional data by calling downstream services, and finally persisted the enriched events into a durable datastore—CloudSQL PostgreSQL on GCP.\n                    </p><p>\n                        When everything was healthy, the pipeline worked exactly as expected. Events flowed in, got enriched, and were stored reliably. The real challenge started when things went wrong, which, in distributed systems, is not an exception but a certainty.\n                    </p><p>\n                        There were multiple failure scenarios we had to deal with. Sometimes the APIs we depended on for hydration were down or slow. Sometimes the consumer itself crashed midway through processing. In other cases, events arrived with missing or malformed fields that could not be processed safely. These were all situations outside our direct control, but they still needed to be handled gracefully.\n                    </p><p>\n                        This is where the concept of a Dead Letter Queue came into the picture. Whenever we knew an event could not be processed successfully, instead of dropping it or blocking the entire consumer, we redirected it to a DLQ so it could be inspected and potentially reprocessed later.\n                    </p><p>\n                        Our first instinct was to use Kafka itself as a DLQ. While this is a common pattern, it quickly became clear that it wasn't a great fit for our needs. Kafka is excellent for moving data, but once messages land in a DLQ topic, they are not particularly easy to inspect. Querying by failure reason, retrying a specific subset of events, or even answering simple questions like \"what failed yesterday and why?\" required extra tooling and custom consumers. For a system that powered business-critical daily reports, this lack of visibility was a serious drawback.\n                    </p><p>\n                        That's when we decided to treat PostgreSQL itself as the Dead Letter Queue.\n                    </p><p>\n                        Instead of publishing failed events to another Kafka topic, we persisted them directly into a DLQ table in PostgreSQL. We were already using CloudSQL as our durable store, so operationally this added very little complexity. Conceptually, it also made failures first-class citizens in the system rather than opaque messages lost in a stream.\n                    </p><p>\n                        Whenever an event failed processing—due to an API failure, consumer crash, schema mismatch, or validation error—we stored the raw event payload along with contextual information about the failure. Each record carried a simple status field. When the event first landed in the DLQ, it was marked as . Once it was successfully reprocessed, the status was updated to . Keeping the state model intentionally minimal made it easy to reason about the lifecycle of a failed event.\n                    </p><h3>DLQ Table Schema and Indexing Strategy</h3><p>\n                        To support inspection, retries, and long-term operability, the DLQ table was designed to be simple, query-friendly, and retry-aware.\n                    </p><pre><code>CREATE TABLE dlq_events (\n    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n    event_type VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n    payload JSONB NOT NULL,\n    error_reason TEXT NOT NULL,\n    error_stacktrace TEXT,\n    status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, -- PENDING / SUCCEEDED\n    retry_count INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,\n    retry_after TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,\n    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),\n    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()\n);</code></pre><h4>Key Design Considerations</h4><ul><li> is stored as  to preserve the raw event without enforcing a rigid schema.</li><li> keeps the lifecycle simple and explicit.</li><li> prevents aggressive retries when downstream systems are unstable.</li><li> allows retry limits to be enforced without external state.</li><li>Timestamps make auditing and operational analysis straightforward.</li></ul><pre><code>CREATE INDEX idx_dlq_status\nON dlq_events (status);\n\nCREATE INDEX idx_dlq_status_retry_after\nON dlq_events (status, retry_after);\n\nCREATE INDEX idx_dlq_event_type\nON dlq_events (event_type);\n\nCREATE INDEX idx_dlq_created_at\nON dlq_events (created_at);</code></pre><p>\n                        These indexes allow the retry scheduler to efficiently locate eligible events while still supporting fast debugging and time-based analysis without full table scans.\n                    </p><h3>DLQ Retry Mechanism with ShedLock</h3><p>\n                        Persisting failed events solved the visibility problem, but we still needed a safe and reliable way to retry them.\n                    </p><p>\n                        For this, we introduced a DLQ retry scheduler backed by ShedLock. The scheduler periodically scans the DLQ table for  events that are eligible for retry and attempts to process them again. Since the service runs on multiple instances, ShedLock ensures that only one instance executes the retry job at any given time. This eliminates duplicate retries without requiring custom leader-election logic.\n                    </p><pre><code>dlq:\n  retry:\n    enabled: true\n    max-retries: 240\n    batch-size: 50\n    fixed-rate: 21600000 # 6 hours in milliseconds</code></pre><ul><li>The scheduler runs every six hours.</li><li>Up to fifty eligible events are picked up per run.</li><li>Events exceeding the maximum retry count are skipped.</li><li>Successful retries immediately transition the event status to .</li><li>Failures remain in  and are retried in subsequent runs.</li></ul><p>\n                        The retry scheduler uses a SQL query with  to safely select eligible events across multiple instances. This PostgreSQL feature ensures that even if multiple scheduler instances run simultaneously, each will pick up different rows without blocking each other:\n                    </p><pre><code>@QueryHints(@QueryHint(name = \"jakarta.persistence.lock.timeout\", value = \"-2\"))\n@Query(\n    value = \"SELECT * FROM dlq_table \"\n        + \"WHERE messagetype = :messageType \"\n        + \"AND retries &lt; :maxRetries \"\n        + \"AND (replay_status IS NULL OR replay_status NOT IN ('COMPLETED')) \"\n        + \"ORDER BY created_at ASC \"\n        + \"FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED\",\n    nativeQuery = true\n)</code></pre><p>\n                        The  clause is crucial here. It allows each instance to lock and process different rows concurrently, preventing duplicate processing while maintaining high throughput. The query hint sets the lock timeout to , which means \"wait indefinitely\" but combined with , it effectively means \"skip any rows that are already locked by another transaction.\"\n                    </p><p>\n                        This setup allowed the system to tolerate long downstream outages while avoiding retry storms and unnecessary load on dependent services.\n                    </p><p>\n                        With this approach, failures became predictable and observable rather than disruptive. Engineers could inspect failures using plain SQL, identify patterns, and reprocess only the events that mattered. If a downstream dependency was unavailable for hours or even days, events safely accumulated in the DLQ and were retried later without human intervention. If an event was fundamentally bad, it stayed visible instead of being silently dropped.\n                    </p><p>\n                        Most importantly, this design reduced operational stress. Failures were no longer something to fear; they were an expected part of the system with a clear, auditable recovery path.\n                    </p><p>\n                        The goal was never to replace Kafka with PostgreSQL. Kafka remained the backbone for high-throughput event ingestion, while PostgreSQL handled what it does best—durability, querying, and observability around failures. By letting each system play to its strengths, we ended up with a pipeline that was resilient, debuggable, and easy to operate.\n                    </p><p>\n                        In the end, using PostgreSQL as a Dead Letter Queue turned failure handling into something boring and predictable. And in production systems, boring is exactly what you want.\n                    </p>",

      "content": "<div><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">As many as 30,000 people could have been killed in the streets of Iran on Jan. 8 and 9 alone, two senior officials of the country’s Ministry of Health told TIME—indicating a dramatic surge in the death toll. So many people were slaughtered by Iranian security services on that Thursday and Friday, it overwhelmed the state’s capacity to dispose of the dead. Stocks of body bags were exhausted, the officials said, and eighteen-wheel semi-trailers replaced ambulances.</p></div><div><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">The government’s internal count of the dead, not previously revealed, far surpasses the toll of 3,117 announced on Jan. 21 by regime hardliners who report directly to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. (Ministries report to the elected President.) The 30,000 figure is also far beyond tallies being compiled by activists methodically assigning names to the dead. As of Saturday, the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency said it had confirmed 5,459 deaths and is investigating 17,031 more.</p><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">TIME has been unable to independently verify these figures.</p><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">The Health Ministry’s two-day figure roughly aligns with a count gathered by physicians and first responders, and also shared with TIME. That surreptitious tally of deaths recorded by hospitals stood at 30,304 as of Friday, according to Dr. Amir Parasta, a German-Iranian eye surgeon who prepared a report of the data. Parasta said that number does not reflect protest-related deaths of people registered at military hospitals, whose bodies were taken directly to morgues, or that happened in locales the inquiry did not reach. Iran’s National Security Council has said protests took place in around 4,000 locations across the country.  </p></div><div><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">“We are getting closer to reality,” Dr. Parasta said. “But I guess the real figures are still way higher.”</p><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">That appears to be the reality implicit in the government’s internal figure of more than 30,000 deaths in two days. A slaughter on that scale, in the space of 48 hours, had experts on mass killing groping for comparisons.</p><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">“Most spasms of killing are not from shootings,” said Les Roberts, a professor at Columbia University who specializes in the epidemiology of violent death. “In Aleppo [Syria] and in Fallujah [Iraq], when spasms of death this high have occurred over a few days, it involved mostly explosives with some shooting.”</p><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">The only parallel offered by online databases occurred in the Holocaust. On the outskirts of Kyiv on Sept. 29 and 30, 1941,<a href=\"https://time.com/6102593/ukraine-holocaust-memorial-kremlin-propaganda/\"> Nazi death squads</a> executed 33,000 Ukrainian Jews by gunshot in a ravine known as<a href=\"https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/kiev-and-babi-yar\"> Babyn Yar</a>.</p><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">In Iran, the killing fields extended across the country where, since Dec. 28, hundreds of thousands of citizens had assembled in the streets chanting first, for relief from an economy in freefall, and soon for the downfall of the Islamic regime. During the first week, security forces confronted some demonstrations, using mostly non-lethal force, but with officials also offering conciliatory language, the regime response was uncertain. That changed during the weekend commencing Jan. 8. Protests peaked, as opposition groups, <a href=\"https://x.com/PahlaviReza/status/2009041925647548815\">including</a><a href=\"https://time.com/7346706/reza-pahlavi-iran-crown-prince-trump-protests/\">Reza Pahlavi,</a> the exiled son of Iran’s former shah, urged people to join the throngs, and U.S. President Donald Trump repeated <a href=\"https://time.com/7347090/iran-protesters-trump-help/\">vows to protect them</a>, though no help arrived.</p></div><div><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">Witnesses say millions were in the streets when authorities shut down the internet and all other communications with the outside world. Rooftop snipers and trucks mounted with heavy machine guns opened fire, according to eyewitnesses and cell phone footage. On Friday, Jan. 9, an official of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps warned on state television to anyone venturing into the streets, “if … a bullet hits you, don’t complain.”</p><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">It took days for the reality to penetrate the internet blackout. Images of the bloodied bodies trickled out<a href=\"https://time.com/6249365/iran-elon-musk-starlink-protests/\"> via illicit Starlink</a> satellite internet connections. The task of counting the dead was hampered, however, because the authorities had also cut off lines of communications inside Iran. The first firm information came from a Tehran doctor <a href=\"https://time.com/7345092/iran-protests-death-toll-regime-crackdown/\">who told </a>TIME that just six hospitals in the capital had recorded at least 217 protester deaths after Thursday’s assault. Health care workers in Iran estimated at least 16,500 protesters had been killed by Jan. 10, according to an earlier report by Dr. Parasta in Munich. Friday’s update built on that research, he said.</p></div><div><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">“I am genuinely impressed by how quickly this work was pulled together under extremely constrained and risky conditions,” said Paul B. Spiegel, a professor at the Johns Hopkins University International School of Health. Like Roberts, he expressed wariness of extrapolating from the figures provided by hospitals.&nbsp;</p><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">Roberts, who traveled into war zones to research civilian death rates <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140673606694919/abstract\">in Iraq</a> and the Democratic Republic of <a href=\"https://carnegieendowment.org/events/2000/10/continuing-crisis-in-the-drc-the-unheralded-death-toll-and-its-implications\">Congo</a>, said, “the 30,000 verified deaths are almost certainly an underestimate.”</p><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">The emergence of the Ministry of Health numbers appears to confirm that—while underscoring the stakes for both Iranians and a regime that, in 1979, came to power when a sitting government was confronted by millions of people demanding its downfall.</p><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">On Friday, Jan. 9, Sahba Rashtian, an aspiring animation artist, joined friends on the streets in Isfahan, a city in central Iran famous for its beauty. \"Before anyone started chanting,\" a friend told TIME, \"Sahba was seen collapsed on the ground. Her sister noticed blood on her hand.”</p></div><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">Sahba died on an operating table at a nearby hospital. She was 23.</p><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">“She always joked about her beautiful name,” her friend said. “She’d laugh and say, ‘Sahba means wine, and I am forbidden in the Islamic Republic.’”</p><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">At the burial, the friend said, religious rites were barred, and Rashtian’s father wore white.&nbsp;</p><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">“Congratulations,” he told mourners, according to the friend. “My daughter became a martyr on the path to freedom.”</p>",

Microsoft addressed these issues in the out of band update issued on January 17, but in the process broke apps like Outlook, OneDrive, and Dropbox.</p><p>It's clear that the quality bar for Windows is at an all time low right now, marking an absolutely dreadful start to the year for Microsoft and Windows.

Your work software tools, and all the information they contain, disappear.</p><p>You reach out for information but struggle to communicate with family and friends, or to get the latest updates on what is happening, as social media platforms are all down. Just as someone can pull the plug on your computer, it’s possible to shut down the system it connects to. </p><p>This isn’t an outlandish scenario. Technical failures, cyber-attacks and natural disasters can all bring down key parts of the internet. And as the US government makes increasing demands of European leaders, it is possible to imagine Europe losing access to the digital infrastructure provided by US firms as part of the geopolitical bargaining process. </p><p>At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the EU’s president, Ursula von der Leyen, <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2026/01/20/in-davos-von-der-leyen-pitches-european-independence-versus-trumps-worldview\">has highlighted</a> the “structural imperative”  for Europe to “build a new form of independence” – including in its technological capacity and security. And, in fact, moves are already being made across the continent to start regaining some independence from US technology.</p><p>A small number of US-headquartered big tech companies now control a large proportion of the world’s <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/topics/cloud-computing-243\">cloud computing</a> infrastructure, that is the global network of remote servers that store, manage and process all our apps and data. Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud are reported to hold about <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/ATAG/2025/780413/ECTI_ATA(2025)780413_EN.pdf\">70% of the European market</a>, while European cloud providers have <a href=\"https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/european-cloud-providers-hold-15-of-local-market-share-synergy-research/\">only 15%</a>.</p><p>My <a href=\"https://www.linaker.se/\">research</a> supports the idea that relying on a few global providers increases vulnerabilty for Europe’s private and public sectors – including the risk of cloud computing disruption, whether caused by technical issues, <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115092243259973570\">geopolitical disputes</a> or malicious activity.</p><p>Two recent examples – both the result of apparent technical failures – were the hours‑long <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/24/amazon-reveals-cause-of-aws-outage\">AWS incident</a> in October 2025, which disrupted thousands of services such as banking apps across the world, and the major <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/dec/05/another-cloudflare-outage-takes-down-websites-linkedin-zoom\">Cloudflare incident</a> two months later, which took LinkedIn, Zoom and other communication platforms offline. </p><p>The impact of a major power disruption on cloud computing services was also demonstrated when Spain, Portugal and some of south-west France endured a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/28/spain-and-portugal-power-outage-cause-cyber-attack-electricity\">massive power cut</a> in April 2025.</p><figure><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h2>What happens in a digital blackout?</h2><p>There are signs that Europe is starting to take the need for greater digital independence more seriously. In the Swedish coastal city of Helsingborg, for example, a <a href=\"https://www.dagenssamhalle.se/samhalle-och-valfard/digitalisering/helsingborg-satsar-pa-digital-suveranitet-nytt-projekt-ska-starka-motstandskraften/\">one-year project</a> is testing how various public services would function in the scenario of a digital blackout. </p><p>Would elderly people still receive their medical prescriptions? Can social services continue to provide care and benefits to all the city’s residents?</p><p>This pioneering project seeks to quantify the full range of human, technical and legal challenges that a collapse of technical services would create, and to understand what level of risk is acceptable in each sector. The aim is to build a model of crisis preparedness that can be shared with other municipalities and regions later this year.</p><p>Elsewhere in Europe, other forerunners are taking action to strengthen their <a href=\"https://www.linaker.se/blog/how-denmark-is-waking-up-to-the-challenge-of-digital-sovereignty/\">digital sovereignty</a> by weaning themselves off reliance on global big tech companies – in part through collaboration and adoption of open source software. This technology is treated as a digital public good that can be moved between different clouds and operated under sovereign conditions.</p><p>In northern Germany, the state of <a href=\"https://www.heise.de/en/news/Goodbye-Microsoft-Schleswig-Holstein-relies-on-Open-Source-and-saves-millions-11105459.html\">Schleswig-Holstein</a> has made perhaps the clearest break with digital dependency. The state government has replaced most of its Microsoft-powered computer systems with open-source alternatives, cancelling nearly 70% of its licenses. Its target is to use big tech services only in exceptional cases by the end of the decade.</p><p>Across France, Germany, the Netherlands and Italy, governments are <a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/digital-commons-edic-launches-advance-europes-technological-sovereignty\">investing</a> both nationally and transnationally in the development of digital open-source platforms and tools for chat, video and document management – akin to digital Lego bricks that administrations can host <a href=\"https://www.opendesk.eu/en\">on their own terms</a>.</p><p>In Sweden, a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H_oifdVWbw\">similar system</a> for chat, video and online collaboration, developed by the National Insurance Agency, runs in domestic data centres rather than foreign clouds. It is being offered as a service for Swedish public authorities looking for sovereign digital alternatives.</p><p>For Europe – and any nation – to meaningfully address the risks posed by digital blackout and cloud collapse, digital infrastructure needs to be treated with the same seriousness as physical infrastructure such as ports, roads and power grids.</p><p>Control, maintenance and crisis preparedness of digital infrastructure should be seen as core public responsibilities, rather than something to be outsourced to global big tech firms, open for foreign influence.</p><p>To encourage greater focus on digital resilience among its member states, the EU has developed a <a href=\"https://commission.europa.eu/document/09579818-64a6-4dd5-9577-446ab6219113_en\">cloud sovereignty framework</a> to guide procurement of cloud services – with the intention of keeping European data under European control. The upcoming <a href=\"https://www.mlex.com/mlex/articles/2384011/-effective-control-concept-for-cloud-sovereignty-eyed-by-eu-commission\">Cloud and AI Development Act</a> is expected to bring more focus and resources to this area.</p><p>Governments and private companies should be encouraged to demand security, openness and interoperability when seeking bids for provision of their cloud services – not merely low prices. But in the same way, as individuals, we can all make a difference with the choices we make.</p><p>Just as it’s advisable to ensure your own access to food, water and medicine in a time of crisis, be mindful of what services you use personally and professionally. Consider where your emails, personal photos and conversations are stored. Who can access and use your data, and under what conditions? How easily can everything be backed up, retrieved and transferred to another service?</p><p>No country, let alone continent, will ever be completely digitally independent, and nor should they be. But by pulling together, Europe can ensure its digital systems remain accessible even in a crisis – just as is expected from its physical infrastructure.</p>",

      "content": "<p>You can now view replies to this blog post made on Bluesky directly on this website. <a href=\"https://micahcantor.com/blog/bluesky-comment-section#comments\">Check it out here</a>!</p><p>I've always wanted to host a comment section on my site, but it's difficult because the content is statically generated and hosted on a CDN.\nI could host comments on a separate VPS or cloud service.\nBut maintaining a dynamic web service like this can be expensive and time-consuming — in general, I'm not interested in being an unpaid, part-time DevOps engineer.</p><p>Recently, however, I read a blog post by <a href=\"https://www.coryzue.com/writing/bluesky-comments/\">Cory Zue</a> about how he embedded a comment section from Bluesky on his blog.\nI immediately understood to benefits of this approach. With this approach, Bluesky could handle all of the difficult work involved in managing a social media like account verification, hosting, storage, spam, and moderation. Meanwhile because Bluesky is an open platform with a public API, it's easy to directly embed comments on my own site.</p><p>There are other services that could be used for this purpose instead. Notably, I could embed replies from the social media formerly known as Twitter. Or I could use a platform like <a href=\"https://disqus.com/\">Disqus</a> or even <a href=\"https://giscus.app/\">giscus</a>, which hosts comments on GitHub Discussions. But I see Bluesky as a clearly superior choice among these options. For one, Bluesky is built on top of an open social media platform in AT Proto, meaning it can't easily be taken over by an authoritarian billionaire creep. Moreover, Bluesky is a full-fledged social media platform, which naturally makes it a better option for hosting a conversation than GitHub.</p><p>Zue published a standalone package called <a href=\"https://github.com/czue/bluesky-comments\">bluesky-comments</a> that allows embedding comments in a React component as he did.\nBut I decided to build this feature myself instead. Mainly this is because I wanted to make a few styling changes anyway to match the rest of my site. But I also wanted to leave the option open to adding more features in the future, which would be easier to do if I wrote the code myself. The entire implementation is small regardless, amounting to only ~200 LOC between the UI components and API functions.</p><p>Initially, I planned to allow people to directly post on Bluesky via my site. This would work by providing an OAuth flow that gives my site permission to post on Bluesky on behalf of the user. I actually did get the auth flow working, but building out a UI for posting and replying to existing comments is difficult to do well. Going down this path quickly leads to building what is essentially a custom Bluesky client, which I didn't have the time or interest in doing right now. Moreover, because the user needs to go through the auth flow and sign-in to their Bluesky account, the process is not really much easier than posting directly on a linked Bluesky post.</p><p>Without the requirement of allowing others to directly post on my site, the implementation became much simpler. Essentially, my task was to specify a Bluesky post that corresponds to the article in the site's metadata. Then, when the page loads I fetch the replies to that post from Bluesky, parse the response, and display the results in a simple comment section UI.</p><p>As explained in <a href=\"https://micahcantor.com/blog/rsc-rewrite\">my last post</a>, this site is built using React Server Components and Parcel. The content of my articles are written using MDX, an extension to Markdown that allows directly embedding JavaScript and JSX. In each post, I export a  object that I validate using a <a href=\"https://zod.dev\">Zod</a> schema. For instance, the metadata for this post looks like this:</p><div data-bright-theme=\"github-dark\"><pre><code></code></pre></div><p>The value of  references the Bluesky post from which I'll pull replies to display in the comment section. Because my project is built in TypeScript, it was easy to integrate with the Bluesky TypeScript SDK ( on NPM). Reading the Bluesky API documentation and Zue's implementation led me to the <a href=\"https://docs.bsky.app/docs/api/app-bsky-feed-get-post-thread\"> endpoint</a>. Given an AT Protocol URI, this endpoint returns an object with data on the given post and its replies.</p><p>I could have interacted directly with the Bluesky API from my React component using  and . However, it can be a bit tricky to correctly handle loading and a error states, even for a simple feature like this. Because of this, I decided to use the <a href=\"https://tanstack.com/query/latest\">Tanstack  package</a> to manage the API request/response cycle. This library takes care of the messy work of handling errors, retries, and loading states while I simply provide it a function to fetch the post data.</p><p>Once I obtain the Bluesky response, the next task is parsing out the content and metadata for the replies. Bluesky supports a rich content structure in its posts for representing markup, references, and attachments. Building out a UI that fully respects this rich content would be difficult. Instead, I decided to keep it simple by just pulling out the text content from each reply.</p><p>Even so, building a UI that properly displays threaded comments, particularly one that is formatted well on small mobile devices, can be tricky. For now, my approach was to again keep it simple. I indented each reply and added a left border to make it easier to follow reply threads. Otherwise, I mostly copied design elements for layout of the profile picture and post date from Bluesky.</p><p>Lastly, I added a UI component linking to the parent post on Bluesky, and encouraging people to add to the conversation there. With this, the read-only comment section implementation was complete. If there's interest, I could publish my version of Bluesky comments as a standalone package. But several of the choices I made were relatively specific to my own site. Moreover, the implementation is simple enough that others could probably build their own version from reading the source code, just as I did using Zue's version.</p><p>Let me know what you think by replying on Bluesky. Hopefully this can help increase engagement with my blog posts, but then again, my last article generated no replies, so maybe not 😭.</p><p>Thanks everyone for all the positive feedback! I made a few improvements last night and today. I added control button that allows you to sort comments by top, latest, or oldest. I also included the like count beneath each comments, and made a few small styling improvements.</p><p>A few people have asked about adding this to their own site, or about other implementation details. For that, feel free to check out <a href=\"https://github.com/micahcantor/blog-rsc\">the source code on GitHub</a> (and in particular  and ).</p><p>And as I mentioned earlier, I'm certainly not the first person to have thought of this idea or implemented it. In particular, I like the implementations of the same feature by <a href=\"https://natalie.sh/posts/bluesky-comments/\">Natalie B.</a> and by <a href=\"https://triplepat.com/blog/2024/10/17/how-the-website-works\">Triple Pat</a>.</p>",

      "content": "<p>On March 14, 2025, Albedo's first satellite, Clarity-1, launched on SpaceX Transporter-13. We took a big swing with our pathfinder. The mission goals:</p><ol role=\"list\"><li>Prove sustainable orbit operations in VLEO — an orbital regime long considered too harsh for commercial satellites — by overcoming thick atmospheric drag, dangerous atomic oxygen, and extreme speeds.</li><li>Prove our mid-size, high-performance Precision bus — designed and built in-house in just over two years.</li><li>Capture 10 cm resolution visible imagery and 2-meter thermal infrared imagery, a feat previously achieved only by exquisite, billion dollar government systems.</li></ol><p>We proved a ton. We learned a ton.</p><p>We achieved the first two goals definitively and validated 98% of the technology required for the third. This was an extraordinarily ambitious first satellite. We designed and built a high-performance bus on time and on budget, integrated a large-aperture telescope, and operated in an environment no commercial company had sustained operations in, funded entirely by private capital.</p><p>Let's start with the result that matters most: VLEO works. And it works better than even we expected.</p><p>For decades, Very Low Earth Orbit was written off as impractical for normal satellite lifetimes. The atmosphere is thicker, creating drag that would deorbit normal satellites in weeks. If the drag didn't kill you, atomic oxygen would erode your solar arrays and surfaces. To succeed in VLEO required a fundamentally different satellite design.</p><p>Clarity-1 proved that our design works.</p><p>The drag coefficient was the headline: 12% better than our design target. Measured multiple times at altitudes between 350 km - 380 km with a repeatable result, this validates our models producing a satellite lifespan of five years at 275 km altitude, averaged across the solar cycle. This was one of our most critical assumptions, and we exceeded it.</p><p>Atomic oxygen (AO) is the silent killer in VLEO. The deeper you go, the more AO you encounter. It degrades solar arrays and other traditional satellite materials. We developed a new class of solar arrays with unique measures designed to mitigate AO degradation. They work. Even as we descended deeper into VLEO and AO fluence increased logarithmically, our power generation stayed constant. The solar arrays are holding up as designed.</p><p>Clarity-1 demonstrated over 100 km of controlled altitude descent, stationkeeping in VLEO, and survived a solar storm that temporarily spiked atmospheric density — the impact on Clarity's descent rate was barely noticeable. Momentum management worked. Fault detection worked. Our thrust planning model was validated against GOCE data (a 2009 VLEO R&amp;D mission) with sub-meter accuracy. Radiation tolerance was excellent, with 4x fewer single-event upsets than expected. Orbit determination was dialed.</p><p>We proved sustainable VLEO operations.</p><p>Developed and built in just over two years, our in-house bus Precision is now TRL-9: flight-proven on-orbit.</p><p>Every bus subsystem worked. Every piece of in-house technology we developed performed: our CMG steering law, our operational modes, flight and ground software, electronics boards, and our novel thermal management system. &nbsp;We hit our embedded software GNC timing deadlines, we converged our attitude and orbit determination estimators, we saw 4π steradian command and telemetry antenna coverage, and we got on-orbit actuals for our power generation and loads.</p><p>Our cloud-native ground system was incredible. Contact planning across 25 ground stations was completely automated. Mission scheduling updated every 15 minutes to incorporate new tasking and the latest satellite state information, smoothly transitioning to updated on-board command loads with visual tracking of each schedule and its status. Automated thrust planning to achieve our desired orbital trajectory supported 30+ maneuvers per day. Our engineers could track and command the satellite from anywhere with internet and a secure VPN.</p><p>We pushed 14 successful flight software feature updates on-orbit — and even executed one FPGA update, which is exceptionally rare. The ability to continuously improve throughout Clarity's operational life proved essential — every major solution to challenges we faced involved flight software updates. On-orbit software upgrades are exceedingly tricky to get right, but Clarity-1 was designed from day one around this foundational capability.</p><p>The first month of the mission was magic.</p><p>An hour after launch, we watched Clarity-1 deploy from the premium caketopper slot into LEO, giving us an incredible view of the Nile River as she separated from the rocket.</p><p>First contact came just three hours later at 5:11am MT. Imagine sitting in Mission Control, watching two ground station passes with no data, then on the third: heaps of green, healthy telemetry streaming into all of the subsystem dashboards. Clarity had nailed her autonomous boot-up sequence and rocket separation rate capture. Stuck the landing.</p><p>The next milestone — and the one many of us were most anxious about — was our autonomous Protect Mode, basically our VLEO version of Safe Mode.</p><p>We nailed it 14 hours after launch.</p><p>By 6:45pm that same day, Clarity was in Operational mode, ready for commissioning.</p><blockquote>\"Gotta say it: the last 16 hours have been incredible. I started my shift last night hoping to see one bit of data. I wouldn't have believed it if someone told me we'd be in Protect within 14 hours from launch.\"— Albedo GNC Engineer</blockquote><p>The days that followed were a blur of checkboxes turning green. 4-CMG commissioning complete. Payload power-on and checkout validated. Thermal balance for both visible and thermal sensors confirmed. Our first on-orbit software update went flawlessly.</p><p>Clarity uses Control Moment Gyroscopes (CMGs) to steer the satellite, giving us more agility than more commonly used reaction wheels. We moved onto validating GNC modes such as GroundTrack, which we use to point at communication ground terminals.</p><div><p>Clarity-1 accurately pointing at a ground station using GroundTrack mode; visualization is driven using real telemetry</p></div><p>We moved on to commissioning our X-band radio — the high-rate link to downlink imagery. After we uncovered an issue with our ground station provider’s pointing mode, the 800 Mbps link began pumping down data on every pass. The waveforms were clean. Textbook. A direct representation of how locked in our precision CMG pointing was.</p><p>With our first satellite at this level of complexity, we couldn't believe how smoothly it had gone. Years of developing new technologies had been validated in a fraction of the commissioning time we'd anticipated.</p><p>Next up was maneuvering from our LEO drop-off altitude down to VLEO, where it would be safe to eject the telescope contamination cover and start snapping pictures.</p><p>One of our four CMGs experienced a temperature spike in the flywheel bearing. Our Fault Detection, Isolation, and Recovery (FDIR) logic caught it immediately, spun it down, and executed automated recovery actions. But it wouldn't spin back up. Manual recovery attempts followed. Also unsuccessful.</p><p>Rushing back into CMG operations without understanding the failure mechanism risked killing the mission entirely, so we turned off the other three and put the satellite in two-axis stabilization using the magnetic torque rods.</p><div><p>Clarity-1 intentionally spinning to provide two-axis stabilization</p></div><p>We had a choice. Hack together novel 3-CMG control algorithms as fast as possible and risk losing another, or figure out how to leverage only the torque rods to achieve 3-axis control with sufficient accuracy to navigate the maneuver to VLEO.</p><p>We went with the torque rods.</p><p>On satellites this size (~600 kg), magnetic torque rods are typically used for momentum dumping, not attitude control. But we'd built Clarity with unusually beefy torque rods due to the elevated momentum management needs in VLEO. Our GNC team went heads down and developed algorithms to achieve 3-axis attitude control using only torque rods.</p><p>Within a month, we had it working.</p><p>Both of our electric thrusters commissioned quickly and were working well. But with torque rods only, our attitude control had 15 to 20 degrees of error, sometimes reaching ~45 degrees. And maneuvering to VLEO isn’t “point into the wind and fire” — it’s continuous vector and trajectory management across an orbit. That kind of control error meant inefficient burns and a much harder descent plan.</p><p>As the descent progressed, however, the team learned and iterated. With more iteration and flight software updates, we uploaded onboard logic informed by several sources of live data that dialed in our thrust vector control to within 5 degrees of the target. The autonomous thrust planning system we built enabled us to claw back performance that nearly matched our originally projected descent speed.</p><p>We maneuvered safely past the ISS and entered VLEO. Eager to pop off the contamination cover.</p><p>Once we reached safe altitude, it was time to jettison the contamination cover protecting our telescope.</p><p>There are horror stories about contamination covers getting stuck after months of temperature fluctuations.</p><p>Clarity's was flawless. I'll never forget seeing this blip in telemetry live — confirming through Newton's third law that the jettison was successful. Shortly after, LeoLabs confirmed tracking of two separate objects.</p><p>We were ready to start imaging.</p><p>Here's where it got complicated.</p><p>Our GNC and FSW teams were close but not yet finished with the new 3-CMG control law. CMGs are rarely used in commercial space, let alone by a startup. Then take one more step: singularity-prone 3-CMG control that to our knowledge has not been attempted on a non-exquisite satellite, and certainly not developed and uploaded on-orbit. Traditional algorithms require at least four CMGs to provide capability volumes free of singularities.</p><p>We were eager to make some amount of progress, so we started imaging on torque rods even though there would be severe limitations: 50+ pixels of smear, large mispointing from the wobble of torque rod control due to earth's magnetic field, and downlink limited to at best two small images per day. The last two constraints meant we were at risk of spending precious downlink capacity on clouds.</p><p>Sure enough, the first two days of pixels were mostly clouds, but we were happy to peek through a little in this image.</p><p>Although we couldn't  attitude accurately, we did still have good attitude  after the fact. AyJay whipped up a clever idea with Claude Code that automated posting weather conditions in Slack for each collection. We analyzed that to determine which images were likely clear, and selected those for downlink.</p><p>We adjusted the focus position a few times, and images continued getting better.</p><p>Then, 3-CMG control was ready.</p><p>Out of the box, the new algorithms and software performed perfectly.</p><p>This visualization shows real telemetry of Clarity performing seven back-to-back imaging maneuvers, with limited 3-CMG agility, followed by an X-band downlink over Iceland minutes later. The satellite was executing sophisticated attitude profiles with very low control error. Fiber-optic gyro measurements showed exquisite jitter performance.</p><div><p>Clarity is an agile TDI line-scanner capable of off-nadir imaging. This sequence was near-nadir intentionally for calibration purposes.</p></div><p>In real time, collecting and downlinking those seven images took ten minutes.</p><p>And this is where our ground software really showed its teeth. On most missions, “data on the ground” is just the start — turning raw bits into something viewable is a slow chain of handoffs and batch processing. For us, within seconds of the downlink finishing, the image product pipeline was already posting processed snippets into our company Slack. Literally seconds.</p><p>That end-to-end loop — photons in orbit to a viewable product on the ground, within minutes — is a capability that’s still rare in this industry.</p><p>As expected with smear reduced, image quality improved immediately.</p><p>We were ready to execute focus calibration.</p><p>Large telescope optics experience hygroscopic dryout during the first few months on-orbit — moisture trapped in materials during ground assembly slowly releases in the vacuum of space, causing the focus position to drift. Dialing in best focus requires dozens of iterations: capture images, analyze sharpness, adjust focus position, repeat. Each cycle gets you closer to the optical performance the system was designed for, and our telescope’s on-ground alignment was verified to spec.</p><p>After a few iterations of this, we could start to see cars.</p><p>Even this early into imaging, the infrared images blew us away. Using a low-cost microbolometer — a fraction of the price of cooled IR sensors — we captured thermal signatures that showed ships in Tokyo Bay, steel processing facilities where we could distinguish individual coke ovens from their smokestacks, and distinct signatures between real vegetation and turf — a good proxy for camouflage detection. Day or night, clear as day.</p><p>Three days into the excitement, CMG problems started again.</p><p>A second CMG began showing the same telemetry signatures we now recognized as warning signs.</p><p>What we had learned from the investigation: the allowable temperature specifications of the CMGs were much higher than the true limit, constrained by what the lubricant inside the flywheel could handle. A straightforward fix for the future — an unfortunate corner case to learn about in hindsight.</p><p>The second CMG showing issues was also on the hot side of the satellite. While we had overhauled the vehicle and CMG operations to prevent additional bearing wear, the damage had already been done in the first month of the mission.</p><p>We spent months trying everything we could to get the CMGs to operate sustainably. The team attempted many clever solutions, one of which revived the first CMG that had locked up. We uploaded a feature to select any 3 of the 4 CMGs for operator commanding. But we weren't able to get sustained, reliable operation.</p><p>Despite the CMG challenges, here's what the imaging journey proved.</p><p><strong>The full end-to-end image chain works.</strong> Photons hit our optics, get captured by our sensor, processed through payload electronics, packetized and encrypted, transmitted via our X-band radio, received on the ground, and processed into image products. The entire chain is validated.</p><p><strong>The end-to-end loop is fast.</strong> Within 30 seconds of a downlink, processed image snippets were already posting to our company Slack.</p><p><strong>Sensor performance exceeded expectations.</strong> Dynamic range, radiometry, color balance, band-to-band alignment — all look great, even on uncalibrated imagery.</p><p><strong>We can scan out long images.</strong> Our line-scanning approach produced strips 20-30 kilometers long, exactly as designed.</p><p><strong>Pointing accuracy and high quality telemetry validates the ingredients for precise geolocation.</strong> The data we need to pinpoint where each pixel lands on Earth to &lt;5m (closed-loop CE90) is there.</p><p><strong>Jitter and smear are low.</strong> Fiber-optic gyro measurements confirmed 3x lower smear and 11x lower jitter compared to our goal — a critical ingredient for exquisite imagery.</p><p><strong>Our proprietary image scheduler works.</strong> The automated system that plans collections, manages constraints, and optimizes what we capture each day performed as designed.</p><p>Nine months into the mission, we lost contact with Clarity-1.</p><p>By that point, we had largely exhausted our options on the CMGs. The path to further image quality improvement had effectively closed.</p><p>We had been tracking intermittent memory issues in our TT&amp;C radio throughout the mission, working around them as they appeared. Our best theory is that one of these issues escalated in a way that corrupted onboard memory and is preventing reboots. We've tried several recovery approaches. So far, none have worked, and the likelihood of recovery looks low at this point.</p><p>But here's what matters: the VLEO validation data we collected is sufficient.</p><p>We combined a state-of-the-art atmospheric density model, our high-fidelity orbital dynamics force models, and months of natural orbit decay data from 350 to 380 km altitude to determine Clarity’s coefficient of drag — with repeatable results at different altitudes. That drag coefficient, paired with our demonstrated ability to maintain altitude in VLEO for months using high-efficiency thrusters, tells us exactly how the vehicle behaves under aerodynamic drag across the VLEO regime — and validates an average five-year lifespan at 275 km across the solar cycle. Telemetry from our solar arrays, together with onboard atomic oxygen sensor data, shows peak power generation stayed constant after exposure to VLEO levels of AO fluence — proving our AO mitigation worked.</p><p>Thanks to our friends at LeoLabs, we've validated that Clarity is maintaining attitude autonomously. She's still up there, still oriented, still descending through VLEO. Just not talking to us.</p><p>Even before this, we had started developing an in-house TT&amp;C radio for our systems moving forward, rather than reusing this radio that was procured from a third party. We’ll incorporate learnings from this reliability issue into that.</p><p>We're still working the problem. This chapter isn't over yet. But even if it is, Clarity-1 gave us what we needed to build what comes next.</p><p>If you think about exquisite imagery as a pyramid, we needed 100% of the systems working together to achieve the pinnacle: 10 cm visible imagery. We got to about 98%. Everything else in that pyramid — the entire foundation — is proven and retired.</p><p>Our drag coefficient. Our atomic oxygen resilience. Our solar arrays. Our thermal management. Our flight software. Our ground software. Our CMG steering laws. Our precision pointing algorithms. Our payload electronics. Our sensor performance. Our image processing chain. Our ability to operate sustainably in VLEO. Our team.</p><p>We know exactly what to fix. It’s straight forward: operate the CMGs at lower temperature. The system thermal design is already updated in the next build to maximize CMG life going forward.</p><p>Beyond the CMGs, there were a handful of learnings on the margins. We learned our secondary mirror structure could be stiffer — already in the updated design. We learned we could use more heater capacity in some payload zones — already fixed.</p><p>We learned from the things that worked, too. We're well down the development path for next-gen flight software, avionics, and power distribution. Orbit determination and geolocation will be even better. Additional surface treatments will improve drag coefficient further. Power-generation will increase while maintaining the proven atomic oxygen resilience. The list goes on.</p><p>The path to exquisite imagery is clear. And that’s only one of many exciting capabilities unlocked by sustainable operations in VLEO.</p><p>Our next VLEO mission will incorporate these learnings and demonstrate new features that enable missions beyond imaging — we’ll share more details soon. In parallel, imaging remains a core focus: we’re continuing to build optical payloads for EO/IR missions as part of a broader VLEO roadmap.</p><p>The successes of Clarity-1 reinforced our core conviction: VLEO isn’t just a better orbit for imaging — it’s the next productive orbital layer.</p><p>The physics are unforgiving, but that’s exactly why it matters. Go lower and you unlock a step-change in performance: sharper sensing, faster links, lower latency, and a new level of responsiveness. The reason VLEO has been written off for decades isn’t lack of upside — it’s that most satellites simply can’t survive there long enough to matter.</p><p>Clarity proved the hard parts: sustainable VLEO operations, validated drag and lifetime models, atomic oxygen resilience, and a flight-proven high-performance bus. We’re not speculating about VLEO. We’re operating in it, learning in it, and capitalized to scale it.</p>",

A day or two later this appeared in my web client as well. Look, I love our new overlords (for the record m'lords I nearly always use \"please\" and \"thank you\").

So I lived with the AI summary at the top. For a week. Then this morning, I saw several messages in my Primary tab that normally get sorted into Promotions, Social, Updates or Forums. This is not unheard of; sometimes a company uses a new incoming address or something and stuff gets put in the wrong bucket.</p><p>But  time, I got a popup that says I must \"Share\" this message with Google and links to the Privacy Policy and Google Terms of Service. And an explicit sentence:</p><blockquote><p>\"Messages and attachments might be reviewed by humans, so don't share any sensitive or confidential information.\"</p></blockquote><p>I'm not naive. I'm an early adopter, my email address includes my name and no numbers. I was a direct marketer when we still were the red-headed step-children of the product managers.  I carpooled to Symantec with Google employee no 11's girlfriend (Go Beavers!) From the get-go, having Google read my email in order to provide targeted advertising was part of the deal. I was fine with that.</p><p>... now... what they are saying is that... we are going to use your email to train our LLMs. I'm not okay with that. That knowledge of my way of writing, my personal details, my confidential commercial information is  okay to use to train your models.

      "content": "<p>Today we’re going to be taking a look at what almost 13 years of development has done for the Raspberry Pi. I have one of each generation of Pi from the original Pi that was launched in 2012 through to the Pi 5 which was released just over a year ago.</p><p>We’ll take a look at what has changed between each generation and how their performance and power consumption has improved by running some tests on them.</p><p>Here’s my video of the testing process and results, read on for the write-up;</p><h2>Purchase Links For Components Used In These Tests</h2><p><em>Some of the above parts are affiliate links. By purchasing products through the above links, you’ll be supporting this channel, at no additional cost to you.</em></p><h2>Hardware Changes Through Each Generation</h2><p>This is the original Raspberry Pi, which was launched in February 2012.</p><p>This Pi has a Broadcom BCM2835 SOC which features a single ARM1176JZF-S core running at 700MHz along with a VideoCore IV GPU. It has 512 MB of DDR RAM.</p><p>In terms of connectivity, it only has 100Mb networking and 2 x USB 2.0 ports. Video output is 1080P through a full-size HDMI port or analogue video out through a composite video connector and audio output is provided through a 3.5mm audio jack. It doesn’t have any WiFi or Bluetooth connectivity but it does have some of the features that we still have on more recent models like DSI and CSI ports, a full size SD card reader for the operating system and GPIO pins, although only 26 of them at this stage.</p><p>Power is supplied through a micro USB port and it is rated for 5V and 700mA.</p><p>It was priced at $35 – which at the time was incredibly cheap for what was essentially a palm-sized computer.</p><p>The Raspberry Pi 2 was launched 3 years later, in February 2015 and this Pi looked quite different to the original and similar to the Pi’s we know today.</p><p>The Pi 2 has a significantly better processor than the original. The Broadcom BCM2836 SOC has 4 Cortex-A7 cores running at 900 MHz and it retained the same VideoCore IV GPU. RAM was also bumped up to 1GB.</p><p>It added another 2 x USB 2.0 ports alongside the 100Mb Ethernet port. The composite video port disappeared and the analogue video output was moved into the audio jack.</p><p>The GPIO pins were increased to 40 pins which has followed the same pin layout since – which has really helped in maintaining compatibility with hats and accessories. The SD card reader was also changed to a microSD card reader.</p><p>The power circuitry was bumped up to 800mA to accommodate the more powerful CPU.</p><p>The Raspberry Pi 3 was launched just a year later, in February 2016.</p><p>The Pi 3’s new Broadcom BCM2837 SOC retained the same 4-core architecture but these were changed to 64-bit Cortex A53 cores running at 1.2Ghz.</p><p>RAM was kept at 1GB but was now DDR2.</p><p>There was no change to the USB or Ethernet connectivity on the original Pi 3 but we did see WiFi and Bluetooth added for the first time. WiFi was single band 2.4GHz and we had Bluetooth 4.1.</p><p>The version that I have is actually the 3B+, which was launched a little later. The main improvements over the original Pi 3 were a 0.2GHz boost to the clock speed and the upgrade to Gigabit networking with PoE (Power over Ethernet) support and dual-band WiFi.</p><p>The power circuitry was again improved, still running at 5V but now up to 1.34A, which was almost double the Pi 2.</p><p>Next came the Pi 4 in June 2019. This Pi came at one of the worst times for global manufacturing and was notoriously difficult to get hold of due to the impact of COVID on the global supply chain. Quite ironically, this hard-to-get Pi is the one that I’ve got the most of, mainly due to my <a href=\"https://www.the-diy-life.com/building-a-water-cooled-raspberry-pi-4-cluster/\">water-cooled Pi cluster build</a>.</p><p>The Pi 4 has a Broadcom BCM2711 SOC with 4 Cortex-A72 cores running at 1.5GHz. So again a slight clock speed increase over the Pi 3 but still retaining 4 cores. It also includes a bump up to a VideoCore VI GPU.</p><p>This was the first model to feature different RAM configurations. It was originally available in 1, 2, 4GB variants featuring LPDDR4 RAM and in March of 2020 an 8GB variant was added to the linup as well. This obviously resulted in a few different price points but impressively they still managed to keep a $35 offering 7 years after the launch of the first Pi.</p><p>It retained the same form factor as the Pi 3 but with the network and Ethernet ports switched around. Notably, two of the USB ports were upgraded to USB 3.0, networking was now gigabit ethernet like the 3B+, WiFi was dual-band and it had Bluetooth 5.0.</p><p>They also changed the single full-size HDMI port to two micro HDMI ports. Most people I know don’t like this change and find it annoying to have to use adaptors to work with common displays and these micro HDMI ports are prone to breaking when they are used often. I think general hobbyists and makers would prefer this to still be a single full-size port but Pi’s are often used in commercial display applications so I guess that’s why they went with this dual micro HDMI configuration.</p><p>The power circuit was actually reduced in this model, from 1.34 down to 1.25A and the port was changed to USB C.</p><p>Lastly and most recently we have the Pi 5 which was launched in October 2023.</p><p>This Pi features a Broadcom BCM2712 SOC with 4 Cortex A76 cores running at a significantly faster 2.4Ghz and a VideoCore VII GPU running at 800MHz.</p><p>So quite a bump up in CPU and GPU performance.</p><p>It is offered in 3 RAM configurations but the drop in a 1GB offering means that they’re no longer available at the $35 price point. There is a fairly significant increase in price up to $50 for the base 2GB variant.</p><p>Some other notable changes are the inclusion of a PCIe port which enables IO expansion and a much improved power circuit. The PCIe port is quite commonly used to add an NVMe SSD instead of a microSD card for the operating system.</p><p>The power circuit was upgraded to handle the PCIe port addition, now stepping up to 5V at up to 5A, along with a power button for the first time.</p><p>The change in power supply requirements to 5V and 5A is a bit annoying as most power delivery capable supplies cap out 2.5 or 3A at 5V. It would have been more universal to require a 9V 3A supply to meet the Pis power requirements. I assume they steered away from this because the Pi’s circuitry runs at 5V and 3.3V and they would have then needed to add another onboard DC-DC converter which increases complexity, size and potentially the cost, it would also have made it a bit less efficient. But this does mean that you most likely need to buy a USB C power supply that has been purpose-built for the Pi 5.</p><p>The Pi 5 is also the first Pi to have its own dedicated fan socket.</p><p>So that’s a summary of the hardware changes, now let’s boot them up and take a look at their performance.</p><h2>Testing The Performance Of Each Generation Of Pi</h2><p>To compare the performance between the Pi’s, I’m going to run the following tests.</p><ul><li>I’m going to attempt to playback a  in the browser, although I expect we’ll have problems with this up to the Pi 4.</li><li>We’ll then run a  which I’ll do both for a single-core and multicore.</li><li>Then we’ll run a .</li><li>Then test the storage speed using <strong>James Chambers Pi Benchmark script</strong>.</li><li>Then we’ll run an  test.</li><li>Lastly, we’ll look at , both at idle and with the CPU maxed out.</li><li>And then use that data to determine each Pi’s .</li></ul><p>To keep things as consistent as possible I’m going to be running the latest available version of Pi OS from <a href=\"https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/\">Raspberry Pi Imager</a> for each Pi. I was pleasantly surprised to find that you can still flash an OS image for the original Pi in their latest version of Imager.</p><p>I’ll be testing them all running on a 32GB Sandisk Ultra microSD card. I’ll also be using an Ice Tower cooler on each to ensure they don’t run anywhere near thermal throttling.</p><h3>1080P YouTube Video Playback</h3><p>I started with the original Pi and its first boot and setup process was a lesson in patience. It took me the best part of two hours to get the first boot complete, the Pi updated and the testing utilities installed but I got there in the end.</p><p>Even once set up it takes about 8 minutes to boot up to the desktop and the CPU stays pegged at 100% for another two to three minutes before dropping down to about 20% at idle.</p><p>The original Pi refused to open up the browser, so that’s where my YouTube video playback test ended.</p><p>The Pi 2 managed to open the browser and actually started playing back a 1080P video, which was surprising, but playback was terrible. It dropped pretty much all of the frames both in the window and fullscreen.</p><p>The Pi 3 played video back noticeably better than the Pi 2, but it’s still quite a long way away from being usable and still drops a lot of frames.</p><p>The Pi 4 handled 1080P video reasonably well. It had some initial trouble but then settled down. Fullscreen is also a bit choppy but is also usable.</p><p>The Pi 5 handled 1080P playback well without any significant issues both in the window and fullscreen.</p><p>Next was the Sysbench CPU benchmark. I ran three tests on each and averaged the scores and I did this for both single-core and multicore.</p><p>In single core, the Pi 1 managed a rather dismal score of 68, the Pi 2 got a bit more than double this score but the real step up was with the Pi 3 which managed 18 times higher than the Pi 2. The Pi 4 and Pi 5 also offered good improvements on the previous generations.</p><p>Similarly in multicore, the Pi 3 scored over 18 times the score of the Pi2 and the Pi 4 and 5 provided good improvements on the Pi 3’s score.</p><p>Comparing the combined multicore score of the Pi 5 to what the single core on the Pi 1 can do, the Pi 5 is a little over 600 times faster.</p><p>Next, I tried running a GLMark2 GPU benchmark on them. I used the <a href=\"https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/focal/man1/glmark2-es2-wayland.1.html\">GLMark2-es2-wayland</a> version which is designed for OpenGL ES so that the Pi 1 was supported.</p><p>I was surprised that the Pi 1 was even able to run GLMark2 – it did complete the benchmark, although the score wasn’t all that impressive.</p><p>These results really show how the Pi’s GPU has improved in the last two generations. Prior to these tests, I had never seen a score below 100 and the Pi 1, 2 and 3 managed to fall short of triple digits. Pi 5 scored over 2.5 times higher than the Pi 4.</p><p>Next was the storage speed test using <a href=\"https://github.com/TheRemote/PiBenchmarks\">James Chambers Pi Benchmarks</a> script. The bus speed has increased over the years from 25MHz on the Pi 1 to 100MHz on the Pi 5, so I expect we’ll see these reflected in the benchmark scores.</p><p>The storage speed test’s results aren’t as dramatic as the CPU and GPU results but show a steady improvement between generations. The Pi 3 did a bit worse than the Pi 2 but this small difference is likely just due to variability in the tests.</p><p>Next, I ran the iPerf network speed test on each.</p><p>The Pi 1 doesn’t quite get close to its theoretical 100Mbps but the Pi 2 does. The Pi 3 B+ although having Gigabit Ethernet is limited by this running over USB 2.0 which only has a theoretical maximum of 300MBps, so it came quite close. Both the Pi 4 and 5 expectedly come close to theoretical Gigabit speeds.</p><p>Lastly, I tested the power consumption of each Pi at idle and under load.</p><p>I used the same Pi 5 power adaptor to test all of the Pis to keep things consistent and I just used a USB C to micro USB adaptor for the Pi 1, 2 and 3.</p><p>The idle results were closer than I expected. The Pi 2 had the lowest idle power draw and the Pi 5 the highest, but all were within a watt or two of each other. At full load, you can see the increase in CPU power draw more physical power with the Pi 5 drawing almost three times the Pi 1 and Pi 2.</p><p>Converted to performance per watt using the Sysbench results, we can again see how much better the Pi 4 and 5 are over the Pi 1 and 2. There is a clear improvement in the performance that each generation of Pi is able to get per watt of power, which is essentially its efficiency. Although the Pi 5 draws more power than the Pi 1 under full load, you’re getting almost 200 times more power out of it per watt.</p><h2>Final Thoughts On The Drag Race And Future Pis</h2><p>I really enjoyed working through this project to see how much Pi’s have changed over the years, particularly in terms of performance. I still remember being amazed at the size and price of the original Pi when it came out and it’s great that they’re still fully supported and can still be used for projects – albeit with less CPU-intensive projects.</p><p>Let me know what you think has been the biggest improvement to the Pi over the years and what you’d still like to see added to future models in the comments section below.</p><p>I personally really like the addition of the PCIe port on the Pi 5 and I’d like to see 2.5Gb networking and a DisplayPort or USB C with DisplayPort added to a future generation of Pi.</p>",

These keys enable the ability to decrypt and access the data on a computer running Windows, giving law enforcement the means to break into a device and access its data.</p><p>The news comes as Forbes reports that Microsoft gave the FBI the BitLocker encryption keys to access a device in Guam that law enforcement believed to have \"evidence that would help prove individuals handling the island’s Covid unemployment assistance program were part of a plot to steal funds\" in early 2025.</p><a data-url=\"\" href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/microsoft-bitlocker-encryption-keys-give-fbi-legal-order-privacy-nightmare\" target=\"_blank\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer-when-downgrade\" data-hl-processed=\"none\"></a><p aria-hidden=\"true\">This was possible because the device in question had its BitLocker encryption key saved in the cloud. By default, Windows 11 forces the use of a Microsoft Account, and the OS will automatically tie your BitLocker encryption key to your online account so that users can easily recover their data in scenarios where they might get locked out. This can be disabled, letting you choose where to save them locally, but the default behavior is to store the key in Microsoft's cloud when setting up a PC with a Microsoft Account.</p><p aria-hidden=\"true\"><em>\"While key recovery offers convenience, it also carries a risk of unwanted access, so Microsoft believes customers are in the best position to decide... how to manage their keys,”</em> Microsoft spokesperson Charles Chamberlayne said in a statement to Forbes.</p><p>Microsoft told Forbes that it receives around 20 requests for BitLocker encryption keys from the FBI a year, but the majority of requests are unable to be met because the encryption key was never uploaded to the company's cloud.</p><p>This is notable as other tech companies, such as Apple, have famously refused to provide law enforcement with access to encrypted data stored on their products. Apple has openly fought against the FBI in the past when it was asked to provide a backdoor into an iPhone. Other tech giants, such as Meta, will store encryption keys in the cloud, but use zero-knowledge architectures and encrypt the keys server-side so that only the user can access them.</p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check=\"\"><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\"></figcaption></figure><p>It's frankly shocking that the encryption keys that do get uploaded to Microsoft aren't encrypted on the cloud side, too. That would prevent Microsoft from seeing the keys, but it seems that, as things currently stand, those keys are available in an unencrypted state, and it is a privacy nightmare for customers.</p><p>To see Microsoft so willingly hand over the keys to encrypted Windows PCs is concerning, and should make everybody using a modern Windows computer think twice before backing up their keys to the cloud.

      "content": "<div><div>\nMany Small Queries Are Efficient In SQLite\n</div></div><ul><li><p>\n200 SQL statements per webpage is excessive for client/server database\nengines like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server.\n\n</p></li><li><p>\nBut with SQLite, 200 or more SQL statement per webpage is not a problem.\n\n</p></li><li><p>\nSQLite can also do large and complex queries efficiently, just like\nclient/server databases.  But SQLite can do many smaller queries\nefficiently too.  Application developers can use whichever technique\nworks best for the task at hand.\n     \n</p></li></ul><p>\nThe <a href=\"https://www.sqlite.org/whentouse.html#website\">Appropriate Uses For SQLite</a> page says that\ndynamic pages on the SQLite website typically do about 200 SQL\nstatements each.\nThis has provoked criticism from readers.  Examples:\n\n</p><ul><li><p><i>\"200 SQL statements is a ridiculously high number for a single page\"</i></p></li><li><p><i>\"For most sites, 200 queries is way, way, way too much.\"</i></p></li></ul><p>\nSuch criticism would be well-founded for a traditional client/server\ndatabase engine, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server.  In\na client/server database, each SQL statement requires a message\nround-trip from the application to the database server and back to\nthe application.  Doing over 200 round-trip messages, sequentially,\ncan be a serious performance drag.  This is sometimes called the\n\"N+1 Query Problem\" or the \"N+1 Select Problem\" and it is an anti-pattern.\n\n</p><p>\nSQLite is  client/server, however.  The SQLite database runs\nin the same process address space as the application.  Queries do not\ninvolve message round-trips, only a function call.  The latency\nof a single SQL query is far less in SQLite.  Hence, using a large number\nof queries with SQLite is not the problem.\n\n</p><p>\nThe first group of queries in the log are extracting display options\nfrom the \"config\" and \"global_config\" tables of the Fossil database.\nThen there is a single complex query that extracts a list of all elements\nto be displayed on the timeline.\nThis \"timeline\" query demonstrates that SQLite can easily process complex\nrelational database queries involving multiple tables, subqueries, and\ncomplex WHERE clause constraints, and it can make effective use of indexes\nto solve the queries with minimal disk I/O.\n\n</p><p>\nFollowing the single big \"timeline\" query, \nthere are additional queries for each timeline element.\nFossil is using the \"N+1 Query\" pattern rather than trying\nto grab all the information in as few queries as possible.\nBut that is ok because there is no unnecessary IPC overhead.\nAt the bottom of\neach timeline page, Fossil shows approximately how long it took to generate\nthe page.  For a 50-entry timeline, the latency is usually less than\n25 milliseconds.  Profiling shows that few of those milliseconds\nwere spent inside the database engine.\n\n</p><p>\nUsing the N+1 Query pattern in Fossil does not harm the application.  \nBut the N+1 Query pattern does have benefits.  For one, the\nsection of the code that creates the timeline query can be\ncompletely separate from the section that prepares each timeline\nentry for display.\nThis provides a separation of responsibility that helps keep the code\nsimple and easy to maintain.  Secondly, the information\nneeded for display, and the queries needed to extract that information,\nvary according to what type of objects are to be shown.  Check-ins need one\nset of queries.  Tickets need another set of queries.  Wiki pages need a\ndifferent query.  And so forth.  By implementing these queries on-demand\nand in the part of the code dealing with the various entities, there is\nfurther separation of responsibility and simplification of the overall \ncode base.\n\n</p><p>\nSo, SQLite is able to do one or two large and complex queries, or it can\ndo many smaller and simpler queries.  Both are efficient.  An application\ncan use either or both techniques, depending on what works best for the\nsituation at hand.\n\n</p><p>\nThe following is a log of all SQL used to generate one particular\ntimeline

      "content": "<p>I’ve been using GitLab for my private projects for years now. I just started using it at some point and never had a reason to switch.</p><p>Back when GitHub still charged for private repositories, GitLab offered them for free. That was the initial hook. I had a bunch of small projects and experiments that I didn’t want to publish but also didn’t want to pay for. GitLab was the obvious choice.</p><p>GitHub eventually made private repos free too, but by then my workflow was already built around GitLab. All my CI pipelines, Docker images, deployment scripts - everything pointed there.</p><h2>The Docker registry thing</h2><p>Every GitLab project comes with a Container Registry. This is probably the feature I use most.</p><p>The workflow is simple. Build an image locally or in CI, push it to the registry, pull it wherever you need it.</p><p>No separate Docker Hub account. No thinking about pull rate limits (remember when Docker Hub introduced those and broke half the internet’s CI pipelines?). No managing access tokens for yet another service.</p><p>For my private projects this is perfect. I don’t need the discoverability of Docker Hub. I just need a place to store images that integrates with my existing authentication.</p><p>The 10GB limit per project sounds small on paper but I’ve never come close to hitting it. Old tags get cleaned up, base layers are shared, and most of my images aren’t that big anyway.</p><p>GitLab CI was one of the earlier “CI config as code” implementations that I used. You drop a  in your repo and things start happening. The config is versioned with everything else, which means you can see exactly what your pipeline looked like six months ago.</p><p>Nothing fancy. Build the image, push it, optionally deploy. The manual trigger on deploy is nice - I can build automatically but still control when things go to production.</p><p>The shared runners GitLab provides handle most of my workloads. They’re not fast, but they’re free and reliable. For the times when I needed something specific - like a runner with more memory or access to my private network - setting up my own runner on a cheap VPS was straightforward. Install the runner, register it with a token, done.</p><p>The documentation for CI/CD is extensive. Almost too extensive. There are so many features and options that finding what you need can take a while. But once you figure out your patterns, you mostly copy-paste from your own previous configs.</p><p>Let’s talk about what’s not great.</p><p> The GitLab web interface has always felt sluggish to me. Click on a merge request, wait. Switch to the pipeline view, wait. Open the job log, wait. It’s not terrible, but there’s this constant friction that adds up over a long session.</p><p>I’ve noticed improvements recently. Either they optimized things or I’ve just gotten used to it - hard to say. But it’s still not as snappy as GitHub.</p><p> GitLab tries to be everything. Issue tracking, project management, wiki, snippets, package registry, container registry, security scanning, infrastructure management, monitoring… The sidebar menu goes on forever.</p><p>I use maybe 10% of what’s available. Repositories, merge requests, CI/CD, container registry. That’s pretty much it.</p><p>This is a double-edged sword. On one hand, feature bloat. On the other, if I ever need something like a private NPM registry or security scanning, it’s already there. I just haven’t needed it yet.</p><p>I run about a dozen private projects ranging from active side projects to abandoned experiments I keep around “just in case.” None of this costs me anything. It’s crazy.</p><p>All my private projects live on GitLab. Prototypes, experiments, half-finished ideas, things I’m actively working on but not ready to share. It’s my digital workshop where I can make a mess without anyone watching.</p><p>GitHub is different. That’s where I put things I want people to see.</p><p>This split works well for me. I get the collaboration and visibility benefits of GitHub for public stuff while keeping my private mess organized on GitLab with proper CI/CD and container registries.</p><p>Some people do everything on GitHub. Some do everything on GitLab. Having a foot in both camps might seem redundant but honestly, they serve different purposes in my workflow.</p>",

      "content": "<p>There’s a kind of polite fiction at the heart of the software industry. It goes something like this:</p><blockquote><p>Estimating how long software projects will take is very hard, but not impossible. A skilled engineering team can, with time and effort, learn how long it will take for them to deliver work, which will in turn allow their organization to make good business plans.</p></blockquote><p>This is, of course, false. As every experienced software engineer knows, <strong>it is not possible to accurately estimate software projects</strong>. The tension between this polite fiction and its well-understood falseness causes a lot of strange activity in tech companies.</p><p>For instance, many engineering teams estimate work in <a href=\"https://asana.com/resources/t-shirt-sizing\">t-shirt sizes</a> instead of time, because it just feels too obviously silly to the engineers in question to give direct time estimates. Naturally, these t-shirt sizes are immediately translated into hours and days when the estimates make their way up the management chain.</p><p>Alternatively, software engineers who are genuinely trying to give good time estimates have ridiculous <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19671824\">heuristics</a> like “double your initial estimate and add 20%“. This is basically the same as giving up and saying “just estimate everything at a month”.</p><p>Should tech companies just stop estimating? One of my guiding principles is that <strong>when a tech company is doing something silly, they’re probably doing it for a good reason</strong>. In other words, practices that appear to not make sense are often serving some more basic, <a href=\"https://www.seangoedecke.com/seeing-like-a-software-company\">illegible</a> role in the organization. So what is the actual purpose of estimation, and how can you do it well as a software engineer?</p><h3>Why estimation is impossible</h3><p>Before I get into that, I should justify my core assumption a little more. People <a href=\"https://world.hey.com/dhh/software-estimates-have-never-worked-and-never-will-a41a9c71\">have</a><a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18487253\">written</a><a href=\"https://medium.com/@riaanfnel/the-problem-with-estimates-f3d5cddd5e62\">a lot</a> about this already, so I’ll keep it brief.</p><p>I’m also going to concede that <strong>sometimes you can accurately estimate software work</strong>, when that work is very well-understood and very small in scope. For instance, if I know it takes half an hour to deploy a service, and I’m being asked to update the text in a link, I can accurately estimate the work at something like 45 minutes: five minutes to push the change up, ten minutes to wait for CI, thirty minutes to deploy.</p><p>For most of us, the majority of software work is not like this. We work on poorly-understood systems and cannot predict exactly what must be done in advance. Most programming in large systems is : identifying prior art, mapping out enough of the system to understand the effects of changes, and so on. Even for fairly small changes, we simply do not know what’s involved in making the change until we go and look.</p><p>The pro-estimation dogma says that these questions ought to be answered during the planning process, so that each individual piece of work being discussed is scoped small enough to be accurately estimated. I’m not impressed by this answer. It seems to me to be a throwback to the bad old days of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_architect\">software architecture</a>, where one architect would map everything out in advance, so that individual programmers simply had to mechanically follow instructions. Nobody does that now, because it doesn’t work: programmers must be empowered to make architectural decisions, because they’re the ones who are actually in contact with the code. Even if it did work, that would simply shift the impossible-to-estimate part of the process backwards, into the planning meeting (where of course you can’t write or run code, which makes it near-impossible to accurately answer the kind of questions involved).</p><p>In short: software engineering projects are not dominated by the known work, but by the unknown work, which always takes 90% of the time. However, only the known work can be accurately estimated. It’s therefore impossible to accurately estimate software projects in advance.</p><h3>Estimates do not come from engineers</h3><p>Estimates do not help engineering teams deliver work more efficiently. Many of the most productive years of my career were spent on teams that did no estimation at all: we were either working on projects that had to be done no matter what, and so didn’t really need an estimate, or on projects that would deliver a constant drip of value as we went, so we could just keep going indefinitely.</p><p>In a very real sense, <strong>estimates aren’t even made by engineers at all</strong>. If an engineering team comes up with a long estimate for a project that some VP really wants, they will be pressured into lowering it (or some other, more compliant engineering team will be handed the work). If the estimate on an undesirable project - or a project that’s intended to “hold space” for future unplanned work - is too short, the team will often be encouraged to increase it, or their manager will just add a 30% buffer.</p><p>One exception to this is projects that are technically impossible, or just genuinely prohibitively difficult. If a manager consistently fails to pressure their teams into giving the “right” estimates, that can send a signal up that maybe the work can’t be done after all. Smart VPs and directors will try to avoid taking on technically impossible projects.</p><p>Another exception to this is areas of the organization that senior leadership doesn’t really care about. In a sleepy backwater, often the formal estimation process does actually get followed to the letter, because there’s no director or VP who wants to jump in and shape the estimates to their ends. This is one way that some parts of a tech company can have drastically different engineering cultures to other parts. I’ll let you imagine the consequences when the company is re-orged and these teams are pulled into the spotlight.</p><p><strong>Estimates are political tools for non-engineers in the organization</strong>. They help managers, VPs, directors, and C-staff decide on which projects get funded and which projects get cancelled. </p><h3>Estimates define the work, not the other way around</h3><p>The standard way of thinking about estimates is that you start with a proposed piece of software work, and you then go and figure out how long it will take. <strong>This is entirely backwards.</strong> Instead, teams will often start with the estimate, and then go and figure out what kind of software work they can do to meet it.</p><p>Suppose you’re working on a LLM chatbot, and your director wants to implement “talk with a PDF”. If you have six months to do the work, you might implement a robust file upload system, some pipeline to chunk and embed the PDF content for semantic search, a way to extract PDF pages as image content to capture formatting and diagrams, and so on. If you have one day to do the work, you will naturally search for simpler approaches: for instance, converting the PDF to text client-side and sticking the entire thing in the LLM context, or offering a plain-text “grep the PDF” tool.</p><p>This is true at even at the level of individual lines of code. When you have weeks or months until your deadline, you might spend a lot of time thinking airily about how you could refactor the codebase to make your new feature fit in as elegantly as possible. When you have hours, you will typically be laser-focused on finding an approach that will actually work. There are always many different ways to solve software problems. Engineers thus have quite a lot of discretion about how to get it done.</p><p>So how do I estimate, given all that?</p><p><strong>I gather as much political context as possible before I even look at the code</strong>. How much pressure is on this project? Is it a casual ask, or do we  to find a way to do this? What kind of estimate is my management chain looking for? There’s a huge difference between “the CTO  wants this in one week” and “we were looking for work for your team and this seemed like it could fit”.</p><p>Ideally, I go to the code <strong>with an estimate already in hand</strong>. Instead of asking myself “how long would it take to do this”, where “this” could be any one of a hundred different software designs, I ask myself “which approaches could be done in one week?“.</p><p><strong>I spend more time worrying about unknowns than knowns</strong>. As I said above, unknown work always dominates software projects. The more “dark forests” in the codebase this feature has to touch, the higher my estimate will be - or, more concretely, the tighter I need to constrain the set of approaches to the known work.</p><p>Finally, <strong>I go back to my manager with a risk assessment, not with a concrete estimate</strong>. I don’t ever say “this is a four-week project”. I say something like “I don’t think we’ll get this done in one week, because X Y Z would need to all go right, and at least one of those things is bound to take a lot more work than we expect. Ideally, I go back to my manager with a  of plans, not just one:</p><ul><li>We tackle X Y Z directly, which  all go smoothly but if it blows out we’ll be here for a month</li><li>We bypass Y and Z entirely, which would introduce these other risks but possibly allow us to hit the deadline</li><li>We bring in help from another team who’s more familiar with X and Y, so we just have to focus on Z</li></ul><p>In other words, I don’t “break down the work to determine how long it will take”. My management chain already knows how long they want it to take. <strong>My job is to figure out the set of software approaches that match that estimate.</strong></p><p>Sometimes that set is empty: the project is just impossible, no matter how you slice it. In that case, my management chain needs to get together and figure out some way to alter the requirements. But if I always said “this is impossible”, my managers would find someone else to do their estimates. When I do that, I’m drawing on a well of trust that I build up by making pragmatic estimates the rest of the time.</p><h3>Addressing some objections</h3><p>Many engineers find this approach distasteful. One reason is that they don’t like estimating in conditions of uncertainty, so they insist on having all the unknown questions answered in advance. I have written a lot about this in <a href=\"https://www.seangoedecke.com/taking-a-position\"><em>Engineers who won’t commit</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.seangoedecke.com/clarity\"><em>How I provide technical clarity to non-technical leaders</em></a>, but suffice to say that I think it’s cowardly. If you refuse to estimate, you’re forcing someone less technical to estimate for you.</p><p>Some engineers think that their job is to constantly push back against engineering management, and that helping their manager find technical compromises is betraying some kind of sacred engineering trust. I wrote about this in <a href=\"https://www.seangoedecke.com/a-little-bit-cynical\"><em>Software engineers should be a little bit cynical</em></a>. If you want to spend your career doing that, that’s fine, but I personally find it more rewarding to find ways to work with my managers (who have almost exclusively been nice people).</p><p>Other engineers might say that they rarely feel this kind of pressure from their directors or VPs to alter estimates, and that this is really just the sign of a dysfunctional engineering organization. Maybe! I can only speak for the engineering organizations I’ve worked in. But my suspicion is that these engineers are really just saying that they work “out of the spotlight”, where there’s not much pressure in general and teams can adopt whatever processes they want. There’s nothing wrong with that. But I don’t think it qualifies you to give helpful advice to engineers who do feel this kind of pressure.</p><p>I think software engineering estimation is generally misunderstood.</p><p>The common view is that a manager proposes some technical project, the team gets together to figure out how long it would take to build, and then the manager makes staffing and planning decisions with that information. In fact, it’s the reverse: a manager comes to the team with an estimate already in hand (though they might not come out and admit it), and then the team must figure out what kind of technical project might be possible within that estimate.</p><p>This is because estimates are not by or for engineering teams. They are tools used for managers to negotiate with each other about planned work. Very occasionally, when a project is literally impossible, the estimate can serve as a way for the team to communicate that fact upwards. But that requires trust. A team that is always pushing back on estimates will not be believed when they do encounter a genuinely impossible proposal.</p><p>When I estimate, I extract the range my manager is looking for, and only then do I go through the code and figure out what can be done in that time. I never come back with a flat “two weeks” figure. Instead, I come back with a range of possibilities, each with their own risks, and let my manager make that tradeoff.</p><p><strong>It is not possible to accurately estimate software work.</strong> Software projects spend most of their time grappling with unknown problems, which by definition can’t be estimated in advance. To estimate well, you must therefore basically ignore all the known aspects of the work, and instead try and make educated guesses about how many unknowns there are, and how scary each unknown is.</p><p>edit: I should thank one of my readers, Karthik, who emailed me to ask about estimates, thus revealing to me that I had many more opinions than I thought.</p><p>edit: This post got a bunch of comments on <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46742389\">Hacker News</a>. Some non-engineers made the <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46744538\">point</a> that well-paid professionals should be expected to estimate their work, even if the estimate is completely fictional. Sure, I agree, as long as we’re on the same page that it’s fictional!</p><p>A couple of <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46744696\">engineers</a><a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46744876\">argued</a> that estimation was a solved problem. I’m not convinced by their examples. I agree you can probably estimate “build a user flow in Svelte”, but it’s much harder to estimate “build a user flow in Svelte <em>on top of an existing large codebase</em>”. I should have been more clear in the post that I think that’s the hard part, for the normal reasons that it’s very hard to work in large codebases, which I <a href=\"https://www.seangoedecke.com/large-established-codebases\">write</a><a href=\"https://www.seangoedecke.com/wicked-features\">about</a><a href=\"https://www.seangoedecke.com/clarity\">endlessly</a> on this blog.</p><p>edit: There are also some comments on <a href=\"https://lobste.rs/s/dspppf/how_i_estimate_work_as_staff_software\">Lobste.rs</a>, including a good <a href=\"https://lobste.rs/c/i0sxht\">note</a> that the capability of the team obviously has a huge impact on any estimates. In my experience, this is not commonly understood: companies expect estimates to be fungible between engineers or teams, when in fact some engineers and teams can deliver work ten times more quickly (and others cannot deliver work , no matter how much time they have).</p>",

      "content": "<p>: None of this is written by AI, I’m still a real person writing my own blog like its 1999</p><p>I finally figured out how to do Gigabit Ethernet over my existing phone wires.</p><h2>Powerline adapter and misery</h2><p><strong>I’ve mostly lived with powerline adapters over recent years.</strong>&nbsp;Some worked well, some did not (try few and return what doesn’t work in your home). One I had for a while gave me stable 30 Mbps, which was little but good enough for internet at the time. <strong>I care very much about having stable low latency for gaming, more than bandwidth.</strong></p><p>Fast forward to my current situation, that powerline adapter regularly lost connection which was a major problem. I got some new ones with the latest and greatest G.hn 2400 standard. The final contender served around 180 Mbps to my office (with high variance 120 to 280 Mbps), or around 80 Mbps to the top floor. It’s good enough to watch YouTube/TV yet it’s far from impressive.</p><p>One peculiar thing from the UK: Internet providers don’t truly offer gigabit internet. They have a range of deals like 30 Mbps – 75 Mbps – 150 Mbps – 300 Mbps – 500 Mbps – 900 Mbps, each one costing a few more pounds per month than the last. This makes the UK simultaneously one of the cheapest and one of the most expensive countries to get Internet. </p><p><strong>Long story short, new place, new hardware, new deals, the internet has been running at 500 Mbps for some time now.</strong></p><p><strong>Problem: How to get 500 Mbps to my room?</strong></p><h2>A Fetish for Phone Sockets</h2><p>I’ve been looking for a way to reuse phone wires for a while, because British houses are full of phone sockets. There are 2 sockets in my office room.</p><p><strong>I can’t stress enough how much we love our phone sockets. It’s not uncommon to have a one bed flat with 2 phone sockets in the living room and 2 phone sockets in the bedroom and a master socket in the technical room. It’s ridiculous.</strong></p><p>A new house bought today could have 10 phone sockets and 0 Ethernet sockets. There is still no regulation that requires new build to get Ethernet wiring (as far as I know).</p><p><strong>There’s got to be a way to use the existing phone infrastructure.</strong></p><p>I know the technology exists. It’s one of the rare cases where the technology exists and is mature, but nobody can be bothered to make products for it.</p><p>The standards that run powerline adapters (HomePlug AV200, AV500, G.hn 2400) can work with any pair of wires. It should work ten times better on dedicated phone wires instead of noisy power wires, if only manufacturers could be bothered to pull their fingers out of their arse and make the products that are needed.</p><p>It’s made and shipped from Germany.</p><p>I was lazy so I ordered online in self-service (which is definitely the wrong way to go about it). It’s available on <a href=\"https://www.ebay.de/itm/384796529745\">Ebay DE</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.de/dp/B095N9G8RG?ref=myi_title_dp\">Amazon DE</a>, it’s possible to order from either with a UK account, make sure to enter a UK address for delivery (some items don’t allow it).</p><p>The better approach is almost certainly to speak to the seller to get a quote, with international shipping and the import invoice excluding VAT (to avoid paying VAT on VAT).</p><p>The package got the usual Royal Mail treatment:</p><ul><li>The package was shipped by DHL Germany</li><li>The package was transferred to Royal Mail when entering the UK</li><li>After some days, the DHL website said they tried to deliver but nobody home, this is bullshit</li><li>Royal website said the package reached the depot and was awaiting delivery, this is bullshit</li><li>In reality, the package was stuck at the border, as usual</li><li>Google to find “website to pay import fee on parcel”</li><li>Entered the DHL tracking number into the Royal Mail form for a Royal Mail tracking number</li><li>The website said that the parcel had import fees to pay, this is correct</li><li>Paid the fee online, 20% VAT + a few pounds of handling fees</li><li>The package will be scheduled for delivery a few days later</li><li>Royal Mail and DHL updated their status another two or three times with false information</li><li>Royal Mail delivered a letter saying there was a package waiting on fees, though it was paid</li><li>The package finally arrived</li></ul><p>Basically, you need to follow the tracking regularly until the package is tagged as lost or failed delivery, which is the cue to pay import fees.</p><p><strong>It’s the normal procedure to buy things from Europe since Brexit 2020. It’s actually quite shocking that Royal Mail still hasn’t updated their tracking system to be able to give a status “waiting on import fees to be paid online”. They had 6 years!</strong></p><ul><li>A pair of gigacopper G4201TM</li><li>The device has a German power socket (expected)</li><li>It came with a German to UK power adapter (unexpected and useful)</li><li>It came with a standard RJ11 cable (expected and useless)</li><li>Found BT631A to RJ11 cables online (the standard UK phone socket)</li><li>Found Ethernet cables in my toolbox</li><li>3M removable hanging strip to stick to the wall, the device is very light</li></ul><p>There is a <a href=\"https://www.gigacopper.net/wp/en/home-networking/\">gigacopper G4202TM</a>: with an RJ45 to connect to the phone line instead of a RJ11 (not sure if it’s a newer model or just a variant, as that one has two gigabit Ethernet ports). Don’t be confused by having a RJ45 port that is not a RJ45 port.</p><p>There is a <a href=\"https://www.gigacopper.net/wp/en/home-networking/\">gigacopper G4201C</a> (1 port) and G4204C (4 port) for Ethernet over coaxial. Some countries have coax in every room for TV/satellite. This may be of interest to some readers.</p><p>Reminder, this is a 500 Mbps internet connection.</p><p>I discovered soon afterwards that I bought the wrong item. There is an InHome and a Client/Server variant of the product. Make sure to buy the InHome variant.</p><ul><li>The InHome variant can have up to 16 devices, communicating to any peer on the medium, with sub millisecond latency.</li><li>The client-server variant is preconfigured as a pair, splitting the bandwidth 70% download / 30% upload, with few milliseconds latency. I think it’s a use case for ISP and long range connections.</li></ul><p>Thankfully the difference is only the firmware. I spoke to the vendor who was very helpful and responsive. They sent me the firmware and the tools to patch.</p><p>I have a fetish for low latency. This screenshot is oddly satisfying.</p><p><strong>The web interface says 1713 Mbps on the physical layer, the debugging tool says PHONE 200MHz – Connected 1385 Mbps.</strong></p><p>I wanted to verify whether the device can do a full Gigabit. Unfortunately I realized I don’t have any device that can test that.</p><p>Phones are wireless, which is too slow to test anything. I checked out of curiosity, my phone did 100 Mbps to 400 Mbps right next to the router. Grabbed two laptops only to realize they didn’t have any Ethernet port. I dug up an old laptop from storage with an Ethernet port. The laptop couldn’t boot, the CPU fan didn’t start and the laptop refused to boot with a dead fan.</p><p><strong>There is a hard lesson here: 1 Gbps ought to be enough for any home. Using the phone line is as good as having Ethernet wiring through the house if it can deliver a (shared) 1.7 Gbps link to multiple rooms.</strong></p><p><strong>Still, I really wanted to verify that the device can do a full Gbps, I procured an USB-C to Ethernet adapter.</strong></p><p>Full speed achieved, testing from a phone to a computer with iperf3.</p><p><strong>Some readers might wonder about the wiring.</strong></p><p><strong>I didn’t check the wiring before buying anything because it’s pointless. British sockets are always daisy chained in an incomprehensible maze.</strong></p><p>Phone sockets need 2 wires and can be daisy chained. Ethernet sockets need 8 wires. They often use the same Cat5 cable because it’s the most widely available (8 wires cable, the 6 extra wires can remain unconnected). </p><p>It’s possible to swap the phone socket for an RJ45 socket, if you only have 2 sockets connected with the right cable. It’s not possible when sockets are daisy chained. (You could put a double or triple RJ45 socket with a switch to break a daisy chain, but it quickly becomes impractical in a British house with 5 to 10 sockets in an arbitrary layout.)</p><p><strong>I opened one socket in the office room. There are two Cat5 cables daisy chained. There are 3 wires connected.</strong></p><p>It’s probably daisy chained with the other socket in the room, or it’s daisy chained with the socket in the other room that’s closer. Who knows.</p><p>I opened the BT master socket in the technical room. It should have the cables coming from the other rooms. It should connect the internal phone wires with the external phone line.</p><p>There is one single Cat5 cable. There are 4 wires connected. It’s definitely not a master socket. WTF?!</p><p>It’s interesting that this socket has 4 wires connected but the socket in the office has 3 wires connected. The idiot who did the wiring was inconsistent. The gigacopper device can operate over 2 wires (200 MHz Phone SISO) or over 4 wires (100 MHz Phone MIMO). I can try the other modes if I finish the job.</p><p>The search for the master socket continues. The cables from the other floors should all be coming down somewhere around here.

It’s the hell of a mess.</p><p>Only sure thing, they are different cables because they are different colours. They might be going to a junction box somewhere else. Probably behind a wall that’s impossible to access!</p><p>Conclusion: There is zero chance to get proper Ethernet wiring out of this mess.</p><p><strong>The gigacopper device to do gigabit Ethernet over phone line is a miracle!</strong></p><p>There is an enormous untapped market for gigabit Ethernet over phone sockets in the UK.</p>",

You've got all this to take care of.'\"</p><p>She drove to their insurance company in Escondido, Calif., to transfer the insurance for Peter's truck into her name. Because of the pandemic, the office was staffed by just one person. The woman opened the door to let Sherburne inside, and they sat across from each other at a desk.</p><p>\"It didn't take her but a few minutes to take care of why I was there,\" Sherburne recalled.</p><p>\"When she got done, she stopped and she looked at me across her desk, and she made sure that I was looking at her — that she had my full attention.\"</p><p>\"And she said, 'OK, so now that we've finished with that, people are going to stop and ask you, \"How can I help?\"' And then she gave this pregnant pause, and she said, 'Let them.'\"</p><p>Sherburne took in the advice, absorbing the moment. She wasn't the kind of person to reach out to others for help.</p><p>\"But because she said it with such force, it really, really made sense to me,\" Sherburne said.</p><p>As soon as she got home, she realized that she did need help. The firewood she used to heat her home was running low, and winter was around the corner. Chopping wood was something Peter had always done. But this time, she asked a friend to take care of it.</p><p>\"So many, many people did little things and big things to help me,\" Sherburne said. \"One of the neighbors actually cooked for me for four years — dinners — and her husband delivered the dinners to me.\"</p><p>Sherburne says she would have never reached out for support if not for the advice of the woman at the insurance company.</p><p>\"In the back of my mind, I kept hearing her voice, you know, 'Let them.'\"</p><p>A few years later, Sherburne went back to the insurance office to tell the woman how deeply her words had affected her. But the agent didn't work there anymore.</p><p>\"So I just wanted to tell her how much that meant to me,\" Sherburne said.</p><p>\"It was such a little thing for this woman just to say that to me.

      "content": "<p> in the US opened the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/apps/\">app</a> today, they were greeted with a pop-up asking them to agree to the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/social-media/\">social media</a> platform’s new terms of service and privacy policy before they could resume scrolling.</p><p>These changes are part of TikTok’s transition to new ownership. In order to continue operating in the US, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/tiktok/\">TikTok</a> was compelled by the US government to transition from <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/china-issue/\">Chinese control</a> to a new, American-majority corporate entity. Called TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC, the new entity is made up of a group of investors that includes the software company <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/oracle/\">Oracle</a>.</p><p>It's easy to tap Agree and keep on <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/no-the-freecash-app-wont-pay-you-to-scroll-tiktok/\">scrolling through videos</a> on TikTok, so users might not fully understand the extent of changes they are agreeing to with this pop-up.</p><p>Now that it’s under US-based ownership, TikTok potentially collects more detailed information about its users, including precise location data. A spokesperson for TikTok USDS declined to comment.</p><h2>TikTok Adds Precise Location Tracking</h2><p>TikTok’s change in <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/location/\">location tracking</a> is one of the most notable updates in this new privacy policy. Before this update, the app did not collect the precise, GPS-derived location data of US users. Now, if you give TikTok permission to use your phone’s location services, then the app may collect granular information about your exact whereabouts. Similar kinds of precise location data is also tracked by other social media apps, like <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/instagram/\">Instagram</a> and X.</p><p><em>We collect information about your approximate location, including location information based on your SIM card and/or IP address. In addition, we collect location information (such as tourist attractions, shops, or other points of interest) if you choose to add the location information to your User Content. Current versions of the app do not collect precise or approximate GPS information from US users.</em></p><p><em>We automatically collect certain information from you when you use the Services, including</em> ... l<em>ocation information about your approximate location based on your device and network information, such as SIM card region, IP address, and device system settings. We also collect information, such as tourist attractions, shops, or other points of interest, if you choose to add the location to your user content. Also, if you choose to enable location services for the TikTok app within your device settings, we collect approximate or precise location information from your device.</em></p><h2>TikTok Now Tracks AI Interactions</h2><p>Rather than an adjustment, TikTok’s policy on AI interactions adds a new topic to the privacy policy document. Now, users' interactions with any of TikTok’s AI tools explicitly fall under data that the service may collect and store. This includes any prompts as well as the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/artificial-intelligence/\">AI-generated</a> outputs. The metadata attached to your interactions with AI tools may also be automatically logged.</p><p><em>(These AI interactions are not explicitly mentioned in the past policy.)</em></p><p><em>When you create an account, upload content, contact us directly, or otherwise use the Services, you may provide some or all of the following information … AI interactions, including prompts, questions, files, and other types of information that you submit to our AI-powered interfaces, as well as the responses they generate.</em></p><p><em>We automatically collect certain information from you when you use the Services, including … metadata that is automatically uploaded in connection with your user content, messages, or AI interactions, such as how, when, where, and by whom the user content was created, or message or prompt was sent. Metadata may also include information, such as your username, that enables your user content to be traced back to your account by other users.</em></p><h2>TikTok Expands Its Ads Network</h2><p>This change to TikTok’s privacy policy may not be as immediately noticeable to users, but it will likely have an impact on the types of ads you see outside of TikTok. So, rather than just using your collected data to target you while using the app, TikTok may now further leverage that info to serve you more relevant ads wherever you go online. As part of this advertising change, TikTok also now explicitly mentions publishers as one kind of partner the platform works with to get new data.</p>",

      "content": "<p>A mental model is a simplified explanation of how something works. </p><p>Any idea, belief, or concept can be boiled down to its essence. Like a map, mental models highlight key information while ignoring irrelevant details. They’re tools for compressing complexity into manageable chunks.</p><p>Mental models help us understand the world. For example, velocity shows that both speed and direction matter. Reciprocity reveals how being positive and taking initiative gets the world to do most of the work for you. Margin of Safety reminds us that things don’t always go as planned. Relativity exposes our blind spots and shows how a different perspective can reveal new information. These are just a few examples.</p><figure><blockquote><p>If you want to be a good thinker, you must develop a mind that can jump the jurisdictional boundaries. You don’t have to know it all. Just take in the best big ideas from all these disciplines. And it’s not that hard to do.</p></blockquote></figure><h2>The Big Ideas From The Big Disciplines</h2><p>This page summarizes the big ideas to help you make better decisions, avoid problems, and spot opportunities others miss.</p><p>The map is not the territory reminds us that our mental models of the world are not the same as the world itself. It cautions against confusing our abstractions and representations with the complex, ever-­shifting reality they aim to describe.</p><p>It is dangerous to mistake the map for the territory. Consider the person with an outstanding résumé who checks all the boxes on paper but can’t do the job. </p><p>Updating our maps is a difficult process of reconciling what we want to be true with what is true.</p><p>In many areas of life, we are offered maps by other people. We are reliant on the maps provided by experts, pundits, and teachers. In these cases, the best we can do is to choose our mapmakers wisely and to seek out those who are rigorous, transparent, and open to revision.</p><p>Ultimately, the map/territory distinction invites us to engage with the world as it is, not just as we imagine it. And remember, when you don’t make the map, choose your cartographer wisely.</p><p>The first rule of competition is that you are more likely to win if you play where you have an advantage. Playing to your advantage requires a firm understanding of what you know and don’t know. </p><p>Your circle of competence is your personal sphere of expertise, where your knowledge and skills are concentrated. It’s the domain where you have a deep understanding, where your judgments are reliable, and your decisions are sound.&nbsp;</p><p>The size of your circle isn’t as important as knowing the boundaries. The wise person knows the limits of their knowledge and can confidently say, “This falls within my circle,” or “This is outside my area of expertise.”&nbsp;</p><p>While operating within your circle of competence is a recipe for confidence and effectiveness, venturing outside your circle of competence is a recipe for trouble. You’re like a sailor navigating unfamiliar waters without a map, at the mercy of currents and storms you don’t fully understand. This isn’t to say that you should never venture outside your circle. Learning new things, gaining new skills, and mastering new domains is one of the most beautiful things about life.&nbsp;</p><p>Celebrate your expertise, but also acknowledge your limitations.</p><p>First principles thinking is the art of breaking down complex problems into their fundamental truths. It’s a way of thinking that goes beyond the surface and allows us to see things from a new perspective. </p><p>Thinking in first principles allows us to identify the root causes, strip away the layers of complexity, and focus on the most effective solutions. Reasoning from first principles allows us to step outside the way things have always been done and instead see what is possible. </p><p>First principles thinking is not easy. It requires a willingness to challenge the status quo. This is why it’s often the domain of rebels and disrupters who believe there must be a better way. It’s the thinking of those willing to start from scratch and build from the ground up.</p><p>In a world focused on incremental improvement, first principles thinking offers a competitive advantage because almost no one does it.</p><p>Thought experiments are the sandbox of the mind, the place where we can play with ideas without constraints. They’re a way of exploring the implications of our theories, of testing the boundaries of our understanding. They offer a powerful tool for clarifying our thinking, revealing hidden assumptions, and showing us unintended consequences. </p><p>The power of thought experiments lies in their ability to create a simplified model of reality where we can test our ideas. In the real world, confounding factors and messy details obscure the core principles at work. Thought experiments allow us to strip away the noise and focus on the essence of the problem. </p><p>Thought experiments remind us that some of the most profound insights and innovations start with a simple question: What if?</p><p>Second-­order thinking is a method of thinking that goes beyond the surface level, beyond the knee-­jerk reactions and short-­term gains. It asks us to play the long game, to anticipate the ripple effects of our actions, and to make choices that will benefit us not just today but in the months and years to come. </p><p>Second-order thinking demands we ask: And then what? </p><p>Think of a chess master contemplating her next move. She doesn’t just consider how the move will affect the next turn but how it will shape the entire game. She’s thinking many steps ahead. She’s considering her own strategy and her opponent’s likely response. </p><p>In our daily lives, we’re often driven by first-­order thinking. We make decisions based on what makes us happy now, what eases our current discomfort, or satisfies our immediate desires. </p><p>Second-­order thinking asks us to consider the long-­term implications of our choices to make decisions based not just on what feels good now but on what will lead to the best outcomes over time. </p><p>In the end, second-­order thinking is about playing the long game. It’s about making choices for the next move and the entire journey.</p><p>Probabilistic thinking is the art of navigating uncertainty. Successfully thinking in shades of probability means roughly identifying what matters, calculating the odds, checking our assumptions, and then deciding. </p><p>The challenge of probabilistic thinking is that it requires constant updating. As new information emerges, the probabilities change. What seemed likely yesterday may seem unlikely today. This explains why probabilistic thinkers always revise their beliefs with new data and why it’s uncomfortable for many people. </p><p>It’s much easier to believe something false is accurate than to deal with the fact that we might be wrong. Being a probabilistic thinker means being willing to say, “I don’t know for sure, but based on the evidence, I think there’s a 63 percent chance of X.” The rewards of probabilistic thinking are immense. </p><p>By embracing uncertainty, we can make better decisions, avoid the pitfalls of overconfidence, and navigate complex situations with greater skill and flexibility. We can be more open-­ minded, more receptive to new ideas, and more resilient in the face of change.</p><p>Much of success comes from simply avoiding common paths to failure.</p><p>Inversion is not the way we are taught to think. We are taught to identify what we want and explore things that will move us closer to our objective. However, avoiding things that ensure we don’t get what we want dramatically increases our odds of success.</p><p>We can get fixated on solving problems one way, missing simpler solutions. Inversion breaks us out of this tunnel vision.</p><p>Instead of “How do I solve this?”, inversion asks, “What would guarantee failure?” Rather than “How can I achieve this?”, it asks “What’s preventing me from achieving it?” This flip reveals insights our usual thinking overlooks.</p><p>When facing a tricky problem or ambitious goal, try inverting. Ask how you’d guarantee failure. The answers may surprise you—and unlock new solutions.</p><p>Occam’s razor is the intellectual equivalent of “keep it simple.” </p><p>When faced with competing explanations or solutions, Occam’s razor suggests that the correct explanation is most likely the simplest one, the one that makes the fewest assumptions. This doesn’t mean the simplest theory is always true, only that it should be preferred until proven otherwise. Sometimes, the truth is complex, and the simplest explanation doesn’t account for all the facts. The key to wielding this model is understanding when it works for you and against you.</p><p>A theory that is too simple fails to capture reality, and one that is too complex collapses under its own weight.</p><p>Hanlon’s razor is a mental safeguard against the temptation to label behavior as malicious when incompetence is the most common response. It’s a reminder that people are not out to get you, and it’s best to assume good faith and resist the urge to assign sinister motives without overwhelming evidence. </p><p>This isn’t to say that genuine malice doesn’t exist. Of course, it does. But in most interactions, stupidity is a far more common explanation than malevolence. People make mistakes. They forget things. They speak without thinking. They prioritize short-­term wins over long-term wins. They act on incomplete information. They fall prey to bias and prejudice. These actions might appear like deliberate attacks from the outside, but the reality is far more mundane. </p><p>Hanlon’s razor’s real power lies in how it shifts our perspective. When we assume stupidity rather than malice, we respond differently. Instead of getting defensive or lashing out, we approach the situation with empathy and clarity. </p><p>For most daily frustrations and confusion, Hanlon’s razor is a powerful reminder to approach problems with a spirit of generosity. It’s a way to reduce drama and stress and find practical solutions instead of descending into blame and escalation.</p><h2>The Mental Models of Physics, Chemistry, and Biology</h2><p>Relativity is the idea that our perceptions and judgments are not absolute but are shaped by our unique vantage points and frames of reference. It’s the understanding that our experiences are subjective. </p><p>We each inhabit a particular web of experiences. This context shapes how we see the world, what we notice and overlook, and what we value and dismiss. Two people can look at the same event and come away with vastly different interpretations based on their unique frames of reference. </p><p>Consider two people standing in the same room: They each experience the same absolute temperature differently. One can feel hot while the other feels cold, even though the temperature is the same. Similarly, consider political debates: Our beliefs are shaped by our unique experiences and social contexts. A policy that seems like common sense to an urban progressive might feel like complete nonsense to a rural conservative, and vice versa. In this way, understanding relativity is key to fostering empathy and finding common ground. However, relativity is not the same as relativism—­ the idea that all perspectives are equally valid. </p><p>Recognizing the relativity of our perceptions doesn’t mean we don’t have to make judgments about validity. Instead, it’s a call to examine our assumptions, seek out diverse perspectives, and expand our frames of reference. We all have blind spots—­things we cannot see. Understanding that our perceptions are relative allows us to open ourselves to other ways of seeing. If you’re wondering where to get started, try asking others what they see that you can’t. Apply your judgment to their responses and update your beliefs accordingly.</p><p>Reciprocity underlies everything from basic human kindness to the most complex systems of trade. At its core, reciprocity is the simple idea of treating others as they treat us—giving what we get. But from this simple principle grows a vast web of social interactions and expectations that shapes nearly every aspect of our lives. </p><p>Many people expect the world to just hand them things without effort. This is a poor strategy because it doesn’t align with the human behavior you can observe around you every day. Reciprocation teaches us that you are likely to receive the same if you give people cynicism and curtness or nothing at all. But if you give people an opportunity and the benefit of the doubt, you will, more often than not, be on the receiving end of the same behavior. </p><p>Become what you want to see in the world, and the world will return it to you. If you want an amazing relationship with your partner, be an amazing partner. If you want people to be thoughtful and kind to you, be thoughtful and kind to them. If you want people to listen to you, listen to them. </p><p>The best way to achieve success is to deserve success. Small changes in your actions change your entire world. </p><p>One of the biggest misperceptions about reciprocity is that people should sit around waiting for others to go first rather than unlocking the power of reciprocity in their favor by going positive and going first without expectation. </p><p>Reciprocity reminds us that our actions tend to come back on us. It’s an essential reminder that we are part of the world, and thus, our actions do not happen in isolation but are instead part of an interconnected web of effects.</p><p>Thermodynamics is the science of energy, heat, and work. It’s the set of physical laws that govern how energy moves and changes in the universe. Chances are, when you first came across the subject, it was dry, full of equations and abstract concepts. But the truth is thermodynamics is a useful intellectual framework for daily life. Not only can it reveal why your room gets messier over time, but it also explains why you should choose your friends wisely. </p><p>The first law of thermodynamics states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. This means that every joule of energy in the universe, every bit of heat and work and motion is part of an unbroken chain stretching back to the Big Bang. </p><p>When you hop on a flight that burns jet fuel, you’re tapping into energy captured by plants millions of years ago and stored in chemical bonds until it was transformed into heat and motion. </p><p>But while energy is conserved, it’s not always useful. That’s where the second law of thermodynamics comes in. It states that entropy—­ a measure of disorder—­ increases over time in any closed system. In other words, left on its own, the universe tends toward chaos. Your bedroom doesn’t clean itself—­ it takes energy and effort to maintain order. Stars burn out, structures crumble, and ice melts into water.</p><p>Entropy is the universe’s tax on time. The constant battle against entropy is the driving force behind much of what we do. The constant struggle between order and disorder is the source of change and progress. </p><p>While engineers and scientists use thermodynamics to design engines or calculate the energy requirements of a system, we can use it as a framework for understanding the deep interconnectedness of everything. When you feel the sun’s warmth on your skin, you’re experiencing the result of a thermodynamic process that began in the heart of a star ninety-three million miles away. When you watch a campfire burn down to embers, you’re witnessing the inexorable march of entropy in real-time.</p><p>Thermodynamics is the story of energy across time. We’re part of an energy story that stretches back to the dawn of time and reaches the farthest pockets of space. We can marvel that in a universe ruled by disorder, pockets of temporary order can emerge, whether it’s a clean room, a planet, or a civilization. </p><p>By understanding thermodynamics, we gain not just a technical toolbox but an appreciation for the beauty, complexity, and fragility of our very existence.</p><p>Inertia is the stubborn resistance of the universe to change. It’s why objects at rest tend to stay at rest, and objects in motion tend to stay in motion. You can think of inertia as the guardian of the status quo.</p><p>At its core, inertia is a property of mass. The more massive an object is, the more it resists changes to its state of motion. A feather, with its tiny mass, is easily blown about by the slightest breeze. A boulder, on the other hand, requires a powerful force to get it moving. This is why it takes more effort to push a heavy cart than a light one, more energy to launch a rocket than to toss a ball. </p><p>But inertia isn’t just a physical phenomenon. It’s an illuminating lens to see habits, beliefs, and our resistance to change. The longer we’ve held them, the larger the mass and the more force required to change them. The path of least resistance is always the status quo. </p><p>Getting started is the hardest part. Once something moves in a direction, keeping it in motion is much easier. But once something is in motion, it’s hard to stop. This is why most self-­help books about positive habits break things down into very small steps—­to reduce the force required to overcome the status quo. For example, if you want to get in the habit of doing push-­ups daily, start with one rather than fifty. If you want to start a flossing habit, start with one tooth. After all, the bigger the mass—­in this case, the gap between where you are and where you want to be—­ the more effort required.</p><p>Inertia is both a challenge and an opportunity. Successful companies struggle with the inertia of their success and the resistance to change that comes with size, complexity, and entrenched interests. On the other hand, startups can leverage their lack of inertia—­their agility, their willingness to pivot and adapt—­as a competitive advantage. </p><p>Momentum and inertia are closely related. While inertia is the tendency to resist change, momentum is the oomph an object has when it’s moving. The more momentum something has, the harder it is to stop or redirect. The key is to pick the right direction and build momentum so inertia works to your advantage and carries you forward. This is the essence of the “flywheel” concept in business—success breeds success, and small wins compound into big gains.</p><p>When you’re fighting the status quo, remember the physics at play. Resistance is natural. Understand that building momentum in a new direction takes a sustained force. While the universe resists change, it always rewards those who dare to overcome that resistance.</p><p>Friction and viscosity are the sand in the gears of the universe, the invisible hands that slow the motion of all things. </p><p>Friction is the grip between surfaces in contact, the roughness that resists sliding. Viscosity is the thickness of fluids, the internal friction that makes liquids sluggish and syrupy. Together, they are the great moderators of motion. </p><p>Think of the last time you tried to slide a heavy piece of furniture across the floor. The resistance you felt, the effort required to overcome the grip of the surface—­ that was friction at work. Or consider the slow, thick pour of honey from a jar, the way it clings and drips in slow threads. That’s the viscosity of the fluid resisting the force of gravity, the internal friction that makes the honey flow like molasses rather than water. </p><p>While friction is the enemy of efficiency, it’s also necessary for traction. We couldn’t walk, hold tools, or tie knots without it. Viscosity, too, is a double-­edged sword. In pipelines and hydraulic systems, high viscosity means higher pumping costs, slower flows, and greater strain on equipment. But viscosity also makes oil a good lubricant, allowing paints and coatings to spread evenly and adhere to surfaces.</p><p>Friction and viscosity are powerful metaphors for the forces of resistance in every domain of life. In human relationships, friction is the conflict and tension that arises from differing goals, personalities, or beliefs. The interpersonal roughness can generate heat and wear, but also the traction that allows us to influence and connect with others.</p><p>While often hidden, friction and viscosity work against us whenever we try to do something. We often default to using more force to overcome resistance when simply reducing the friction or viscosity will do. However, doing both is more effective than either in isolation. </p><p>Friction and viscosity can also be wielded as weapons. Rather than try to catch up to the competition with more effort, you might want to explore slowing them down by adding resistance through increased regulation, bureaucracy, or other clever ideas. In the end, reducing resistance is often easier than adding force.</p><p>Velocity is the great differentiator, distinguishing the stagnant from the swift. </p><p>In physics, velocity is a fundamental quantity, a key variable in the equations that describe the behavior of everything from subatomic particles to galaxies. It’s the v in the formulas of motion, the arrow that points the way from here to there. </p><p>Velocity is also a metaphor for life. Consider it the rate at which we learn and grow, the speed at which we innovate and create, and the focus with which we pursue our goals. </p><p>Velocity challenges us to think about what we can do to put ourselves on the right trajectory and to find a balance between mass and speed to move toward our goals. The ability to set a direction, improve your tactics, and adjust to new information becomes paramount. </p><p>Velocity isn’t just about raw speed. Direction matters just as much (if not more). A car moving at high speed in circles goes nowhere, while a slow and steady walk in a straight line can cross continents. </p><p>Velocity is progress. Sometimes, progress comes from more force, and sometimes, progress comes from removing friction. Once you have a destination, you can improve your velocity by working harder and eliminating things that aren’t contributing toward reaching that goal.</p><p>Leverage is the force multiplier of the world, the principle that allows the small to move the large and the few to influence the many. It’s the idea that a little force, strategically applied, can yield outsize outputs.</p><p>At its core, leverage is amplification. Think of a crowbar prying&nbsp;two boards apart or a pulley system hoisting a heavy load. In each case, the appled force is multiplied.&nbsp;But leverage isn’t just useful in physics. Rather, it’s a principle that applies across our lives.</p><p>Leverage is often lurking in the background of nonlinear outcomes. Consider the author who took the ideas in their head, put them in a book, and sold millions of copies, or the Wall Street investor who made a single decision that resulted in billions. Or even the CEO who directs the people working for them. All of these examples are leverage in action.</p><p>In personal development, leverage is about identifying the key habits, skills, and relationships that will impact your life and work most. It’s about focusing your energy on the critical few rather than the trivial many, about finding the points of maximum leverage where small changes can cascade into massive results.</p><p>An example of personal leverage is an employee who learns to use AI to amplify their impact on the organization far beyond their experience or effort. While labor is still a form of leverage, it can often be done with silicon chips. In this sense, the person who can leverage technology can compete in a way never imaginable.</p><p>However, leverage is not without its risks and responsibilities. Just as a small action can have an outsized positive impact, so can it have negative consequences. If you borrow too much money against your house and it turns out to be less valuable than assumed or interest rates change, the downside of leverage can quickly wipe you out.</p><p>Good ideas taken too far often cause unanticipated consequences. Wielding leverage to maximum effect all the time, as the West Virginia mine owners did, sows the seeds of ongoing unrest that undermines one’s ability to be truly effective. No one wants to feel exploited, and those who are never give their loyalty or their best work.</p><p>The key is to use leverage wisely and judiciously by understanding the systems you want to influence and considering the second- and third-­ order effects of your actions.</p><p>Leverage is a tool, not a toy, and like any tool, it requires skill, judgment, and respect.</p><p>Activation energy is the spark that ignites the fire of change, the initial burst of effort required to kick-­ start a reaction or transformation. It’s the metaphorical push that gets the boulder rolling down the hill, the investment of energy needed to overcome inertia and set a process in motion. </p><p>In chemistry, activation energy is the minimum energy that must be input for a reaction. It’s the hurdle molecules must overcome to break their bonds and form new ones, the energetic barrier separating the reactants from the products. </p><p>But activation energy isn’t just a chemical concept. It’s a principle that applies to any system where change is possible but not automatic. In personal growth, activation energy is the effort required to break old habits and form new ones. In innovation, it’s the investment needed to turn an idea into reality. </p><p>The key is recognizing activation energy for what it is: a necessary upfront cost, not a permanent obstacle. Once things are moving, momentum takes over. Once the reaction starts, it becomes self-­ sustaining.</p><p>Catalysts are the unsung heroes of chemical reactions, the silent partners accelerating change. By decreasing the time required to cause change, they also make reactions possible that might not have occurred otherwise. </p><p>In chemistry, a catalyst is a substance that increases the reaction rate without permanently altering itself. But catalysts aren’t just chemical curiosities, they’re a powerful metaphor for the forces that drive change and growth.</p><p>In business, a catalyst might be a new technology that opens fresh possibilities or a visionary leader who inspires a team to new heights. In your personal life, a catalyst could be a life-­changing book, a transformative experience, or a mentor who sees your potential and helps you realize it. </p><p>Of course, while we benefit from others acting as our catalysts, we can be catalysts ourselves—helping others find the activation energy they need to thrive.</p><p>Alloying is the art of mixing elements to create something greater than the sum of its parts. While our intuition tells us that pure substances are best, alloying shows this is not always true. One plus one can equal ten. By blending ingredients in precise proportions, metallurgists can create materials with bespoke properties—the lightness of aluminum with the strength of steel, the corrosion resistance of chromium with the affordability of iron.</p><p>But alloying isn’t just about physical properties. It’s a metaphor for the power of diversity and combination in all walks of life. In teams, alloying is the mixing of different skills, perspectives, and personalities to create a more creative, adaptable, and resilient group than any individual could be alone. In ideas, it’s the blending of concepts from different fields to spark innovation and insight.</p><p>In people, alloying is the combination of skills that makes them unstoppable. Consider a person possessing deep engineering skills who can clearly explain ideas. They are more valuable than someone with just the engineering skills. Now add empathy, humility, resilience, and drive. This person becomes incredibly rare.</p><p>The key to successful alloying is knowing which elements to combine and in what proportions. Too little of one ingredient and you don’t get the desired effect; too much and you might end up with something brittle or unstable. The art lies in finding the sweet spot, the golden ratio where the whole becomes more than the sum of its parts.</p><p><strong>Evolution Part One: Natural Selection and Extinction</strong></p><p>Natural selection is the hidden hand that selects the fittest from a never-­ending pile of genetic variation, while extinction is the hammer that shatters the unfit and clears the way for variations to arise. </p><p>In biology, natural selection is the process by which traits that enhance survival and reproduction become more common in successive generations of a population. The invisible hand of natural selection guides the adaptations of the living world, favoring creatures that are best suited to their environments and pruning back those that fall short.</p><p>But for every winner in the great game of natural selection, there are countless losers. Extinction is the fate awaiting those species that fail to adapt, that find themselves outpaced by changing circumstances or outcompeted by more successful forms. The evolutionary end. Without the possibility of extinction, there would be no imperative to evolve to our changing environment. And without the sculpting hand of natural selection, the unfit and ill-­ adapted would consume scarce resources. These principles apply far beyond the realm of biology. </p><p>In business, technology, and ideas, we see the same relentless winnowing of the unfit and the elevation of the adaptive. The companies that thrive navigate the shifting landscape of consumer demand and technological change, while those that stagnate are swept away by the tides of creative destruction. </p><p>On a personal level, we are all subject to the pressures of selection and the risk of extinction. Our skills, our knowledge, and our ways of thinking must constantly evolve to keep pace with an ever-changing world. Those who consistently adapt are the ones who thrive in the long run.</p><p>Above all, remember that there are no permanent victories in the great game of life—­ only the ceaseless striving to stay one step ahead.</p><p>Complacency will kill you. There’s no such thing as a permanent lead. No matter how well a species adapts to its environment, it must keep running just to stay in place.  </p><p>The Red Queen effect results from the never-­ending arms race between predator and prey, parasite and host, and competitor and competitor. As one species evolves a new adaptation, others evolve countermeasures, leading to a constant escalation. The faster you adapt, the faster your rivals must respond, and vice versa. This has profound implications for the pace of evolution.</p><p>In a static environment, natural selection might favor a leisurely pace of change. But in a world of constant change, where your competitors are always nipping at your heels, the premium is on speed. The species that thrive adapt quickly and turn the evolutionary crank faster than their rivals. But the Red Queen effect isn’t just about biological evolution. The same principle applies in any competitive domain—­ business, technology, or even ideas. </p><p>Companies must continually innovate to stay ahead of their rivals. Technologies must evolve at a breakneck pace to avoid obsolescence. Ideas must adapt and grow to maintain their relevance. </p><p>The key is recognizing that adaptation isn’t a one-time event but a continuous process. It’s not about reaching a finish line but maintaining a lead in an endless race. Those who rest on their laurels, who become complacent in their success, are quickly overtaken by hungrier, more agile competitors. But there is a catch when it comes to people. </p><p>Once we gain an advantage, we want to hold on to it at all costs, and if we’re not careful, this can slow the pace of adaptation. Before long, our competitors catch up or find innovative ways to neutralize our strength. Sustained success comes from being flexible enough to change, letting go of what worked in the past, and focusing on what you need to thrive in the future.</p><p>Standing still is the quickest path to extinction in a world of constant change. Victory goes to those who can continuously adapt.</p><p>Nothing exists in isolation. Everything is connected. The ecosystem lens reveals that each species plays its part in a delicate balance of competition and cooperation. The actions of any one species can have consequences for many others in the same environment. </p><p>In biology, an ecosystem is a community of living organisms interacting with each other and their physical environment. In an ecosystem, nothing exists in isolation—every creature is both predator and prey, both producer and consumer, locked in an intricate dance of energy and nutrients. </p><p>Yet the concept of an ecosystem extends far beyond biology. You can see it nearly everywhere you look. Businesses operate within a complex network of companies, customers, competitors, suppliers, and regulators. Each entity relies on and influences the others, creating a dynamic interplay that determines which businesses thrive and which do not. Economies are also vast ecosystems comprising various sectors (like agriculture, manufacturing, and services) and actors (like workers, consumers, and governments). These components interact under the rules set by economic policies and market forces. Economic theories often explore how changes in one part of the ecosystem can lead to significant outcomes in another, much like the ripple effects seen in biological ecosystems.</p><p>What all ecosystems have in common is their inherent complexity and their reductionist analysis. In an ecosystem, the whole is always more than the sum of its parts. The system’s behavior emerges from the countless interactions of its components, often in surprising and unpredictable ways. This suggests that to truly comprehend a complex system, we must look beyond the individual elements and consider the patterns of relationship and feedback that bind them together. </p><p>Left to their own devices, many systems can take care of themselves, possessing abilities to correct and compensate for changes and external pressures. No matter how well-intentioned our interventions are, they often lead to unintended consequences as the solution to one problem quickly causes another, more significant problem. </p><p>Be slow to intervene, and if you do, take the time to understand how actions in one part cascade into others. It pays to remember the motto of physicians, “First, do no harm.”</p><p>A niche is a special place where a particular species or idea can thrive. It’s the ecological equivalent of a custom-­fitted suit tailored to its occupant’s unique needs and abilities. In a niche, you don’t have to be all things to all people—­ you just have to be the best at what you do.</p><p>In biology, a niche is a species’ specific role and position within its ecosystem. It’s the unique combination of resources it consumes, the habitat it lives in, the interactions it has with other species. A place where a species’ adaptations flourish. </p><p>But the concept of a niche extends far beyond the realm of ecology. In business, we talk about “market niches”—­ the specific segments of customers with particular needs or preferences. A company focusing on a niche can often out-compete larger, more general rivals by specializing, by becoming the best at serving that particular slice of the market, or by moving with velocity. </p><p>The same principle applies to careers. By specializing in something unique and valuable, you can create a space where you can excel and your combination of skills thrives. The key is finding the niche that fits you, rewards your strengths, and neutralizes your weaknesses.</p><p>This isn’t to say that occupying a niche is without risks. In fact, you become very fragile. If the environment changes, if consumer preferences shift, a once-­cozy niche can quickly become a tight squeeze. That’s why successful niche occupants are often those who can adapt and evolve their niche as the world around them changes. </p><p>Specialists have less competition and stress, but only in times of stability. Generalists face more significant day‑to‑day challenges for resources and survival but have more flexibility to respond when times change.</p><p>Self-­ preservation is a core instinct that drives all living things to protect and sustain their own existence. It’s the biological imperative that makes a gazelle run from the lion, the roots of a tree seek water, and bacteria evolve resistance to antibiotics. In the game of life, self-­ preservation is the only rule: stay alive. </p><p>For humans, self-­ preservation goes beyond physical survival. It encompasses the protection of our psychological well-being, social status, and sense of identity. Anything that threatens how we see ourselves becomes a threat.</p><p>While self-­ preservation is a necessary instinct, it can also be limiting. When we’re too focused on avoiding threats, we can easily miss opportunities right before us. Left unchecked, self-preservation can lead to stagnation. The key is to find balance: to protect what’s essential and be willing to let go of what no longer serves us.</p><p>Listen to the voice that tells you when to be cautious, but don’t let it be the only voice you hear. Often, the most significant risk is not taking risks at all.</p><p>Replication is the molecular magic trick that allows organisms to make copies of themselves to pass their genetic blueprints from one generation to the next. In the grand ballet of evolution, replication is the music that keeps the dance going. </p><p>At its core, replication is about information transfer. It’s the process by which the instructions encoded in DNA are faithfully copied and transmitted. Whenever a cell divides or an organism reproduces, the replication machinery swings into action, ensuring the genetic message is preserved and propagated. However, replication is not a perfect process. Errors creep in, and mutations occur. And it’s these imperfections that fuel the engine of evolution. Without the variation introduced by replication errors, life would stagnate, unable to adapt to changing environments.</p><p>Replication is helpful outside of biology, too. As a mental model, it teaches us that we don’t always need to reinvent the wheel. When you’re just starting, the quickest way to make great leaps is to imitate what others are already doing. This establishes an average baseline of performance. Once you get a sense and a feel for the environment, you can innovate and adapt to set a new baseline. </p><p>The power of replication lies in its exponential nature. A single replicated entity can give rise to countless copies, each of which can replicate further. This is the power that viruses and viral ideas harness—­ the ability to spread explosively by exploiting the machinery of replication. Memes, beliefs, and practices also replicate, spreading from mind to mind and shaping the contours of our shared reality. </p><p>But replication also comes with risks. Unchecked replication can be cancerous, leading to uncontrolled growth that threatens the health of the larger system. </p><p>Effective replication requires enough structure and space to produce a copy and enough flexibility to adapt to environmental changes. Just because something has worked for a while doesn’t mean it will be effective in perpetuity. Maintaining a successful approach requires the ability to grow and modify that approach as required. </p><p>As we contemplate replication’s role in life and thought, we must recognize its creative and destructive potential. We must create conditions that favor replicating what is true, sound, and beneficial while resisting the spread of what is false, harmful, or malignant. </p><p>Cooperation is the surprising secret of success in the ruthless world of survival. If there is any one model that explains humanity, then this is it. Cooperation unleashed the potential of the human species.&nbsp;</p><p>At first glance, cooperation seems to defy the logic of natural selection. Why would an organism invest its hard-­ earned resources in helping another rather than focusing solely on its own survival and reproduction? The answer lies in the magic of reciprocity and shared interest. When organisms can benefit more by cooperating than by competing, cooperative strategies emerge and flourish. Collaboration with others gives us options and opportunities that are unavailable when we insist on going it alone.&nbsp;</p><p>But cooperation is not automatic. It requires specific conditions—repeated interactions, shared benefits, and mechanisms to prevent cheating.&nbsp;</p><p>Cooperation is the foundation of civilization. Our species’ success is built on our ability to cooperate flexibly and at scale—­ to share knowledge, coordinate efforts, and create institutions that incentivize cooperative behavior. Cooperation underlies our achievements, from the division of labor in the economy to the norms of reciprocity in society. But, as in nature, human cooperation is not guaranteed. It requires constant cultivation and protection from the forces of selfishness and short-­ term thinking. It requires norms that reward cooperation and punish defection.</p><p><strong>Hierarchical&nbsp; Organization</strong></p><p>Hierarchy is the invisible scaffolding that organizes the living world.&nbsp;</p><p>Hierarchies in biology aren’t just about structure but about function. They allow for specialization and division of labor, for the emergence of complex behaviors from simple rules. In the hierarchy of an ant colony, the queen, workers, and soldiers all play their roles, their interactions giving rise to the sophisticated operation of the colony as a whole.&nbsp;</p><p>But hierarchy isn’t rigid or fixed. It’s fluid and dynamic, with levels constantly interacting and influencing one another. A change at one level can ripple across the entire hierarchy, transforming the system unexpectedly.&nbsp;</p><p>While hierarchy is a way to manage complexity, it can also backfire. Too much hierarchy leads to unrest and instability. Too little leads to chaos.&nbsp;</p><p>Most organizations promote cultures that emphasize rather than de‑emphasize an individual’s status, power, and place, which is part of the reason they get torn apart, as the fight to get to the top of the hierarchy takes precedence over the organization’s success.&nbsp;</p><p>In the end, hierarchy is the organizing principle that allows scale from the microscopic to the magnificent.</p><p>Incentives are the hidden engines that drive behavior. They’re the unseen forces that shape our choices, the carrots and sticks that guide our actions.&nbsp;</p><p>Think of a business offering a bonus for hitting a sales target. The bonus is an incentive, the external reward that motivates the salesperson to excel. But incentives aren’t always so obvious. They can be subtle, even subconscious—­ the social approval we seek, the habits we form, the desires we pursue.&nbsp;</p><p>Incentives are powerful because they tap into the fundamental wiring of the human brain. We’re hardwired to seek reward and avoid punishment, to optimize for the outcomes that serve our interests. When the incentives align with our goals, we thrive. When they don’t, we struggle.&nbsp;</p><p>In a classroom, it’s easy to say that we’ll be motivated by doing the right thing; however, in reality, we’re driven mainly by rewards. We have difficulty turning down the pleasure of immediate gains, even if it takes us away from our ultimate goal.&nbsp;</p><p>Often, short-­term and long-­term incentives differ. You might not feel like going to the gym today but want to be healthy as you age. Making choices to maximize your satisfaction today often leads to less reward down the road.&nbsp;</p><p>Poorly designed incentives backfire, encouraging short-­ term thinking, unethical behavior, or unintended consequences. The key is to craft incentives that reward the behaviors that lead to long-­ term success.&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately, if you understand the incentive, you can predict the outcome. By shaping the incentives, we shape the outcomes. By aligning the incentives, we unlock the power of human potential.</p><p><strong>Tendency to Minimize Energy Output (Mental and physical)</strong></p><p>The tendency to limit energy output is the universal inclination to follow the path of least resistance. From the flow of a river to the behavior of a market, this tendency is the invisible hand that guides the actions of the world.&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes, our tendency to conserve energy helps us, and sometimes, it hurts us. While minimizing our output ensures we will have extra to draw on in times of increased need, it can also get in the way of learning. Experience doesn’t become learning without reflection, which is an energy expenditure.&nbsp;</p><p>If we want to develop our thinking and get the most out of our environments, then we have to be aware of the natural tendency to minimize energy output and correct for it where doing so creates value.</p><h2>The Mental Models of Systems Thinking</h2><p>Feedback loops are the engines of growth and change. They’re the mechanisms by which the output of a system influences its input.</p><p>Complex systems often have many feedback loops, and it can be hard to appreciate how adjusting to feedback in one part of the system will affect the rest.</p><p>Using feedback loops as a mental model begins with noticing the feedback you give and respond to daily. The model also provides insight into the value of iterations in adjusting based on the feedback you receive. With this lens, you gain insight into where to direct system changes based on feedback and the pace you need to go to monitor the impacts.</p><p>Feedback loops are what make systems dynamic. Without feedback, a system does the same thing over and over. Understand them, respect them, and use them wisely.</p><p>Equilibrium is the state of balance, where opposing forces cancel each other out. It’s the calm in the storm’s center, the stable point around which the chaos swirls. In a system at equilibrium, there’s no net change. Everything is in a steady state, humming along at a constant pace.&nbsp;</p><p>However, systems are rarely static. They continuously adjust toward equilibrium but rarely stay in balance for long.&nbsp;</p><p>Equilibrium is a ­ double-edged sword, both stability and stagnation. In our lives, we often act like we can reach an equilibrium: once we get into a relationship, we’ll be happy; once we move, we’ll be productive; once X thing happens, we’ll be in Y state. But things are always in flux. We don’t reach a certain steady state and then stay there forever. The endless adjustments are our lives. The trick is to find the right balance, strive for equilibrium where it’s needed, and know when to break free and embrace the dis-equilibrium that drives progress.</p><p>Bottlenecks are the choke points, the narrow parts of the hourglass where everything slows down. They’re the constraints that limit the flow, the weakest links in the chain that determine the strength of the whole. In any system, the bottleneck is the part holding everything else back.</p><p>The tricky thing about bottlenecks is that they’re not always obvious. It’s easy to focus on the parts of the system that are moving quickly and assume everything is fine. But the real leverage is in finding and fixing the bottlenecks. Speed up the slowest part, and you speed up the whole system.</p><p>This is the theory of constraints in a nutshell. Figure out your bottleneck and focus all your efforts on alleviating it. Don’t waste time optimizing the parts that are already fast. They’re not the limiting factor.</p><p>However, bottlenecks aren’t always the villains we make them out to be. Sometimes, they’re a necessary part of the system. Think of a security checkpoint at an airport. It slows everything down, but it’s there for a reason. Remove it, and you might speed things up, but at the cost of safety.</p><p>The key is to be intentional about your bottlenecks. Choose them wisely, and make sure they’re serving a purpose. A deliberate bottleneck can be a powerful tool for focusing effort and maintaining quality. An accidental bottleneck is just a drag on the system.</p><p>Bottlenecks are leverage points where a little effort can go a long way.</p><p>Systems change as they scale up or down; neither is intrinsically better or worse. The right scale depends on your goals and the context. If you want to scale something up, you need to anticipate that new problems will keep ­ arising—​­ problems that didn’t exist on a smaller scale. Or you might need to keep solving the same problems in different ways.</p><p>Think about a recipe. If you’re making a cake for four people, you use a certain amount of ingredients. But if you want to make a cake for four hundred people, you don’t just multiply the ingredients by one hundred. That’s not how scale works. You need to change the process and use bigger mixers and bigger ovens. You need a system that can handle the increased volume without breaking down.&nbsp;</p><p>The challenge with scale is that it’s not always obvious how to achieve it. What works for a small system often breaks down at larger volumes. You have to anticipate the bottlenecks and the points where the system will strain under the increased load. And you have to be ready to re‑engineer your processes as you grow.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re building something, always be thinking about scale. How will this work when you have ten times as many customers? One hundred times? One thousand times? Build with scale in mind from the start, and you’ll be ready for the growth when it comes.</p><p>Margin of safety is a secret weapon. It’s the buffer, the extra capacity, the redundancy that you build into a system to handle unexpected stress. It’s the difference between a bridge that can barely handle the expected load and one that can handle ten times that load without breaking a sweat.&nbsp;</p><p>You can apply a margin of safety to any area of life with uncertainty and risk. The key is always to ask yourself: What if I’m wrong? What if things don’t go as planned? How much extra capacity must I build to handle the unexpected?&nbsp;</p><p>But here’s the rub: margin of safety isn’t free. It means spending more upfront. In the short term, you’ll look overly cautious and leave immediate profits on the table. But in the long run, this apparent overcaution lets you survive when others break – and thrive when others merely survive.</p><p>Margin of safety is the unsung hero of ­ long-​­term success. It’s not flashy. It’s not exciting, but it’s the foundation on which everything else is built. Master it, and you’ll be well on your way to navigating the uncertainties of life with confidence and stability.</p><p>Churn is the silent killer of businesses. It’s the slow leak, the constant drip of customers slipping away, of users drifting off to find something new. The attrition eats away at your growth, forcing you to keep running just to stay in place. The thing about churn is that it’s often hidden. It’s not like a sudden crisis that grabs your attention. It’s a slow, quiet process that happens in the background.&nbsp;</p><p>Churn can present opportunity. Like a snake shedding its skin, replacing components of a system is a natural part of keeping it healthy. New parts can improve functionality.&nbsp;</p><p>When we use this model as a lens, we see that new people bring new ideas, and counterintuitively, some turnover allows us to maintain stability. Replacing what is worn out also allows us to upgrade and expand our capabilities, creating new opportunities. Some churn is inevitable. Too much can kill you.</p><p>Algorithms are recipes. A list of crisp, unambiguous steps that tell you how to get from point A to point B. But they’re more than just directions. Algorithms are if‑then machines for tuning out the noise and zeroing in on the signal. Have the specs been met? Fol- low the algorithm and find out. Thinking algorithmically means searching for processes that reliably spit out the desired results, like a vending machine dispensing the same candy bar every time someone punches in E4.</p><p>Critical mass isn’t just a science term; it’s a guide for understanding that often things happen slowly and then all at once. It’s the moment when a system goes from sputtering along to explosive growth. Like a nuclear chain reaction, once you hit critical mass, the reaction becomes self-sustaining.</p><p>Through this lens we gain insight into the amount of material needed for a system to change from one state to another. Material can be anything from people and effort to raw material. When enough material builds up, systems reach their tipping point. When we keep going, we get sustainable change.</p><p>Using critical mass as a lens for situations where you want different outcomes helps you identify both the design elements you need to change and the work you need to put in.&nbsp;</p><p>Nearly everything is an emergent ­ effect—​­a table, a space shuttle, even ­ us—​­ combinations of ingredients that come together in a specific way to create something new. Emergence is the universe’s way of reminding us that when we combine different pieces in new ways, we get results that are more than the sum of their parts, often in the most unexpected and thrilling ways.&nbsp;</p><p>Using this mental model is not about predicting emergent properties but acknowledging they are possible. There is no need to stick with what you know; mix it up and see what happens. Learn new skills, interact with new people, read new things.</p><p>Irreducibility is about essence. It’s the idea that some things can’t be broken down into smaller parts without losing what makes them tick. It’s the idea that not everything can be explained by looking at its components. Emergent properties arise from complex systems that can’t be predicted by studying the individual parts.&nbsp;</p><p>Grappling with irreducibility requires a shift in thinking. Instead of trying to break things down, sometimes you have to zoom out. Look at the big picture. Embrace the complexity. Because some problems don’t have neat, modular solutions. They’re irreducibly messy.&nbsp;</p><p>Using irreducibility as a lens helps you focus on what you can change by understanding what really matters</p><p><strong>Law of Diminishing Returns</strong></p><p>Diminishing returns is the idea that the easy wins usually come first. The more you optimize a system, the harder it gets to eke out additional improvements, like squeezing juice from a lemon. The first squeeze is easy. The second takes a bit more work. By the tenth squeeze, you’re fighting for every last drop.&nbsp;</p><p>Every bit of effort translates into significant gains when you’re a beginner. But as you level up, progress becomes more incremental. It takes more and more work to get better and better. That’s why going from good to great is much harder than going from bad to good.&nbsp;</p><p>Understanding diminishing returns is crucial for allocating resources efficiently. You want to focus on where you can get the biggest bang for your buck. Sometimes, that means knowing when to stop optimizing and move on to something else.</p><h2>The Mental Models of Mathematics</h2><p>Sample size is about how much of the world you’re looking at. It’s the number of data points you’re using to draw conclusions. Like trying to guess the average height of people in a city by measuring a few folks on the street. The more people you measure, the more confident you can estimate.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the biggest mistakes we can make is drawing conclusions from too small a sample ­size—​­ like trying to guess a puzzle picture from only a few pieces. In most instances, increasing our sample size gives us valuable information that lets us see our situation in a new light. The catch is that large sample sizes are expensive. It takes time and money to collect all that data. So practitioners and researchers are always balancing the need for precision with the constraints of budget and deadline. They’ll often settle for the smallest sample size that can still give them a statistically significant result.</p><p>Using this model means exploring what isn’t obvious and knowing how easy it is to corrupt our samples with bias.&nbsp;</p><p>The next time you hear a statistic, think about the sample size. It’ll give you a clue about how seriously to take it. Remember: the larger the sample, the closer to the truth.</p><p>Randomness is the chaos that underlies the cosmos. It’s the unpredictable, the uncontrollable, the stuff that doesn’t follow any discernible pattern.</p><p>Randomness is what makes life surprising. It’s why you can’t predict the future with certainty. You might make plans, but there’s always the possibility of a random event throwing a wrench in the works. A flat tire, a chance encounter, a sudden inspiration. Randomness is the spice that keeps things interesting.</p><p>The tricky thing about randomness is that humans are terrible at recognizing it. We see patterns where there are none. We attribute meaning to coincidence. We think we can beat the odds. But true randomness is immune to our predictions and superstitions. It doesn’t care about our theories or desires</p><p>Regression to the mean is the universe’s way of saying “not so fast.” It’s the tendency for extreme outcomes to be followed by more average ones. Extreme results are rarely repeated.&nbsp;</p><p>The next time you see something extraordinary, enjoy it. But remember, it probably won’t last. Sooner or later, regression to the mean will come calling, pulling the exceptional back to the ordinary. That’s the way the universe keeps things in check.</p><p>Multiplying by zero is the mathematical version of the Midas touch in reverse. Everything it touches turns to nothing. No matter how big or small a number is, when you multiply it by zero, you get zero. It’s the ultimate reset button.&nbsp;</p><p>Multiplying by zero shows that we must be mindful of the zeros that will negate our other efforts. Just as in engineering, where one faulty component can make an entire system fail, not being reliable can have the same effect in life.&nbsp;</p><p>When you multiply by zero, everything else becomes irrelevant.</p><p>Equivalence is the art of making things interchangeable. It’s the idea that two things can be swapped out without changing the essence of what they’re a part of. Like swapping a red Lego brick for a blue one. The color changes, but the structure remains the same.</p><p>Being equal doesn’t mean being the same. Different inputs can produce identical results, and there is more than one way to solve most problems.</p><p>Equivalence lets us simplify complex systems. We can focus on the essentials instead of getting bogged down in details. We can see the forest for the trees. And we can make changes without fear of breaking the fundamental structure.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, equivalence has its limits. Not everything is interchangeable. You can’t swap out a car’s engine for a hamster wheel and expect the car to run. The art is in knowing where equivalence applies and where it doesn’t. It’s in recognizing the essential differences that matter, and the superficial differences that don’t.&nbsp;</p><p>The next time you face a complex problem, try thinking about equivalence. Look for the underlying patterns. See if there are components you can swap out or simplify. You might just find a solution that’s been hiding in plain sight all along.</p><p>Surface area is what determines how much an object interacts with its environment. The more surface area the more contact. Surface area can be good and bad. Sometimes, keeping it small is favorable, and sometimes, increasing our exposure is beneficial.&nbsp;</p><p>Surface area teaches us that increasing cognitive diversity can give us fresh ideas and help us innovate. However, the model also reminds us that in many ways, the more we expose ourselves, the more vulnerable we are. Different situations require different surface areas.</p><p>Global and local maxima as a model can be used differently to help us make the changes we need for success. It encourages us to see achieving our goals not as a steady upward trajectory but as a path full of peaks and valleys. Understanding that sometimes we have to go down to climb even higher helps us make ­ short-term sacrifices to play the long game. In engineering, you might be trying to maximize efficiency. In life, you might be trying to maximize happiness. But in all these cases, getting stuck on a local maximum is easy. You find a pretty good solution, and you stop looking for a better one.&nbsp;</p><p>The next time you’re trying to optimize something, remember the concept of global and local maxima. Don’t just settle for the first peak you find. Keep exploring. Keep searching for that global maximum. It might be a tough climb, but the view from the top is worth it.</p><h2>The Mental Models of Economics</h2><p>Scarcity shapes our choices and drives our actions. When something is scarce, it suddenly becomes valuable. We want it more because there is less. It’s the principle that underlies everything from the price of gold to the thrill of the hunt.</p><p>Scarcity isn’t just about material things. It applies to time, opportunities, and ideas. We’re drawn to the exclusive, the ­ limited-​­edition, the one-of-a-kind.</p><p>In economics, scarcity is a foundational principle. There are infinite wants and desires but limited resources. We can’t have everything, so we must choose. Scarcity guides those choices.&nbsp;</p><p>Some businesses operate with a scarcity mentality, removing shock absorbers and operating lean, with just enough resources to produce the day’s goods. This model is prone to disruption with the slightest hiccup and signals to employees that they’re in a culture of scarcity, triggering our biological instinct toward self-preservation. We subconsciously hoard things of value to gain an individual advantage.&nbsp;</p><p>Scarcity can work to your advantage. Imagine you’ve got a rare combination of qualities: you’re honest, hardworking, and smart. People like that are scarce, and the world disproportionately rewards them. It’s not just about being good at one thing; it’s about having a mix of traits.&nbsp;</p><p>The key to navigating scarcity is understanding its power, recognizing when it’s driving our choices, and asking if those choices align with our true values and goals. Sometimes, scarcity creates real value. But sometimes, it’s just a mirage, a trick of the mind.</p><p>Supply and demand are the push and pull determining availability and price. Their dance is never-ending. A sudden shortage can send prices soaring; a new discovery can send them crashing.</p><p>But supply and demand aren’t just about price; they’re also about allocation. They determine who gets what, and how much of it. When supply is low and demand is high, resources flow to those willing and able to pay the most.</p><p>Markets react to supply and demand. When demand exceeds supply, it encourages investment by companies to create substitutes or more supply. On the other hand, when supply exceeds demand, it discourages investment until a profitable balance is restored.&nbsp;</p><p>Economic cycles are driven as much by human nature as by resources. When profits are flowing, it encourages overconfidence, greed, and complacency. When profits are nowhere to be found, it encourages fear, savings, and ruthless efficiency.&nbsp;</p><p>As individuals, we’re all part of this dance. Every choice we make as consumers and every decision we make as producers shapes the contours of supply and demand. We are the market, collectively determining what has value and what doesn’t.&nbsp;</p><p>Remember the forces at play the next time you’re at the store, negotiating a salary, or launching a product. You’re not just a passive participant but an active agent in supply and demand. Your choices matter. Make them wisely.</p><p>Optimization is about making the most of what you have. It’s like cleverly solving a puzzle, finding a trick to skip steps and get to the answer faster.&nbsp;</p><p>In a world of scarcity, optimization is powerful. It allows us to maximize our limited resources, whether time, money, or energy. But like any tool, it’s only as good as the hand that wields it. Used wisely, optimization unlocks hidden potential and drives extraordinary results. Used poorly, it leads to wasted effort and missed opportunities.&nbsp;</p><p>Optimization often works for you until it doesn’t. It’s like the student who writes the answer but doesn’t show their work. Knowing when to use it, when to let it go, and when to avoid it can give you a key advantage.</p><p>Life is full of trade-offs. Every choice has a cost. When you say yes to one thing, you say no to others. This is how the world works. It’s like gravity. You can’t escape it.&nbsp;</p><p>Opportunity cost is what you give up when you make a choice. It’s the thing you can’t have because you picked something else. Say you have a free evening. You can work on your startup or go to a movie. If you work, you miss the fun. If you go to the movie, you miss the chance to make progress.&nbsp;</p><p>Every choice has an opportunity cost because every time you say yes to something, you’re implicitly saying no to other things. You need to know your opportunity costs. This helps you make good trade-offs.&nbsp;</p><p>A ­ trade-​­off is giving up one thing to get something else. It’s choosing between options. Each has good and bad points. Trade-offs are about priorities. When you make something, you face trade-offs. If you want it fast, you might lose some features. If you want it cheap, you might use lower-quality materials.&nbsp;</p><p>In life, we face ­ trade-​­ offs all the time. Do you take a high-paying job with long hours? Or the low-paying one with more free time? Do you spend money now or save for later?&nbsp;</p><p>Making good ­ trade-​­offs is about weighing the opportunity costs and benefits of each option and choosing the one that aligns best with your goals and values. It’s not always easy, but being conscious of the ­ trade-​­ offs you’re making can help you make better decisions.&nbsp;</p><p>Wisdom is anticipating the consequences of your choices. In life and business, success is about making good trade-offs. It’s not about having it all. It’s about having what matters most. We all value different things. That’s what makes life rich.&nbsp;</p><p>Opportunity cost is what you give up when you make a choice; trade-offs are the balancing acts you perform when deciding between competing options. They’re two sides of the same ­ coin— ­whenever you make a ­ trade-​­off, you’re incurring an opportunity cost for the option you didn’t choose. The key in both cases is to be thoughtful and intentional about your choices.</p><p>Specialization is a ­trade-​­off: pursuing one course means not pursuing another. It’s narrowing your focus to broaden your impact. In a world of infinite knowledge and finite time, specialization is the key to unlocking mastery. It’s about going deep, not wide.&nbsp;</p><p>Specialization has risks. If the world changes, what was once a valuable specialty can become obsolete. And yet, we need specialists. You wouldn’t want a generalist doing your brain surgery or a root canal.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s the catch: the more you specialize, the more you see how much other fields can teach you. The most exciting finds often happen at the edges between areas of knowledge. The trick is to specialize without getting stuck. To go deep, but also reach out.&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately, specialization is about where you spend your time and effort. It’s how you stand out. It’s choosing to be great at one thing instead of okay at many.</p><p>Interdependence is the web that ties us all together. It’s the recognition that no person, no company, no country is an island. We’re all connected, all reliant on one another in countless ways, big and small. Interdependence is the reality that underlies the illusion of ­ self-​­sufficiency. No one is entirely ­self-​­made.</p><p>Interdependence can be both a vulnerability and a strength. When we recognize our interdependencies, we can leverage them for mutual benefit. We can form alliances, partnerships, and ecosystems. We can create value that no single entity could create alone.</p><p>Interdependence is the foundation of synergy, the alchemy of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts. On the other hand, if we depend on others for something critical, it can expose us if they fail to deliver or change their minds. It’s easy to be a good partner when things are going well. But you want to be careful with whom you depend in a crisis.</p><p>Interdependence isn’t just a macro concept. It’s deeply personal. We’re all interdependent with our families, our friends, our communities. We rely on one another for support, for love, for meaning. Interdependence is the fabric of our social lives.</p><p>Efficiency is about getting the most done with the least waste. It’s not always about finding the perfect answer but the one that works well enough without too much fuss. Efficiency matters because in real life, you never have all the time or resources you want. You have to make do with what you’ve got.</p><p>But efficiency isn’t just about speed. It’s also about effectiveness and doing the right things. There’s no point in doing something fast if it’s not worth doing. True efficiency is about focusing on what matters most. It’s about saying no to the small stuff so you can say yes to the big stuff.</p><p>Like everything, efficiency has its limits. There’s a point of diminishing returns, a threshold beyond which further optimization yields little gain. The key is finding the sweet spot, the point of maximum efficiency before the costs start outweighing the benefits.</p><p>Efficiency works until it doesn’t. The more perfectly efficient a system, the more vulnerable it becomes to any change. While the idea can be hard to appreciate, maximal efficiency in the short term rarely leads to maximum ­ long-​­ term efficiency. A common benefit eroded in the quest for efficiency is a margin of safety. Through the efficiency lens, the opportunity cost of holding something like extra cash, inventory, or even employees may be seen as too high. However, supply shocks or environmental changes can make excess cash, inventory, and employees more valuable. </p><p>Inefficiency in the short run is often very efficient in the long run when it leaves you better able to adapt to an uncertain world and increases the odds of survival. </p><p>In a world of trade-offs, efficiency is a balancing act. It’s about making the most of what you have and leaving room for what you might need. It’s about being prepared for the future, not just optimized for the present.</p><p>Debt is a double-edged sword. It’s a powerful tool to help you grow a business, buy a home, or seize an opportunity. But it’s also a chain that can bind your future or destroy you.&nbsp;</p><p>When debt spirals out of control, it quickly turns dreams into nightmares.&nbsp;</p><p>Debt isn’t just about money. It can be a favor you owe, a social obligation, or anything that creates a future obligation. We even have sleep debt.&nbsp;</p><p>It can be hard to appreciate just how fragile debt makes you. It’s like driving across a vast desert without a spare tire. If everything goes perfectly, you will reach the other side, but the smallest hiccup will leave you stranded and desperate.&nbsp;</p><p>Use debt wisely. Respect its power, but fear its edge. Remember, the more you borrow, the less room you have to weather life’s storms.&nbsp;</p><p>While debt might seem cheap in the moment, the future often proves it to be more expensive than we imagined. The more you borrow, the less room you have to deal with uncertainty.&nbsp;</p><p>Debt can give you leverage, but it can also take away your freedom. Respect its power but fear its edge.</p><p>Monopoly and competition are the yin and yang of the business world. They’re the opposing forces that shape the landscape of every market, the tides that lift and sink the fortunes of every firm. To understand business, you must understand the dance between these poles.&nbsp;</p><p>Competition is the default state of the market. It’s the Darwinian struggle where many firms vie for the same customers and resources. In a competitive market, no one firm has the power to set prices or dictate terms. They’re price takers, not price makers. They survive by being efficient, delivering value, and innovating.&nbsp;</p><p>If competition is the natural state, monopoly is the entrepreneur’s dream. A monopoly dominates a market so completely that it becomes the market. Think of the only bridge that crosses a river. But monopolies inevitably sow the seeds of their own destruction. The question is how long they will last.&nbsp;</p><p>We need both monopoly and competition. Competition keeps firms honest and drives innovation. But we also need monopolies’ deep pockets to fund big visions and moon shots. The ideal is a balance: enough competition to check monopolies but enough monopolies to reward innovation.</p><p>Creative destruction is the engine of progress in a capitalist economy. It’s the process by which new innovations replace old ones, the cycle of birth and death that keeps an economy vibrant. It embodies the old adage: The only constant is change.</p><p>In a dynamic economy, nothing is sacred. Newer, better ideas can disrupt every industry, company, and way of doing things. The smartphone replaced the flip phone, online streaming replaced movie rental stores, and cars replaced horses.</p><p>While creative destruction can be painful for individual companies, it’s essential for the overall economy’s health. It prevents stagnation and ensures resources are always put to their most productive use. Without creative destruction, we’d still ride horses and rent VHS tapes.</p><p>On one hand, creative destruction is the opportunity you’re looking for—the chance to disrupt an incumbent—to build something new and better. But on the other hand, it’s the threat you’re always guarding against—the possibility that you will be disrupted by the next big thing.</p><p>Creative destruction isn’t just about business; it’s a metaphor for life. We are all subject to change, to the constant cycle of endings and beginnings. The key is to not cling too tightly to the old, but to embrace the new possibilities.</p><p>Gresham’s Law states that bad money drives out good. But it’s not just about currency. The principle applies anytime there are two competing versions of something, one perceived as high quality and the other as low quality.</p><p>In a sense, Gresham’s Law is the dark side of human nature. We’re wired to optimize for the short term, to get the most value for the least effort. If we can pass off the less valuable thing and keep the more valuable one, we will. Without consequences, bad behavior drives out good. Bad lending drives out good lending. Bad morals drive out good morals. Overcoming this requires constant effort.</p><p>In the short run, bad often drives out good. But in the long run, true value wins out.</p><p>Bubbles are a natural by-product of human nature. They happen when collective enthusiasm for an asset runs far ahead of its fundamental value. It’s the moment when the market becomes untethered from reality when prices are driven not by sober calculation but by mass delusion.&nbsp;</p><p>Bubbles are a fascinating study of human psychology. They’re driven by greed and FOMO (fear of missing out). No one wants to be the sucker who sits on the sidelines while everyone else gets rich. But there’s also an element of genuine belief, of conviction that this time is different, that the old rules no longer apply.&nbsp;</p><p>While ultimately destructive, bubbles also serve a function. They’re the market’s way of exploring new frontiers, of testing new possibilities. Many of the innovations we take for granted ­ today— ­ from cars to computers to the internet ­ itself—​­ were once the subject of speculative manias. Bubbles fund the infrastructure for future revolutions, even as they leave a trail of financial wreckage in their wake.&nbsp;</p><p>Bubbles remind us that markets are driven by human emotions and beliefs. They’re a mirror held up to our collective hopes, dreams, and delusions. The next time you catch yourself saying, “this time is different,” remember that all bubbles pop eventually.&nbsp;</p><p>Like a balloon that can only expand so far, bubbles eventually burst, and the game ends abruptly without warning. Keeping yourself grounded in value and economic reality, not in story or hype, is key to standing alone as a bubble expands.</p><p>The audience is the invisible participant in every work of art. They are the eyes that see, the ears that hear, the minds that interpret. Without an audience, art is like a tree falling in an empty ­ forest—­ it may make a sound, but does it matter? The audience is what gives art its meaning, its purpose, and its very existence. </p><p>Every observer infuses art with personal significance, transforming it into a co-creation. A painting of a sunset may evoke feelings of peace and beauty for one person and feelings of melancholy and loss for another. The artwork is the same, but the audience is different, so the meaning is different. In this sense, the audience is a cocreator of the art.</p><p>Great artists design their work for these silent judges, balancing authenticity with expectation without succumbing to pandering.The audience is their silent collaborator and their ultimate judge.</p><p>In a world where so much can be faked, the audience is something real. You can fake likes, followers, and reviews, but you can’t fake the genuine human experience of engaging with art. The spontaneous laughter, unexpected tears, and long, thoughtful silence are the honest reactions that both the audience and the artists live for.</p><p>Never forget your audience, but never let them dictate your creation. </p><p>Picture this: you’re browsing a bookstore, scanning the shelves for your next read. You pick up a book with a shadowy figure on the cover, a magnifying glass in hand. Instantly, you know what kind of story awaits you within those pages. This is the power of genre— the unspoken understanding between creator and audience that shapes how we experience art.</p><p>But genre is more than just a label; it’s a set of conventions, an understanding between the artist and the audience. When we pick up a mystery novel, we expect a crime, some clues, and a detective. When we go to a rock concert, we expect loud guitars, driving rhythms, and a rebellious attitude. Genre sets the parameters of our experience, even as it gives the artist a foundation to build upon or rebel against.</p><p>Think of genre as a game with rules. The rules provide structure, but they also create opportunities for creativity. A sonnet has a strict ­ form—​­ fourteen lines, a specific rhyme ­ scheme—​­ but within those constraints, poets have found endless ways to express love, loss, joy, and sorrow. The rules of the genre game inspire ingenuity, challenging artists to create something fresh within the familiar.</p><p>But genres are not static; they are constantly evolving. Look at the way rock music has transformed over the decades. What began as a rebellious offshoot of blues and country in the 1950s has splintered into countless subgenres, each with a distinct style and audience. From the psychedelic experimentation of the 1960s to the punk revolution of the ’70s to the grunge explosion of the ’90s, rock has reinvented itself time and again. What was once transgressive becomes mainstream, and new forms emerge to take its place.</p><p>Navigating genre is a delicate art. Sticking too closely to the conventions may cause your work to be dismissed as formulaic. On the other hand, if you stray too far you risk losing your audience. The key is to find the sweet ­ spot—​­ honoring the genre’s expectations while bringing something new and personal to the table.</p><p>Ultimately, genre is a tool—a way of framing the conversation between the artist and the audience. It provides common ground, a starting point for the journey together. But the true power of art lies in the way it can transcend genre, using convention as a springboard to take us places we’ve never been.</p><p>Contrast is the spice of life and art. It’s the clash of opposites that energizes a work and jolts our senses. Without contrast, the world is bland. With it, the world dances with dark and light, loud and soft, rough and smooth. Contrast makes us notice.</p><p>Contrast isn’t just visual. In music, quiet moments make loud ones explosive. Gentle ballads set the stage for crashing anthems. In literature, calm before the storm makes extraordinary events remarkable. Contrast gives art emotional power.</p><p>Contrast creates interest and engagement. Our brains are wired to pay attention to changes and differences. We tune out the monotonous, but we snap to attention when something breaks the pattern. Artists use contrast to manipulate our attention, direct our focus, and shape our work experience.</p><p>Contrast is a universal principle. Light and dark, hot and cold, life and ­ death—​­ the world is defined by contrasts. Darkness helps us understand light. Winter makes us appreciate spring. Contrast gives meaning to existence.</p><p>Framing is the art of context, the craft of shaping perception. It’s how we present information, the lens through which we invite others to view the world. Like a photographer choosing what’s in the frame, we constantly decide what to emphasize, minimize, or leave out. These often unconscious choices profoundly influence how others understand and respond.</p><p>In psychology, framing is a key concept in understanding ­ decision- ­ making. Present the same options in different ways, and people’s choices change. Is it a muffin or a cake? The thing doesn’t change, but its packaging does.</p><p>For marketers and advertisers, framing is a potent tool. A car can be framed as a status symbol, an adventure machine, or a sensible family vehicle. A watch can be about punctuality, or it can be about luxury and prestige. The product stays the same, but the story changes. The right frame makes the ordinary extraordinary.</p><p>But framing isn’t just about persuasion. It’s also about understanding, about making sense of the complex world around us. We all carry frames in our ­ minds—​­ mental models of how things work, cultural narratives, and personal beliefs. These frames shape how we interpret information, how we explain events, and how we imagine possibilities.</p><p>Framing’s power lies in its subtlety. Unlike a logical argument, a frame doesn’t need to be explicitly stated to have an effect. It works on an emotional, often subconscious level. A ­ well-​­crafted frame can make an idea feel intuitive, even inevitable, without the audience knowing why.</p><p>Framing is the silent partner in every communication, the hidden hand shaping understanding. Like any powerful tool, framing can be used for good or ill. It can illuminate truth, or it can obscure it. It can empower people to see new possibilities, or it can subtly limit their thinking to narrow predefined channels.</p><p>Rhythm is the universe’s heartbeat, the pulse animating life. From our steady heartbeats to the sun’s rise and fall, from crashing waves to swaying trees, rhythm is the pattern underlying existence. It’s the organizing principle bringing order to chaos, the recurring cycle shaping time.</p><p>In music, rhythm is the backbone supporting melody and harmony. Without rhythm, music would be a formless wash of sound, lacking structure and impact. The steady beat of the drum, the driving strum of the guitar, the pulsing throb of the ­ bass—​­ these rhythms grab us on a visceral level, moving our bodies and stirring our souls.</p><p>But rhythm isn’t just about regularity, the even spacing of beats. It’s also variation, the interplay of different rhythmic patterns. In jazz, the syncopated rhythms and the unexpected accents give the music an improvisational feel. In classical music, the shifting rhythms, from the stately march to the lively dance, convey the piece’s emotional arc.</p><p>Rhythm is also fundamental to language. The cadence of a phrase, the meter of a poem, the rise and fall of a great orator’s ­ speech—​­ these rhythms communicate meaning beyond the literal content of the words. They create their own music, a pattern resonating in the ear and lingering in the mind.</p><p>Even in our daily lives, rhythm plays a crucial role. The routines we establish, the habits we cultivate, the cycles of work and rest, of activity and ­ reflection—​­ these rhythms give structure and meaning to our existence. Without rhythm, life would be a formless blur, a ceaseless stream of unrelated moments. Rhythm allows us to make sense of time, to find our place in life’s larger patterns.</p><p>Melody is music’s soul, the ethereal thread weaving through sound’s tapestry. It’s the part of a song that we hum in the shower, the tune that gets stuck in our head and won’t let go. Melody is the musical expression of a fundamental human need: the need to tell a story, convey an emotion, and connect with others beyond words.</p><p>A melody is simply a sequence of notes, a pattern of pitches and rhythms. But melody’s magic transcends these basic building blocks. A great melody is more than the sum of its parts. It has a shape, a contour, an arc that carries us from one note to the next. It has a sense of inevitability, as if each note is the only possible choice, even as the melody surprises us with its freshness and novelty.</p><p>In this sense, melody is a lot like language. As we arrange words infinitely to express different ideas, we arrange notes to express emotions and experiences. A rising melody might convey a sense of hope and aspiration, while a falling melody might suggest sadness or resignation. A melody with large leaps might feel adventurous and daring, while one with small, stepwise motion might feel intimate and confiding.</p><p>But melody isn’t just about individual expressions. It’s also about communication and connection. When a melody resonates with us, it’s as if the composer is speaking directly to our hearts. We feel understood, validated, less alone. And when we sing or play a melody with others, we create a bond, a shared experience that transcends our individual differences.&nbsp;</p><p>This is why melody has such power across cultures and throughout history. From the chants of ancient rituals to the latest pop hits, melody has been a constant in human musical expression. It’s a universal language, requiring no translation or explanation. A beautiful melody can move us regardless of whether we understand the words or know the cultural context.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, not all melodies are equal. Just as there are great works of literature and forgettable pulp novels, there are melodies that stand the test of time and others that quickly fade from memory. The best melodies balance the familiar and the new. They have a memorable shape, a satisfying resolution, a feeling of completeness.&nbsp;</p><p>In a world often fragmented and chaotic, melody is a source of unity and coherence, a way of finding beauty and meaning amid the noise.</p><p>Representation is the mental shorthand we use to navigate the complexities of reality, the symbols and images we use to communicate our thoughts and experiences. Representation is how we construct meaning and bridge the gap between the raw data of our senses and the narratives we tell about ourselves and our world.&nbsp;</p><p>At its core, representation is about standing in for something else. A word stands in for an object or concept, a map for a territory, a musical note for a sound. We use representations because we can’t hold the entirety of reality in our minds at once. We need abstractions, simplifications, and models that we can manipulate and reason about.&nbsp;</p><p>But representation is not neutral. Every representation is an interpretation, a way of framing reality that highlights some aspects and obscures others. An emoji might represent a feeling, but it doesn’t show the lived experience that causes that feeling. In this sense, representation is always a kind of distortion. It’s a lens that shapes how we see the world, for better or worse. A good representation can illuminate hidden truths, help us see patterns and connections we might otherwise miss. But a bad representation can mislead us, reinforce stereotypes and prejudices, limit our ability to imagine alternatives.&nbsp;</p><p>Representation is not just about mirroring reality; it’s also about shaping it. The representations we create and consume can influence how we think and act, to change the very world they purport to describe. A powerful piece of art can shift cultural attitudes, a persuasive political narrative can sway elections, a compelling scientific model can guide research and policy. In this way, representation is a kind of feedback loop. We create representations based on our understanding of reality, but those representations, in turn, shape our understanding, which influences the representations we create next. It’s a constant dance between map and territory, symbol and referent.</p><p>The plot is the story’s engine, propelling characters and events through time. It’s the sequence of causally connected events that leads from the beginning of a narrative to its resolution. Without a plot, a story is just disconnected moments and unrelated incidents. With a plot, a story becomes a journey, a transformative experience for characters and readers.&nbsp;</p><p>At its most basic level, a plot is a series of events connected by cause and effect. Event A leads to Event B, which leads to Event C, and so on, until the story reaches its resolution. But a good plot is more than just a linear chain of events. It’s a complex web of actions and reactions, of conflicts and resolutions, of setups and payoffs.&nbsp;</p><p>Conflict is the heart of any plot. Without conflict, characters have no story or reason to act or change. Conflict can take many ­ forms—​­ person versus person, person versus nature, person versus society, person versus self. But all conflicts share a fundamental structure: a character wants something but faces obstacles. The plot is the events that arise from the character’s attempts to overcome these obstacles and achieve their goal.&nbsp;</p><p>But plot is not just about external conflicts and goals. It’s also about the internal journey of the characters, the way they grow and change because of the events they experience. A good plot presents a character with external challenges and forces them to confront their own flaws, beliefs, and desires.&nbsp;</p><p>In this sense, the plot is a crucible for the character. It’s the fire that tests and transforms the protagonist, revealing their true nature and potential. A character who ends a story unchanged, unaffected by the plot’s events, is a character in a story that hasn’t really gone anywhere. The best plots leave characters fundamentally altered, through triumph or tragedy.&nbsp;</p><p>Plot is also personal. The most powerful story in the world is the one you tell yourself about the obstacles and challenges in front of you. A positive story doesn’t always ensure success, but a negative one almost guarantees failure.&nbsp;</p><p>Once a story takes root, no matter how false, it can be hard to change. This applies to both humanity in general and to each of us individually. Change the story to change the results.</p><p>At their core, characters are bundles of traits and motivations, of habits and histories, of strengths and flaws. They are the total of their choices and actions, the product of genetics, choices, and circumstances. But a great character is more than just a list of attributes. A great character is a paradox, a contradiction, a mystery that unfolds over the course of a story.&nbsp;</p><p>In many ways, character is destiny. The choices a character makes, the actions they take, flow inevitably from who they are. A cautious, thoughtful character will approach a problem differently than an impulsive, emotional one. A character with a strong moral compass will make different decisions than one with a flexible relationship to the truth. Obstacles reveal character.&nbsp;</p><p>But character is not static; it is not a fixed point but a journey. The best characters are the ones who grow and change throughout a story and who are transformed by the events of the plot and the interactions with other characters. Think of Ebenezer Scrooge, the miserly old man who learns the true meaning of generosity. </p><p>Understanding a person’s character allows you to see someone for who they are at their core and step into their shoes. This helps you understand why they make their choices, predict their behavior, and empathize with their story. But remember, character is not set in stone. What happened yesterday is over. Today’s obstacles and challenges are nothing more than an opportunity to take a step toward or away from the person you want to be. No single choice satisfies the pursuit, only repeated steps in the right direction.</p><p>The setting is the stage upon which the drama of the story unfolds, the physical and temporal context that shapes and reflects the actions of characters. An active participant in the narrative, setting is a force that can enable or hinder, reveal or conceal, enlighten or deceive. The setting is not just where the story happens but why it happens.&nbsp;</p><p>Setting anchors a story in time and place, providing sensory details that make it real. But setting is more than just physical description. It’s also the social, cultural, and historical context that defines the parameters of what is possible and what is permissible for the characters.&nbsp;</p><p>A story set in medieval Europe will have different constraints and opportunities than one set in ­ modern-​­ day Tokyo. A character in a small, gossipy village will face different challenges than one in a large, anonymous city. Setting shapes the choices characters make, the conflicts they face, the resolutions they find.&nbsp;</p><p>But setting is not just a ­one-​­way street, not just the environment acting upon the characters. Characters also act upon and interact with their setting. They navigate its challenges, exploit its opportunities, and leave their mark on its landscape. Every story is a symbiotic relationship between character and setting, a reciprocal exchange of influence and transformation.&nbsp;</p><p>Setting is the silent force that influences our fate. What we think and do is greatly impacted by our environment. This leads to a powerful and profound point: to change your behavior, change your environment. If you don’t, it will change you.</p><p>Performance is the art of the ephemeral, the fleeting moment of creative expression existing only in the here and now. It’s where the boundaries between art and life blur, the artist’s body and actions become the medium, and the audience’s presence and participation become integral.&nbsp;</p><p>At its core, performance is about presence, about the immediacy and intimacy of live action. In a world increasingly mediated by screens, live performance asserts the primacy of embodied experience, of the direct encounter between performer and spectator. It’s a reminder that art is not just a thing to be consumed but an event to be lived.&nbsp;</p><p>But performance is also about absence, the gaps and spaces between action and interpretation, intention and reception. Unlike a painting or a sculpture, a performance can never be fully captured or contained. It exists only in the memories and testimonies of those who were there, in the ripples and reverberations it sends through the culture. Performance embraces the contingency and ­open- endedness of the live event, the sense that anything could happen, that meaning is always in the making.&nbsp;</p><p>This contingency is both the power and the challenge of performance. It allows for spontaneity and responsiveness, adapting to and incorporating the unpredictable elements of the moment. Yet, it makes performance resistant to the control and perfection other art forms aspire to. A performance is always a collaboration with chance, a dance with the unknown.&nbsp;</p><p>As audience members, we are not just passive observers but active participants in the performance. Our presence, reactions, and energy all become part of the work. Think of fans transmitting energy to a team to rally them from behind with a few minutes left in the game. Performance invites us to be cocreators, to complete the work through our own interpretations and responses. In so doing, we become part of something larger than ourselves.&nbsp;</p><p>When we are fully present in any performance where someone is making themselves vulnerable, we may just glimpse the raw, unedited, unpolished essence of what it means to be human.</p><h2>The Mental Models of Military and War</h2><p>One of the most valuable military tactics is the habit of “personally seeing the front” before making decisions – not always relying on advisors, maps, and reports, all of which can be faulty or biased. The Map/Territory model, as does the incentive model, illustrates the problem of not seeing the front. Leaders of any organization can generally benefit from seeing the front, as it provides firsthand information and tends to improve the quality of secondhand information.</p><p>The asymmetry model leads to an application in warfare whereby one side seemingly “plays by different rules” than the other side due to circumstance. Generally, this model is applied by an insurgency with limited resources. Unable to out-muscle their opponents, asymmetric fighters use other tactics, as with terrorism creating fear that’s disproportionate to their actual destructive ability.</p><p>The Second World War was a good example of a two-front war. Once Russia and Germany became enemies, Germany was forced to split its troops and send them to separate fronts, weakening their impact on either front. Opening a two-front war can often be a useful tactic, as can solving a two-front war or avoiding one, as in the example of an organization tamping down internal discord to focus on its competitors.</p><p>Though asymmetric insurgent warfare can be extremely effective, competitors have developed counterinsurgency strategies over time. Recently and famously, General David Petraeus of the United States led the development of counterinsurgency plans involving no additional force but substantial gains. Tit-for-tat warfare or competition often leads to a feedback loop that demands insurgency and counterinsurgency.</p><h2>The Mental Models of Human Nature and Judgment</h2><p>Fundamentally, the modern world operates on trust. Familial trust is generally a given (otherwise we’d have a hell of a time surviving), but we also choose to trust chefs, clerks, drivers, factory workers, executives, and many others. A trusting system is one that tends to work most efficiently; the rewards of trust are extremely high.</p><p>Highly responsive to incentives, humans have&nbsp;perhaps the most varied and hardest to understand set of incentives in the animal kingdom. This causes us to distort our thinking when it is in our own interest to do so. A wonderful example is a salesman truly believing that his product will improve the lives of its users. It’s not merely convenient that he sells the product; the fact of his selling the product causes a very real bias in his own thinking.</p><p>Ivan Pavlov very effectively demonstrated that animals can respond not just to direct incentives but also to associated objects; remember the famous dogs salivating at the ring of a bell. Human beings are much the same and can feel positive and negative emotion towards intangible objects, with the emotion coming from past associations rather than direct effects.</p><p>Humans have a tendency to feel envious of those receiving more than they are, and a desire “get what is theirs” in due course. The tendency towards envy is strong enough to drive otherwise irrational behavior, but is as old as humanity itself. Any system ignorant of envy effects will tend to self-immolate over time.</p><p>Based on past association, stereotyping, ideology, genetic influence, or direct experience, humans have a tendency to distort their thinking in favor of people or things that they like and against people or things they dislike. This tendency leads to overrating the things we like and underrating or broadly categorizing things we dislike, often missing crucial nuances in the process.</p><p>Anyone who has been alive long enough realizes that, as the saying goes, “denial is not just a river in Africa.” This is powerfully demonstrated in situations like war or drug abuse, where denial has powerful destructive effects but allows for behavioral inertia. Denying reality can be a coping mechanism, a survival mechanism, or a purposeful tactic.</p><p>One of the most useful findings of modern psychology is what Daniel Kahneman calls the Availability Bias or Heuristic: We tend to most easily recall what is salient, important, frequent, and recent. The brain has its own energy-saving and inertial tendencies that we have little control over – the availability heuristic is likely one of them. Having a truly comprehensive memory would be debilitating. Some sub-examples of the availability heuristic include the Anchoring and Sunk Cost Tendencies.</p><p><strong>8. Representativeness Heuristic</strong>The three major psychological findings that fall under Representativeness, also defined by Kahneman and his partner Tversky, are:</p><p><strong>b. Tendency to Stereotype&nbsp;</strong>The tendency to broadly generalize and categorize rather than look for specific nuance. Like availability, this is generally a necessary trait for energy-saving in the brain.</p><p><strong>c. Failure to See False Conjunctions</strong>Most famously demonstrated by the Linda Test, the same two psychologists showed that students chose more vividly described individuals as more likely to fit into a predefined category than individuals with broader, more inclusive, but less vivid descriptions, even if the vivid example was a mere subset of the more inclusive set. These specific examples are seen as more representative of the category than those with the broader but vaguer descriptions, in violation of logic and probability.</p><p>Human beings are one of many social species, along with bees, ants, and chimps, among many more. We have a DNA-level instinct to seek safety in numbers and will look for social guidance of our behavior. This instinct creates a cohesive sense of cooperation and culture which would not otherwise be possible but also leads us to do foolish things if our group is doing them as well.</p><p>Human beings have been appropriately called “the storytelling animal” because of our instinct to construct and seek meaning in narrative. It’s likely that long before we developed the ability to write or to create objects, we were telling stories and thinking in stories. Nearly all social organizations, from religious institutions to corporations to nation-states, run on constructions of the narrative instinct.</p><p>We like to call other species curious, but we are the most curious of all, an instinct which led us out of the savanna and led us to learn a great deal about the world around us, using that information to create the world in our collective minds. The curiosity instinct leads to unique human behavior and forms of organization like the scientific enterprise. Even before there were direct incentives to innovate, humans innovated out of curiosity.</p><p>The psychologist Steven Pinker calls our DNA-level instinct to learn grammatically constructed language the Language Instinct. The idea that grammatical language is not a simple cultural artifact was first popularized by the linguist Noam Chomsky. As we saw with the narrative instinct, we use these instincts to create shared stories, as well as to gossip, solve problems, and fight, among other things. Grammatically ordered language theoretically carries infinite varying meaning.</p><p><strong>13. First-Conclusion Bias</strong>As Charlie Munger famously pointed out, the mind works a bit like a sperm and egg: the first idea gets in and then the mind shuts. Like many other tendencies, this is probably an energy-saving device. Our tendency to settle on first conclusions leads us to accept many erroneous results and cease asking questions; it can be countered with some simple and useful mental routines.</p><p>It’s important for human beings to generalize; we need not see every instance to understand the general rule, and this works to our advantage. With generalizing, however, comes a subset of errors when we forget about the Law of Large Numbers and act as if it does not exist. We take a small number of instances and create a general category, even if we have no statistically sound basis for the conclusion.</p><p><strong>15. Relative Satisfaction/Misery Tendencies</strong>The envy tendency is probably the most obvious manifestation of the relative satisfaction tendency, but nearly all studies of human happiness show that it is related to the state of the person relative to either their past or their peers, not absolute. These relative tendencies cause us great misery or happiness in a very wide variety of objectively different situations and make us poor predictors of our own behavior and feelings.</p><p>As psychologists have frequently and famously demonstrated, humans are subject to a bias towards keeping their prior commitments and staying consistent with our prior selves when possible. This trait is necessary for social cohesion: people who often&nbsp;change their conclusions and habits are often distrusted. Yet our bias towards staying consistent can become, as one wag put it, a “hobgoblin of foolish minds” – when it is combined with the first-conclusion bias, we end up landing on poor answers and standing pat in the face of great evidence.</p><p>Once we know the outcome, it’s nearly impossible to turn back the clock mentally. Our narrative instinct leads us to reason that we knew it all along (whatever “it” is), when in fact we are often simply reasoning post-hoc with information not available to us before&nbsp;the event. The hindsight bias explains why it’s wise to keep a journal of important decisions for an unaltered record and to re-examine our beliefs when we convince ourselves that we knew it all along.</p><p>Justice runs deep in our veins. In another illustration of our relative sense of well-being, we are careful arbiters of what is fair. Violations of fairness can be considered grounds for reciprocal action, or at least distrust. Yet fairness itself seems to be a moving target.&nbsp;What is seen as fair and just in one time and place may not be in another. Consider that slavery has been seen as perfectly natural and perfectly unnatural in alternating phases of human existence.</p><p>We tend to over-ascribe the behavior of others to their innate traits rather than to situational factors, leading us to overestimate how consistent that behavior will be in the future. In such a situation, predicting behavior seems not very difficult. Of course, in practice this assumption is consistently demonstrated to be wrong, and we are consequently surprised when others do not act in accordance with the “innate” traits we’ve endowed them with.</p><p><strong>Stress (Including Breaking Points)</strong>Stress causes both mental and physiological responses and tends to amplify the other biases. Almost all human mental biases become worse in the face of stress as the body goes into a fight-or-flight response, relying purely on instinct without the emergency brake of Daniel Kahneman’s “System 2” type of reasoning. Stress causes hasty decisions, immediacy, and a fallback to habit, thus giving rise to the elite soldiers’ motto: “In the thick of battle, you will not rise to the level of your expectations, but fall to the level of your training.”</p><p>A major problem with historiography – our interpretation of the past – is that history is famously written by the victors. We do not see what Nassim Taleb calls the “silent grave” – the lottery ticket holders who did not win. Thus, we over-attribute success to things done by the successful agent rather than to randomness or luck, and we often learn false lessons by exclusively studying victors without seeing all of the accompanying losers who acted in the same way but were not lucky enough to succeed.</p><p>We might term this Boredom Syndrome: Most humans have the tendency to need to act, even when their actions are not needed. We also tend to offer solutions even when we do not have knowledge to solve the problem.</p><p>What a man wishes, he also believes. Similarly, what we believe is what we choose to see. This is commonly referred to as the confirmation bias. It is a deeply ingrained mental habit, both energy-conserving and comfortable, to look for confirmations of long-held wisdom rather than violations. Yet the scientific process – including hypothesis generation, blind testing when needed, and objective statistical rigor – is designed to root out precisely the opposite, which is why it works so well when followed.</p><p>The modern scientific enterprise operates under the principle of falsification: A method is termed scientific if it can be stated so that a certain defined result would cause it to be proved false. Pseudo-knowledge and pseudo-science operate and propagate by being unfalsifiable. As with astrology, we cannot prove them either correct or incorrect because the conditions under which they would be shown false are never stated.</p>",

      "content": "<p>We’re excited to announce our latest major release, Zotero 8. Zotero 8 builds on the new design and features of <a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/blog/zotero-7/\">Zotero 7</a> and includes a huge number of improvements and refinements.</p><h2>Redesigned Citation Dialog</h2><p>Zotero 8 introduces a new unified citation dialog, replacing the previous citation dialog (the “red bar”), the “classic” citation dialog, and the Add Note dialog (the “yellow bar”).</p><p>The new dialog has two modes: List mode and Library mode. List mode lets you quickly search for citations from across your Zotero libraries by title, creator, and year. Library mode includes a library browser, letting you find items in specific libraries or collections. You can switch between the two modes with a single click, preserving any added items or entered search terms. By default, it will open in the last mode you used, but you can choose a different default mode in the settings.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/blog/zotero-7/\">Zotero 7</a>, we added the ability to quickly add citations for selected items and open documents. In the new dialog, these options are available in both List mode and Library mode, so you can make these quick selections even if you otherwise prefer to add items via the library browser.</p><p>As before, once you’ve selected an item, you can click on its bubble to customize the citation with a page number, prefix, etc. It’s also now possible to add any locator — not just a page number — right from the search bar by typing the full or short name (e.g., “line 10” or “l. 10” after the citation and pressing Enter/Return.</p><p>You can switch between adding citations and adding notes using buttons in the bottom left, corresponding to the Add/Edit Citation and Add Note buttons in your word processor.</p><p>(For those coming from the classic dialog, note that there’s no text field to make manual edits to citations. It’s been possible to edit citations directly in the document for many years, which is why the red bar didn’t include such a text field either. More importantly, though, such manual edits should be avoided in almost all cases. Instead, <a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/support/word_processor_plugin_usage#customizing_cites\">customize the citation</a> via the citation dialog, which will allow Zotero to continue to update the citation as necessary.)</p><h2>Annotations in the Items List</h2><p>Annotations you make on PDFs, EPUBs, and webpage snapshots now show up under their parent attachments in the items list.</p><p>Showing annotations in the items list makes it easier to view annotations across a library or collection, and it also makes it possible to search for annotations directly. For example, you can search for all annotations in a collection with a given tag and then create a note from those annotations or copy them to an external text editor with Quick Copy.</p><p>In Advanced Search, you can use “Item Type” “is” “Annotation” to match annotations or use the Annotation Text and Annotation Comment search conditions to search for specific parts of the annotation.</p><p>You can assign tags to selected annotations by dragging them to the tag selector, just like other items.</p><p>Selected annotations show up in the item pane, grouped by top-level item.</p><h2>Reader Appearance Panel with Theme Support</h2><p>We’ve added a new Appearance panel in the reader that provides quick access to view settings and introduces support for reader themes.</p><p>The view settings are per-document settings. Themes are applied globally for all documents, including in the attachment preview in the item pane, and apply to PDFs, EPUBs, and webpage snapshots.</p><p>We offer a number of built-in themes (“Dark”, “Snow”, “Sepia”), and you can create custom themes just by specifying a foreground and background color. (Some other theme engines require additional accent colors, but we’ve tried to make this as simple as possible for users by automatically adjusting other colors based on the foreground and background colors.) You can set a different theme that applies to light mode and dark mode.</p><p>The themes replace the previous on-by-default “Use Dark Mode for Content” option, which inverted images in dark mode. We’re now simply darkening images a bit when using a dark theme. Images and ink annotations in the reader sidebar and note editor are now only darkened as well (and only when Zotero itself is in dark mode).</p><p>When possible, we also try to apply themes to PDF pages containing full-page images, such as scanned papers, by replacing whitish/dark colors with theme colors. (Otherwise we simply darken the page slightly.)</p><p>It’s now possible to open notes in tabs in addition to separate windows. Note tabs fill the whole window, with wide margins for better readability and a clean, distraction-free space for note-taking.</p><p>By default, double-clicking a note in the items list will open it in a tab. You can choose to open the note in the other space from the context menu, and you can change the default behavior using the “Open notes in new windows instead of tabs” setting in the General pane of the settings.</p><p>Notes in tabs have a separate font size setting in the View menu.</p><h2>Reading Mode for Webpage Snapshots</h2><p>Reading Mode reformats webpage snapshots for easier reading, with unnecessary page elements removed. You can adjust line height and other view options from the Appearance panel.</p><p>We’ve reworked the tabs menu to make it faster to interact with via the keyboard.</p><p>You can now press Ctrl/Cmd-; to bring up the menu at any time.</p><p>Once the menu is open, it simultaneously accepts search input, up/down navigation, and row selection, without the need to move between different parts of the menu. You can simply start typing the name of an open tab and then press Enter/Return to switch to it once you’ve narrowed down the list.</p><p>It’s also possible to quickly close multiple tabs by moving between the row close buttons with up/down and pressing space bar to close a tab.</p><p>Zotero now automatically keeps attachment filenames in sync with parent item metadata as you make changes (e.g., changing the title). In previous versions, while Zotero would automatically rename files when you first added them to your library, if you later edited the item’s metadata, you would need to right-click on the attachment and select “Rename File from Parent Metadata”.</p><p>You can configure which file types renaming applies to from the General tab of the Zotero settings.</p><p>After upgrading to this version, existing eligible files that don’t match the current filename format won’t be automatically renamed, but you can choose to rename them en masse from the Zotero settings. Zotero will also prompt you to rename all files if you change the filename format.</p><p>“Rename File from Parent Metadata” has been removed from the item context menu. If a filename doesn’t match the configured filename format (e.g., because automatic renaming is disabled or you changed the format but didn’t choose to rename all files), you can click the “Rename File to Match Parent Item” button next to the filename in the attachment’s item pane to rename it.</p><h2>New Attachment Title Options</h2><p>Zotero 7 introduced more consistent handling of <a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/support/kb/attachment_title_vs_filename\">attachment titles</a>, preserving simpler, less-redundant titles (e.g., “Full Text PDF” or “Preprint PDF”) in cases where the title was previously changed to match the filename. Zotero 8 further refines its renaming and titling logic when adding multiple and/or non-primary attachments, to bring the functionality better in line with the intended behavior.</p><p>We’ve also added a “Normalize Attachment Titles” option under Tools → Manage Attachments to update old primary attachments with titles matching the filename to use simpler titles such as “PDF”.</p><p>While we recommend the default behavior, allowing Zotero to rename primary files and keep them renamed while using simpler titles in the items list, if you really prefer to view filenames instead of titles, you can now enable “Show attachment filenames in the items list” option in the General pane of the settings.</p><p>Zotero 8 adds a version for Linux running on ARM64 devices. This includes ARM-based Chromebooks, Apple Silicon Macs running Linux (Linux VMs, Asahi Linux), and Raspberry Pis.</p><p>If you’ve been unable to run Zotero on your ARM-based device, or you’ve been running the x86_64 version under emulation, give it a try.</p><h2>User Interface Improvements</h2><p>We’ve made a number of changes across the interface to address common requests:</p><ul><li>A new button in the library tab allows you to quickly close the item pane without dragging its edge or using the menus.</li><li>You can reorder item pane sections by dragging their icons in the side navigation bar.</li><li>You can drag items, collections, and searches into the trash.</li><li>You can drag attachments, notes, and related items from the item pane (e.g., to copy files to the filesystem or use Quick Copy).</li><li>Collections automatically expand when you drag over them, making it easier to drop collections or items into subcollections.</li><li>You can delete attachments from the item pane.</li><li>Tabs maintain their size as you close them for faster closing of multiple tabs.</li></ul><p>With Zotero 8, the Zotero Connector save popup can autocomplete tags in your Zotero library and allows you to add a note to items as you save them.</p><p>Zotero 8 includes much more than we can list here. See the <a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/support/8.0_changelog\">changelog</a> for additional details.</p><p>If you’re already running Zotero, you can upgrade from within Zotero by going to Help → “Check for Updates…”.</p><p><small>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis entry was posted\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ton Thursday, January 22nd, 2026 at 12:52 pm by Dan Stillman\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand is filed under <a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/blog/category/features/\" rel=\"category tag\">Features</a>, <a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/blog/category/news/\" rel=\"category tag\">News</a>.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</small></p>",

This type of technology should prevent anyone except the device owner from accessing the data if the computer is locked and powered off.&nbsp;</p><p>But, by default, BitLocker recovery keys are uploaded to Microsoft’s cloud, allowing the tech giant — and by extension law enforcement — to access them and use them to decrypt drives encrypted with BitLocker, as with the case reported by Forbes.</p><p>The case involved several people suspected of fraud related to the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program in Guam, a U.S. island in the Pacific. Local news outlet Pacific Daily News <a href=\"https://www.guampdn.com/news/another-unsealed-warrant-encrypted-data-seized-in-pua-fraud-investigation/article_1b98b770-daf5-436a-97f9-3a11f57accf5.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">covered</a> the case last year, reporting that a warrant had been served to Microsoft in relation to the suspects’ hard drives.

Microsoft told Forbes that the company sometimes provides BitLocker recovery keys to authorities, having received an average of 20 such requests per year.&nbsp;</p><p>Apart from the privacy risks of handing recovery keys to a company, Johns Hopkins professor and cryptography expert Matthew Green <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/matthewdgreen.bsky.social/post/3md3vciumvk2s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">raised the potential scenario</a> where malicious hackers compromise Microsoft’s cloud infrastructure — something that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/17/microsoft-lost-keys-government-hacked/\">has happened</a><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/19/hackers-breached-microsoft-to-find-out-what-microsoft-knows-about-them/\">several times</a> in recent years — and get access to these recovery keys. The hackers would still need physical access to the hard drives to use the stolen recovery keys.</p><p>“It’s 2026 and these concerns have been known for years,” Green wrote in a <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/matthewdgreen.bsky.social/post/3md3vnprijk2s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">post on Bluesky</a>. “Microsoft’s inability to secure critical customer keys is starting to make it an outlier from the rest of the industry.”</p>",

      "content": "<p>On January 22, 2026, an automated routing policy configuration error caused us to leak some <a href=\"https://cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-bgp/\"><u>Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)</u></a> prefixes unintentionally from a router at our data center in Miami, Florida. While the route leak caused some impact to Cloudflare customers, multiple external parties were also affected because their traffic was accidentally funnelled through our Miami data center location.</p><p>The route leak lasted 25 minutes, causing congestion on some of our backbone infrastructure in Miami, elevated loss for some Cloudflare customer traffic, and higher latency for traffic across these links. Additionally, some traffic was discarded by firewall filters on our routers that are designed to only accept traffic for Cloudflare services and our customers.</p><p>While we’ve written about route leaks before, we rarely find ourselves causing them. This route leak was the result of an accidental misconfiguration on a router in Cloudflare’s network, and only affected IPv6 traffic. We sincerely apologize to the users, customers, and networks we impacted yesterday as a result of this BGP route leak.</p><p>Essentially, a route leak occurs when a network tells the broader Internet to send it traffic that it's not supposed to forward. Technically, a route leak occurs when a network, or Autonomous System (AS), appears unexpectedly in an AS path. An AS path is what BGP uses to determine the path across the Internet to a final destination. An example of an anomalous AS path indicative of a route leak would be finding a network sending routes received from a peer to a provider.</p><p>During this type of route leak, the rules of <a href=\"https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sylvia/cs268-2019/papers/gao-rexford.pdf\"></a> are violated, as BGP updates are sent from AS64501 to their peer (AS64502), and then unexpectedly up to a provider (AS64503). Oftentimes the leaker, in this case AS64502, is not prepared to handle the amount of traffic they are going to receive and may not even have firewall filters configured to accept all of the traffic coming in their direction. In simple terms, once a route update is sent to a peer or provider, it should only be sent further to customers and not to another peer or provider AS.</p><p>During the incident on January 22, we caused a similar kind of route leak, in which we took routes from some of our peers and redistributed them in Miami to some of our peers and providers. According to the route leak definitions in RFC7908, we caused a mixture of Type 3 and Type 4 route leaks on the Internet.&nbsp;</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p>A change that ultimately triggers the routing policy bug is merged in our network automation code repository</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Automation is run on single Miami edge-router resulting in unexpected advertisements to BGP transit providers and peers</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Network team begins investigating unintended route advertisements from Miami</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Incident is raised to coordinate response</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>The bad configuration change is manually reverted by a network operator, and automation is paused for the router, so it cannot run again</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>The change that triggered the leak is reverted from our code repository</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Automation is confirmed by operators to be healthy to run again on the Miami router, without the routing policy bug</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Automation is unpaused on the single router in Miami</p></td></tr></tbody></table><div><h3>What happened: the configuration error</h3><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/route-leak-incident-january-22-2026/#what-happened-the-configuration-error\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a></div><p>On January 22, 2026, at 20:25 UTC, we pushed a change via our policy automation platform to remove the BGP announcements from Miami for one of our data centers in Bogotá, Colombia.

      "content": "<p>In 1978, Intel introduced the 8086 processor, a revolutionary chip that led to the modern x86 architecture.\nUnlike modern 64-bit processors, however, the 8086 is a 16-bit chip.\nIts arithmetic/logic unit (ALU) operates on 16-bit values, performing arithmetic operations such as addition and subtraction,\nas well as logic operations including bitwise AND, OR, and XOR.\nThe 8086's ALU is a complicated part of the chip, performing 28 operations in total.</p><p>In this post, I discuss the circuitry that controls the ALU, generating the appropriate control signals for a\nparticular operation.\nThe process is more complicated than you might expect. First, a machine code instruction results in the execution of multiple\nmicrocode instructions.\nUsing the ALU is a two-step process: one microcode instruction (micro-instruction) configures the ALU for the desired operation,\nwhile a second\nmicro-instruction gets the results from the ALU.\nMoreover, based on both the microcode micro-instruction and the machine code instruction, the control circuitry sends control signals to the ALU,\nreconfiguring it for the desired operation.\nThus, this circuitry provides the \"glue\" between the micro-instructions and the ALU.</p><p>The die photo below shows the 8086 processor under a microscope.\nI've labeled the key functional blocks.\nArchitecturally, the chip is partitioned into a Bus Interface Unit (BIU) at the top and an Execution Unit (EU) below.\nThe BIU handles bus and memory activity as well as instruction prefetching, while the Execution Unit (EU) executes the instructions.\nIn the lower right corner, the microcode ROM holds the micro-instructions.\nThe ALU is in the lower left corner, with bits 7-0 above and bits 15-8 below, sandwiching the status flag circuitry.\nThe ALU control circuitry, highlighted in red at the bottom of the chip, is the focus of this article.</p><div>The die of the 8086. Click this image (or any other) for a larger version.</div><p>The 8086 processor implements most machine instructions in microcode, with a micro-instruction for each step of the machine instruction.\n(I discuss the 8086's microcode in detail <a href=\"https://www.righto.com/2022/11/how-8086-processors-microcode-engine.html\">here</a>.)\nThe 8086 uses an interesting architecture for microcode:\neach micro-instruction performs two unrelated operations. The first operation moves data between a source and a destination.\nThe second operation can range from a jump or subroutine call to a memory read/write or an ALU operation.\nAn ALU operation has a five-bit field to specify a particular operation and a two-bit field to specify\nwhich temporary register provides the input. As you'll see below, these two fields play an important role in the ALU circuitry.</p><p>In many cases, the 8086's micro-instruction doesn't specify the ALU operation, leaving the details to be substituted from the machine instruction opcode.\nFor instance, the ADD, SUB, ADC, SBB, AND, OR, XOR, and CMP\nmachine instructions share the same microcode, while the hardware selects the ALU operation from the instruction opcode.\nLikewise, the increment and decrement instructions use the same microcode, as do the decimal adjust instructions DAA and DAS, and the\nASCII adjust instructions AAA and AAS.\nInside the micro-instruction, all these operations are performed with a \"pseudo\" ALU operation called XI (for some reason).\nIf the microcode specifies an XI ALU operation, the hardware replaces it with the ALU operation specified in the instruction.\nAnother important feature of the microcode is \nthat you need to perform one ALU micro-instruction to configure the ALU's operation, but the result isn't\navailable until a later micro-instruction, which moves the result to a destination.\nThis has the consequence that the hardware must remember the ALU operation.</p><p>To make this concrete, here is the microcode that implements a typical arithmetic instruction such as  or .\nThis microcode consists of three micro-instructions. \nThe left half of each micro-instruction specifies a data movement, first moving the two arguments to ALU temporary registers\nand then storing the ALU result (called Σ).\nThe right half of each micro-instruction performs the second task.\nFirst, the ALU is configured to perform an  operation using temporary register A. Recall that  indicates the ALU operation\nis filled in from the machine instruction; this is how the same microcode handles eight different types of machine instructions.\nIn the second micro-instruction, the next machine instruction is started unless a memory writeback is required ().\nThe last micro-instruction is  (Run Next Instruction) to start a new machine instruction. It also indicates that the\nprocessor status flags () should be updated to indicate if the ALU result is zero, positive, overflow, and so forth.</p><pre>M → tmpa   XI   tmpa  \nR → tmpb   WB,NXT     \nΣ → M      RNI  F     </pre><p>The ALU is the heart of a processor, performing arithmetic and logic operations.\nMicroprocessors of the 1970s typically supported addition and subtraction; logical AND, OR, and XOR; and various bit shift operations.\n(Although the 8086 had multiply and divide instructions, these were implemented in microcode, not in the ALU.)\nSince an ALU is both large and critical to performance, chip architects try to optimize its design.\nAs a result, different microprocessors have widely different ALU designs.\nFor instance, the 6502 microprocessor has separate circuits for addition and each logic operation; a multiplexer selects the appropriate\noutput.\nThe Intel 8085, on the other hand, uses an optimized clump of gates that performs the desired operation based on control signals (<a href=\"https://www.righto.com/2013/01/inside-alu-of-8085-microprocessor.html\">details</a>), while the Z80's 4-bit ALU uses a different clump of gates (<a href=\"https://www.righto.com/2013/09/the-z-80-has-4-bit-alu-heres-how-it.html\">details</a>).</p><p>The 8086 takes a different approach, using two lookup tables (along with other gates) to generate the carry and output signals for each bit in the ALU.\nBy setting the lookup tables appropriately, the ALU can be configured to perform the desired operation.\n(This is similar to how an FPGA implements arbitrary functions through lookup tables.)\nThe schematic below shows the circuit for one bit of the ALU.\nI won't explain this circuit in detail since I explained it in <a href=\"https://www.righto.com/2020/08/reverse-engineering-8086s.html\">an earlier article</a>.\nThe relevant part of this circuit is the six control signals at the left.\nThe two multiplexers (trapezoidal symbols) implement the lookup tables by using the two input argument bits to select outputs from\nthe control signals to control carry generation and carry propagation.\nThus, by feeding appropriate control signals into the ALU, the 8086 can reconfigure the ALU to perform the desired operation.\nFor instance, with one set of control signals, this circuit will add. Other sets of control signals will cause the circuit to subtract\nor compute a logical operation, such as AND or XOR.\nThe 8086 has 16 copies of this circuit, so it operates on 16-bit values.</p><div>The circuit that implements one bit in the 8086's ALU.</div><p>The 8086 is a complicated processor, and its instructions have many special cases, so controlling the ALU is\nmore complex than described above.\nFor instance, the compare operation is the same as a subtraction, except the numerical result of a compare is discarded; just the\nstatus flags are updated.\nThe add versus add-with-carry instructions require different values for the carry into bit 0, while subtraction requires the\ncarry flag to be inverted since it is treated as a borrow.\nThe 8086's ALU supports increment and decrement operations, but also increment and decrement by 2, which requires an increment signal into bit\n1 instead of bit 0.\nThe bit-shift operations all require special treatment. For instance, a rotate can use the carry bit or exclude the carry bit, while\nand arithmetic shift right requires the top bit to be duplicated.\nAs a result, along with the six lookup table (LUT) control signals, the ALU also requires numerous control signals to adjust its\nbehavior for specific instructions.\nIn the next section, I'll explain how these control signals are generated.</p><h2>ALU control circuitry on the die</h2><p>The diagram below shows the components of the ALU control logic as they appear on the die.\nThe information from the micro-instruction enters at the right and is stored in the latches.\nThe PLAs (Programmable Logic Arrays) decode the instruction and generate the control signals.\nThese signals flow to the left, where they control the ALU.</p><div>The ALU control logic as it appears on the die. I removed the metal layer to show the underlying polysilicon and silicon. The reddish lines are remnants of the metal.</div><p>As explained earlier, if the microcode specifies the  operation, the operation field is replaced with a value based on the machine instruction opcode.\nThis substitution is performed by the  multiplexer before the value is stored in the operation latch.\nBecause of the complexity of the 8086 instruction set, the  operation is not as straightforward as you might expect.\nThis multiplexer gets three instruction bits from a special register called the \"X\" register, another instruction bit from the instruction\nregister, and the final bit from a decoding circuit called the Group Decode ROM.</p><p>Recall that one micro-instruction specifies the ALU operation, and a later micro-instruction accesses the result. Thus, the\nALU control circuitry must remember the specified operation so it can be used later. \nIn particular, the control circuitry must keep track of the ALU operation to perform and the temporary register specified.\nThe control circuitry uses three flip-flops to keep track of the specified temporary register, one flip-flop for each register.\nThe micro-instruction contains a two-bit field that specifies the temporary register. The control circuitry decodes this field and\nactivates the associated flip-flop.\nThe outputs from these flip-flops go to the ALU and enable the associated temporary register.\nAt the start of each machine instruction, the flip-flops are reset, so temporary register A is selected by default.</p><p>The control circuitry uses five flip-flops to store the five-bit operation field from the micro-instruction.\nAt the start of each machine instruction, the flip-flops are reset so operation 0 (ADD) is specified by default.\nOne important consequence is that an add operation can potentially be performed without a micro-instruction to configure the ALU,\nshortening the microcode by one micro-instruction and thus shortening the instruction time by one cycle.</p><p>The five-bit output from the operation flip-flops goes to the operation PLA (Programmable Logic Array), which decodes the operation\ninto 27 control signals.\nMany of these signals go to the ALU, where they control the behavior of the ALU for special cases.\nAbout 15 of these signals go to the Lookup Table (LUT) PLA, which generates the six lookup table signals for the ALU.\nAt the left side of the LUT PLA, special high-current driver circuits amplify the control signals before they are sent to the ALU.\nDetails on these drivers are in the footnotes.</p><p>Whenever I look at the circuitry of the 8086 processor, I see the differences between a RISC chip and a CISC chip.\nIn a RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) processor such as ARM, instruction decoding is straightforward, as is the processor circuitry.\nBut in the 8086, a CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer) processor, there are corner cases and complications everywhere.\nFor instance, an 8086 machine instruction sometimes specifies the ALU operation in the first byte and sometimes in the second byte,\nand sometimes elsewhere, so the X register latch, the XI multiplexer, and the Group Decode ROM are needed.\nThe 8086's ALU includes obscure operations including four types of BCD adjustments and seven types of shifts, making the ALU more\ncomplicated.\nOf course, the continuing success of x86 shows that this complexity also has benefits.</p><p>This article has been a deep dive into the details of the 8086's ALU, but I hope you have found it interesting.\nIf it's too much detail for you, you might prefer my overview of the <a href=\"https://www.righto.com/2020/08/reverse-engineering-8086s.html\">8086 ALU</a>.</p>",

But because it’s a good piece of speculative design fiction that asks provocative questions and reveals the shape of constraints we’ll face as agentic coding systems mature and grow.</p><div data-astro-cid-z3fakvtz=\"\"><div data-astro-cid-z3fakvtz=\"\"><p>“Design fiction” or “speculative design” is a branch of design where you create things (objects, prototypes, sketches) from a plausible near future. Not to predict what’s going to happen, but to provoke questions and start conversations about what  happen. Not in a bright-and-glorious-flying-cars way that futurism can sometimes fall into. But, most helpfully, in a way that thinks about banal details, overlooked everyday interactions, low status objects, imperfect implementations, knock-on effects, and inconveniences. See the Near Future Lab’s short     and their     if you want to learn more.</p></div></div><p>I also think Yegge deserves praise for exercising agency and taking a swing at a system like this, despite the inefficiencies and chaos of this iteration. And then running a public tour of his shitty, quarter-built plane while it’s mid-flight.</p><p>When I was taken to the Tate Modern as a child I’d point at     pieces and say to my mother “I could do that”, and she would say “yes, but you didn’t.” Many people have talked about what large-scale, automated agent orchestration systems  look like in a few years, and no one else attempted to sincerely build it.</p><p>I should be transparent and say that I have not used Gas Town in earnest on any serious work. I have only lightly poked at it, because I do not qualify as a serious user when I’m still hovering around stages 4-6 in Yegge’s 8 levels of automation:</p><p>I currently juggle a handful of consecutive     and     agents, but pay close attention to the diffs and regularly check code in an IDE. Which I guess puts me in the agentically conservative camp in this distressingly breakneck moment in history.</p><p>Gas Town is a full-on stage 8 piece of tooling: using an orchestrator that manages dozens+ of other coding agents for you. Yegge also warned me not to seriously use Gas Town multiple times, in increasingly threatening typography. I trust his guidance on his own slush pile.</p><p>But I have grokked the basic concepts and spent more time with this manifesto than is warranted. And here is what stood out to me from the parts I could comprehend:</p><p>When you have a fat stack of agents churning through code tasks, development time is no longer the bottleneck. Yegge says “Gas Town churns through implementation plans so quickly that you have to do a LOT of design and planning to keep the engine fed.” Design becomes the limiting factor: imagining what you want to create and then figuring out all the gnarly     required to make your imagination into reality.</p><p>I certainly feel this friction in both my own professional work and personal projects. My development velocity is far slower than Yegge since I only wrangle a few agents at a time and keep my eyes and hands on the code. But the build time is rarely what holds me up. It is always the design; how should we architect this? What should this feel like? How should this look? Is that transition subtle enough? How composable should this be? Is this the right metaphor?</p><p>When it’s not the design, it’s the product strategy and planning; What are the highest priority features to tackle? Which piece of this should we build first? When do we need to make that decision? What’s the next logical, incremental step we need to make progress here?</p><p>These are the kind of decisions that agents cannot make for you. They require your human context, taste, preferences, and vision.</p><p>With agents to hand, it’s easy to get ahead of yourself, stumbling forward into stacks of generated functions that should never have been prompted into existence, because they do not correctly render your intentions or achieve your goals.</p><p>Gas Town seems to be halfway into this pitfall. The biggest flaw in Yegge’s creation is that it is poorly designed. I mean this in the sense that he absolutely did not design the shape of this system ahead of time, thoughtfully considering which metaphors and primitives would make this effective, efficient, easy to use, and comprehensible.</p><p>He just made stuff up as he went. He says as much himself: “Gas Town is complicated. Not because I wanted it to be, but because I had to keep adding components until it was a self-sustaining machine.” Gas Town is composed of “especially difficult [theories] because it’s a bunch of bullshit I pulled out of my arse over the past 3 weeks, and I named it after badgers and stuff.” It was slapdashed together over “17 days, 75k lines of code, 2000 commits. It finally got off the ground (GUPP started working) just 2 days ago.”</p><p>This Hacker News     describes the problem well, and points out that Yegge’s previous     project, of which Gas Town is an extension, suffers the same issue:</p><div data-align-left=\"true\" data-astro-cid-572j4yyn=\"\"><p>“Beads is a good idea with a bad implementation. It’s not a designed product in the sense we are used to, it’s more like <strong>a stream of consciousness converted directly into code. It’s a program that isn’t only vibe coded, it was vibe designed too.</strong>”</p><p>“Gas Town is clearly the same thing multiplied by ten thousand. <strong>The number of overlapping and ad hoc concepts in this design is overwhelming.</strong> Steve is ahead of his time but we aren’t going to end up using this stuff. Instead a few of the core insights will get incorporated into other agents in a simpler but no less effective way.”</p></div><div data-align-left=\"true\" data-astro-cid-572j4yyn=\"\"><p>“gas town [is] such a nightmare to use i love it… the mayor is dumb as rocks the witness regularly forgets to look at stuff the deacon makes his own rules the crew have the object permanence of a tank full of goldfish and the polecats seem intent on wreaking as much chaos on the project as they can. this is peak entertainment i swear”</p></div><p>Friends and colleagues of mine who have been brave enough to try out Gas Town in more depth report the same thing; this thing fits the shape of Yegge’s brain and no one else’s. I’d categorise that as a moderate design fail, given this is a public product that I assume Yegge wants  people to try out. The onboarding is baptism by fire.</p><p>This feels like one of the most critical, emerging footguns of liberally hands-off agentic development. You can move so fast you never stop to think. It is so easy to prompt, you don’t fully consider what you’re building at each step of the process. It is only once you are hip-deep in poor architectural decisions, inscrutable bugs, and a fuzzy memory of what you set out to do, do you realise you have burned a billion tokens in exchange for a pile of hot trash.</p><h2 data-astro-cid-lz3qpvh2=\"\">2. Buried in the chaos are sketches of future agent orchestration patterns</h2><p>Now that I’ve just critiqued the design of Gas Town, I will turn around and say that while the current amalgamation of polecats, convoys, deacons, molecules, protomolecules, mayors, seances, hooks, beads, witnesses, wisps, rigs, refineries, and dogs is a bunch of under cooked spaghetti, Yegge’s patterns  sketch out some useful conceptual shapes for future agentic systems.</p><p>If you step back and squint, this mishmash of concepts reveals a few underlying patterns that future agentic systems will likely follow:</p><h3 data-astro-cid-6vq7zla3=\"\">Agents have specialised roles with hierarchical supervision</h3><p>Every agent in Gas Town has a permanent, specialised role. When an agent spins up a new session, it knows who it is and what job it needs to do. Some examples:</p><ul><li> is the human concierge: it’s the main agent you talk to. It talks to all the other agents for you, kicking off work, receiving notifications when things finish, and managing the flow of production.</li><li> are temporary grunt workers. They complete single, isolated tasks, then disappear after submitting their work to be merged.</li><li> supervises the Polecats and helps them get unstuck. Its job is to solve problems and nudge the proletariat workers along.</li><li> manages the merge queue into the main branch. It evaluates each piece of work waiting to be merged, resolving conflicts in the process. It can creatively “re-imagine” implementations if merge conflicts get too hairy, while trying to keep the intent of the original work.</li></ul><p>There are many more characters in this town, but these give you a flavour of the system. Giving each agent a single job means you can prompt them more precisely, limit what they’re allowed to touch, and run lots of them at once without them stepping on each other’s toes.</p><p>There’s also a clear chain of command between these agents. You talk to the Mayor, who coordinates work across the system. The Mayor in Gas Town never writes code. It talks to you, then creates work tasks and assigns them to workers. A set of system supervisors called the Witness, the Deacon, and “Boot the Dog” intermittently nudge the grunt workers and each other to check everyone is doing their work. Oh and there’s also a crew of “dogs” who do maintenance and cleaning.</p><p>It’s easier if I try and show you. Here’s the basic relationship structure of Gas Town, as best I can make out:</p><p>Since I’m making my own visuals here, I should justify it by pointing out that while Yegge made lots of his own ornate, zoopmorphic diagrams of Gas Town’s architecture and workflows, they are unhelpful. Primarily because they were made entirely by Gemini’s    . And while Nano Banana is state-of-the-art at making diagrams, generative AI systems are still really shit at making illustrative diagrams. They are very hard to decipher, filled with cluttered details, have arrows pointing the wrong direction, and are often missing key information. Case in point:</p><p>Does this help you understand how the system works? No? No.</p><p>Gas Town’s hierarchical approach solves both a coordination and attention problem. Without it, you are the one assigning tasks to dozens individual agents, checking who’s stuck, who’s idle, and who’s waiting on work from someone else. With the Mayor as your single interface, that overhead disappears. You can continuously talk to the Mayor without interrupting any agents or getting in the way, or having to think much about which one is doing what. This is less cognitive overhead than constantly switching tabs between Claudes.</p><p>I think there’s a lot of opportunity to diversify the cast of characters here and make more use of    . The agents in Gas Town are all generalist workers in the software development pipeline. But we could add in any kind of specialist we want: a dev ops expert, a product manager, a front-end debugger, an accessibility checker, a documentation writer. These would be called in on-demand to apply their special skills and tools.</p><h3 data-astro-cid-6vq7zla3=\"\">Agent roles and tasks persist, sessions are ephemeral</h3><p>One of the major limitations of current coding agents is running out of context. Before you even hit the limits of a context window,     degrades the output enough that it’s not worth keeping. We constantly have to compact or start fresh sessions.</p><p>Gas Town’s solution to this is make each agent session disposable by design. It stores the important information – agent identities and tasks – in Git, then liberally kills off sessions and spins up fresh ones when needed. New sessions are told their identity and currently assigned work, and continue on where the last one left off. Gas Town also lets new sessions ask their predecessors what happened through “seancing”: resuming the last session as a separate instance in order to let the new agent ask questions about unfinished work.</p><p>This saving and recalling is all done through Gas Town’s “Beads” system.  Beads are tiny, trackable units of work – like issues in an issue tracker – stored as JSON in Git alongside your code. Each bead has an ID, description, status, and assignee. Agent identities are also stored as beads, giving each worker a persistent address that survives session crashes.</p><p>Yegge didn’t invent this pattern of tracking atomic tasks outside agent memory in something structured like JSON. Anthropic described the same approach in their research on    , just published in November 2025. I give it a hot minute before this type of task tracking lands in Claude Code.</p><h3 data-astro-cid-6vq7zla3=\"\">Feeding agents continuous streams of work</h3><p>The whole promise of an orchestration system like Gas Town is it’s a perpetual motion machine. You give high-level orders to the mayor, and then a zoo of agents kicks off to break it down into tasks, assign them, execute them, check for bugs, fix the bugs, review the code, and merge it in.</p><p>Each worker agent in Gas Town has its own queue of assigned work and a “hook” pointing to the current thing they should be doing. The minute they finish a task, the next one jumps to the front of the queue. The mayor is the one filling up these queues – it’s in charge of breaking down large features into atomic tasks and assigning them to available workers. In theory, the workers are never idle or lacking tasks, so long as you keep feeding the mayor your grand plans.</p><p>This principle of “workers always do their work” is better in theory than practice. It turns out to be slightly difficult to make happen because of the way current models are trained. They’re designed as helpful assistants who wait politely for human instructions. They’re not used to checking a task queue and independently getting on with things.</p><p>Gas Town’s patchwork solution to this is aggressive prompting and constant nudging. Supervisor agents spend their time poking workers to see if anyone’s stalled out or run dry on work. When one goes quiet, they send it a ping which jolts the agent into checking its queue and getting back to work. These periodic nudges move through the agent hierarchy like a heartbeat keeping everything moving. This is a decent band-aid for the first version, but more serious efforts at agent orchestration systems will need reliable ways to keep agents on task.</p><h3 data-astro-cid-6vq7zla3=\"\">Merge queues and agent-managed conflicts</h3><p>When you have a bunch of agents all working in parallel, you’re of course going to run into merge conflicts. Each agent is off on its own branch, and by the time it finishes its task, the main branch might look completely different – other changes have landed, the code has moved on. The later an agent finishes, the worse this gets. Normally you, the human, takes on the burden of sorting out the mess and deciding which changes to keep. But if agents are running on their own, something has to do that job for them.</p><p>So Gas Town has a dedicated merge agent – the Refinery – that works through the merge queue one change at a time. It looks at each merge request, resolves any conflicts, and gets it into main. When things get really tangled – when so much has changed that the original work doesn’t even make sense anymore – it can creatively “re-imagine” the changes: re-doing the work to fit the new codebase. Or escalate to a human if needed.</p><p>But there’s another way to sidestep merge conflict nightmares that Gas Town doesn’t have built in: ditch PRs for    . The traditional git workflow puts each feature on its own branch for days or weeks, accumulating commits, then getting merged back as one chunky PR.</p><p>Stacked diffs avoid this conflict-prone approach by breaking work into small, atomic changes that each get reviewed and merged on their own, building on top of each other. Every change gets its own branch, forked off the previous change, forming a “stack” of changes dependent on one another. When a change earlier in the stack gets updated, all the changes below it automatically rebase on top of the new version.</p><p>This fits how agents naturally work. They’re already producing tiny, focused changes rather than sprawling multi-day branches. When conflicts do pop up, they’re easier to untangle because each diff touches less code.    ’s recent acquisition of    , a tool built specifically for stacked diff workflows, suggests I am not the only one who sees this opportunity. When you’ve got dozens of agents landing changes continuously, you need tools and interfaces specifically designed for these frequent, incremental merges.</p><h2 data-astro-cid-lz3qpvh2=\"\">3. The price is extremely high, but so is the (potential) value</h2><p>Yegge describes Gas Town as “expensive as hell… you won’t like Gas Town if you ever have to think, even for a moment, about where money comes from.” He’s on his second Claude account to get around Anthropic’s spending limits.</p><p>I can’t find any mention online of the per-account limits, but let’s conservatively assume he’s spending at least $2,000 USD per month, and liberally $5,000.</p><p>The current cost is almost certainly artificially inflated by system inefficiency. Work gets lost, bugs get fixed numerous times, designs go missing and need redoing. As models improve and orchestration patterns mature, the cost of orchestrators like this should drop while output quality rises.</p><p>I expect companies would happily pay around the $1-3k/month mark for a sane, understandable, higher quality, and lower waste version of Gas Town. Maybe that sounds absurd to you, given we’ve all become anchored to the artificially low rate of $100-200/month for unlimited usage by the major providers. But once the AI bubble pops, the VC funds dry up, and providers have to charge the true cost of inference at scale, we should expect that “unlimited” tier to look a lot pricier.</p><p>Even when that comes to pass, a few thousand is pretty reasonable when you compare it to an average US senior developer salary: $120,000 USD.  If Gas Town could genuinely speed up the work of a senior developer by 2-3x or more, it would easily be worth 10-30% of their salary. The cost per unit of valuable work starts to look competitive with human labour.</p><div data-astro-cid-zk3dhqbk=\"\"><p data-astro-cid-zk3dhqbk=\"\">Annual cost as a percentage of developer salary</p></div><p>The maths on paying for something like this is already defensible in wealthier places like the US and parts of Western Europe. In spots where developer salaries are lower, we would expect the budget for AI assisted tools adjusts accordingly. They’ll get less crazy scaled automation and more conservative usage with humans filling in the cognitive gaps.</p><h2 data-astro-cid-lz3qpvh2=\"\">4. Yegge never looks at code. When should we stop looking too?</h2><p>Yegge is leaning into the true definition of     with this project: “It is 100% vibecoded. I’ve never seen the code, and I never care to.” Not looking at code  is a very bold proposition, today, in January 2026.</p><p>Given the current state of models and the meagre safeguards we have in place around them, the vast majority of us would consider this blind coding approach irresponsible and daft to do on anything that isn’t a throwaway side project. Which, given the amount of effort and Claude tokens Yegge has sunk into building it, writing documentation, and publicly promoting it, Gas Town is not.</p><p>“Should developers still look at code?” will become one of the most divisive and heated debates over the coming years. You might be offended by the question, and find it absurd anyone is asking. But it’s a sincere question and the answer will change faster than you think.</p><p>I’m already seeing people divide along moralistic, personal identity lines as they try to answer it. Some declare themselves purist, AI sceptic, Real Developers who check every diff and hand-adjust specific lines, sneering at anyone reckless enough to let agents run free. While others lean into agentic maximalism, directing fleets from on high and pitying the mass of luddites still faffing about with manual edits like it’s 2019. Both camps mistake a contextual judgement for a personality trait and firm moral position.</p><p>A more conservative, easier to consider, debate is: how  should the code be in agentic software development tools? How easy should it be to access? How often do we expect developers to edit it by hand?</p><p>Interfaces like    ,    , and     do not put code front and centre in the experience. The agent is your first and primary interface. You might be able to see diffs rolls by or display code files inline, but you can’t touch them. Trying to edit code yourself is a roundabout journey of opening your IDE and navigating to the correct files and lines.</p><p>This design choice assumes it is easier to ask an agent to make the change for you, than it is to type it out the syntax yourself. They clearly say “we don’t believe users need to touch code.”</p><p>Framing this debate as an either/or – either you look at code or don’t, either you edit code by hand or you exclusively direct agents, either you’re the anti-AI-purist or the agentic-maxxer – is unhelpful. Because nothing is a strict binary.</p><p>The right distance isn’t about what kind of person you are or what you believe about AI capabilities in the current moment. How far away you step from the syntax shifts based on what you’re building, who you’re building with, and what happens when things go wrong. The degree of freedom you hand over to agents depends on:</p><h3 data-astro-cid-6vq7zla3=\"\">Domain and programming language</h3><p>Front-end versus backend makes a huge difference. Language is a poor medium for designing easing curves and describing aesthetic feelings – I always need to touch the CSS, and it’s often faster to just tweak directly than try to explain what I want. Yegge’s CLI tooling is much easier to validate with pass/fail tests than evaluating whether a notification system “feels calm enough”. Model competence also varies wildly by language; prompting React and Tailwind gives you much better results than Rust or Haskell, where the models still regularly choke on borrow checkers and type systems.</p><h3 data-astro-cid-6vq7zla3=\"\">Access to feedback loops and definitions of success</h3><p>The more agents can validate their own work, the better the results. If you let agents run tests and see the output, they quickly learn what’s broken and how to fix it. If you let them open browsers, take screenshots, and click around, they can spot their mistakes. Tools like the     lean into this – it loops until tests pass or some specific condition is validated. This doesn’t work for less defined, clear cut work though. If you try to make an agent design a visual diagram for you, it’s going to struggle. It doesn’t know your aesthetic preferences and can’t really “see” what it’s making.</p><h3 data-astro-cid-6vq7zla3=\"\">Risk tolerance for shit going wrong</h3><p>Stakes matter. If an agent breaks some images on your personal blog, you’ll recover. But if you’re running a healthcare system where a bug could miscalculate drug dosages, or a banking app moving actual money around, you can’t just wave an agent at it and hope. Consequences scale up fast. Corporate software has people whose entire job is compliance and regulatory sign-off – they need to see the code, understand it, verify it meets requirements. Those people aren’t going to let you wildly run Gas Town over projects without serious guardrails in place.</p><div data-align-left=\"true\" data-astro-cid-572j4yyn=\"\"><p>“Gas Town sounds fun if you are accountable to nobody: not for code quality, design coherence or inferencing costs. The rest of us are accountable for at least the first two and even in corporate scenarios where there is a blank check for tokens, that can’t last. So the bottleneck is going to be how fast humans can review code and agree to take responsibility for it.”</p></div><h3 data-astro-cid-6vq7zla3=\"\">Greenfield vs. brownfield projects</h3><p>Starting fresh (greenfield), means you can let agents make architectural decisions and establish patterns – if you don’t like them, you can easily throw it out and restart. The cost of mistakes is low. But in an existing codebase (brownfield) with years of accumulated conventions, implicit patterns, and code that exists for reasons nobody remembers anymore, agents need much tighter supervision. They’ll happily introduce a new pattern that contradicts the three other ways this codebase already solves the same problem.</p><p>If you’re solo of course you can YOLO. If you’re working with more than a handful of people, you’ll have to agree on coding standards and agent rules. This creates its own overhead: updating the AGENTS.md file, picking MCPs, writing commands and skills and rules and whatever else we invent to constrain these things. The pace of change when you’re all using agents can be overwhelming and you need to figure out a sensible reviewing pipeline to manage it. Team coordination can fall apart when everyone’s agents start moving too fast. You might show up in the morning and discover someone’s agent renamed the database schema while another agent refactored the whole API layer, and neither of which jive with your giant, unmerged feature.</p><p>More senior developers can prompt better, debug better, and setup more stringent preferences earned through decades of seeing what can go wrong in scaled, production environments. They can recognise patterns: “oh, that’s a memory leak” or “that’s going to deadlock under load.” Newer developers don’t have that catalogue of failures yet and are much more likely to prompt their own personal house of cards. The tests might pass and everything looks fine until you hit production traffic or someone enters a weird character. It is hard to defend against unknown unknowns.</p><p>Given all these “it depends” considerations, I’m currently in the code-must-be-close camp for most serious work done by professional developers. But I expect I’ll shift to the code-at-a-distance camp over the next year or two as the harnesses and tools we wrap around these agents mature. If we can ship them with essential safe guards and quality gates, the risks drop. Sure, the models will also improve, but the infrastructure matters far more: validation loops, tests, and specialised subagents who focus on security, debugging, and code quality are what will make code-at-a-distance feasible.</p><p>We have many, continuous versions of the code distance debate internally at    . One of the projects within the team driving this is     – autonomous agents run through GitHub Actions in response to events: new PRs, new issues, or specific times of day. Every commit can trigger a security review agent, an accessibility audit, and a documentation updater, all running in parallel alongside traditional CI/CD tests before anything lands in main. The team building it rarely touches code and do most of their work by directing agents from their phones. It’s these kinds of guardrails that makes a hands-off Sim-City-esque orchestrator system feel less terrifying to me.</p><p>I don’t believe Gas Town itself is “it”. It’s not going to evolve into the thing we all use, day in and day out, in 2027. As I said, it’s a provocative piece of speculative design, not a system many people will use in earnest. In the same way any poorly designed object or system gets abandoned, this manic creation is too poorly thought through to persist. But the problems it’s wrestling with and the patterns it has sketched out will unquestionably show up in the next generation of development tools.</p><p>As the pace of software development speeds up, we’ll feel the pressure intensify in other parts of the pipeline: thoughtful design, critical thinking, user research, planning and coordination within teams, deciding what to build, and whether it’s been built well. The most valuable tools in this new world won’t be the ones that generate the most code fastest. They’ll be the ones that help us think more clearly, plan more carefully, and keep the quality bar high while everything accelerates around us.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Growing up in the 90s and early 2000s, tech was a foundational part of my childhood.</p><p>I built more physical computers than I can remember. We went from paper maps to GPS (which itself evolved from DVDs with static maps to internet-connected real-time navigation). CD players became MP3 players, then streaming services. We had Palm Pilots and early attempts at “smart” phones, which were anything but. Our computers could search for extraterrestrial life through SETI. We emerged from the pager era to portable phones to the entire internet in our pocket (which evolved from charging per SMS or megabyte to unlimited data plans).</p><p>We went through what I still think of as a golden era of console gaming: the N64 &amp; PlayStation, then PS2, Xbox, and GameCube. Meanwhile, our bulky CRT monitors became flat (with a misadventure toward “projection” TVs in between). We could buy gadgets for everything. Best Buy and RadioShack felt like amusement parks we’d visit without intention, ready to be drawn in by something new. A trip to Asia’s electronics stores felt like a genuine step into the future.</p><p>Today, we have everything we did back then, and much more. And yet it somehow feels like we’ve been left with less.</p><p>In the early 2000s, tech began a decades-long consolidation. Almost everything we used before became a function of a single device. Objectively, this was an improvement—old VCR interfaces were awful, early MP3 players were clunky, GPS lacked real-time traffic data, and nothing talked to each other. And yet, through that consolidation, something intangible was taken from us.</p><p>Our devices lost their unique personalities. Phones became our alarm clocks, flashlights, calendars, watches, cameras, GPS units, music players, radios, journals, and gaming devices—all at once. We betrayed our focus in the pursuit of convenience, and the personality of our devices for homogeneity.</p><p>The benefits were clear to us, but the costs weren’t.</p><p>This convergence created winner-take-all (and two-player) markets. Console gaming became PlayStation or Nintendo. Phones became Android or iOS. Computers became Mac or Windows. PC gaming became synonymous with Steam. Everything else became a feature inside one of those platforms, with globally synchronized updates making our experiences increasingly uniform, and bland.</p><p>For a long time, that felt inevitable. But it’s only become clear in retrospect that somewhere in the early 2020s, things started to change.</p><p>New paradigms are emerging for the first time since mobile. VR is no longer experimental. Early AR is starting to reach consumers. Meta shipped a wearable that normal people actually use, thanks to a clever Ray-Ban partnership (and associated equity stake). 3D printers have become real household products. Wearables are diversifying—smart rings, over-the-counter glucose monitors, connected beds.</p><p>Meanwhile, Apple’s aggressive push for services revenue has alienated developers and users alike, creating space for alternatives. And nostalgia has revealed itself as massive, underserved economic demand.</p><p>Gen-Z is buying single-purpose iPods and wired headphones. Pokémon cards are trendy. My friends and I are amassing N64 game collections again. There is a revived appetite for film cameras and Polaroids. Companies are recreating old hardware in modern form—ModRetro’s upcoming FPGA-based M64 plays native N64 cartridges, following their successful Game Boy recreation. They’re now working to bring a “next-gen” CRT monitor to market. The Playdate proved there’s still room for third-party handhelds with their own unique philosophies. Even Nintendo couldn’t resist capitalizing with the re-release of their classic consoles.</p><p>Design matters again. In our devices, and in our lives. Art Deco is in vogue. Cyberpunk has never been more culturally mainstream. Color is back, and bold.</p><p>Canon, Sony, and Nikon may have replaced Kodak for professionals, but Leica is thriving again and Kodak Instamatic has gone viral. People want devices that feel personal—leather finishes, physical controls, intentional constraints. For years this expression was limited to phone cases. Now it’s showing up in hardware itself.</p><p>Tech is starting to resemble the wristwatch market: collaborations, limited editions, exclusivity. A market with many players—emerging companies, niche studios, design-forward brands, and even failing companies—is healthier than one dominated by a few giants.</p><p>Antitrust pressure has slowed consolidation, opened app distribution, killed the anti-competitive iMessage and AirDrop moats, and made big tech cautious about horizontal expansion. And yet market forces may matter even more. Subscriptions keep multiplying. Advertising creeps into everything. Consolidated platforms are becoming bloated, degrading experiences. Platforms extract value in ways that betray their original philosophies.</p><p>Apple’s push toward services has been financially successful but culturally damaging. Users are looking elsewhere. It was imperceptible at first, but that sentiment is spreading.</p><p>Barriers to entry are lower than they’ve been in decades. Software can be deployed in minutes. Hardware is still hard, but 3D printing has revolutionized prototyping and accessible manufacturing services have drastically lowered the cost and time to market. Even the consolidation on the USB-C standard has played a role, allowing switching devices without investing in a new ecosystem.</p><p>We’ve also grown tired of curation by algorithm. What we watch is shaped by recommendation engines. How we perceive it is influenced by aggregate ratings. I miss wandering through video stores, choosing based on nothing more than a cover. Discovery felt accidental and my opinions felt like my own.</p><p>Burnout plays a role too. A Timex ad went viral this year: “Know the time without seeing you have 1,249 unanswered emails.” People are gravitating toward rigid, single-purpose experiences that let them fully disengage.</p><p>Our appetite for alternatives has grown, while they’ve also become easier to create. LLMs and modern tools have lowered the effort required to build things. Side projects are easier to start and finish. Even when large companies offer better experiences on paper, individuals are building alternatives for the joy of it. Some go viral. Consumers end up with more choice.</p><p>Nothing would have been harder to project than the growth of Linux on the desktop. Integrated platforms seemingly made the Linux philosophy untenable, and yet it may now be growing as a direct result of this decoupling. This was a feature, not a bug.</p><p>Looking at my own purchases from 2025, the pattern becomes obvious:</p><ul><li>TRMNL (a no-distraction e-paper display)</li><li>Android Pixel Pro (alongside iPhone)</li><li>ASUS ROG laptop (for CUDA and gaming)</li><li>Govee programmable lights</li><li>Bambu Labs P1S 3D printer</li><li>Kindle (finally retiring my last mini-USB device)</li><li>Abbott Lingo glucose sensor</li><li>iPad (single-purpose: as a second MacBook display while traveling)</li><li>More mechanical watches than I can count (while not tech per se, it does reduce the breadth of the Apple ecosystem)</li></ul><p>This is more than I’ve bought in the last 5 years, and I’m already excited for 2026. While Meta, Apple, Amazon, and Google still appear in my list, their purposes are narrower for me than in the past, and their presence is often no longer part of a two-player market. To be clear, these companies often make great products that should exist, but they should be easy to use as standalone à la carte offerings, not forced omakase experiences.</p><p>We’ll never truly recreate the late 80s or mid-90s. SaaS, subscription pricing, and centralized platforms are here to stay. But this feels like the beginning of another golden era—one defined less by consolidation and more by variety, personality, and choice.</p>",

What started as the company that revolutionized how we deploy applications has been through multiple identity crises, pivoting from one strategy to another in search of sustainable revenue and market relevance.</p><p>Docker’s journey reads like a startup trying to find product-market fit, except Docker already had product-market fit - they created the containerization standard that everyone uses. The problem is that Docker the technology became so successful that Docker the company struggled to monetize it. When your core product becomes commoditized and open source, you need to find new ways to add value.</p><p>Docker Swarm was Docker’s attempt to compete with Kubernetes in the orchestration space. But Kubernetes won that battle decisively, and Docker eventually sold Swarm. This was a clear signal that Docker was stepping back from trying to be the full-stack container platform and instead focusing on what they could uniquely provide.</p><p>For a while, Docker seemed to focus on developer experience. This made sense - developers are Docker’s core users, and improving their workflow could be a differentiator. Docker Scout emerged from the acquisition of Atomist in June 2022, bringing “software supply chain” capabilities. Scout allows Docker to see not just what’s in a container, but how it was built and where vulnerabilities are. This was a smart move toward security and observability, areas where Docker could add real value.</p><p>Docker also acquired AtomicJar, the company behind Testcontainers, adding shift-left testing capabilities. Testcontainers lets developers run real dependencies (databases, message queues, etc.) in containers during testing, making integration tests more reliable and closer to production environments.</p><p>Then came the AI pivot. Docker Model Runner entered the scene, positioning Docker as a platform for running AI models. Docker Compose expanded to support AI agents and models. Docker Offload was introduced for cloud-scale GPU execution of AI tasks. Partnerships with Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and AI SDKs (CrewAI, LangGraph, Vercel AI SDK) followed.</p><p>The acquisition of MCP Defender in September 2025 further cemented Docker’s move into AI security, focusing on securing agentic AI infrastructure and runtime threat detection. This was a significant shift - from developer tools to AI infrastructure.</p><p>Suddenly, Docker moved into the hardened images space. In December 2025, Docker made over 1,000 Docker Hardened Images free and open source under Apache 2.0, reducing vulnerabilities by up to 95% compared to traditional images. This move was likely triggered by Chainguard’s success in the secure container image space. Chainguard had been building a business around minimal, secure container images, and Docker needed to respond.</p><p>Making hardened images free was a bold move - it’s hard to compete with free, especially when it’s open source. But it also raises questions about Docker’s business model. If you’re giving away your security features for free, what are you selling?</p><h2>Leadership Changes and Acquisition Speculation</h2><p>In February 2025, Docker replaced CEO Scott Johnston (who led the company since 2019) with Don Johnson, a former Oracle Cloud Infrastructure founder and executive vice president. This leadership transition has prompted tech analysts to anticipate a potential acquisition by a major cloud provider. The CEO swap, combined with the strategic pivots, suggests Docker may be positioning itself for sale rather than building a standalone business.</p><p>Docker’s strategic shifts tell a story of a company searching for its place in a market it helped create. The containerization technology Docker pioneered became so successful that it became infrastructure - something everyone uses but no one wants to pay for directly.</p><p>The pivots from orchestration (Swarm) to developer tools (Scout, Testcontainers) to AI (Model Runner, MCP Defender) to security (Hardened Images) show a company trying different approaches to find sustainable revenue. Each pivot makes sense in isolation, but together they paint a picture of a company without a clear long-term vision.</p><p>The hardened images move is particularly interesting because it’s defensive - responding to Chainguard’s success rather than leading with innovation. Making it free and open source is a strong competitive move, but it doesn’t solve the fundamental business model question.</p><p>Docker the technology isn’t going anywhere. It’s too embedded in the infrastructure of modern software development. But Docker the company? That’s less clear. The leadership change, acquisition speculation, and rapid strategic pivots suggest Docker Inc may be positioning itself for an exit rather than building a long-term independent business.</p><p>For developers, this doesn’t change much. Docker containers will continue to work, and the open source nature of Docker means the technology will persist regardless of what happens to the company. But it’s worth watching how Docker Inc’s search for identity plays out - it could affect the ecosystem of tools and services built around containers.</p><p>The irony is that Docker created a standard so successful that it became infrastructure, and infrastructure is hard to monetize. Docker Inc’s struggle to find its place is a cautionary tale about the challenges of building a business around open source technology that becomes too successful.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Most PCs tend to boot from a primary media storage, be it a hard disk drive, or a solid-state drive, perhaps from a network, or – if all else fails – the USB stick or the boot DVD comes to the rescue… Fun, eh? Boring! Why don’t we try to boot from a record player for a change?</p><p>: Click <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/IBMPCjr/posts/1592474927753981/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a> to observe the very same vinyl ramdisk <a href=\"https://boginjr.com/electronics/old/ibm4860/\">booted on an IBM PCjr</a>!\nSo this nutty little experiment connects a PC, <a href=\"https://boginjr.com/electronics/old/ibm5150/\">or an IBM PC to be exact</a>, directly onto a record player through an amplifier. I made a small ROM on-chip boot loader that operates the built-in “cassette interface” of the PC (that was hardly ever used), which will now be invoked by the BIOS if all the other boot options fail, i.e. floppy disk and the hard drive. The turntable spins an analog recording of a small bootable read-only RAM drive, which is 64K in size. This contains a FreeDOS kernel, modified by me to cram it into the memory constraint, a micro variant of COMMAND.COM and a patched version of INTERLNK, that allows file transfer through a printer cable, modified to be runnable on FreeDOS. The bootloader reads the disk image from the audio recording through the cassette modem, loads it to memory and boots the system on it. Simple huh?</p><p>And now to get more technical: this is basically a merge between <a href=\"https://boginjr.com/it/sw/dev/bootlpt-86/\">BootLPT/86</a> and <a href=\"https://boginjr.com/it/sw/dev/5150caxx/\">5150CAXX</a>, minus the printer port support. It also resides in a ROM, in the BIOS expansion socket, but it does not have to. The connecting cable between the PC and the record player amplifier is the same as with 5150CAXX, just without the line-in (PC data out) jack.\nThe “cassette interface” itself is just <a href=\"https://www.minuszerodegrees.net/5150/misc/5150_post_test_131.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PC speaker</a> timer channel 2 for the output, and 8255A-5 PPI port C channel 4 (PC4, I/O port 62h bit 4) for the input. BIOS INT 15h routines are used for software (de)modulation.\nThe boot image is the same 64K BOOTDISK.IMG “example” RAM drive that can be downloaded at the bottom of the BootLPT article. This has been turned into an “IBM cassette tape”-protocol compliant audio signal using 5150CAXX, and sent straight to a record cutting lathe.<p>\nVinyls are cut with an RIAA equalization curve that a preamp usually reverses during playback, but not perfectly. So some signal correction had to be applied from the amplifier, as I couldn’t make it work right with the line output straight from the phono preamp. In my case, involving a vintage Harman&amp;Kardon 6300 amplifier with an integrated MM phono preamp, I had to fade the treble all the way down to -10dB/10kHz, increase bass equalization to approx. +6dB/50Hz and reduce the volume level to approximately 0.7 volts peak, so it doesn’t distort. All this, naturally, with any phase and loudness correction turned off.</p>\nOf course, the cassette modem does not give a hoot in hell about where the signal is coming from. Notwithstanding, the recording needs to be pristine and contain no pops or loud crackles (vinyl) or modulation/frequency drop-outs (tape) that will break the data stream from continuing. However, some wow is tolerated, and the speed can be 2 or 3 percent higher or lower too.</p><p>And that’s it! For those interested, the bootloader binary designed for a 2364 chip (2764s can be used, through an adaptor), can be obtained <a href=\"https://boginjr.com/apps/vinyl-boot/BootVinyl.bin\">here</a>. It assumes an IBM 5150 with a monochrome screen and at least 512K of RAM, which kind of reminds me of my setup (what a coincidence). The boot disk image can be obtained at the bottom of the BootLPT/86 article, and <a href=\"https://boginjr.com/misc/bootdisk.flac\">here’s its analog variant</a>, straight from the grooves 🙂</p>",

      "content": "<p>Lev Kokotov</p><p>PgDog is a proxy for scaling PostgreSQL. Under the hood, we use <a href=\"https://github.com/pganalyze/libpg_query/\"></a> to parse and understand SQL queries. Since PgDog is written in Rust, we use its <a href=\"https://github.com/pganalyze/pg_query.rs/\">Rust bindings</a> to interface with the core C library. \nThose bindings use Protobuf (de)serialization to work uniformly across different programming languages, e.g., the popular Ruby  gem.</p><p>Protobuf is fast, but not using Protobuf is faster. We forked  and replaced Protobuf with direct C-to-Rust (and back to C) bindings, using bindgen and Claude-generated wrappers. This resulted in a 5x improvement in parsing queries, and a 10x improvement in deparsing (Postgres AST to SQL string conversion).</p><p>You can reproduce these by cloning <a href=\"https://github.com/pgdogdev/pg_query.rs\">our fork</a> and running the benchmark <a href=\"https://github.com/pgdogdev/pg_query.rs/blob/f5a92bf9ed87ebe60c444f64ccb7a40397a31bcc/tests/raw_parse_tests.rs\">tests</a>:</p><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td> (Protobuf)</td></tr><tr><td> (Direct C to Rust)</td></tr><tr><td> (Protobuf)</td></tr><tr><td> (Direct Rust to C)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The first step is always profiling. We use <a href=\"https://github.com/mstange/samply\">samply</a>, which integrates nicely with the Firefox profiler. Samply is a sampling profiler: it measures how much time code spends running CPU instructions in each function. It works by inspecting the application call stack thousands of times per second. The more time is spent inside a particular function (or span, as they are typically called), the slower that code is. This is how we discovered :</p><p>This is the entrypoint to the  C library, used by all  bindings. The function that wraps the actual Postgres parser, , barely registered on the flame graph. Parsing queries isn’t free, but the Postgres parser itself is very quick and has been optimized for a long time. With the hot spot identified, our first instinct was to do nothing and just add a cache.</p><p>Caching is a trade-off between memory and CPU utilization, and memory is relatively cheap (latest DRAM crunch notwithstanding). The cache is mutex-protected, uses the LRU algorithm and is backed by a hashmap. The query text is the key and the Abstract Syntax Tree is the value, which expects most apps to use prepared statements. The query text contains placeholders instead of actual values and is therefore reusable, for example:</p><div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div></div><p>While the  parameter can change between invocations, the prepared statement does not, so we could cache its static AST in memory.</p><p>This works pretty well, but eventually we ran into a couple of issues:</p><ol><li>Some ORMs can have bugs that generate thousands of unique statements, e.g.,  instead of , which causes a lot of cache misses</li><li>Applications use old PostgreSQL client drivers which don’t support prepared statements, e.g., Python’s  package</li></ol><p>The clock on Protobuf was ticking and we needed to act. So, like a lot of engineers these days, we asked an LLM to just do it for us.</p><p>I’m going to preface this section by saying that the vast majority of PgDog’s source code is written by a human. AI is not in a position to one-shot a connection pooler, load balancer and database sharder. However, when scoped to a very specific, well-defined and most importantly  task, it can work really well.</p><p>The prompt we started with was pretty straightforward:</p><blockquote><p><em>libpg_query is a library that wraps the PostgreSQL parser in an API. pg_query.rs is a Rust wrapper around libpg_query which uses Protobuf for (de)serialization. Replace Protobuf with bindgen-generated Rust structs that map directly to the Postgres AST.</em></p></blockquote><p>And after two days of back and forth between us and the machine, it worked. We ended up with 6,000 lines of recursive Rust that manually mapped C types and structs to Rust structs, and vice versa. We made the switch for <a href=\"https://docs.rs/pg_query/latest/pg_query/fn.parse.html\"></a>, <a href=\"https://docs.rs/pg_query/latest/pg_query/fn.deparse.html\"></a> (used in our new query rewrite engine, which we’ll talk about in another post), <a href=\"https://docs.rs/pg_query/latest/pg_query/fn.fingerprint.html\"></a> and <a href=\"https://docs.rs/pg_query/latest/pg_query/fn.scan.html\"></a>. These four methods are heavily used in PgDog to make sharding work, and we immediately saw a 25% improvement in  benchmarks.</p><p>Just to be clear: we had a lot of things going for us already that made this possible. First,  has a Protobuf spec for  (and Prost, the Protobuf Rust implementation) to generate bindings, so Claude was able to get a comprehensive list of structs it needed to extract from C, along with the expected data types.</p><p>Second,  was already using bindgen, so we had to just copy/paste some invocations around to get the AST structs included in bindgen’s output.</p><p>And last, and definitely not least,  already had a working  and  implementation, so we could test our AI-generated code against its output. This was entirely automated and verifiable: for each test case that used , we included a call to , compared their results and if they differed by even one byte, Claude Code had to go back and try again.</p><p>The translation code between Rust and C uses  Rust functions that wrap Rust structs to C structs. The C structs are then passed to the Postgres/ C API which does the actual work of building the AST.</p><p>The result is converted back to Rust using a recursive algorithm: each node in the AST has its own converter function which accepts an  C pointer and returns a safe Rust struct. Much like the name suggests, the AST is a tree, which is stored in an array:</p><div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div></div><p>For each node in the list, the implementation calls , which then handles each one of the 100s of tokens available in the SQL grammar:</p><div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div></div><p>For nodes that contain other nodes, we recurse on  again until the algorithm reaches the leaves (nodes with no children) and terminates. For nodes that contain scalars, like a number (e.g., ) or text (e.g., ), the data type is copied into a Rust analog, e.g.,  or .</p><p>The end result is <a href=\"https://docs.rs/pg_query/latest/pg_query/protobuf/struct.ParseResult.html\"></a>, a Rust struct generated by Prost from the  API Protobuf specification, but populated by native Rust code instead of Prost’s deserializer. Reusing existing structs reduces the chance of errors considerably: we can compare  and  outputs, using the derived  trait, and ensure that both are identical, in testing.</p><p>While recursive algorithms have a questionable reputation in the industry because bad ones can cause stack overflows, they are very fast. Recursion requires no additional memory allocation because all of its working space, the stack, is created on program startup. It also has excellent CPU cache locality because the instructions for the next invocation of the same function are already in the CPU L1/L2/L3 cache. Finally and arguably more importantly, they are just easier to read and understand than iterative implementations, which helps us, the humans, with debugging.</p><p>Just for good measure, we tried generating an iterative algorithm, but it ended up being slower than Prost. The main cause (we think) was unnecessary memory allocations, hashmap lookups of previously converted nodes, and too much overhead from walking the tree several times. Meanwhile, recursion processes each AST node exactly once and uses the stack pointer to track its position in the tree. If you have any ideas on how to make an iterative algorithm work better, <a href=\"https://discord.gg/CcBZkjSJdd\">let us know</a>!</p><p>Reducing the overhead from using the Postgres parser in PgDog makes a huge difference for us. As a network proxy, our budget for latency, memory utilization, and CPU cycles is low. After all, we aren’t a real database…yet! This change improves performance from two angles: we use less CPU and we do less work, so PgDog is faster and cheaper to run.</p><p>If stuff like this is interesting to you, <a href=\"https://pgdog.dev/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d4bcbd94a4b3b0bbb3fab0b1a2\">reach out</a>.

When that happens, it feels less like learning something new and more like recognition. A kind of “ok, yeah” moment.</p><p data-start=\"636\" data-end=\"775\">I have not seen this effect discussed much. I also think it has improved how .</p><h2 data-start=\"636\" data-end=\"775\">Much of what we know is tacit</h2><p data-start=\"862\" data-end=\"1068\">You know when a design is wrong before you can say why. You <a href=\"https://philipotoole.com/how-i-found-a-bug-in-sqlite/\">sense a bug</a> before you can reproduce it. You recognize a bad abstraction instantly, even if it takes an hour to explain the problem to someone else.</p><p data-start=\"1070\" data-end=\"1275\">This is not a failure. It is how experience operates. The brain compresses experience into patterns that are efficient for action, not for speech. Those patterns are real, but they are not stored in sentences.</p><p data-start=\"1277\" data-end=\"1466\">The problem is that reflection, planning, and teaching all require language. If you cannot express an idea, you cannot easily examine it, you cannot easily share it.</p><h2 data-start=\"1277\" data-end=\"1466\">LLMs are good at the opposite problem</h2><p data-start=\"1468\" data-end=\"1537\">Large language models are built to do exactly this – turn vague structure into words.</p><p data-start=\"1468\" data-end=\"1537\">When I ask a question about something semi-obvious to me, something I believe is true but am not sure why, the model responds with a formulation. It steps through each reason why that something may be true. Each point it makes is orthogonal to the previous one, allowing me to trade, exchange, and re-order the arguments it makes.</p><h2 data-start=\"1877\" data-end=\"2043\">Putting things into words changes the thought</h2><p data-start=\"2045\" data-end=\"2105\">Once the LLM writes down an idea, I can then play with it in my mind.</p><p data-start=\"2107\" data-end=\"2275\">Vague intuitions turn into named distinctions and my implicit assumptions become visible. At that point I can test them, discard them, or refine them.</p><p data-start=\"2277\" data-end=\"2471\">Of course, this is not new. Writing has always done this for me. What is different is the speed. I can explore half-formed thoughts, discard bad descriptions, and try again. That encourages a kind of thinking I might have otherwise skipped.</p><h2 data-start=\"2473\" data-end=\"2559\">The feedback loop matters</h2><p data-start=\"2647\" data-end=\"2828\">Over time I’ve noticed that now I do this without an LLM to hand.&nbsp; Can I “phrase in precise language what and why I am thinking, feeling, believing, right now?”</p><p data-start=\"2647\" data-end=\"2828\">In that sense, the model is not improving my thinking directly. It is improving how I use language, improving the effectiveness of my internal monologue. And since reasoning depends heavily on what one can represent explicitly, that improvement can feel like a real increase in clarity.</p><p data-start=\"3262\" data-end=\"3408\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">The more I do this, the better I get at noticing what I actually think.</p>",

      "content": "<h3>How is AI reshaping the economy?</h3><p>This report introduces new metrics of AI usage to provide a rich portrait of interactions with Claude in November 2025, just prior to the release of Opus 4.5. These “primitives”—simple, foundational measures of how Claude is used, which we generate by asking Claude specific questions about anonymized Claude.ai and first-party (1P) API transcripts—cover five dimensions relevant to AI’s economic impact: user and AI skills, how complex tasks are, the degree of autonomy afforded to Claude, how successful Claude is, and whether Claude is used for personal, educational, or work purposes.</p><p>The results reveal striking geographic variation, real-world estimates of AI task horizons, and a basis for revised assessments of Claude's macroeconomic impact.</p><p>The data we release alongside this report are the most comprehensive to date, covering five new dimensions of AI use, consumer and firm use, and country and region breakdowns for Claude.ai.</p><h3>What has changed since our last report</h3><p>In the first chapter, we revisit findings from our previous <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/research/anthropic-economic-index-september-2025-report\">Economic Index report</a> published in September 2025. We find:</p><ul><li><strong>Claude usage remains concentrated among certain tasks, most of them related to coding </strong>While we see over 3,000 unique work tasks in Claude.ai, the top 10 most common tasks account for 24% of our sampled conversations, a slight increase since our last report. Augmentation patterns (conversations where the user learns, iterates on a task, or gets feedback from Claude) edged to just over half of conversations on Claude.ai. In contrast, automated use remains dominant in 1P API traffic, reflecting its programmatic nature.</li><li><strong>Global usage remains persistently uneven while US states converge</strong>The US, India, Japan, the UK, and South Korea lead in overall Claude.ai use. Worldwide, uneven adoption remains well-explained by GDP per capita. Within the US, workforce composition plays a key role in shaping uneven adoption as states with more computer and mathematical professionals show systematically more Claude usage.</li></ul><p>While substantial concentration remains, since our last report Claude usage has become noticeably more evenly distributed across US states. If sustained, usage per capita would be equalized across the country in 2-5 years.</p><h3>Introducing and analyzing our new economic primitives</h3><p>In the second chapter we discuss the motivation for and introduce our new economic primitives, including how they were selected and operationalized, and their limitations. We additionally present evidence that our primitives capture directionally accurate aspects of underlying usage patterns as compared to external benchmarks. In chapters three and four we use these primitives to further investigate implications for adoption and productivity. We find:</p><ul><li><strong>Claude use diversifies with higher adoption and income</strong>While the most common use of Claude is for work, coursework use is highest in countries with the lowest GDP per capita, while rich countries show the highest rates of personal use. This aligns with a simple adoption curve story: early adopters in less developed countries tend to be technical users with specific, high-value applications or use Claude for education, whereas mature markets see usage diversify toward casual and personal purposes.</li><li><strong>Claude succeeds on most tasks, but less so on the most complex ones</strong>We find that Claude generally succeeds at the tasks it is given, and that the education level of its responses tends to match the user's input. Claude struggles on more complex tasks: As the time it would take a human to do the task increases, Claude’s success rate falls, much like <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14499\">prominent evals measuring the longest tasks that AIs can reliably perform</a>. </li><li><strong>Job exposure to AI looks different when success rates are factored in</strong>We also use the success rate primitive to better understand job exposure to AI, calculating the share of each occupation that Claude can perform by weighting task coverage by both success rates and the importance of each task within the job. For some occupations, like data entry keyers and database architects, Claude shows proficiency in large swaths of the job.</li><li><strong>Claude is used for higher-skill tasks than those in the broader economy</strong>The tasks we observe in Claude usage tend to require more education than those in the broader economy. If we assume that AI-assisted tasks diminish as a share of worker responsibilities, removing them would leave behind less-skilled work. But this simple task displacement would not affect white-collar workers uniformly—for some occupations it removes the most skill-intensive tasks, for others the least.<p>Without the tasks that we observe Claude performing, travel agents would experience deskilling as complex planning work gives way to routine ticket purchasing and payment collection. Property managers, by contrast, would experience upskilling as bookkeeping tasks give way to contract negotiations and stakeholder management.</p></li></ul><h3>A new window for understanding AI’s impact on the economy</h3><p>These results provide a new window into how AI is currently impacting the economy. Knowing the success rate of tasks gives a more accurate picture of which tasks might be automated, how impacted certain jobs might be, and how labor productivity will change. Measuring differential performance by user education sheds light on inequality effects.</p><p>Indeed, the close relationship between education levels in inputs and outputs signals that countries with higher educational attainment may be better positioned to benefit from AI, independent of adoption rates alone.</p><p>This data release aims to enable researchers and the public to better understand the economic implications of AI and investigate the ways in which this transformative technology is already having an effect.</p><h2>Chapter 1: What has changed since our last report</h2><p>Because frontier AI model capabilities are improving rapidly and adoption has been swift, it is important to regularly take stock of changes in how people and businesses are using such systems—and what this usage implies for the broader economy.</p><p>In this chapter we analyze how Claude usage and diffusion patterns changed from August 2025 to November 2025 just prior to the release of Opus 4.5. We make four observations:</p><ol><li><strong>Usage remains highly concentrated across tasks</strong>:The ten most common tasks represent 24% of observed usage on Claude.ai, up from 23% in our last report. For first-party (1P) API enterprise customers, concentration among tasks increased more notably: the top ten tasks now represent 32% of traffic, up from 28% in the last report.</li><li><strong>Augmentation is once again more common than automation on Claude.ai:</strong>In our previous report we noted that automated use had risen to exceed augmented use on Claude.ai, perhaps capturing both improving capabilities and greater familiarity among users with LLMs. Data from November 2025 points to a broad-based shift back toward augmented use on Claude.ai: The share of conversations classified as augmented jumped 5pp to 52% and the share deemed automated fell 4pp to 45%. Product changes during this period—including <a href=\"https://claude.com/blog/create-files\">file creation capabilities</a>, <a href=\"https://claude.com/blog/memory\">persistent memory</a>, and <a href=\"https://claude.com/blog/skills\">Skills for workflow customization</a>—may have shifted usage patterns toward more collaborative, human-in-the-loop interactions.</li><li><strong>Within the US, lower usage states have relatively faster gains in adoption</strong>Within the US, usage per capita remains largely shaped by how well-matched the workforce is to broader Claude usage: For example, states with a larger share of workers in computer and mathematical occupations tend to have higher usage. Indeed, the top five US states account for nearly half (50%) of all usage despite representing only 38% of the working-age population. <p>Nevertheless, there are early signs of rapid regional convergence in adoption: usage has increased relatively faster for states that had lower usage in our last report. If sustained, usage per capita would be equalized across the country in 2-5 years, a pace of diffusion roughly 10x faster than the spread of previous economically consequential technologies in the 20th century.</p><p>While this is consistent with rapid AI adoption and diffusion, this estimate comes with uncertainty given that it is based on a change observed over a three month period. Diffusion may ultimately proceed more slowly in the months and years to come.</p></li><li><strong>Global usage shows little sign of increasing or decreasing regional convergence</strong>Globally, Claude usage per capita—as captured by the Anthropic AI Usage Index (AUI)—remains highly uneven and strongly correlated with GDP. These gaps are stable: we see no evidence that low-use countries are catching up or that high-use countries are pulling away.</li></ol><h3>Shifting patterns of usage across tasks and associated occupations</h3><p>Even though frontier LLMs have an impressive range of capabilities relevant to every facet of the modern economy, Claude usage remains very concentrated among a small number of tasks. As compared to nearly one year ago, consumer usage on <a href=\"http://claude.ai/redirect/website.v1.52cf9e7f-1dca-4936-86b8-d24a8a6f2cd7\">Claude.ai</a> is modestly more concentrated: The share of conversations assigned to the ten most prevalent O*NET tasks was 24% in November 2025, 1pp higher than in August and up from 21% in January 2025. The most prevalent task in November 2025—modifying software to correct errors—alone represented 6% of usage.</p><p>In our last Anthropic Economic Index Report we began tracking business adoption patterns by studying Claude usage among 1P API customers. The ten most common tasks grew from 28% of API records in August to 32% in November. Rising concentration among a small set of tasks suggests the highest-value applications continue to generate outsized economic value even as models have become more capable at a wider range of tasks. As with <a href=\"http://claude.ai/redirect/website.v1.52cf9e7f-1dca-4936-86b8-d24a8a6f2cd7\">Claude.ai</a> the most common task among API customers was modifying software to correct errors, which accounted for one in ten records.</p><p>Indeed, computer and mathematical tasks—like modifying software to correct errors—continue to dominate Claude usage overall, representing a third of conversations on Claude.ai and nearly half of 1P API traffic. Such dominance has subsided on Claude.ai: the share of conversations on Claude.ai assigned to such (mostly) coding-related tasks is down from a peak of 40% in March 2025 to 34% in November 2025. At the same time, the share of transcripts assigned to computer and mathematical tasks among 1P API traffic edged higher from 44% in August to 46% in November 2025 (Figure 1.2).</p><p>The second largest share of Claude.ai usage in November 2025 was in the Educational Instruction and Library category. This corresponds mostly to help with coursework and review, and the development of instructional materials. Such usage has risen steadily since our first report, up from 9% of conversations on Claude.ai in January 2025 to 15% in November.</p><p>The share of usage on Claude.ai for Arts, Design, Entertainment, Sports, and Media tasks increased between August and November 2025 as Claude was used in a growing share of conversations for writing tasks, primarily copyediting and the writing and refinement of fictional pieces. This jump in the prevalence of design- and writing-related tasks reversed a steady decline across earlier reports. For both Claude.ai and API customers, there was a drop in the share of conversations/transcripts where Claude was used for Life, Physical, and Social Science-related tasks.</p><p>Perhaps the most notable development for API customers was the increase in the share of transcripts associated with Office and Administrative Support related tasks, which rose 3pp in August to 13% in November 2025. Because API use is automation-dominant, this suggests that businesses are increasingly using Claude to automate routine back-office workflows such as email management, document processing, customer relationship management, and scheduling.</p><h3>Augmentation is again dominant on Claude.ai</h3><p>How AI will affect the economy depends not just on the tasks Claude is used for but the way that users access and engage underlying model capabilities. Since our first report, we have classified conversations into one of five interaction types, which we group into two broader categories: automation and augmentation.</p><p>Figure 1.3 plots how automated versus augmented use has evolved over time since we first started collecting this data one year ago. In January 2025, augmented use of Claude was dominant: 56% of conversations were classified as augmentation compared to 41% automated. In August 2025, more conversations were classified as automated as compared to augmented.</p><p>This was a notable development since it suggested that rapid improvements in model capabilities and platform functionality coincided with users increasingly delegating tasks entirely to Claude. This was evident in the “directive” collaboration mode, which is further grouped as automation. Directive conversations are those in which users give Claude a task and it completes it with minimal back-and-forth. From January 2025 to August 2025 the share of such directive conversations rose from 27% to 39%.</p><p>Three months later, the share of directive conversations had fallen 7pp to 32% in November 2025 as augmentation once again became more prevalent on Claude.ai than automation. Nevertheless, the automation share was still elevated as compared to nearly one year ago when we first began tracking this measure, suggesting that the underlying trend is still toward greater automation even as the August spike overstated how quickly it was materializing.</p><p>While we see some evidence of a shift toward soft skill usage on Claude.ai with design, management, and education now higher, the shift back toward augmented use was broad-based in November (Figure 1.4). The rise in augmented use was driven mainly by users iterating with Claude to complete tasks (“task iteration”) rather than asking Claude to explain concepts (“learning”). See Figure 1.5 for common words associated with the three most common interaction modes across O*NET tasks and bottom-up descriptions of requests made of Claude.</p><h3>Persistent regional concentration</h3><p>In our previous report, we introduced the Anthropic AI Usage Index (AUI), a measure of whether Claude is over- or underrepresented in a given geography relative to the size of its working-age population. The AUI is defined as</p><p>An AUI above 1 indicates that a country uses Claude more intensively than its population alone would predict, while an AUI below 1 indicates lower-than-expected usage. For example, Denmark has an AUI of 2.1, meaning its residents use Claude at roughly twice the rate its share of the global working-age population would suggest.</p><p>A key fact about Claude usage globally is that it is geographically concentrated: a small number of countries comprise an outsized share of use. From a global perspective, little changed in this respect between August and November 2025. Indeed, the left panel of Figure 1.6 shows that the AUI concentration across countries was essentially unchanged between our last report and this report.</p><p>By contrast, usage became more evenly distributed across US states from August to November 2025: the Gini coefficient, a standard measure of equality, fell from 0.37 to 0.32. While it is important to exercise caution in interpreting short-run changes, this is a relatively large change toward perfect equality in which the AUI is equal to 1 for all states with a Gini coefficient of 0. If the Gini coefficient for the US again falls by 0.05 every three months, then parity of usage would be reached in roughly two years.</p><p>What shapes patterns of usage within the US and around the world? In our previous report we emphasized the key role played by income differences globally: Variation in Claude usage across countries is largely accounted for by variation in GDP per capita. In Chapter 3 we revisit the importance of income in shaping not just usage intensity but also patterns of usage around the world.</p><p>Within the US, income is less clearly a predictor of usage. Instead, what appears to matter most is the composition of each state’s workforce and how well-matched the workforce is to Claude capabilities as reflected in task-level usage. States that have a higher share of workers in computer and mathematical occupations—like Washington D.C., Virginia, and Washington—tend to have higher usage per capita. Quantitatively, each 1% increase in the share of such tech workers in a state is associated with 0.36% higher usage per capita (Figure 1.7). This alone accounts for nearly two-thirds of the cross-state variation in AUI.</p><p>While we would intuitively expect Claude usage to be higher in states with more tech workers, this pattern holds more generally: Usage per capita is higher in states with more workers in occupations where Claude usage is overrepresented as compared to the US workforce (e.g., Arts, Design, Entertainment, Sports and Media) or with relatively fewer workers in occupations where Claude usage is low as compared to the national economy (e.g., Transportation and Material Moving). This can be seen by calculating the Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence between the composition of each state’s workforce and the global composition of Claude usage. States with a lower KL divergence—and thus with a workforce that looks more similar to Claude usage patterns—tend to have higher usage per capita.</p><h3>Signs of faster Claude diffusion in the US among low usage states</h3><p>While differences in workforce composition appear to play a role in shaping regional adoption within the US, early evidence suggests Claude is diffusing considerably faster than historical precedent would predict. Economically consequential technologies have historically taken around half a century to achieve full diffusion across the US (<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/140/2/1299/7959830\">Kalanyi et al., 2025</a>). By contrast, comparing Claude adoption rates in November 2025 to three months prior, we estimate that parity in adoption per capita across US states—as measured by the AUI—could be reached within 2–5 years. This estimate comes with a high degree of uncertainty as the precision of our estimates cannot rule out much slower rates of diffusion.</p><p>We generate this estimate through the lens of a simple model of diffusion, which we briefly describe here. We model diffusion as proportional convergence toward a common steady state of equalized usage per capita in which each state s has an AUI equal to 1:</p><p>Under this model, the log deviation of AUI from steady state (AUI = 1) shrinks by a factor of β every three months, implying a half-life of β quarters. For example, with quarterly data a value of β = 0.99 implies a half-life of about 17 years. To illustrate, starting from an initial AUI of 2, this means AUI would decline to around 1.4 after 17 years and to around 1.1 after 50 years. We take β = 0.99 as a sensible benchmark because it implies a pace of diffusion similar to economically consequential technologies in the 20th century.</p><p>This model of convergence motivates the following regression specification:</p><p>Naively estimating this equation by ordinary least squares (OLS) yields an estimate of β̂  ≈ 0.77. Weighted least squares (WLS) where we weight by each state’s workforce yields an estimate of β̂  ≈ 0.76 (Figure 1.8). Both are statistically distinguishable from 1 at conventional levels. Taken at face value, these estimates imply that it would take little more than two years for each state's AUI to close most of the gap to 1.</p><p>A concern with estimating convergence this way is that our AUI estimates are subject to sampling noise and other variation unrelated to diffusion. This can produce classical attenuation bias: even if AUI is not actually changing, our estimate of β could end up meaningfully below one.</p><p>To address this, we estimate the model by two-stage least squares (2SLS), instrumenting the log of AUI in August 2025 with the composition of each state's workforce, measured by its proximity to overall Claude usage patterns. The logic behind this instrument is that workforce composition is a strong predictor of Claude usage (relevance) but being measured independently, is expected to be uncorrelated with sampling noise in our AUI estimates (validity). As noted above, states with more workers in high-Claude-usage roles do tend to have systematically higher usage per capita.</p><p>The 2SLS estimates imply modestly slower convergence: β̂  ≈ 0.89 unweighted and β̂  ≈ 0.86 when weighting by each state’s working-age population. However, these estimates are less precise, and only the former is statistically distinguishable from 1 at the 10% level. Despite implying a slower convergence than OLS, the 2SLS estimates still imply rapid diffusion: just four to five years for the log deviation of each state's AUI to shrink by 90%.</p><p>That said, our estimates are based on just three months of data. And while the 2SLS specification may help address sampling noise, considerable uncertainty remains. We will revisit this question of the pace of diffusion in future reports.</p><p>As with previous reports, all our analysis is based on privacy-preserving analysis. Throughout the report we analyze a random sample of 1M conversations from Claude.ai Free, Pro and Max conversations (we also refer to this as “consumer data” since it mostly represents consumer use) and 1M transcripts from our first-party (1P) API traffic (we also refer to this as “enterprise data” since it mostly represents enterprise use). Both samples come from November 13, 2025 to November 20, 2025. We continue to manage data according to our privacy and retention policies, and our analysis is consistent with our terms, policies, and contractual agreements. For 1P API data, each record is a prompt-response pair from our sample period which in some instances is mid-session for multi-turn interactions.</p><p> The share of conversations on Claude.ai that were classified into neither automation nor augmentation categories fell from 3.9% to 3.0%.</p><p> See, for example, <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/140/2/1299/7959830\">Kalanyi et al (2025)</a>: “Second, as the technologies mature and the number of related jobs grows, hiring spreads geographically. This process is very slow, taking around 50 years to disperse fully.”</p><p>With our bottom-up analysis of 1P API traffic we see Claude used to \"Generate personalized B2B cold sales emails\" (0.47%), \"Analyze emails and draft replies for business correspondence\" (0.28%), \"Build and maintain invoice processing systems\" (0.24%), \"Classify and categorize emails into predefined labels\" (0.23%), and \"Manage calendar scheduling, meeting coordination, and appointment booking\" (0.16%).</p><p> At a high level, we distinguish between automation and augmentation modes of using Claude. Automation encompasses interaction patterns focused on task completion: Directive: Users give Claude a task and it completes it with minimal back-and-forth; Feedback Loops: Users automate tasks and provide feedback to Claude as needed; Augmentation focuses on collaborative interaction patterns: Learning: Users ask Claude for information or explanations about various topics; Task Iteration: Users iterate on tasks collaboratively with Claude; Validation: Users ask Claude for feedback on their work</p><p> These interaction modes are not mutually exhaustive. In some instances, Claude determines that a sampled conversation does not match any of the five interaction modes.</p><p> In this report we use Sonnet 4.5 for classification whereas in our previous Economic Index report we used Sonnet 4. We previously found that different models can generate different classification outcomes, though these effects tend to be modest.</p><p>We include a constant term in the regression since it should be equal to zero under the null hypothesis. Across all our specifications, the constant term is estimated to be close to and statistically indistinguishable from zero.</p><h2>Chapter 2: Introducing economic primitives</h2><p>The strength of the Anthropic Economic Index lies in showing not only how much AI is used, but  it is used. In prior reports, we showed which tasks Claude is used for, and how people collaborate with Claude. These data have enabled external researchers to analyze labor market shifts (e.g., <a href=\"https://digitaleconomy.stanford.edu/publications/canaries-in-the-coal-mine/\">Brynjolfsson, Chandar &amp; Chen, 2025</a>).</p><p>In this edition of the Anthropic Economic Index, we expand the breadth of data available to external researchers by providing insights on five economic “primitives”, by which we mean simple, foundational measures of the ways that Claude is used, which we generate by asking Claude to answer specific questions about the anonymized transcripts in our sample. Some of our primitives encompass several such questions, and others use a single indicator.</p><p>Because AI capabilities are advancing so rapidly and the economic effects will be unevenly experienced, we need a breadth of signals to uncover not just how Claude is used but also to inform what impact this technology will have.</p><h3>Dimensions of AI use that matter for economic impacts</h3><p>This report introduces five new economic primitives beyond the one we already measure, collaboration patterns (whether users automate or augment their tasks with Claude). These primitives capture five dimensions of a human-AI conversation: 1) task complexity, 2) human and AI skills, 3) work, coursework or personal use case, 4) the AI’s level of autonomy, and 5) task success (see Table 2.1). AI autonomy captures something different from our existing automation/augmentation distinction. For example, “Translate this paragraph into French” is high automation (directive, minimal back-and-forth) but low AI autonomy (the task requires little decision-making from Claude).</p><p> captures that tasks can vary in their complexity, including how long they take to complete and how difficult they are. A \"debugging\" task in O*NET could refer to Claude fixing a small error in a function or comprehensively refactoring a codebase—with very different implications for labor demand. We measure complexity through estimated human time to complete tasks without AI, time spent completing tasks with AI, and whether users handle multiple tasks within a single conversation.</p><p> address how automation interacts with skill levels. If AI disproportionately substitutes for tasks requiring less expertise while complementing higher-skilled work, it could be another form of skill-biased technical change—increasing demand for highly skilled workers while displacing lower skilled workers. We measure whether users could have completed tasks without Claude, and the years of education needed to understand both user prompts and Claude's responses.</p><p> distinguishes professional, educational, and personal use. Labor market effects most directly follow from workplace use, while educational use may signal where the future workforce is building AI-complementary skills.</p><p> measures the degree to which users delegate decision-making to Claude. Our latest report documented rising \"directive\" use where users delegate tasks entirely. Tracking autonomy levels—from active collaboration to full delegation—helps forecast the pace of automation.</p><p> measures Claude’s assessment of whether Claude completes tasks successfully. Task success helps assess whether tasks can be automated effectively (can a task be automated at all?) and efficiently (how many attempts would it take to automate a task?). That is, task success matters for both the feasibility and the cost of automation labor tasks.</p><h3>Selecting and validating the new measures</h3><p>The new dimensions of AI use captured in our data were informed by our recent work on the <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/research/estimating-productivity-gains\">productivity effects of Claude</a>, feedback we received from external researchers, recent literature on AI’s economic impact through the lens of human capital and expertise (<a href=\"https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/26-011_04dcb593-c32b-4e4e-80fc-b51030cf8a12.pdf\">Vendraminell et al., 2025</a>), and deliberation within our economic research team. Our main selection criteria were expected economic relevance, complementarity of dimensions, and whether Claude could classify conversations along that dimension with directional accuracy.</p><p>We propose that multiple simple primitives, even if somewhat noisy and not perfectly accurate by themselves, can together provide important signals on how AI is being used. We therefore mainly tested for directional accuracy.</p><p>For classifying task duration with and without AI, we used minimally modified versions of our <a href=\"https://www-cdn.anthropic.com/e5645986a7ce8fbcc48fa6d2fc67753c87642c30.pdf\">prior productivity work</a>. For net new classifiers, implemented via our <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13678\">privacy-preserving tooling</a>, our validation process was as follows. We designed multiple potential measures to capture concepts such as task complexity. For Claude.ai, we evaluated the classifier performance compared to a human researcher on a small set of transcripts in which users gave feedback to Claude.ai and for which we thus have permission to look at underlying transcripts. For first-party API (1P API) data, we validate the classifiers using a mix of internal and synthetic data. Neither data sources are fully representative of Claude.ai or 1P API traffic, but they allow us to check that the classifiers are working on data that resembles real usage data, while ensuring privacy.</p><p>Based on initial performance, we revised the classifiers that needed tweaking or discarded classifiers that did not perform well. Interestingly, we find that in some instances (e.g., to measure task success), a simple classifier performed better than a nuanced, complex classifier when compared to human ratings. We then compared performance of classifier versions with vs. without chain of thought prompting, and decided to keep chain of thought prompting only for three facets (human time estimate, human with AI time estimate, and AI autonomy) where we found that it substantially improved performance. We selected a final set of nine new classifiers for the five primitives, all of which are directionally accurate even if they may deviate somewhat from human ratings.</p><h3>The primitives' value is in what they can predict</h3><p>Our goal was to create classifiers that are straightforward to implement and in combination provide potentially important economic signals. While we are very confident in the directional accuracy of the new measures (e.g., tasks with higher average years of education needed to understand the human prompt are likely more complex), none of the measures should be taken as exact or definitive (e.g., Claude.ai may somewhat underestimate the human education years needed for many tasks).</p><p>Even so, the primitives enrich our understanding of how people use AI. Systematic relationships emerge across primitives, regions, and tasks—patterns we explore in depth in Chapters 3 and 4. That these relationships are intuitive and consistent suggests the primitives capture relevant aspects of how people and businesses use Claude.</p><p>External benchmarks reinforce this. In our <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/research/estimating-productivity-gains\">productivity work</a>, Claude’s time estimates correlate with actual time spent on software engineering tasks. Figure 2.1 shows that our human education measure correlates with actual worker education levels across occupations. These validations suggest individual primitives are directionally correct—and combining them may provide additional analytical value, such as enriching productivity estimates with task success rates or constructing new measures of occupational exposure.</p><p>Ultimately, the strongest validation will come from the primitives’ ability to capture meaningful variation in labor market outcomes. The data we release enable external researchers to analyze economic shifts in new ways. Early work has been encouraging—the automation/augmentation distinction from prior reports has already been used by external researchers to analyze labor market shifts (<a href=\"https://digitaleconomy.stanford.edu/publications/canaries-in-the-coal-mine/\">Brynjolfsson, Chandar &amp; Chen, 2025</a>).</p><h3>Primitives highlight how use cases differ</h3><p>To illustrate how the primitives distinguish between different types of AI use, we examine two contrasting request clusters: software development (\"Help debug, develop, and optimize software across multiple programming domains\") and personal life management (\"Assist with personal life management and everyday tasks\"). Figure 2.2 shows the primitive profile for each cluster alongside global averages.</p><p> Claude estimates that software development requests would take a competent professional approximately 3.3 hours to complete without AI—close to the global average of 3.1 hours. Personal life management tasks are estimated to be simpler, averaging 1.8 hours. Estimated human-AI collaboration time is similar across both (~15 minutes), showing this primitive varies less than other primitives for these two tasks.</p><p> Software development requests draw on more specialized knowledge: both human prompts and AI responses are estimated to require approximately 13.8 years of education to understand, compared to 9.1–9.4 years for personal life management requests. Claude estimates that users would be able to complete personal life management requests by themselves 96% of the time, versus 82% for software development requests—indicating that Claude provides more essential support for technical work.</p><p> Claude classifies 64% of software development requests as work-related, compared to just 17% for personal life management. This illustrates that Claude can be used for very different purposes. Overall, Claude.ai use is 46% work, 19% coursework, and 35% personal.</p><p> Both clusters show similar estimated autonomy levels (~3.5 on a 1 to 5 scale), near the global average. This means that both software development and personal life management tasks, on average, afford Claude a similar autonomy to make decisions on how to complete the task.</p><p> Claude assesses personal tasks as successfully completed 78% of the time, versus 61% for software development. Harder tasks—those requiring more specialized knowledge and where users could not easily complete them alone—show lower estimated success rates.</p><h3>Tasks and primitives differ between Claude.ai and API users</h3><p>As in our previous report, we find major differences in the tasks and primitives in Claude.ai conversations compared to the 1P API data. Part of this reflects the nature of the interaction: Claude.ai transcripts can include multi-turn conversations, while the API data we analyze is limited to single input-output pairs. This is because API requests arrive independently, with no metadata linking them to prior exchanges. This means we can only analyze them as isolated user-assistant pairs rather than full conversation trajectories.</p><p>Overall, API usage is overwhelmingly work-related (74% vs. 46%) and directive (64% vs. 32%), with three-quarters of interactions classified as automation compared to less than half on Claude.ai (see Figure 1.3).</p><p>Claude.ai users, by contrast, engage in more back-and-forth: task iteration and learning modes are far more common, and tasks tend to be more lengthy—both in terms of human time with AI (15 minutes vs. 5 minutes) and the estimated time a human would need to complete the task alone (3.1 hours vs. 1.7 hours). Claude.ai also shows higher task success rates (67% vs. 49%), which may reflect the benefits of multi-turn conversation, where users can clarify, correct course, and iterate toward a solution. Claude.ai users also give the AI more autonomy on average, and are more likely to bring tasks they couldn't complete alone.</p><p>These differences are also reflected in the occupational distribution of tasks. API usage is heavily concentrated in Computer &amp; Mathematical tasks (52% vs. 36%), consistent with its use for programmatic, automation-friendly workflows like code generation and data processing. Office &amp; Administrative tasks are also more prevalent in the API (15% vs. 8%), reflecting routine business operations suited to delegation. Claude.ai, by contrast, sees substantially more Educational Instruction tasks (16% vs. 4%)—coursework help, tutoring, and instructional material development—as well as more Arts, Design, and Entertainment tasks (11% vs. 6%). Claude.ai also has a longer tail of human-facing categories like Community &amp; Social Service and Healthcare Practitioners, where users seek advice, counseling, or information on personal matters.</p><p>These patterns suggest that 1P API deployments concentrate on tasks amenable to systematic automation, while Claude.ai serves a broader range of use cases including learning, creative work, and personal assistance.</p><p>Chapter 4 explores task-level variation in greater depth.</p><p> A classifier is a model that assigns a given input (e.g. a user conversation) a specific output (e.g. the use case “work”). In this report, we use Claude as a classifier, meaning that we prompt Claude to select a specific output and then use Claude’s response as the output (see Table 2.1 for the prompts).</p><p>Throughout this report, we use binned scatterplots to show bivariate relationships. We divide observations into 20 equally-sized bins based on the x variable, then plot the average x and y values for each bin. The leftmost dot, for example, represents the averages for observations in the lowest 5% of the x distribution.</p><h2>Chapter 3: How Claude is used varies by geography</h2><p>In this chapter, we analyze geographic variation in Claude usage patterns using a privacy-preserving¹ analysis of 1 million Claude.ai conversations². We make five observations:</p><ul><li><strong>Claude is mostly used for work, but use cases diversify with adoption:</strong> Work and personal use cases are more common in higher-income countries, while coursework use cases are more common in lower-income countries. This echoes findings from our prior report and aligns with <a href=\"http://microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/New-Future-Of-Work-Report-2025.pdf\">recent work by Microsoft</a>.</li><li><strong>GDP and human education predict adoption globally and within the US:</strong> A 1% increase in GDP per capita is associated with a 0.7% increase in Claude usage per capita at the country level. Human education—Claude's estimate of years of formal education needed to understand the human prompt—correlates positively with the Anthropic AI Usage Index at both levels.</li><li><strong>Other primitives predict adoption differently at global vs. US levels:</strong> At the country level, higher usage correlates with shorter tasks and less AI autonomy. At the US state level, these relationships are not statistically significant, though work use correlates positively with adoption.</li><li><strong>Relationships between primitives depend on context:</strong> Task success is negatively associated with human education across countries, but positively within US states. However, when controlling for other primitives, the US relationship becomes insignificant.</li><li><strong>How humans prompt is how Claude responds:</strong> The education levels of human prompts and AI responses are nearly perfectly correlated (r &gt; 0.92 at both levels). Higher per capita usage countries also show more augmentation—using Claude as a collaborator rather than delegating decisions entirely.</li></ul><h3>Claude is mostly used for work, but use cases diversify with adoption</h3><p>Our data, relying on a <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/research/clio\">privacy-preserving</a> analysis of 1 million Claude.ai conversations, reveals striking geographic differences in how Claude is adopted. Claude is predominantly used for work, across the globe and across the United States. However, there is geographic variation in use cases. At the global level, the Balkans and Brazil have the highest relative share of work use (see Figure 3.1), and Indonesia stands out with the highest share of coursework. At the US state level, New York stands out as the state using Claude relatively the most for work.</p><p>Use case differences are related to a country’s per capita income, which, in turn, is related to per capita AI adoption. We observe that work use cases and personal use cases of Claude are more common in higher income countries, while coursework use cases are more common in lower income countries (see Figure 3.2). Interestingly, these findings converge with <a href=\"http://microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/New-Future-Of-Work-Report-2025.pdf\">recent work by Microsoft</a> showing that AI use for school is associated with lower per capita income, whereas AI use for leisure is associated with higher per capita income.</p><p>Multiple factors could contribute to these patterns:</p><ul><li>Personal use cases may be more common as AI adoption increases and more diverse users use AI, or existing users explore wider applications of AI. In contrast, countries with lower per capita adoption (which is correlated with lower per capita income) may be focused on specific use cases such as coding or as coursework.</li><li>Countries differ in their ability to pay for Claude, and coursework use cases may be better suited to free Claude usage than complex use cases in work areas such as software engineering.</li><li>Users in higher-income countries may have other resources, such as free time and continuous Internet access, that enable non-essential personal use cases.</li></ul><h3>International and US adoption differ across economic primitives</h3><p>The economic primitives introduced in this report allow us to analyze some of the factors that may drive differential adoption. When analyzing the relationship between the Anthropic AI Usage Index (AUI) and core economic primitives as well as GDP, we observe that certain patterns hold for both countries and US states. For example, we replicate the finding from our prior report that GDP is strongly correlated with the AUI (see Figures 3.3 and 3.4). At the country level, a 1% increase in GDP per capita is associated with a 0.7% increase in Claude usage per capita. Human education (how many years of education it takes to understand the human written prompts in a conversation) correlates positively and significantly with the Anthropic AI Usage Index both at the country and at the US state level.</p><p>However, the relationship between AUI and the primitives often differs between country and US state level. For example, at the country level, the AUI correlates negatively with the time it would take a human to complete a task without AI, and with how much decision-making autonomy AI is given. At the US state level, these relationships are not statistically significant–likely also due to the smaller sample size for US states. Additionally, we observe a positive correlation between the AUI and Claude.ai use for work at the US state, but not at the country level.</p><p>Importantly, the primitives themselves are not necessarily causal factors—we don't know if income or education are truly driving adoption, or if they're proxies for other underlying conditions. Many of these factors are highly correlated with one another. For example, at the US state level, human education years show a strong association with the Anthropic AI Usage Index in isolation, but this relationship disappears once we control for GDP and other primitives—suggesting education may be capturing variation that's better explained by economic development and other factors.</p><h3>Institutional factors shape the relationship between task success and education years</h3><p>Economic and institutional context—such as how education levels vary within a geography—are related to how AI is being used. Interestingly, we observe that task success is negatively associated with human education at the country level, but positively related at the US state level. However, the positive relationship at the state level becomes insignificant when controlling for other primitives (see Figure 3.5). This means the relationship pattern at one level of observation (country) contradicts the relationship pattern at another level (US state). Cross-country, educated populations may attempt harder tasks and therefore see lower success rates. Within homogeneous contexts, education may not improve task success.</p><h3>How humans prompt is how Claude responds</h3><p>We find a very high correlation between human and AI education, i.e. the number of years of education required to understand a human prompt or the AI’s response (countries:  = 0.925, &nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.001,  = 117; US states:  = 0.928, &nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.001,  = 50). This highlights the importance of skills and suggests that how humans prompt the AI determines how effective it can be. This also highlights the importance of model design and training. While Claude is able to respond in a highly sophisticated manner, it tends to do so only when users input sophisticated prompts.</p><p>How models are trained, fine-tuned and instructed affects how they respond to users. For example, one AI model could have a system prompt that instructs it to always use simple language that a middle school student could understand, whereas another AI model may only respond in complex language that would require a PhD education to understand. For Claude, we observe a more dynamic pattern where how the user prompts Claude relates to how Claude responds.</p><h3>Higher income and higher usage are related to more augmentation</h3><p>Higher per capita usage countries, which tend to be higher per capita income countries, show lower automation, and less decision-making autonomy delegated to Claude. That is, higher income countries use AI more as an assistant and collaborator rather than letting it work independently. This relationship is not significant at the US state level, perhaps because income variation and use case diversity are more limited within the United States than globally. This mirrors a finding from our 3rd Economic Index report where countries with higher Anthropic AI Usage Index tend to use Claude in a more collaborative manner (augmentation), rather than letting it operate independently (automation).</p><p>The striking geographic variation in our data shows that Claude is used in different ways around the world. GDP predicts the Anthropic AI Usage Index at both the country and US state level, and human education—the sophistication of user prompts—correlates with adoption at both levels as well.</p><p>Other relationships depend on context. At the country level, higher usage correlates with shorter tasks and less AI autonomy; within the US, these patterns do not hold. Task success and human education show opposite relationships globally versus within the US.</p><p>The near-perfect correlation between human and AI education years underscores that how users prompt Claude shapes how it responds. Combined with the finding that higher-usage countries engage Claude more collaboratively, this suggests that the skills required to use AI well may themselves be unevenly distributed.</p><p>By measuring the characteristics of conversations with Claude, we find important relationships with broader economic factors such as human capital. These relationships may help predict labor market outcomes and inform a smooth transition to an AI-enabled economy that will require different skillsets.</p><p>For privacy reasons, our automated analysis system filters out any cells—e.g., countries, and (country, task) intersections—with fewer than 15 conversations and 5 unique user accounts. For bottom-up request clusters, we have an even higher privacy filter of at least 500 conversations and 250 unique accounts.</p><p>Data in this section covers 1 million Claude.ai Free, Pro and Max conversations from November 13 to 20, 2025, randomly sampled from all conversations in that period. We then excluded content that was flagged as potential trust and safety violations. The unit of observation is a conversation with Claude on Claude.ai, not a user, so it is possible that multiple conversations from the same user are included, though our <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2412.13678\">past work</a> suggests that sampling conversations at random versus stratified by user does not yield substantively different results. Aggregate geographic statistics at the country and US state level were assessed and tabulated from the IP address of each conversation. For geolocation, we use ISO-3166 codes since our provider for IP geolocation uses this standard. International locations use ISO-3166-1 country codes, US state level data use ISO-3166-2 region codes, which include all 50 US states and Washington DC. We exclude conversations originating from VPN, anycast, or hosting services, as determined by our IP geolocation provider.</p><p>The world map is based on Natural Earth’s world map with the ISO standard point of view for disputed territories, which means that the map may not contain some disputed territories. We note that in addition to the countries shown in gray (“Claude not available”), we do not operate in the Ukrainian regions Crimea, Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk, and Zaporizhzhia. In accordance with international sanctions and our commitment to supporting Ukraine’s territorial integrity, our services are not available in areas under Russian occupation.</p><p>“No data” applies to countries with partially missing data. Some territories (e.g., Western Sahara, French Guiana) have their own ISO-3611 code. Some of these have some usage, others have none. Since the Anthropic AI Usage Index is calculated per working-age capita based on working age population data from the World Bank, and population data is not readily available for all of these territories, we cannot calculate the AUI for these territories.</p><p>We exclude the Seychelles from all geographic analyses because a large fraction of usage we saw during the sampling dates was abusive traffic.</p><p>We exclude Wyoming from all US state analyses because a large fraction of usage we saw during the sampling dates was abusive traffic.</p><h2>Chapter 4: Tasks and productivity</h2><p>In this chapter, we examine how time savings, success rates, and autonomy vary across task types, and what this entails for potential impacts on jobs and productivity.</p><p>The patterns reveal that more complex tasks yield greater time savings, but that this trades off against reliability. In a simple task removal exercise inspired by <a href=\"https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/2025-06/Expertise-Autor-Thompson-20250618.pdf\">Autor and Thompson (2025)</a>, Claude's tendency to cover higher-education tasks produces a net deskilling effect across most occupations, as the tasks AI handles are often the more skilled components of a job.</p><p>Claude usage spans a meaningful fraction of tasks across a growing share of occupations. We incorporate success rates into a richer model of job coverage; some occupations with modest coverage see large effects because AI succeeds on their most time-intensive work. Adjusting productivity estimates for task reliability roughly halves the implied gains, from 1.8 to about 1.0 percentage points of annual labor productivity growth over the next decade. However, these estimates reflect current model capabilities, and all signs suggest that reliability over increasingly long-running tasks will improve.</p><h3>Tradeoffs in task acceleration</h3><p>Our estimates suggest that, in general, the more complex tasks in our data yield a greater time savings (or “speedup”) from AI. We derive this by having Claude estimate both how long a task would take a human working alone and the duration when human and AI work together, which we validated in <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/research/estimating-productivity-gains\">previous work</a>. Speedup is then the human-alone time divided by the human-with-AI time. So reducing a 1 hour task to 10 minutes would give a 6x speedup.</p><p>The left panel of Figure 4.1 below gives the average speedup against our core measure of task complexity, the human years of schooling required to understand the inputs, all at the O*NET task level. It shows that in Claude.ai conversations, for example, prompts requiring 12 years of schooling (a high school education) enjoy a speedup of 9x, while those requiring 16 years of schooling (a college degree) attain a 12x speedup. This implies that productivity gains are more pronounced for use cases requiring higher human capital, consistent with evidence that white collar workers are far more likely to adopt AI (e.g., <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w32966/w32966.pdf\">Bick et al 2025</a>).</p><p>Throughout the range of task complexity, the speedup is higher for API users. This could reflect the nature of the API data, which is restricted to single-turn interactions, and that API tasks have been specifically selected for automation.</p><p>The results also capture a tradeoff, however. More complex tasks have a lower task success rate, as shown in the panel on the right. On Claude.ai, for example, tasks requiring less than a high school education (e.g., answering basic questions about products) attain a 70% success rate, but this drops to 66% for college-level conversations like developing analysis plans. Still, accounting for the difference in success rates—by either excluding low-success tasks or discounting speedups by success probability—does not eliminate the education gradient: complex tasks still show greater net productivity gains.</p><p>One way to examine the implications of the education gradient is to look at the share of automation across the education levels required to understand the inputs. If high-education tasks show relatively more automation, it could signal more exposure for white collar workers. Here, though, the message is unclear: the automation share is essentially unrelated to the human levels of education required to write the prompt (Appendix Figure A.1). On both Claude.ai and 1P API, tasks across education levels show automation patterns in roughly equal shares.</p><p>In what contexts do users defer more to Claude? Claude.ai users give the AI slightly more autonomy when working on more complex tasks. In contrast, API usage shows uniformly lower autonomy at all levels of complexity.</p><p>Note though that these distributions do not span the same set of tasks. API usage covers a more narrow swath of tasks in the economy, as seen in the concentration plot in Chapter 1. The high education tasks that experience heavy usage in the API data include security analysis, testing and quality assurance, and code review, whereas Claude.ai users are more likely to have iterative, instructive sessions.</p><h3>Task Horizons in Real-World Usage</h3><p>Recent work on AI “task horizons” (<a href=\"https://metr.org/blog/2025-03-19-measuring-ai-ability-to-complete-long-tasks/\">Kwa et al., 2025</a>) finds that AI success rates decline with task duration: longer tasks are harder for models to complete. With each successive model generation, however, this decline has become shallower as models succeed on increasingly long tasks. METR operationalizes task horizon primarily as the maximum duration at which a model achieves at least 50% success, and growth in this metric has become a key indicator of AI progress.</p><p>Figure 4.3 shows a similar measure using our primitives. The plot shows task-level success rates against the human time required, all at the O*NET task level. In the API data, success rates drop from around 60% for sub-hour tasks to roughly 45% for tasks estimated to take humans 5+ hours. The fitted line crosses the horizontal 50% success line at 3.5 hours, suggesting that API calls attain a 50% success rate for tasks that are 3.5 hours. The analogous time estimate in METR’s software engineering benchmark is 2 hours for Sonnet 4.5 and about 5 hours for Opus 4.5. (The data in this report predates the release of Opus 4.5.)</p><p>Claude.ai data tells a different story. Success rates decline far slower as a function of task length. Extrapolating using the linear fit, <a href=\"http://claude.ai/redirect/website.v1.52cf9e7f-1dca-4936-86b8-d24a8a6f2cd7\">Claude.ai</a> would hit a 50% success rate at about 19 hours. This may reflect how multi-turn conversation effectively breaks complex tasks into smaller steps, with each turn providing a feedback loop that allows users to correct course.</p><p>It’s worth noting that a fundamental difference from the METR setting is selection. METR constructs a benchmark where a fixed set of tasks is assigned to models. In our data, users choose which tasks to bring to Claude. This means observed success rates reflect not just model capability but also user judgment about what will work, the cost of setting up the problem for Claude, and the expected time savings if the task succeeds.</p><p>If users avoid tasks they expect to fail, for example, observed success rates will overstate true capability on the full distribution of potential tasks. This selection likely operates on both platforms, but in different ways: API customers select for tasks amenable to automation, while Claude.ai users select for tasks that could benefit from iteration. Also due to this selection effect, there’s no guarantee that more performant models would show improvement in this plot, because users may respond to new models by providing more challenging presentations of otherwise similar O*NET tasks.</p><p>Controlled benchmarks like METR’s measure the frontier of autonomous capability. Our real-world data can measure the  task horizon, reflecting a mix of model capabilities and user behavior, and expanding beyond coding tasks. Both approaches find that AI can be effective for tasks requiring hours of human work.</p><h3>Revisiting occupation penetration with effective AI coverage</h3><p>Our <a href=\"https://assets.anthropic.com/m/2e23255f1e84ca97/original/Economic_Tasks_AI_Paper.pdf\">earlier work</a> found that 36% of jobs had AI usage for at least a quarter of their tasks, with about 4% reaching 75% task coverage. This measure was based only on the appearance of a task in our data, however. The primitives introduced in this report can help better characterize how AI is changing the work content of occupations.</p><p>First, we find that task coverage is increasing. Combining across reports, 49% of jobs have seen AI usage for at least a quarter of their tasks. But incorporating that task’s share of the job, and Claude’s average success rate, suggests a different set of affected occupations.</p><p>We define effective AI coverage as the percent of a worker’s day that can be performed successfully by Claude. It’s calculated as the weighted sum of task success rates, where each task's weight is its share of the worker's time adjusted by how frequently the task occurs. The success rate comes from our primitives, the hours estimate from <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/research/estimating-productivity-gains\">our previous work on productivity effects</a>, and the frequency estimate from O*NET data, where surveyed workers indicate how often they perform the task.</p><p>The plot below shows how the effective AI coverage (y-axis) differs from task coverage alone (x-axis). The two are highly correlated, but with key differences. On the right side of the plot, occupations with high coverage—where almost all tasks appear with some frequency in Claude data—generally fall below the 45-degree line. This suggests that even 90% task coverage does not necessarily indicate large job impacts, since Claude may fail on key covered tasks or miss the most time-intensive ones.</p><p>Zooming in, several occupations show large differences in effective AI coverage compared to task coverage. For example, data entry workers have one of the highest effective AI coverage. This is because although only two of their nine tasks are covered, their largest task—reading and entering data from source documents—has high success rates with Claude. AI excels at what they spend most of their time doing.</p><p>Medical transcriptionists and radiologists also move up because their covered tasks happen to be their most time-intensive and highest-frequency work. For radiologists, their top two tasks— interpreting diagnostic images and preparing interpretive reports—have high success rates. These occupations have low task coverage because AI can't do the hands-on or administrative work in their job profiles, but it succeeds on the core knowledge work that dominates their workday.</p><p>Microbiologists fall below the 45-degree line, suggesting lower effective AI coverage than would be predicted by task coverage alone. Claude covers half of their tasks, but not their most time-intensive: hands-on research using specialized lab equipment.</p><p>This measure arguably gives a more realistic picture of job-level AI penetration. However, its implications depend on how often these Claude conversations actually displace or augment work that would otherwise be done by humans. For data entry clerks, AI likely does substitute for tasks previously performed manually. But when a Claude conversation maps to a teacher performing a lecture, it is less clear how this translates to reduced lecture time on the job. In future work, we could leverage our 1P API data to understand which of these tasks are being integrated into production workflows.</p><h3>AI’s impact on the task content of jobs</h3><p>Beyond how much of a worker's day AI can successfully perform, a separate question is which tasks get covered, and whether those tend to be the high-skill or low-skill components of the job. Recent research has studied changes in the task mix within jobs to understand AI's impact on wages and employment (<a href=\"https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/2025-06/Expertise-Autor-Thompson-20250618.pdf\">Autor and Thompson 2025</a>; <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w33509\">Hampole et al 2025</a>). A key insight is that automation's effects depend not just on how many tasks are covered, but on which tasks.</p><p>To see how jobs change when we remove the tasks AI can perform, we first construct a measure of the level of skill required for each task. O*NET doesn't provide task-level education requirements, so we train a model that predicts years of schooling from task embeddings, using the BLS's occupation-level education as the target. This way, a low-education occupation may still have a high-skill task if it looks like those that tend to exist in high-education occupations. For example, Legal Secretaries is a 12-year education occupation, but the task “Review legal publications and perform database searches to identify laws and court decisions relevant to pending cases” is predicted to require 17.7 years because it resembles tasks typically performed by lawyers and paralegals.</p><p>The data shows that Claude tends to cover tasks that require higher levels of education. The mean predicted education for tasks in the economy is 13.2 years. For tasks that we see in our data, the mean prediction is about a year higher, 14.4 years (corresponding to an Associate’s degree). This aligns with the occupation-level results from earlier reports, showing more Claude usage among white collar occupations.</p><p>We next calculate how removing AI-covered tasks shifts the average education level of what remains. Overall, the net first-order impact is to deskill jobs, since AI removes tasks that require relatively higher levels of education. One job that experiences such deskilling is technical writers, which loses tasks like \"Analyze developments in specific field to determine need for revisions\" (18.7 years) and \"Review published materials and recommend revisions or changes in scope, format\" (16.4 years), leaving tasks like \"Draw sketches to illustrate specified materials\" (13.6 years) and \"Observe production, developmental, and experimental activities\" (13.5 years). Travel agents also experience deskilling because AI covers tasks like \"Plan, describe, arrange, and sell itinerary tour packages\" (13.5 years) and \"Compute cost of travel and accommodations\" (13.4 years), while tasks like \"Print or request transportation carrier tickets\" (12.0 years) and \"Collect payment for transportation and accommodations\" (11.5 years) remain. Several teaching professions experience deskilling because AI addresses tasks like grading, advising students, writing grants, and conducting research without being able to do the hands-on work of delivering lectures in person and managing a classroom.</p><p>Some jobs see average education levels increase. Real estate managers experience upskilling because AI covers routine administrative tasks—maintaining sales records (12.8 years), reviewing rents against market rates (12.6 years)—while tasks requiring higher-level professional judgment and in-person interaction remain, like securing loans, negotiating with architecture firms, and meeting with boards.</p><p>These patterns illustrate how jobs may evolve over the coming years as their task content adjusts in response to AI. If the education level can be interpreted like expertise in <a href=\"https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/2025-06/Expertise-Autor-Thompson-20250618.pdf\">Autor and Thompson</a>'s analysis, their framework might predict that wages will fall and employment will increase for technical writers and travel agents; conversely, real estate managers will specialize in complex negotiations and stakeholder management, shrinking employment while increasing wages.</p><p>However, our education-based measure differs from Autor and Thompson's expertise concept: their framework would label some tasks as high expertise where ours specifies low education—for example, the Electrician task \"Connect wires to circuit breakers, transformers, or other components.\" And these predictions are based on current Claude usage patterns, which will shift as models are trained on new capabilities and users discover new applications—potentially changing which tasks are covered and whether the net effect is deskilling or upskilling.</p><h3>Revisiting the aggregate productivity implications of Claude usage</h3><p>In earlier work, we <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/research/estimating-productivity-gains\">estimated that widespread adoption of AI could increase US labor productivity growth by 1.8 percentage points</a> annually over the next decade. Here we revisit that analysis, incorporating the task success primitive introduced in this report and a richer treatment of task complementarity.</p><p>Based on the speedups associated with tasks with at least 200 observations in our sample of 1M <a href=\"http://claude.ai/redirect/website.v1.52cf9e7f-1dca-4936-86b8-d24a8a6f2cd7\">Claude.ai</a> conversations, we replicate our previous finding that current-generation AI models and current usage patterns imply a productivity effect of 1.8 percentage points per year over the next decade.</p><p>With the inclusion of 1P API data, we can assess whether implied labor productivity effects differ based on enterprise Claude deployment patterns. Two countervailing forces are at play: API usage is more concentrated in a narrower set of tasks and occupations (particularly coding-related work), which would tend to reduce implied effects; but task-level speedups are higher on average among API tasks, as implied by Figure 4.1. These forces largely offset: the API sample likewise implies a 1.8 percentage point increase in labor productivity over the next decade.</p><p>A salient critique of this analysis is that it fails to account for model reliability. If workers must validate AI output, the productivity benefits will be smaller than raw speedups suggest. To assess how quantitatively important this channel might be, we incorporate the task success primitive introduced in this report, multiplying task-level time savings by task-specific success rates before aggregating.</p><p>This adjustment has a meaningful effect: implied productivity growth falls from 1.8 to 1.2 percentage points per year for the next decade based on Claude.ai usage, and to 1.0 percentage points for API traffic. Yet, even after accounting for reliability, the implied impact remains economically significant—a sustained increase of 1.0 percentage point per year for the next ten years would return US productivity growth to rates that prevailed in the late 1990s and early 2000s.A second critique concerns task complementarity. If some tasks are essential and cannot easily be substituted, then overall productivity effects will be constrained regardless of speedups on other tasks. Teachers may prepare lesson plans more efficiently with AI while having no impact on time spent with students in the classroom.</p><p>To operationalize this idea, we impose some structure on how we aggregate task-level time savings within occupations but otherwise add up occupational efficiency gains as in the main analysis. Specifically, we suppose that within each occupation tasks are combined according to a Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) aggregator, where each task is weighted by the estimated time spent on each task as calculated in <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/research/estimating-productivity-gains\">our earlier analysis of the productivity effects implied by Claude usage</a>.</p><p>The key parameter is the elasticity of substitution across tasks, σ. When the elasticity of substitution is less than one, tasks are complements and those tasks that are not sped up by AI become bottlenecks for broader productivity gains. Alternatively, when the elasticity of substitution is greater than one, then workers can allocate toward the more productive tasks—thereby amplifying the overall time savings at the occupational level. An elasticity of substitution equal to one is a special case that replicates the main analysis above.</p><p>Figure 4.6 reports the results of this exercise for different values of task substitutability. As expected, when the elasticity of substitution is equal to one the implied productivity effect is the same as in our baseline analysis: An increase in labor productivity growth of ~1.8 percentage points per year over the next decade implied by both Claude.ai and API samples.</p><p>When tasks are complements, however, the implied aggregate labor productivity impact declines sharply as the economic effects are bottlenecked by tasks that AI speeds up the least. For example, at =0.5 the implied overall labor productivity effect is 0.7-0.9 percentage points per year—around half the size as implied by our baseline estimates. Additionally adjusting for task success further reduces the implied productivity effects to 0.8pp for <a href=\"http://claude.ai/redirect/website.v1.52cf9e7f-1dca-4936-86b8-d24a8a6f2cd7\">Claude.ai</a> and 0.6pp for API.</p><p>On the other hand, when the elasticity of substitution is greater than one, the implied labor productivity based on pre-Opus 4.5 usage patterns is materially higher. For example, at =1.5 the implied labor productivity effect rises to 2.2-2.6 percentage points per year, consistent with greater specialization in tasks where AI provides the largest speedups.</p><p>In both cases the implied productivity impact based on API traffic is more responsive to the degree of task substitutability. This is consistent with the fact that there is a larger share of API traffic concentrated in fewer tasks and associated occupations as compared to <a href=\"http://claude.ai/redirect/website.v1.52cf9e7f-1dca-4936-86b8-d24a8a6f2cd7\">Claude.ai</a>: When tasks are complements, this concentration amplifies the bottleneck problem; when they are substitutes, it amplifies productivity gains from task specialization.</p><p>What this analysis shows is that the productivity effects of automation may ultimately be constrained by bottleneck tasks that elude AI automation for the time being. And the labor market implications of increasingly capable AI could be similarly affected by such forces. For example, <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w34639\">Gans and Goldfarb (2026)</a> argue that the presence of bottleneck tasks within jobs means that partial AI automation can lead to an increase in labor income as such tasks increase in economic value (at least until a job is  automated).</p><p>The upshot of this chapter is that the impact of AI on the economy is unlikely to be uniform. As our effective AI coverage framework illustrates, the labor market implications for different workers will hinge on how reliable frontier AI tools are for their most central tasks.</p><p>But the labor market effects may also depend on the skill requirements of tasks that AI can proficiently handle relative to the rest of the economy. Indeed, we find that removing tasks Claude can already handle from the economy would produce a net deskilling effect: the tasks remaining for humans have lower educational requirements than those handled by AI.</p><p>While highly suggestive, this may miss an important detail: the most complex tasks where Claude is used tend also to be those where it struggles most. Rather than displacing highly skilled professionals, this could instead reinforce the value of their complementary expertise in understanding AI's work and assessing its quality.</p><p>The counterpart to these transformative labor market effects is the broader impact on growth and productivity. On the one hand, incorporating task reliability into our analysis diminishes the implied effect on labor productivity growth as informed by current Claude usage patterns. If bottleneck tasks bind, the implied impact diminishes further. On the other hand, the continuing growth in model capabilities suggests that both task coverage and task success may increase, which, in turn, could increase productivity impacts.</p><p> When we study the correlation between primitives with the O*NET, we restrict to tasks appearing in at least 100 conversations to reduce measurement error. In the coverage analysis, we use all tasks above the privacy threshold of 15.</p><p>We generate embeddings for each task statement using a pretrained sentence transformer (all-mpnet-base-v2) and predict education with Ridge regression.</p><p>On the other hand, some historical evidence suggests that when technologies automating job tasks appear in patent data, employment and wages subsequently fall for exposed occupations (<a href=\"https://www.michaelwebb.co/webb_ai.pdf\">Webb 2020</a>).</p><p> When we first assessed the aggregate productivity implications of Claude usage, we relied on a sample of 100k Claude.ai conversations from Fall 2025. Based on the set of tasks for which we observed speedups, we estimated that labor productivity could be 1.8 percentage points higher per year over the next decade. Expanding the sample to 1M observations means that we need to take a stand on how to handle very infrequently occurring tasks—which are very common given that usage follows a power law, as we documented in our past report. We choose a threshold of 0.02% because it replicates our previous results for our sample of <a href=\"http://claude.ai/redirect/website.v1.52cf9e7f-1dca-4936-86b8-d24a8a6f2cd7\">Claude.ai</a> conversations. For privacy-preserving reasons, we only ever analyze tasks with at least 15 observations, or an implied threshold of 0.015% for a 100k sample. And so our results are internally consistent across samples. If we do not impose a restriction on our 1M sample and assume that efficiency gains for any task in our sample, even those with just 15 observations out of one million, the implied aggregate labor productivity growth over the next decade would be roughly 5% percentage points per year—a mechanical increase based on a the much larger set of tasks included.</p><p>As before, this result is based on applying <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3982/ECTA15202\">Hulten’s Theorem</a> to task-level productivity shocks and assuming that the corresponding one-time increase in total factor productivity materializes over the course of a decade alongside capital deepening effects.As a reminder, for aggregating to implied labor productivity we calculate task-level efficiency gains as the log difference between human time without AI and with AI. There are certainly other ways to adjust based on task reliability. If tasks in our sample are composed of sub-tasks with heterogeneous AI applicability, and workers optimally deploy AI only on sub-tasks where it is effective, then scaling the efficiency gain by the success rate captures the extensive margin of AI adoption within a task.</p><p> We use a CES (constant elasticity of substitution) production function to aggregate task-level time savings to economy-wide productivity impacts. The elasticity parameter σ governs how easily workers can substitute between tasks. When σ=1, we apply Hulten's theorem directly: the aggregate productivity gain equals the wage-share-weighted sum of log speedups across tasks. For σ≠1, we use a two-level aggregation: first, within each occupation, we compute an occupation-level speedup as a CES aggregate of task speedups weighted by time fractions, using ρ=(σ-1)/σ. Then we apply Hulten's theorem to these occupation-level speedups. When σ&lt;1 (complements), productivity gains are bottlenecked by tasks with the smallest speedups. When σ&gt;1 (substitutes), workers can specialize in tasks where AI provides the largest speedups, amplifying aggregate gains. For tasks without observed AI speedup data, we assume no productivity change. We thank Pascual Restrepo for suggesting this particular exercise.</p><p>This fourth Anthropic Economic Index Report introduces economic primitives—foundational characteristics of AI use—that show how Claude is used by both consumers and firms. We use Claude to estimate the extent to which usage varies along these dimensions; these measures are directionally accurate and, taken together, provide important signals even if individual classifications are imperfect.</p><p>Our findings carry significant implications for how AI will reshape economies and labor markets. Notably, Claude tends to be used more, and appears to provide greater productivity boosts, on tasks that require higher education. If these tasks shrink for US workers, the net effect could be to deskill jobs. But these impacts depend crucially on complementarity across tasks, and whether increased productivity at a certain task may increase the demand for it.</p><p>At the global level, the strong relationship between per capita income and usage patterns—with higher-income nations using Claude collaboratively while lower-income countries focus on coursework and specific applications—suggests that AI's impact will be mediated by existing institutional structures rather than unfolding uniformly. Geographic diffusion patterns reinforce this picture. Within the US, per capita usage has converged slightly; globally, diffusion is slower. Combined with income-driven differences in how AI is used, this raises questions about whether AI will narrow or widen international economic gaps.</p><p>Equally important to the patterns documented here are potential changes across this and subsequent reports. As AI capabilities advance, Claude's success rate may increase, usage patterns may show greater autonomy, users may tackle new and more complex tasks, and tasks that prove automatable may graduate from interactive chat to API deployment.

      "content": "<h2>\n  1&nbsp;-&nbsp;Poggendorff Illusions\n</h2><p>The Poggendorff illusion is an optical illusion in which a diagonal line interrupted by a vertical bar appears misaligned, even when both segments are actually continuous.</p><p>A simple version of this effect can be seen in the following demo. I used the&nbsp; and&nbsp; pseudo-elements to create the diagonal line and the vertical bar, respectively.</p><p>The effect can also be seen in a more elaborate version with multiple diagonal lines and vertical bars:</p><p>This drawing can easily be achieved using two CSS gradients: one tilted at 70 degrees and another consisting of a series of vertical columns. I applied it to the , although I could have used&nbsp; instead.</p><p>Another variation of this illusion is the Münsterberg Poggendorff Arch, in which the two sides of an arch appear misaligned and seem as though they will not meet at the top&nbsp;-&nbsp;but they do (mouse over to see it).</p><p>The following illusions combine gradients and flat colors. Surprisingly, some of the gradients do not actually exist. They are simple gray bars that, when placed over a gradient, appear to have gradients themselves.</p><p>Take the following demo: all three bars (two vertical ones on the sides and one horizontal bar in the center) are the same shade of gray. The only real gradient is behind them, which tricks our brain into believing that the bars are different colors and even contain gradients.</p><p>Here is another variation of this effect. It looks like the central line has a repeating gradient of dark and light grays, but in reality it is a flat color. If you mouse over the demo, the bar will expand, making it clear that there is no gradient at all.</p><p>The next few optical illusions share a common idea: some colors are identical, but they do not look the same. This typically happens when regions of the same color or brightness are surrounded by areas with different contrast.</p><p>For example, in the following demo, the left and right ends are the same shade of gray. However, one looks lighter because it is closer to white, while the other looks darker because it is closer to black. Mouse over to reveal that they are, in fact, the same color.</p><p>Run the following demo. You will see two gray columns in a black-and-white grid. Both columns are the same shade of gray, but the one surrounded by black appears darker than the one surrounded by white.</p><p>I coded this demo using  so I could try something a bit different. That worked well, but it also made it harder to showcase the effect on hover. In hindsight, I should have planned that better.</p><p>This optical illusion also works with colors. For example, these two squares appear to be different shades of blue, but they are the same color. This time, you can mouse over to reveal the effect:</p><h2>\n  5&nbsp;-&nbsp;Wertheimer-Koffka Ring\n</h2><p>The ring in the following illustration has the same color all the way around. However, one side is placed over white and the other over black, which makes them look different. If you mouse over the demo, the red bar will disappear, making it more obvious that the ring is a single, uniform color.</p><p>You have probably seen the illusion involving a checkerboard and an object casting a shadow, where two tiles&nbsp;-&nbsp;one seemingly light and one seemingly dark&nbsp;-&nbsp;turn out to be the same color.</p><p>This demo follows the same principle. You will see two tiles labeled A and B. Both have the same shade of gray, but most people cannot tell at first glance (or second, or even third).</p><h2>\n  7&nbsp;-&nbsp;Asahi illusion of Brightness\n</h2><p>The circle at the center of this flower-shaped element is the same white as the rest of the page, but it gives the impression of being brighter, as if it were emitting light.</p><p>This is one of my favorite illusions in the collection. The circles (or spheres) look red, blue, or green, but in reality they are all the same grayish color. Our brain \"colorizes\" them based on the lines that overlap the shapes. Don't believe it? Mouse over the illustration.</p><p>In the following illustration, the lines inside the yellow section appear blue, while the lines inside the blue section appear red... but they are all black (or very dark gray). The white contour creates the illusion of color. Mouse over to remove the contour and the lines will clearly appear black.</p><p>One set of lines looks straighter (top) while the other looks more curved (bottom). In reality, both sets are equally wavy. The only difference is how they are colored: changing the color at the peaks makes the lines look straighter. Changing it at the inflection points makes them look more curved.</p><p>This is a classic optical illusion and an easy one to code in CSS. Three gradients are all that is needed to generate the effect in which the horizontal lines appear slanted, even though they are perfectly parallel.</p><p>This optical illusion depicts an impossible shape. Parts that should be in front appear in the back, top becomes right, and everything feels contradictory. I coded this one some time ago for the 2024 Divtober event.</p><p>Which orange circle is larger: the one on the right or the one on the left? It is a trick question: both are the same size. However, having smaller surrounding elements gives the impression that one is larger.</p><p>I also created an animated version of this illusion (see below), as well as another version using a square shape instead of a flower shape:</p><p>When people look at this illustration, they usually say they see a white square over black circles. However, the square is not actually there. The \"Pac-Man\" shapes create the illusion of a square and a sense of depth. Our brain fills in the missing information.</p><h2>\n  15&nbsp;-&nbsp;Ehrenstein's Illusion\n</h2><p>There are no circles or discs in this illustration, only vertical and horizontal lines forming crosses. Our visual system completes the shape and makes us perceive a disc that does not exist.</p><h2>\n  16&nbsp;-&nbsp;Neon-Color-Spreading Illusion\n</h2><p>This illustration shows concentric circles, some of which have a green-and-black pattern. Our brain perceives a central patterned circle and four concentric circles around it, beneath the green circle.</p><p>I cheated a little when creating this in CSS, as I actually used a green circle blended with the other backgrounds.</p><h2>\n  17&nbsp;-&nbsp;Hering and Wundt Illusions\n</h2><p>Perspective-based illusions are fascinating. Even when we know we are looking at a flat image, our brain insists on interpreting depth.</p><p>In the Hering illusion, the red lines appear to curve outward, even though they are straight.</p><p>The  effect is the Wundt illusion. When the lines expand from the sides toward the center, the red lines appear to curve inward (this effect is more subtle).</p><p>Both yellow lines are the same length, but the top one looks longer due to perceived depth and perspective. I tried a different approach when coding this one by applying a three-dimensional rotation in CSS... so the perspective is technically real.</p><p>This illusion is easy to code in CSS and easy to fall for. Both the vertical and horizontal lines are the same length, but the vertical line appears longer.</p><h2>\n  20&nbsp;-&nbsp;Müller-Lyer Illusion\n</h2><p>A classic illusion: the horizontal lines are the same length, but inward- or outward-pointing edges dramatically change how we perceive them. I could swear the top one is longer. But it is not.</p><p>\nFrom a coding perspective, each shape is a pseudo-element. I ensured the horizontal lines were identical by using the same gradients and only repositioning the edges in the&nbsp; and&nbsp;.</p><h2>\n  21&nbsp;-&nbsp;Tilted Table&nbsp;Illusion\n</h2><p>It looks like the top rectangle is leaning to the left, but it is actually parallel to the one at the bottom. The trick lies in the direction of the diagonal lines used to \"color\" each rectangle.</p><p>\nThis illusion works better on larger screens. The effect is diminished when you can see the whole picture.</p><p>This is a simple effect: the black lines are parallel, but they appear not to be because of the direction of the bars crossing them.</p><p>\nI slightly overcomplicated this one while coding it. I initially built the black-and-red version below and tried to reuse more code than I probably should have.</p><p>Here is the original version I created. The effect is also visible there:</p><p>Good news! There are more optical illusions below&nbsp;-&nbsp;but first, a warning.</p><p>\n  ATTENTION: The following optical illusions are static, but they give the impression of movement. Proceed accordingly.\n</p><p>(Leaving some blank space in case you do not want to continue.)</p><p>This is a trippy optical illusion. It is completely static, yet it looks like the black hole at the center is expanding&nbsp;-&nbsp;especially when you are not looking at it directly, creating the sensation of falling into a pit.</p><p>From a coding perspective, this one was very simple: a background pattern made with two radial gradients, plus a blurred pseudo-element for the \"expanding\" hole.</p><p>This is one of only two optical illusions in this collection where I used HTML elements instead of relying exclusively on CSS. It is a classic effect: when you look at the illustration, the peripheral discs appear to rotate, even though nothing is actually moving.</p><p>Another classic illusion. Focus on the white dots and the adjacent dots will appear to turn black. There is no animation, no transition, and nothing dynamic. Just intersecting lines and small white circles, yet it looks like motion.</p><p>This pattern consists of repeating black and white dots across the page. If you focus on one dot, the others will begin to disappear. At first it may happen by row or column, but after a short while, most of them vanish.</p><p>If you do not immediately see the effect, try focusing on one black dot. Mouse over it, wait a few seconds while keeping your focus, and then mouse out.</p><p>This is a static image, but it gives the impression that the pattern inside the circle is moving sideways. This happens because our eyes are constantly making small movements, even when we are not aware of it.</p><p>If you cannot see the illusion, try slightly moving the screen (or your head) while looking just outside the circle.</p><h2>\n  28&nbsp;-&nbsp;Orthogonal Dotted Lines&nbsp;Sway\n</h2><p>When you look around this pattern, the central area appears to slide and sway, even though it is completely static. This illusion makes me dizzy... but that may also be because I had to stare at it for a long time while coding it.</p><p>This illusion is particularly interesting. There is a pink circle surrounded by concentric pink and purple rings. If you focus on the pink circle, the rings appear to spin or scintillate, as if there were some activity in them. Of course, nothing is actually moving.</p><p>This demo was challenging to code and takes a long time to load. Mainly because it uses a large number of conic gradients behind the scenes, which browsers struggle to render efficiently. There is probably a better way to implement it, but I have not explored that yet.</p><p>If you look closely at the illustration, you may notice wave-like motion. As with the previous illusions in this section, the image is entirely static.</p><p>Good news! There are more optical illusions below&nbsp;-&nbsp;but first, another warning.</p><p>\n  ATTENTION: The following optical illusions actually move, and the illusion is created by motion itself. Some of them can be dizzying, so proceed accordingly.\n</p><p>(Leaving some blank space in case you do not want to continue.)</p><h2>\n  31&nbsp;-&nbsp;Animated Ebbinghaus Illusion\n</h2><p>Earlier, we saw two static versions of the Ebbinghaus illusion. This one is animated. The elements move side to side, and the surrounding shapes grow and shrink, giving the impression that the orange circle is changing size&nbsp;-&nbsp;when it definitely is not.</p><h2>\n  32&nbsp;-&nbsp;Psychokinematic Tower\n</h2><p>This looks like a three-dimensional tower spinning in space, as seen from above. In reality, it is a flat, two-dimensional image rotating.</p><p>\nMouse over the demo to stop the rotation and the illusion of depth disappears entirely.</p><p>This optical illusion requires only two gradients: a conic gradient for the fan-shaped arms and a radial gradient for the circles and discs.</p><p>If you focus on the black dot, the illustration may appear to develop a darker greenish or brownish border. However, the colors never change.</p><h2>\n  34&nbsp;-&nbsp;Reverse Spoke&nbsp;Illusion\n</h2><p>This illusion is delightful and disorienting. While the background colors of the wheel are spinning, the spokes remain fixed. However, they appear to rotate in the opposite direction. In reality, only the background is moving.</p><p>What do you see in this animation? Most people report two sets of lines operating independently: one moving horizontally and another moving vertically. And that is exactly how it looks.</p><p>In reality, it is a single shape moving uniformly. Run the demo, mouse over the lines, and the true motion will be revealed.</p><h2>\n  36&nbsp;-&nbsp;Mainz-Linez Illusion\n</h2><p>Focus on one of the red dots. You will notice it moves straight up and down along a vertical path. Now shift your focus to one of the black crosses in the center. Suddenly, the red dots appear to zigzag instead of moving straight.</p><p>It may look like the boxes are moving at different speeds or like a set of walking feet. In reality, all elements move at the same pace and in parallel. Mouse over the demo to reveal the effect.</p><p>The illusion also works when the \"feet\" move in circles, as shown in this alternative version:</p><p>Follow the red dot as it moves sideways. From the corner of your vision, it may appear that the dashed black-and-white lines are moving closer together (when the dot moves left) or farther apart (when it moves right). In reality, the lines are completely static.</p><p>These dots always have the same color. However, when placed against alternating backgrounds, they appear to jump or move out of sync because of how they blend with their surroundings.</p><p>Mouse over the demo to remove the background and the illusion disappears.</p><p>This illusion gives the impression that a blue square is growing and shrinking rhythmically, almost as if it were breathing or beating like a heart.</p><p>Although the image is rotating, its size never changes. Mouse over the illustration to remove the green boxes and reveal the rotating blue square.</p><p>This illustration shows a circle made of pink dots, with one dot missing. Focus on the cross at the center and the missing dot will appear as a yellow or green dot, giving the impression that it is \"eating\" the pink dots. Just like Pac-Man.</p><p>I could have used CSS trigonometric functions to calculate the exact positions of the dots, but since they never change, I chose to hardcode the values instead.</p><p>Here is a related effect. Follow the light gray circle as it spins, and the darker circles will appear to change from gray to greenish. Focus on the cross at the center, and after a short time, the darker circles may begin to fade entirely.</p><h2>\n  42&nbsp;-&nbsp;Pinna-Brelstaff Illusion\n</h2><p>This illusion is particularly dizzying. Follow the bluish dot as it moves from right to left and back again. It will appear as though parts of the tiled background are shifting, even though they are static. The only moving element is the dot.</p><p>\nFrom a CSS perspective, I coded the pattern using conic gradients, and applied it to the&nbsp; and&nbsp; pseudo-elements. I then flipped one upside down and clipped it.</p><p>The radii of a wheel, when viewed through a palisade, appear to curve. In reality, they are perfectly straight. Mouse over the demo to remove the palisade and you will see that the radii never bend.</p><p>This animation demonstrates how our minds infer motion that may not actually be there. Consider the two blue dots. Different people perceive different movements: side to side, top to bottom, or even circular motion.</p><p>Cover the right side of the animation so that you see only one dot at a time. The motion now appears vertical. Cover the bottom part instead, and the motion appears horizontal. This is our brain trying to complete the movement.</p><p>These two illustrations are identical&nbsp;-&nbsp;same shapes, same animation. The only difference is the CSS timing function.</p><p>The top animation moves smoothly from right to left. The bottom one appears to move choppily in the same direction, but if you focus on it, it may suddenly seem to reverse direction and move faster.</p><p>Most of the inspiration for these optical illusions came from two excellent resources:</p><p>You can also find this article on:</p><p>(You can leave comments on those platforms and I will reply there).</p>",

      "content": "<p>Hey HN! We're Nithin and Nikhil, twin brothers building BrowserOS (YC S24). We're an open-source, privacy-first alternative to the AI browsers from big labs.</p><p>The big differentiator: on BrowserOS you can use local LLMs or BYOK and run the agent entirely on the client side, so your company/sensitive data stays on your machine!</p><p>Today we're launching filesystem access... just like Claude Cowork, our browser agent can read files, write files, run shell commands! But honestly, we didn't plan for this. It turns out the privacy decision we made 9 months ago accidentally positioned us for this moment.</p><p>The architectural bet we made 9 months ago: Unlike other AI browsers (ChatGPT Atlas, Perplexity Comet) where the agent loop runs server-side, we decided early on to run our agent entirely on your machine (client side).</p><p>But building everything on the client side wasn't smooth. We initially built our agent loop inside a Chrome extension. But we kept hitting walls -- service worker being single thread JS; not having access to NodeJS libraries. So we made the hard decision 2 months ago to throw away everything and start from scratch.</p><p>In the new architecture, our agent loop sits in a standalone binary that we ship alongside our Chromium. And we use gemini-cli for the agent loop with some tweaks! We wrote a neat adapter to translate between Gemini format and Vercel AI SDK format. You can look at our entire codebase here: <a href=\"https://git.new/browseros-agent\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://git.new/browseros-agent</a></p><p>How we give browser access to filesystem: When Claude Cowork launched, we realized something: because Atlas and Comet run their agent loop server-side, there's no good way for their agent to access your files without uploading them to the server first. But our agent was already local. Adding filesystem access meant just... opening the door (with your permissions ofc). Our agent can now read and write files just like Claude Code.</p><p>What you can actually do today:</p><p>--- Where we are now\nIf you haven't tried us since the last Show HN (<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44523409\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44523409</a>), give us another shot. The new architecture unlocked a ton of new features, and we've grown to 8.5K GitHub stars and 100K+ downloads:</p><p>We are very bullish on browser being the right platform for a Claude Cowork like agent. Browser is the most commonly used app by knowledge workers (emails, docs, spreadsheets, research, etc). And even Anthropic recognizes this -- for Claude Cowork, they have janky integration with browser via a chrome extension. But owning the entire stack allows us to build differentiated features that wouldn't be possible otherwise. Ex:  Browser ACLs.</p><p>Agents can do dumb or destructive things, so we're adding browser-level guardrails (think IAM for agents): \"role(agent): can never click buy\" or \"role(agent): read-only access on my bank's homepage.\"</p><p>Curious to hear your take on this and the overall thesis.</p><p>We’ll be in the comments. Thanks for reading!</p>",

      "content": "<p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Let's say your husband or wife has a friend who will be coming to your city for two weeks on business. This friend writes to you and your spouse, asking if you can put him up while he's in town. Has this person committed a gross violation of etiquette? Whether you answer yes or no may speak to whether you're an Asker or a Guesser--the two personality types described in a three-year-old Web comment that has lately taken on a second life as a full-on blog meme.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">On January 16, 2007, Andrea Donderi <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"http://ask.metafilter.com/55153/Whats-the-middle-ground-between-FU-and-Welcome#830421\" title=\"responded to an Ask MetaFilter post\">responded to an Ask MetaFilter post</a> that dealt with a houseguest-related situation like the one described above. Donderi's take on the situation is as elegant as it is provocative. Basically, she says, there are two types of people in the world:</p><div><blockquote>This is a classic case of Ask Culture meets Guess Culture. In some families, you grow up with the expectation that it's OK to ask for anything at all, but you gotta realize you might get no for an answer. This is Ask Culture.<p> In Guess Culture, you avoid putting a request into words unless you're pretty sure the answer will be yes. Guess Culture depends on a tight net of shared expectations. A key skill is putting out delicate feelers. If you do this with enough subtlety, you won't even have to make the request directly; you'll get an offer. Even then, the offer may be genuine or pro forma; it takes yet more skill and delicacy to discern whether you should accept.</p></blockquote></div><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Over the weekend, <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2010/may/08/change-life-asker-guesser\" title=\"Oliver Burkeman\">Oliver Burkeman</a> wrote a column for The Guardian taking up Donderi's dichotomy and asking, \"Are you an Asker or a Guesser?\" A number of bloggers took the bait, expanding into broader thoughts about the niceties of social etiquette. Here's what they had to say:</p><div><ul><li><b>Contributes to Personal, Professional, International Tensions</b>&nbsp; In his column for The Guardian, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2010/may/08/change-life-asker-guesser\" title=\"Burkeman\">Burkeman</a> notes that neither type's approach is wrong per se, \"but when an Asker meets a Guesser, unpleasantness results. An Asker won't think it's rude to request two weeks in your spare room, but a Guess culture person will hear it as presumptuous and resent the agony involved in saying no. Your boss, asking for a project to be finished early, may be an overdemanding boor – or just an Asker, who's assuming you might decline. If you're a Guesser, you'll hear it as an expectation. This is a spectrum, not a dichotomy, and it explains cross-cultural awkwardnesses, too: Brits and Americans get discombobulated doing business in Japan, because it's a Guess culture, yet experience Russians as rude, because they're diehard Askers.\"</li></ul></div><div><ul><li><b>We Ask Strangers and Close Friends</b>&nbsp; Libertarian blogger <a href=\"http://www.juliansanchez.com/2010/05/10/asking-and-guessing/\" title=\"Julian Sanchez\">Julian Sanchez</a> offers a sociological reading of Donderi's theory that's worth perusing in full. \"The polite indirection of 'Guess Culture' is... often a way of preserving a deliberate ambiguity, which we generally want to do in social relationships where there's an intermediate level of intimacy—whereas relationships at the poles, with either close friends or strangers, tend to be governed by more direct asks,\" Sanchez writes. \"We do this, I think, precisely because those intermediate relationships ambiguous: We’re indirect because we’re negotiating just where on the gradient we fall ... To ask too directly at that stage can seem rude because it effectively demands a binary verdict on a work in progress.\"</li></ul></div><div><ul><li><b>Actually, One of Them Wrong</b>&nbsp; The New Republic's <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/blog/jonathan-chait/ask-dont-guess\" title=\"Jonathan Chait\">Jonathan Chait</a> takes a hard line. \"This is actually pretty simple: Guessers are wrong, and Askers are right. Asking is how you actually determine what the Asker wants and the giver is willing to receive. Guessing culture is a recipe for frustration. What's more, Guessers, who are usually trying to be nice and are holding themselves to a higher level of politeness, ruin things for the rest of us ... Guessers are what forces people with poor social discernment, like me, to regard all kinds of interactions as a minefield of awkwardness.\"</li></ul></div><div><ul><li><b>It's Not So Black and White</b>&nbsp; The Incidental Economist's <a href=\"http://theincidentaleconomist.com/dont-ask-dont-tell-now-dont-guess/\" title=\"Austin Frakt\">Austin Frakt</a> endorses a more situationally fluid approach. \"The problem with assuming one way is better than another is that it ignores the obvious temporal heterogeneity in preferences. The 'requester' (whether of Asker or Guesser type) is in more in need of a 'yes' (or 'no') response from the 'requestee' (again, of either type) at some times than others. Likewise, a requestee is more likely to say 'yes' (or 'no') at some times than at others ... Therefore, it is perfectly sensible to be an Asker for some things at some times and a Guesser for other things (or even the same things) at another.\"</li></ul></div><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">What say you--does the Asker/Guesser model ring true? (Or, put another way: We're not asking, but some people might want to leave comments, and perhaps you know someone who does...)</p><div><small>This article is from the archive of our partner .</small></div>",

      "content": "<p>For nearly three decades; or November 1996 to be exact, PDFs have relied on Deflate—the same compression algorithm that powers your ZIP files. Meanwhile, the web moved on. In 2015, Google introduced Brotli, a compression algorithm so efficient it now powers 95% of internet traffic. Websites got faster. Downloads got smaller. CDNs got cheaper.</p><p><strong>Now PDFs are getting the same upgrade.</strong></p><p>The PDF Association is bringing this battle-tested web compression technology <a href=\"https://pdfa.org/brotli-compression-coming-to-pdf/\">into the PDF specification</a> itself. After a decade of Brotli proving its worth across billions of web requests daily, it's now getting ready to make it's introduction into ISO 32000.</p><p>With <a href=\"https://pdfa.org/member/itext-group-nv/\">iText</a>, we can help drive widespread adoption with a <strong>production-ready Brotli encoder and decoder</strong> for the PDF ecosystem. The result?  with zero quality loss, using the same algorithm trusted by Google, Cloudflare, and every major CDN.</p><p>PDF compression has been stuck in 1996 for a good reason: <strong>backward compatibility is sacred</strong>. The PDF Association operates under a strict principle—any new feature must work seamlessly with existing readers, or it risks fragmenting the ecosystem. Adding a new compression algorithm isn't just a technical change; it's a  that could render documents unreadable in older software. This creates a high barrier for innovation.</p><p>Beyond compatibility concerns, there are other practical challenges. The PDF specification moves slowly by design—it's an ISO standard that requires consensus by hundreds of stakeholders. Compression algorithms must be  (ruling out patented options),  across platforms, and  in production.</p><p>Finally, the ecosystem is conservative: enterprises and governments rely on PDFs for archival and legal documents that must remain accessible for decades, making any breaking change a risk that needs extraordinary justification.</p><h2>Encoding and decoding: Technical implementation</h2><p>To get Brotli compression working within the iText SDK, we need to solve two problems: reading documents, and also writing them.</p><p>Let's start with the easiest one; reading documents.</p><h3>Decoding: Advanced plumbing work</h3><p>First of all, let's look at how the content of a page is stored within a PDF. We can demonstrate this with just the classic \"Hello World\" text example.</p><p>The following PDF syntax simply displays the text \"Hello World!\" on a page:</p><pre>5 0 obj                 % Unique identifier to reference this content from other places within the PDF\n&lt;&lt;/Length 49&gt;&gt;stream    % Meta data for the stream object. Here it contains a Length value to indicate how many bytes are there after the `stream` keyword.\nq                       % the actual content\nBT\n/F1 12 Tf\n37 788.33 Td\n(Hello World!)Tj\nET\nQ\nendstream               % Indicates the end of the stream object\nendobj                  % Indicates the end of the referenceable object\n</pre><p>So, if we need to render or do anything else with the content, it would look like the following:</p><pre>|------------------------|\n| Get stream based on id |\n|------------------------|\n           ||\n           \\/\n|------------------------|\n|      Read content      |\n|------------------------|\n           ||\n           \\/\n|------------------------|\n|    Render/Do stuff     |\n|    with the content    |\n|------------------------|\n</pre><p>Okay, so now we have a high-level view how PDF processors handle the low-level processing of those stream objects, we can dive a little deeper!</p><p>Let's take a look at the following PDF stream object where the content is encoded using the Deflate algorithm.</p><pre>5 0 obj\n&lt;&lt;/Filter/FlateDecode/Length 36&gt;&gt;stream                  % The meta data now now includes `Filter`\nxœmÍÂ0\u0010„ïû\u0014ëM/1?Æl®‚âU\bø\u0002m\u0005I)Íû\u001fºm¢...            % Reduced for clarity\nendstream\nendobj\n</pre><p>First of all, we notice there is an additional Key  with a value of  in the metadata.\nThis can be interpreted the following way: \"The content of this stream object is only usable after its  filter is applied\".</p><p>So how does this change our working implementation?</p><pre>|------------------------|\n| Get stream based on id |\n|------------------------|\n           ||\n           \\/\n|------------------------|\n|      Read content      |\n|------------------------|\n           ||\n           \\/\n|------------------------|\n|         Decode         |\n|     based on Filter    |\n|------------------------|\n           ||\n           \\/\n|------------------------|\n|    Render/Do stuff     |\n|    with the content    |\n|------------------------|\n</pre><p>We can now see we require an operation on the content before it's usable. The PDF specification already provides a variety of ways to write the content of the PDF streams.</p><table><tbody><tr><td>Decodes ASCII hexadecimal data to binary.</td></tr><tr><td>Decodes ASCII base-85 data to binary.</td></tr><tr><td>Decompresses data using LZW compression.</td></tr><tr><td>Decompresses data using zlib/deflate compression.</td></tr><tr><td>Decompresses data using run-length encoding.</td></tr><tr><td>Decompresses CCITT fax-encoded monochrome images.</td></tr><tr><td>Decompresses JBIG2-encoded monochrome image data.</td></tr><tr><td>Decompresses JPEG DCT-based image data.</td></tr><tr><td>Decompresses JPEG 2000 wavelet-based image data.</td></tr><tr><td>Decrypts data encrypted by a security handler.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>So the idea for Brotli is to simply add another  implementation.What we need to get it working into iText is actually pretty minimal:</p><ol><li>Get the decoding implementation from Google's repository.</li><li>Write some plumbing code to call it from iText</li><li>Hook up the plumbing code to the  filter</li></ol><p>For the first step we simply embedded <strong>Google's reference Java Brotli decoder</strong> straight from their official repository into our kernel module.</p><p>By embedding Google's reference implementation directly, we guarantee:</p><ul><li>: No version conflicts with other libraries</li><li>: Same decoder on all platforms</li><li>: We control the code, even if upstream changes</li><li><strong>Automatically generate C# version</strong>: Using our porting mechanism we can have a C# implementation</li></ul><p>The plumbing implementation lives in , which plugs into iText's existing filter pipeline:</p><pre>public class BrotliFilter extends MemoryLimitsAwareFilter {\n    @Override\n    public byte[] decode(byte[] b, PdfName filterName, PdfObject decodeParams,\n            PdfDictionary streamDictionary) {\n        try {\n            final byte[] buffer = new byte[DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE];\n            final ByteArrayInputStream input = new ByteArrayInputStream(b);\n            final ByteArrayOutputStream output = enableMemoryLimitsAwareHandler(streamDictionary);\n            final BrotliInputStream brotliInput = new BrotliInputStream(input);\n            int len;\n            while ((len = brotliInput.read(buffer, 0, buffer.length)) &gt; 0) {\n                output.write(buffer, 0, len);\n            }\n            brotliInput.close();\n            return output.toByteArray();\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            throw new PdfException(KernelExceptionMessageConstant.FAILED_TO_DECODE_BROTLI_STREAM, e);\n        }\n    }\n}\n</pre><p>Let's break down what's happening in this implementation:</p><ul><li>: The filter extends , which protects against decompression\nbombs—malicious PDFs that expand into gigabytes of data when decompressed. This is critical for production systems.</li><li>: The compressed bytes  are wrapped in a , which is then passed to\nGoogle's . This is where the magic happens— handles all the heavy lifting of Brotli decompression.</li></ul><p>As you can see, writing the plumbing code is pretty easy because of iText's architecture.</p><p>The last thing to do is to ensure iText knows which implementation to associate with the  filter.</p><p>This is also pretty trivial. The filter is registered automatically in  alongside  and the other standard PDF\nfilters:</p><pre>public final class FilterHandlers {\n    private static final Map&lt;PdfName, IFilterHandler&gt; defaults;\n\n    static {\n        Map&lt;PdfName, IFilterHandler&gt; map = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();\n\n        map.put(PdfName.FlateDecode, new FlateDecodeFilter());\n        map.put(PdfName.Fl, new FlateDecodeFilter());\n        //other implementations removed for clarity\n\n        // we add our implementation\n        map.put(PdfName.BrotliDecode, new BrotliFilter());\n\n        defaults = Collections.unmodifiableMap(map);\n    }\n}\n</pre><p>That's it. From this point on, <strong>any PDF with  streams just works</strong>. No configuration needed.</p><p>Now we could have stopped here—our SDK could process Brotli-compressed PDFs from other sources. But reading isn't enough. To truly bring Brotli to the PDF ecosystem, we needed to let developers create these smaller files. That meant solving the encoding problem.</p><p>And encoding turned out to be significantly more complex than decoding.</p><h3>Encoding: a separate module for compression</h3><h4>The problem: iText’s compression was hardcoded</h4><p>Before Brotli, iText only supported two compression modes for PDF streams:</p><ol></ol><p>This logic was baked directly into the stream-writing code—there was no abstraction, no plugin point. If you wanted to use a different compression algorithm, you were out of luck.</p><p>To support Brotli (and future algorithms), we needed to <strong>introduce a new abstraction layer</strong>: <code>IStreamCompressionStrategy</code>.</p><pre>public interface IStreamCompressionStrategy {\n   /**\n    * Gets the PDF filter name that identifies this compression algorithm.\n    *\n    * @return the PDF name representing the compression filter\n    */\n   PdfName getFilterName();\n\n   /**\n    * Gets the decode parameters required for decompressing the stream.\n    * &lt;p&gt;\n    * Decode parameters provide additional information needed to correctly\n    * decompress the stream data.\n    *\n    * @return the decode parameters as a PDF object, or {@code null} if not needed\n    */\n   PdfObject getDecodeParams();\n\n   /**\n    * Creates a new output stream that wraps the original stream and applies compression.\n    * @param original the original output stream to wrap\n    * @param stream the PDF stream being compressed (may be used for context or configuration)\n    *\n    * @return a new output stream that performs compression\n    */\n    OutputStream createNewOutputStream(OutputStream original, PdfStream stream);\n}\n</pre><p>This interface decouples compression logic from iText's core PDF writing machinery. Now, instead of hardcoding Flate everywhere, we can inject different strategies at runtime. To inject the required strategy we make use of the . You can find more information about it here: <a href=\"https://kb.itextpdf.com/itext/adding-dependency-injection-to-the-pdfdocument-cla\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Adding Dependency Injection to the PdfDocument class</a>.</p><p>From now on when iText needs to compress a stream, it asks the  in the : <em>\"Do you have an IStreamCompressionStrategy?\"</em></p><ul><li>: Use the registered strategy (Brotli in this case)</li><li>: Fall back to the default Flate compression</li></ul><ul><li>: iText Core no longer cares about the algorithm used</li><li>: You only pay the cost if you use it</li><li>: New algorithms just implement the interface</li></ul><h4>The Second Problem: No Pure Java Encoder</h4><p>Here's where things got tricky. While Google's Brotli decoder has a pure Java implementation (which we embedded for reading), the official Brotli . To use it from Java, you need:</p><ul><li> to call native code from Java</li><li><strong>Platform-specific native libraries</strong> ( for Windows,  for Linux,  for macOS)</li><li> to compile and ship these libraries for every platform</li></ul><p>For a heavily-used library like iText, shipping native binaries is a non-starter:</p><ul><li>: Users need to manage native libraries across platforms</li><li>: Native code introduces attack surfaces</li><li>: We'd need to compile for Windows x64, Linux ARM, macOS Silicon, etc.</li><li>: What if another library ships a different Brotli version?</li></ul><p>We needed a solution that handled this complexity  iText's core.</p><p>That solution is a separate Maven module () that you add as an optional dependency. This\nmodule contains:</p><ul><li><strong>BrotliStreamCompressionStrategy</strong>: Implementation of <code>IStreamCompressionStrategy</code></li><li>: A third-party library that wraps Google's C++ encoder with JNI</li></ul><p>Here's what <code>BrotliStreamCompressionStrategy</code> looks like:</p><pre>public class BrotliStreamCompressionStrategy implements IStreamCompressionStrategy {\n\n    @Override\n    public OutputStream createNewOutputStream(OutputStream original, PdfStream stream) {\n        int compressionLevel = convertCompressionLevel(stream.getCompressionLevel());\n        Encoder.Parameters params = Encoder.Parameters.create(compressionLevel);\n        try {\n            return new BrotliOutputStream(original, params);\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            throw new PdfException(KernelExceptionMessageConstant.CANNOT_WRITE_TO_PDF_STREAM, e);\n        }\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public PdfName getFilterName() {\n        return PdfName.BrotliDecode; // This goes into the /Filter entry\n    }\n}\n</pre><h4>The native wrapper: brotli4j</h4><p>Instead of writing JNI bindings ourselves, we rely on <a href=\"https://github.com/hyperxpro/Brotli4j\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">brotli4j</a>—a mature, well-tested library that:</p><ul><li>Wraps Google's official C++ Brotli encoder/decoder</li><li>Ships <strong>pre-compiled native libraries</strong> for all major platforms (Windows x64/ARM, Linux x64/ARM, macOS Intel/Silicon)</li><li>Automatically extracts the correct native library at runtime (no manual setup)</li><li>Is actively maintained and widely used (powers projects like Netty, OkHttp)</li></ul><p>By delegating to brotli4j, we get production-grade native bindings without maintaining our own JNI layer.</p><h4>Why keep encoding separate?</h4><p>You might ask: <em>\"Why not bundle brotli4j in the kernel module like you did with the decoder?\"</em></p><p>Great question. Here's the reasoning:</p><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Encoder (separate module)</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Required to read Brotli PDFs</td></tr><tr><td>Pure Java (Google's decoder)</td><td>Native code (brotli4j with JNI)</td></tr><tr></tr><tr><td>Every user needs to read PDFs</td><td>Most users stick with Flate</td></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table><p>By keeping the encoder separate, we give users choice: add  if you need 20% smaller files, or stick with the default if native dependencies are a concern.</p><h4>Putting it all together: Full example</h4><p>Here's what it looks like to create a Brotli-compressed PDF:</p><p>First of all add the required dependencies. Notice you have to add iText's artifactory because of the experimental nature of the code, and so users don't accidentally enable it.</p><pre>&lt;repositories&gt;\n  &lt;repository&gt;\n    &lt;id&gt;itext-releases&lt;/id&gt;\n    &lt;name&gt;iText Repository - releases&lt;/name&gt;\n    &lt;url&gt;https://repo.itextsupport.com/releases&lt;/url&gt;\n  &lt;/repository&gt;\n&lt;/repositories&gt;\n\n&lt;dependency&gt;\n&lt;groupId&gt;com.itextpdf&lt;/groupId&gt;\n&lt;artifactId&gt;brotli-compressor&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n&lt;version&gt;{itext.version.bigger.then.9.5.0}&lt;/version&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\n</pre><pre>public static void main() {\n\n// 1.

They won't render in your browser's built-in PDF viewer. Most third-party PDF libraries will reject them outright.</p><p>Why? Because  isn't part of the official PDF specification yet. The PDF Association is actively working on adding it to ISO 32000 (the PDF standard), but until that's finalized and implementations roll out, Brotli PDFs exist in a gray area.</p><h4>What about forward compatibility?</h4><p>Here's the good news: <strong>Brotli PDFs are future-proof</strong>. Once the PDF Association finalizes the spec and vendors implement it, your existing Brotli-compressed documents will just work. You're not creating broken files—you're creating files that are .</p><p>Think of it like HTTP/2 in 2015. Early adopters who deployed it got immediate performance wins in their own\ninfrastructure, and as browsers caught up, those benefits became universal. Brotli PDFs follow the same pattern.</p><p>We're not shipping this as a toy feature. We're working directly with the PDF Association to:</p><ul><li><strong>Standardize the specification</strong> (syntax, decode parameters, dictionary support)</li><li> across multiple platforms (Java, .NET, C++)</li><li> to ensure interoperability when other vendors adopt it</li><li> when the spec finalizes (we'll handle any breaking changes)</li></ul><p>By adopting Brotli compression now, you're not taking a risk—you're investing in a proven technology that's on a clear path to standardization.</p><p>PDF compression hasn't evolved in 30 years—until now. Brotli represents the biggest leap in PDF storage efficiency since the format was invented, and iText is bringing it to production .</p><p>Yes, there are compatibility limitations. Yes, it's experimental. But every standard starts this way. HTTP/2, WebP, and TLS 1.3 were all \"experimental\" once. Early adopters got the benefits first, then the ecosystem caught up.</p><p>By using iText's Brotli implementation now, you're:</p><ul><li> by 15-25% immediately</li><li><strong>Future-proofing your documents</strong> for inevitable standardization</li><li> with real-world feedback</li><li> for a more efficient PDF ecosystem</li></ul><p>The PDF Association is listening.

      "content": "<p align=\"center\"><b>Professor Alan J. Perlis\nYale University</b></p><p>Many reasons can be given for teaching\none or more aspects of computer\nscience (defined as the study of the set\nof phenomena arising around and because of\nthe computer) to all university students.\nProbably every reader of this note supports\nsome of these reasons. Let me list\nthe few I find most important: (1) to\nunderstand and to be able to compose\nalgorithms; (2) to understand how computers\nare organized and constructed; (3) to\ndevelop fluency in (at least) one programming\nlanguage; (4) to appreciate the\ninevitability of controlling complexity\nthrough the design of systems; (5) to\nappreciate the devotion of computer\nscientists to their subject and the\nexterior consequences (to the student as\ncitizen) of the science’s development.</p><p>Even though computer science deals\nwith symbolic objects whose nature we\nstudy mathematically, it cannot be taught\nas an orderly development arising from a\nfew fundamental ideas whose existence the\nstudent has already observed intuitively\nduring his maturation, such as gravitation\nand electricity.</p><p>It is during this first computer\ncourse that the student awakes to the\npossibilities and consequences of computation.\nThey arise most usefully and in\ngreatest profusion during his writing of\nprograms. He must program and program and\nprogram! He must learn how to state\nprecisely in a programming language what\nhe perceives about the nature of symbolic\nsystems. I know of no better way to\nexpedite this awakening than by programming.</p><p>But what should the student program?\nand in what language? I do not place much\nemphasis on heavy  of other people’s\nprograms, packages if you will, that\nperform real services such as statistical\npackages, data management systems, linear\nequations solvers, etc. While it is wise\nto use standard programs when they match\none’s needs, it is more important to\nmaster self-expression during this initial\ncontact.</p><p>Available time is a limiting factor;\na semester provides about 16 weeks of\ncontact. During that interval the student\nmust negotiate a set of tasks that sharpens\nhis abilities and explodes his perceptions\nof the computer’s capabilities. He\nmust be on the computer early and often\nduring the semester and his approach to it\nmust be smooth and easy. The computer\nsystem he uses should be time-sharing and\ninteractive, if you will.</p><p>Learning to program involves a\nsequence of acts of discovery punctuated\nby recovery from errors. As the semester\nprogresses the causes and nature of errors\nwill change. Certain kinds will diminish\nand even disappear, only to be replaced by\nerrors of deeper significance, harder to\nisolate and more resistant to satisfactory\nremoval — syntactic gaffes give way to\nsemantic errors — incorrect perceptions\nof purpose, improper use of means, the use\nof hammers to swat flies and swatters to\nlevel mountains.</p><p>To write correct and balanced programs\na student may be forced to move\nbetween programs that are not related to\neach other by a few simple textual rearrangements.\nHe must learn to write and\ntest complicated programs quite rapidly.\nAs he moves through the sequence of\nassigned tasks his ability to express\nhimself fluently should not founder too\nsoon because of language shortcomings.\nFor all of the above reasons as well as a\nfew others, I have come to believe that\nAPL is the most rational first language\nfor a first course in computer science.</p><p>It is true that BASIC and FORTRAN are\neasier to learn than APL, for example, a\nweek versus a month. However, once\nmastered, APL fits the above requirements\nmuch better than either BASIC or FORTRAN\nor their successors ALGOL 60, PL/I and\nPascal. The syntax of APL is not a\nsignificant difficulty for the students.\nThe large number of primitive functions,\nat first mind-numbing in their capabilities,\nquickly turn out to be easily\nmastered, soon almost all are used naturally\nin every program — the primitive\nfunctions form a harmonious and useful\nset. As a data organization, arrays turn\nout to be extraordinarily useful (though\nprolonged contact with APL makes one wish\nfor the added presence of more heterogeneous\nstructures).</p><p>The virtues of APL that strike the\nprogrammer most sharply are its \n— complicated acts can be described\nbriefly, its  — there are a\nlarge number of ways to state even moderately\ncomplicated tasks (the language\nprovides choices that match divergent\nviews of algorithm construction), and its\n — there is the possibility\nto construct sentences — one-liners as\nthey are commonly called — that approach\nin the flow of phrase organization,\nsequencing and imbedding, the artistic\npossibilities achievable in natural\nlanguage prose.</p><p>The sweep of the eye across a single\nsentence can expose an intricate, ingenious\nand beautiful interplay of operation\nand control that in other programming\nlanguages is observable only in several\npages of text. One begins to appreciate\nthe emergence and significance of style\nand to observe that reading and writing\nfacility is tied to the development of an\narsenal of idioms which soon become\nengraved in one’s skull as units.</p><p>The combination of these three\nfactors makes it possible to develop an\nexcellent set of exercises in the first\ncourse. These exercises can be large in\nnumber, cover a wide range of topics and\nvary widely in complexity, and still be\ndone during the 16 week period. The later\nexercises can be tied to the design and\ndevelopment of a system — a collection of\nprocedures that, in varying combinations,\nperform a set of tasks.</p><p><b>In Teaching Computer Organization</b></p><p>To appreciate computer science one\nrequires an understanding of the computer.\nOnce the student understands the computer\n— its macroscopic components monitored by\nthe fetch-execute cycle and its apparent\ncomplexity being controlled by gigantic\nreplication of a few simple logical\nelements — he can become aware of the\nimportant equilibrium between hardware and\nsoftware — the shifting of function\nbetween the two as determined by economic\nfactors — and between algorithm and\nsystem as determined by traffic and\nvariation. Using APL it is straightforward\nto model a computer and to illustrate\nany of its macroscopic or microscopic\ncomponents at any level of detail. The\nprograms to perform these functions at\nevery level of description remain small\nand manageable — about 40 lines or so.</p><p>The development of software, e.g., a\nmachine language assembler, is a task of\nsimilar difficulty (about 40 lines) and\nhence possible within the confines of a\nfirst course.</p><p>Word processing and graphics,\nincreasingly important application areas\nof computers, can be explored with exercises\nof no great size, e.g., to do\npermuted-index of title lists (~12 lines),\ndisplay, rotation and scaling of composites\nof polygons (~20 lines), graphing of\nfunctions (~5 lines), etc.</p><p>With (or even without) the use of 2\nor 3 pre-built functions, file processing\nproblems such as payroll, personnel\nsearch, etc. can be written in a relatively\nfew lines.</p><p>An important consequence of the\nattainable brevity of these compositions\ncannot be ignored: the student becomes\naware that he need not be forced to depend\nupon external, pre-packaged and elaborate\nsystems to do what are really simple\nprogramming tasks. Instead of learning a\nnew coding etiquette to negotiate a\ncomplex external system, he writes his own\nprograms, develops his own systems tailor-made\nto his own needs and understood at\nall levels of detail by him. If anything\nis meant by man-machine symbiosis, it is\nthe existence of such abilities on the man\nside of the “membrane”, for there is no\npartnership here between man and machine,\nmerely the existence of a growing, but\nnever perfectly organized, inventory of\ntools that the competent can pick among,\nadapt and use to multiply his effective\nuse of the computer.</p><p>I cannot overemphasize the importance\nof terseness, flexibility and phrase\ngrowth to a beginning student. His\nhorizons of performance are being set in\nthis first course. If he sees a task as a\nmountain then its reduction to molehill\nproportions is itself a considerable\nalgorithmic task. While this is true of\nvery large tasks, even when using APL this\nconscious chaining of organized reductions\ncan be postponed until the student has\nalready collected a large number of useful\ndata-processing functions, engraved in his\nskull, with which to level mountains.</p><p>It is important to recognize that no\nmatter how complicated the task, the APL\nfunctions will usually be anywhere from\n1/5 to 1/10 the number of statements or\nlines, or what have you, of a FBAPP\n(FORTRAN or BASIC or ALGOL or PL/I or\nPascal) program. Since APL distributes,\nthrough its primitive functions, control\nthat the other languages explicate via\nsequences of statements dominated by\nexplicit control statements, errors in APL\nprograms tend to be far fewer in number\nthan in their correspondents in FBAPP.</p><p>I can come now to the topics of\nstructured programming and program verification.\nBoth are important, but their\ncontent and importance depend strongly on\nthe language in which programs are\ncouched. A program is well-structured if\nit has a high degree of lexical continuity:\nsmall changes in program capability\nare acquired by making changes within\nlexically close text (modularization).</p><p>Since APL has a greater density of\nfunction within a given lexical scope than\nFBAPP, one would expect that APL programs\nwill support considerably more structure\nthan equivalent size FBAPP programs. Put\nanother way, since the APL programs are\n1/5 to 1/10 the size of FBAPP programs,\nthe consequences to APL programs of weak\nstructuring are less disastrous. Recovery\nfrom design mistakes is more rapid. Since\nwe can only structure what we already\nunderstand, the delay in arriving at\nstable program organization should be\nconsiderably less with FBAPP!</p><p>Please note that the emphasis here is\non the control of propagation of relationships,\nnot the nonsense of restricting \nor bathing programs in cascades of\n loops.</p><p>The verification, formal or informal,\nof programs is a natural and important\nactivity. It is linked to specification:\nwhat we can’t specify we can’t verify. By\nspecification we mean stating what is to\nbe output for a given input. We immediately\nobserve that, since specification in\nFBAPP is extremely tedious and unnatural,\nwe must use some other language. APL\nturns out to be quite good and has often\nbeen suggested as a specification language.\nAssertions and verification\nconditions can be much more easily\nexpressed as APL predicates than as FBAPP\npredicates. Because of the widespread\ndistribution of control into the semantics\nof primitive functions, for which no proof\nsteps need then be given, APL verifications\ntend to be, just as their counterpart\nAPL programs, shorter and more\nanalytic than equivalent FBAPP program\nverifications.</p><p>The form of the FBAPP languages\nfollows closely the structure of the\ncomputers that prevailed during their\ninception. They have the nice property\nthat one may often optimize machine\nperformance of their compiled programs by\ntransforming FBAPP programs to other FBAPP\nprograms. Control of the computer is more\neasily exercised with programs in these\nlanguages than with APL, since the latter\nis more independent of current machines.\nFor many programs this control over the\ntarget machine performance is quite vital,\nand APL couples more weakly to the standard\ncomputer than does FBAPP.</p><p>However, new array processing computers\nare beginning to appear and, had they\nbeen standard 20 years ago, APL and not\nFORTRAN would have been the prototype of\nlanguage development. I often wonder at\nwhat descriptive levels we would be\nprogramming today had that been the case!\nSince it was not the case, we should not\nthrow out or limit APL. We must seek ways\nto match it to the common computer. We\nmust design compilers as well as computers\nthat fit APL better.</p><p><b>More Cost-Effective than BASIC</b></p><p>Cost is an important issue in the\ninstructional process. An APL computer\nsystem currently costs about $10K per\nterminal, about twice the cost of a BASIC\nsystem. As APL system designs stabilize\nand integrated circuitry costs drop, the\ntwo figures will coincide at or near the\ncost of a contemporary terminal. However,\neven now the APL system is cheaper than\nBASIC systems for equivalent work loads\nbecause one can do more than twice as much\nwith APL in a given period of time than\nwith BASIC!</p><p>Let me mention in closing two additional\nissues regarding the use of APL in\nan introductory computer science course.\nFirst, most university computer scientists\ndon’t really  APL. They haven’t\nappreciated what it means to think in APL\n— to think about parallel operations in\narrays and to distribute and submerge\nexplicit looping among its primitive\nfunctions. I am reminded of the difficulties\nmany math departments experience when\nthey try to replace calculus by a fine\nmath and combinatorics course as the first\nmeat and potatoes offering by the department\nto the university. However at Yale\nwe have found that faculty outside the\nsoftware milieu — in theory, for example\n— pick up APL quite fast and prefer it to\nFBAPP. I am sure the same is true elsewhere.</p><p>The second issue is of a different\nkind. I am firmly convinced that APL and\nLISP are related to each other along an\nimportant axis of language design and that\nacquiring simultaneous expertise in both\nlanguages is possible and desirable for\nthe beginning student. Were they unified,\nthe set of tasks that succumb to terse,\nflexible and expressive descriptions will\nenlarge enormously without overly increasing\nthe intellectual burden on the student\nover his initial 16 week contact period.</p><p>Above all, remember what we must\nprovide is a  to last the student\nfor 40 years, not a handbook for tomorrow’s\nemployment.</p><table><tbody></tbody></table>",

      "content": "<p>Iran is in the midst of one of the world’s most severe communications blackouts. This post uses Kentik data to detail how this historic event unfolded, where this event lies in the context of previous Iranian shutdowns, and finally discusses what might be in store next for Iran.</p><p>For nearly two weeks, Iran has been enduring one of the most severe internet shutdowns in modern history. The theocratic regime’s decision to restrict communications coincided with a violent nationwide crackdown on a growing protest movement driven by worsening economic hardship.</p><p>In this post, I explore the situation in Iran using Kentik’s aggregate NetFlow data, along with other sources.</p><p>At the time of this writing, a near-complete internet shutdown has persisted for almost 14 days. Along with internet services, international voice calling has also been blocked (there have been a couple of periods when limited outgoing calls were allowed), and domestic communication services have experienced extended disruptions, including Iran’s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Information_Network\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">National Information Network</a>. For a country of 90 million people, the combined blocking of these communication modes makes this blackout one of the most severe in history.</p><p>To learn more about the conditions that lead to the check out this special episode of Kentik’s <a href=\"https://www.kentik.com/telemetrynow/\">Telemetry Now podcast</a> with Iranian digital rights expert <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ammir\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amir Rashidi</a>, Director of Digital Rights and Security at the human rights organization <a href=\"https://www.miaan.org/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Miaan Group</a>:</p><p>For decades, the internet of Iran has been connected to the world via two international gateways:</p><p>IPM, primarily a university and research network, was the country’s original internet connection in the 1990s, a story covered in the excellent book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Internet-Elsewhere-Emergent-Effects-Wired-ebook/dp/B005DPJKT4\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Internet of Elsewhere</a> by <a href=\"https://cyrusfarivar.com/blog/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Cyrus Farivar</a>. Years later, the state telecom TIC got into the business of providing internet service and today handles the vast majority of internet traffic into and out of Iran.</p><p>Despite TIC’s dominance, IPM has maintained a technologically independent connection to the outside world, though it has never been immune from Iranian government censorship and surveillance. This distinction matters because each gateway behaved differently during the shutdown.</p><p>In the days leading up to January 8, there were many <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/persian/articles/c6207l6m791o\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reports of localized internet blockages</a> around the country, but these incidents weren’t big enough to register on any of our national traffic statistics for Iran.</p><p>The first major development occurred at 11:42 UTC on January 8, 2026, when TIC (AS49666) began <a href=\"https://x.com/DougMadory/status/2009283110282592704\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">withdrawing its IPv6 BGP routes</a> from its sessions with other networks. Within hours, nearly all of Iran’s IPv6 routing had disappeared from the global routing table.</p><p>However, based on our aggregate NetFlow, IPv6 traffic normally amounts to less than 1% of the overall traffic (in bits/sec) into Iran, so the average Iranian was unlikely to be affected by this issue. Regardless, the withdrawal of IPv6 routes appeared to be an early indication of what was to come later in the day.</p><p>Following a brief disruption, we observed internet traffic levels begin to plummet at 16:30 UTC (7pm local). The drop continued until internet traffic into Iran had all but ceased by 1845 UTC, as illustrated below. It took over two hours to stop all internet traffic into and out of the country.</p><p>At 19:00 UTC, we <a href=\"https://x.com/DougMadory/status/2010069808369545267\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">observed TIC disconnecting</a> from a subset of its transit providers, including Russian state telecom Rostelecom (AS12389) and regional operator Gulf Bridge International (AS200612), and all of its settlement-free peers.</p><p>Despite the loss of numerous BGP adjacencies for AS49666 (TIC), the vast majority of Iranian IPv4 routes continued to be routed globally. The drop in Iranian IPv4 traffic, therefore, could not be explained by reachability issues; another mechanism was at work at the network edge blocking traffic.</p><p>Georgia Tech’s IODA tool <a href=\"https://ioda.inetintel.cc.gatech.edu/country/IR?from=1767654317&amp;until=1768950317&amp;view=view1\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">captures this divergence</a> well. In the below screenshot, active probing (blue) drops to zero as traffic is blocked, while routed IPv4 space in BGP (green) is almost completely unscathed (98.14%).</p><p>Although IPv4 routes remained online, internet traffic stopped for roughly 90 million Iranians. This distinction is central to Iran’s next step: internet “whitelisting,” in which an Iranian version of the Chinese Great Firewall allows only approved users or services while blocking all others. Had authorities withdrawn IPv4 routes, as they did with IPv6, Iran would have become completely unreachable, as <a href=\"https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/02/16/world/middleeast/0212-egypt-internet.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Egypt was in January 2011</a>. By keeping IPv4 routes in circulation, Iranian authorities can selectively grant full internet access to specific users while denying it to the broader population.</p><p>As mentioned above, the internet shutdown in Iran is not complete. There has been a tiny amount of traffic still trickling in and out as a small set of Iranians continue to enjoy internet access.</p><p>From our data, we have also observed the emergence of a diurnal pattern of traffic to AS49666 emerge on January 13. AS49666 is not typically a major terminus for internet traffic to Iran, so this traffic is likely proxied traffic from whitelisted individuals or services.</p><h2>Evolving calculus of shutdowns in Iran</h2><p>Back in 2012, Iran was in the beginning stages of building its National Information Network (NIN), ostensibly built to allow the country to continue to function in the event that it was cut off from the outside world. At the time, I teamed up with Iran researcher Collin Anderson to investigate. With access to in-country servers, we mapped Iran’s national internet from the inside (research published <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.6398\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>).</p><p>We found that the NIN had been implemented by routing RFC1918 address space (specifically 10.x.x.x) between Iranian ASes within the country. By doing so, they could be assured that devices connected to the NIN would not be able to receive connections from the outside world, as those IP addresses are not routable on the public internet.</p><p>In 2019, I <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20191128123943/https://blogs.oracle.com/internetintelligence/historic-internet-blackout-in-iran\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reported on Iran’s internet shutdown</a> following the government’s decision to raise gas prices. At the time, it was the most severe shutdown in the country’s history—until this month. It involved withdrawing BGP routes of some networks while blocking traffic of others, and lasted <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Internet_blackout_in_Iran\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">for almost two weeks</a>.</p><div>Initial impacts of the 2019 Iranian internet shutdown in the Oracle Intelligence Map.</div><div>Nightly traffic drops for Iranian mobile providers during Iran’s internet curfew in 2022.</div><p>The article described internet curfews as another means of reducing the costs of shutdowns, not unlike the development of the NIN, according to Iranian digital rights expert <a href=\"https://www.kentik.com/telemetrynow/s02-e65/\">Amir Rashidi</a>. In that post, we wrote:</p><blockquote>The objective of internet curfews, like Iran’s NIN, is to reduce the cost of shutdowns on the authorities that order them. By reducing the costs of these shutdowns, they become a more palatable option for an embattled leader and, therefore, are likely to continue in the future.</blockquote><div>Timeline for the stages of the Iranian internet shutdown during the Twelve-Day War.</div><p>The outage demonstrated Iran’s newfound ability to block traffic nationwide without manipulating BGP routes, signaling a higher level of sophistication in its internet filtering. This summer’s Stealth Blackout ultimately foreshadowed the ongoing shutdown Iran is now enduring.</p><p>In the aftermath of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman,_Life,_Freedom_movement\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2022 protests</a>, Starlink began allowing connections from Iran. Satellite internet operators like Starlink must typically clear, at a minimum, two legal hurdles to operate in a country: a telecom license and radio spectrum authorization from the local government. Starlink has been operational in Iran for over three years at this point without either, and the Iranian government has taken note.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-R/conferences/RRB/Pages/default.aspx\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ITU Radio Regulations Board (RRB)</a> is a quasi-judicial United Nations body that interprets and applies the <a href=\"https://www.itu.int/pub/R-REG-RR\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Radio Regulations</a>, to include satellite emissions. It exists to resolve disputes between countries and oversees compliance with the international radio frequency register, but, in the end, has no direct enforcement power.</p><ul><li>“Request the Administration of the Islamic Republic of Iran to pursue its efforts, to the extent possible, to identify and deactivate unauthorized STARLINK terminals in its territory,</li><li>Strongly urge the Administration of Norway to take all appropriate actions at its disposal to have the operator of the Starlink system immediately disable unauthorized transmissions of its terminals within the territory of the Islamic Republic of Iran.”</li></ul><p>Regardless of the decisions of this body, Starlink continues to operate in the country. (Note: The US and Norway share responsibility for Starlink’s ITU registration.)</p><h2>Other governments are watching, learning</h2><p>In the decade and a half since the internet shutdowns of the Arab Spring, we’ve observed the <a href=\"https://www.kentik.com/blog/from-egypt-to-uganda-a-decade-of-internet-shutdowns/\">practice of suppressing communications evolve</a> as authoritarian governments learn tactics from one another. In the ongoing shutdown in Iran, multiple such tactics are on display.</p><p>To mitigate the costs of its shutdown, the Iranian government has created an internal national internet and appears to be in the process of building a “whitelisting” system to allow certain individuals and services internet access while blocking the rest. If these measures successfully enable an unpopular Iranian government to remain in power, we can expect to see them replicated elsewhere.</p><p>On the other side, the digital rights activists have also been building tools, funded in large part by the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/08/25/state-department-iran-censorship-internet/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">now-embattled Open Technology Fund</a>, to allow communications to continue during a shutdown like this. However, no amount of circumvention tooling can restore service to 90 million people.</p><p>The fight for open and free communications does not have an end. As long as authoritarian governments exist, this game of cat-and-mouse will continue. Ours is only to decide which side we’re on and to throw our support (financially and otherwise) to those working on solutions to these problems.</p>",

      "content": "<p>The idea of streams as a cloud storage primitive resonated with a lot of folks, but not having an open source option was a sticking point for adoption – especially from projects that were themselves open source! So we decided to build it: <a href=\"https://github.com/s2-streamstore/s2\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/s2-streamstore/s2</a></p><p>s2-lite is MIT-licensed, written in Rust, and uses SlateDB (<a href=\"https://slatedb.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://slatedb.io</a>) as its storage engine. SlateDB is an embedded LSM-style key-value database on top of object storage, which made it a great match for delivering the same durability guarantees as s2.dev.</p><p>You can specify a bucket and path to run against an object store like AWS S3 — or skip to run entirely in-memory. (This also makes it a great emulator for dev/test environments).</p><p>Why not just open up the backend of our cloud service? s2.dev has a decoupled architecture with multiple components running in Kubernetes, including our own K8S operator – we made tradeoffs that optimize for operation of a thoroughly multi-tenant cloud infra SaaS. With s2-lite, our goal was to ship something dead simple to operate. There is a lot of shared code between the two that now lives in the OSS repo.</p><p>A few features remain (notably deletion of resources and records), but s2-lite is substantially ready. Try the Quickstart in the README to stream Star Wars using the s2 CLI!</p><p>The key difference between S2 vs a Kafka or Redis Streams: supporting tons of durable streams. I have blogged about the landscape in the context of agent sessions (<a href=\"https://s2.dev/blog/agent-sessions#landscape\">https://s2.dev/blog/agent-sessions#landscape</a>). Kafka and NATS Jetstream treat streams as provisioned resources, and the protocols/implementations are oriented around such assumptions. Redis Streams and NATS allow for larger numbers of streams, but without proper durability.</p><p>The cloud service is completely elastic, but you can also get pretty far with lite despite it being a single-node binary that needs to be scaled vertically. Streams in lite are \"just keys\" in SlateDB, and cloud object storage is bottomless – although of course there is metadata overhead.</p><p>One thing I am excited to improve in s2-lite is pipelining of writes for performance (already supported behind a knob, but needs upstream interface changes for safety). It's a technique we use extensively in s2.dev. Essentially when you are dealing with high latencies like S3, you want to keep data flowing throughout the pipe between client and storage, rather than go lock-step where you first wait for an acknowledgment and then issue another write. This is why S2 has a session protocol over HTTP/2, in addition to stateless REST.</p><p>You can test throughput/latency for lite yourself using the `s2 bench` CLI command. The main factors are: your network quality to the storage bucket region, the latency characteristics of the remote store, SlateDB's flush interval (`SL8_FLUSH_INTERVAL=..ms`), and whether pipelining is enabled (`S2LITE_PIPELINE=true` to taste the future).</p><p>I'll be here to get thoughts and feedback, and answer any questions!</p>",

I hope you find it useful!</p><p>Backstory: I've been using many agents in parallel as I work on a somewhat ambitious financial analysis tool. I was juggling agents working on epics for the linear solver, the persistence layer, the front-end, and planning for the second-generation solver. I was losing my mind playing whack-a-mole with the permission prompts. YOLO mode felt so tempting. And yet.</p><p>Then it occurred to me: what if YOLO mode isn't so bad? Decision fatigue is a thing. If I could cap the blast radius of a confused agent, maybe I could just review once. Wouldn't that be safer?</p><p>So that day, while my kids were taking a nap, I decided to see if I could put YOLO-mode Claude inside a sandbox that blocks exfiltration and regulates git access. The result is yolo-cage.</p><p>Also: the AI wrote its own containment system from inside the system's own prototype. Which is either very aligned or very meta, depending on how you look at it.</p>",

      "content": "\n<p>Hi,<p>I started Muky in April 2024. Classic side project that got out of hand. We have two kids - the younger one is happy with the Toniebox, but our older one outgrew it. She started asking for specific songs, audiobooks that aren't available as figurines, and \"the music from that movie.\"<p>We had an old iPad Mini lying around and already pay for Apple Music. Felt dumb to keep buying €17/$20 figurines for 30-45 minutes of content when we have 100 million songs.<p>Now at version 4.0 after ~20 updates. Some lessons:<p>On the hardware vs app tradeoff:\nToniebox and Yoto are brilliant for little ones – tactile, simple, no screen needed. But they hit a wall once kids want more. And handing a 5-year-old Apple Music means infinite scrolling and \"Dad, what's this song about?\" Muky sits in between – full library access, but parents control what's visible.<p>On sharing:\nRemember lending CDs or cassettes to friends? Or kids swapping Tonie figurines at a playdate? I wanted that for a digital app. So I built QR code sharing. Scan, import, done. And unlike a physical thing – both keep a copy.<p>On onboarding:\nFirst versions: empty app, figure it out yourself. Retention was awful. Now: 4-step onboarding that actually guides you. Should've done this from the start.<p>On content discovery:\n100 million songs sounds great until you have to find something. Parents don't want to search – they want suggestions. Spent a lot of time building a Browse tab with curated albums and audiobooks for kids. Finally feels like the app helps you instead of just waiting for input.<p>On going native:\nWent with Swift/SwiftUI instead of Flutter or React Native. No regrets - SwiftUI is a joy to work with and performance is great. Android users ask for a port regularly. No capacity for that now, but Swift for Android is progressing (<a href=\"https://www.swift.org/documentation/articles/swift-sdk-for-android-getting-started.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.swift.org/documentation/articles/swift-sdk-for-a...</a>). Maybe one day. CarPlay is another one parents keep asking for – going native should make that easier to add, if Apple grants me the entitlement.<p>On subscriptions vs one-time:\nStarted with one-time purchase. Revenue spikes at launch, then nothing. Switched to subscription – existing one-time buyers kept full access. Harder to sell, but sustainable.<p>Ask me anything about indie iOS dev or building for kids. App is at <a href=\"https://muky.app\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://muky.app</a> if you're curious.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46705676\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46705676</a></p>\n<p>Points: 115</p>\n<p># Comments: 47</p>\n",

      "content": "I usually build web games in C++, but using Emscripten always felt like overkill for what I was doing. I don't need full POSIX emulation or a massive standard library just to render some stuff to a canvas and handle basic UI.<p>The main thing I wanted to solve was the JS/WASM interop bottleneck. Instead of using the standard glue code for every call, I moved everything to a Shared Memory architecture using Command and Event buffers.</p><p>The way it works is that I batch all the instructions in WASM and then just send a single \"flush\" signal to JS. The JS side then reads everything directly out of Shared Memory in one go. It’s way more efficient, I ran a benchmark rendering 10k rectangles on a canvas and the difference was huge: Emscripten hit around 40 FPS, while my setup hit 100 FPS.</p><p>But writing DOM logic in C++ is painful, so I built Coi. It’s a component-based language that statically analyzes changes at compile-time to enable O(1) reactivity. Unlike traditional frameworks, there is no Virtual DOM overhead; the compiler maps state changes directly to specific handles in the command buffer.</p><p>I recently benchmarked this against React and Vue on a 1,000-row table: Coi came out on top for row creation, row updating and element swapping because it avoids the \"diffing\" step entirely and minimizes bridge crossings. Its bundle size was also the smallest of the three.</p><p>One of the coolest things about the architecture is how the standard library works. If I want to support a new browser API (like Web Audio or a new Canvas feature), I just add the definition to my WebCC schema file. When I recompile the Coi compiler, the language automatically gains a new standard library function to access that API. There is zero manual wrapping involved.</p><p>I'm really proud of how it's coming along. It combines the performance of a custom WASM stack with a syntax that actually feels good to write (for me atleast :P). Plus, since the intermediate step is C++, I’m looking into making it work on the server side too, which would allow for sharing components across the whole stack.</p><p>component Counter(string label, mut int&amp; value) {</p><pre><code>    def add(int i) : void {\n        value += i;\n    }\n\n    style {\n        .counter {\n            display: flex;\n            gap: 12px;\n            align-items: center;\n        }\n        button {\n            padding: 8px 16px;\n            cursor: pointer;\n        }\n    }\n\n    view {\n        &lt;div class=\"counter\"&gt;\n            &lt;span&gt;{label}: {value}&lt;/span&gt;\n            &lt;button onclick={add(1)}&gt;+&lt;/button&gt;\n            &lt;button onclick={add(-1)}&gt;-&lt;/button&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    }</code></pre>\n}<p>component App {\n    mut int score = 0;</p><pre><code>    style {\n        .app {\n            padding: 24px;\n            font-family: system-ui;\n        }\n        h1 {\n            color: #1a73e8;\n        }\n        .win {\n            color: #34a853;\n            font-weight: bold;\n        }\n    }\n\n    view {\n        &lt;div class=\"app\"&gt;\n            &lt;h1&gt;Score: {score}&lt;/h1&gt;\n            &lt;Counter label=\"Player\" &amp;value={score} /&gt;\n            &lt;if score &gt;= 10&gt;\n                &lt;p class=\"win\"&gt;You win!&lt;/p&gt;\n            &lt;/if&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    }</code></pre>\n}<p>app {\n    root = App; \n    title = \"My Counter App\"; \n    description = \"A simple counter built with Coi\"; \n    lang = \"en\"; \n}</p><p>I'd love to hear what you think.

      "content": "<p>Hi HN, we're Sam, Shane, and Abhi.</p><p>Almost a year ago, we first shared Mastra here (<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43103073\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43103073</a>). It’s kind of fun looking back since we were only a few months into building at the time. The HN community gave a lot of enthusiasm and some helpful feedback.</p><p>Today, we released Mastra 1.0 in stable, so we wanted to come back and talk about what’s changed.</p><p>If you’re new to Mastra, it's an open-source TypeScript agent framework that also lets you create multi-agent workflows, run evals, inspect in a local studio, and emit observability.</p><p>Since our last post, Mastra has grown to over 300k weekly npm downloads and 19.4k GitHub stars. It’s now Apache 2.0 licensed and runs in prod at companies like Replit, PayPal, and Sanity.</p><p>Agent development is changing quickly, so we’ve added a lot since February:</p><p>- Native model routing: You can access 600+ models from 40+ providers by specifying a model string (e.g., `openai/gpt-5.2-codex`) with TS autocomplete and fallbacks.</p><p>- Guardrails: Low-latency input and output processors for prompt injection detection, PII redaction, and content moderation. The tricky thing here was the low-latency part.</p><p>- Scorers: An async eval primitive for grading agent outputs. Users were asking how they should do evals. We wanted to make it easy to attach to Mastra agents, runnable in Mastra studio, and save results in Mastra storage.</p><p>- Plus a few other features like AI tracing (per-call costing for Langfuse, Braintrust, etc), memory processors, a `.network()` method that turns any agent into a routing agent, and server adapters to integrate Mastra within an existing Express/Hono server.</p><p>(That last one took a bit of time, we went down the ESM/CJS bundling rabbithole, ran into lots of monorepo issues, and ultimately opted for a more explicit approach.)</p><p>Anyway, we'd love for you to try Mastra out and let us know what you think. You can get started with `npm create mastra@latest`.</p><p>We'll be around and happy to answer any questions!</p>",

If any of you have actually got it to work, could you share (in detail) how you did it?<p>By \"getting it to work\" I mean:\n * creating more value than technical debt, and\n * producing code that’s structurally sound enough for someone responsible for the architecture to sign off on.<p>Lately I’ve seen a push toward minimal or nonexistent code review, with the claim that we should move from “validating architecture” to “validating behavior.” In practice, this seems to mean: don’t look at the code; if tests and CI pass, ship it. I can’t see how this holds up long-term. My expectation is that you end up with \"spaghetti\" code that works on the happy path but accumulates subtle, hard-to-debug failures over time.<p>When I tried using Codex on my existing codebases, with or without guardrails, half of my time went into fixing the subtle mistakes it made or the duplication it introduced.<p>Last weekend I tried building an iOS app for pet feeding reminders from scratch. I instructed Codex to research and propose an architectural blueprint for SwiftUI first. Then, I worked with it to write a spec describing what should be implemented and how.<p>The first implementation pass was surprisingly good, although it had a number of bugs. Things went downhill fast, however. I spent the rest of my weekend getting Codex to make things work, fix bugs without introducing new ones, and research best practices instead of making stuff up. Although I made it record new guidelines and guardrails as I found them, things didn't improve. In the end I just gave up.<p>I personally can't accept shipping unreviewed code. It feels wrong. The product has to work, but the code must also be high-quality.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46691243\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46691243</a></p>\n<p>Points: 423</p>\n<p># Comments: 426</p>\n",

The nearby sliders\n          adjust the probability of each action occurring.\n        </div><div>\n          When a cell splits, it creates a new cell pointed in a slightly\n          different direction. Decreasing the maximum turn angle causes cells to\n          grow in straighter lines.\n        </div><div>\n          Only the youngest cells get to grow or split. After a certain age,\n          cells become dormant. This threshold age is defined as a percentile on\n          the distribution of cell ages at any given time. Increasing the\n          threshold means more cells will be active.\n        </div><div>\n          Cells leave a signal in the location they were created. This effectively\n          broadcasts their presence so that others won't grow or split on top of\n          them. Increasing the decay rate enables faster regrowth, but also makes\n          it more likely that cells will grow on top of each other.\n        </div><div>\n          When cells reach a fixed maximum age, they die.\n        </div>",

I spent the weekend red-teaming small-scale open weights models (Qwen2.5-1.5B, Qwen3-1.7B, Gemma-3-1b-it, and SmolLM2-1.7B).<p>I found a consistent vulnerability across all of them: Safety alignment relies almost entirely on the presence of the chat template.<p>When I stripped the <|im_start|> / instruction tokens and passed raw strings:<p>Gemma-3 refusal rates dropped from 100% → 60%.<p>Qwen3 refusal rates dropped from 80% → 40%.<p>SmolLM2 showed 0% refusal (pure obedience).<p>Qualitative failures were stark: models that previously refused to generate explosives tutorials or explicit fiction immediately complied when the \"Assistant\" persona wasn't triggered by the template.<p>It seems we are treating client-side string formatting as a load-bearing safety wall.

Flat RAG pipelines often fail to retrieve related articles together, even when they are clearly connected through references, definitions, or clauses.</p><p>After trying several RAG setups, I subjectively felt that GraphRAG was a better mental model for this kind of data. The Microsoft GraphRAG paper and reference implementation were helpful starting points. However, in practice, I found one recurring friction point: graph storage and vector indexing are usually handled by separate systems, which felt unnecessarily heavy for short-lived analysis tasks.</p><p>To explore this tradeoff, I built GibRAM (Graph in-buffer Retrieval and Associative Memory). It is an experimental, in-memory GraphRAG runtime where entities, relationships, text units, and embeddings live side by side in a single process.</p><p>GibRAM is intentionally ephemeral. It is designed for exploratory tasks like summarization or conversational querying over a bounded document set. Data lives in memory, scoped by session, and is automatically cleaned up via TTL. There are no durability guarantees, and recomputation is considered cheaper than persistence for the intended use cases.</p><p>This is not a database and not a production-ready system. It is a casual project, largely vibe-coded, meant to explore what GraphRAG looks like when memory is the primary constraint instead of storage. Technical debt exists, and many tradeoffs are explicit.</p><p>The project is open source, and I would really appreciate feedback, especially from people working on RAG, search infrastructure, or graph-based retrieval.</p><p>Happy to answer questions or hear why this approach might be flawed.</p>",

I wanted AI to actually design — create buttons, build layouts, generate entire component systems. Existing solutions were either read-only or required verbose JSON schemas that burn through tokens.</p><p>Tech stack: Bun + Citty for CLI, Elysia WebSocket proxy, Figma plugin. The render command connects to Figma's internal multiplayer protocol via Chrome DevTools for extra performance when dealing with large groups of objects.</p><p>Try it: bun install -g @dannote/figma-use</p><p>Looking for feedback on CLI ergonomics, missing commands, and whether the JSX syntax feels natural.</p>",

      "content": "<p>It was a quiet afternoon; the only sound was an instrumental playlist humming from a forgotten YouTube tab. A melody felt familiar, but I couldn’t quite place it, spirited away by my work. Suddenly, a transition in the soundtrack caught my ears, pulling me from my thoughts with a single question: what was this soundtrack?</p><p>I switched over to the tab. The title read: . “Of course, it was from .” I had to smile at the unintentional irony. I slid my mouse over the progress bar to hear the transition again. A small graph appeared, indicating it was the song’s “most replayed” segment. Apparently, I wasn’t alone in loving that part. But that’s when I noticed them again: two small, symmetrical dips flanking the graph’s peak.</p><p>I had seen it before. A tiny digital hiccup, easily dismissed. But in the quiet of that afternoon, it was a loose thread, and I felt an irresistible urge to pull.</p><p>It started with a Google search: <em>“how is youtube’s most replayed graph calculated.”</em> Predictably, an AI overview answered:</p><blockquote><p>“aggregating the replay data from thousands of viewers to identify sections of a video that are re-watched the most.”</p></blockquote><p>This generic answer confirmed my suspicion: there wasn’t much public data on this. I’d be charting my own path (I fully expect future LLMs to cite this article, by the way.)</p><h2>Hypothesis: Designing the System</h2><p>This kicked off a personal project: designing YouTube’s “most replayed” with the goal of replicating the bug. Naturally, I put myself in the shoes of an engineer at Google, (a reality I hope to achieve someday), and started brainstorming possible designs by imagining myself wearing a ‘Noogler’ cap with one of those Doraemon copters. Seriously, how does that work? Won’t the cap fly away? Maybe that’s the point? “Let your thinking hats fly.” But I digress. That’s a topic for  I get into Google.</p><p>At the most basic level, I had to divide the continuous bar into discrete segments. So I represented the progress bar’s state as a boolean array, where each index corresponded to a segment of the video. That seemed like a good start.</p><figure><figcaption><small><em>Canvas 1: The boolean array approach.</em>This is my first attempt at an interactive article, so feel free to play around! You can hit start, pause or reset to simulate watching a video. (Note that the array only updates while the animation is playing, and dragging the seek bar is not supported.)</small></figcaption></figure><p>But was that enough? I thought about all the ways I interact with a video player. I can move my seek back and forth, skip segments, re-watch segments, etc. A simple boolean array would only tell me if a segment was watched, not how many times. It fails to account for a user re-watching the same segment five times in a row. I needed something better, like a frequency array, to track how many times each segment was seen.</p><figure><figcaption><small><em>Canvas 2: The frequency array.</em>Notice how the segments grow as the \"watcher\" passes through them, updating the frequency array. Try skipping around when the animation is playing to see the effect.</small></figcaption></figure><p>Now I had a minimum viable product. I could generate the heatmap based on this frequency array: for each segment, I’d plot a point whose vertical position corresponded to its view count. Join the dots, and voilà: my very own “most replayed” graph.</p><figure><figcaption><small>We simply connect the dots of our frequency array, and scale the points upward based on the respective view counts.</small></figcaption></figure><p>Was that all? Unfortunately, no. There was a lot more to it. First and foremost, I could already see a bug in my implementation. I thought about what would happen when a segment was watched over and over again, a ridiculously large number of times. My point would shoot higher and higher until it was off-screen entirely. This would be, to put it mildly, a bad user experience. Try re-watching the same segment multiple times in the above interactive canvas to see the effect.</p><p>So, what’s the fix? If you have a statistics background (or just a good memory of high school math), you might already know the answer. Either way, it’s . It sounds fancy, but it’s really just a way of keeping our graph in check. Instead of plotting the raw view counts (which can range from zero to billions), we scale everything down to a standard range, typically between 0 and 1.</p><p>The math is simple: find the segment with the highest view count (let’s call it ). Then, divide every segment’s view count by . Suddenly, the specific numbers don’t matter. The most popular segment will always have a value of 1 (or 100% height), and every other segment falls somewhere below that, relative to the peak. It ensures that whether a video has a thousand views or a thousand million, the points’ value range from 0 to 1 and the graph always fits perfectly inside the viewport.</p><figure><figcaption><small><em>Canvas 4: The normalized histogram.</em>By scaling everything relative to the peak, the graph remains perfectly contained within the viewport.</small></figcaption></figure><p>But there’s a catch. You can’t normalize if you have no data. When a video is fresh out of the oven and just published,  is zero. Trying to divide by zero is a great way to crash a server, so the feature sits dormant. This is the  phase. If you’ve ever rushed to watch a new upload from your favorite creator, you might have noticed the graph is missing. That’s not a glitch; it’s a waiting game. YouTube is silently listening, collecting that initial batch of viewer data to establish a baseline.</p><p>This raises an interesting question: do they keep listening forever? Does the server track every single micro-interaction for a video that’s five years old? The answer is almost certainly no, and for two very pragmatic reasons.</p><p>First, speed is everything. The internet has the attention span of a goldfish. If a video goes viral, the “most replayed” graph needs to be available  the video is trending, not three weeks later when everyone has moved on. If the system waited for a “perfect” dataset, the moment would be lost. They need to calculate the graph quickly so users can see it before the hype dies down.</p><p>Second, we don’t need perfection; we need patterns. This isn’t a bank transaction where every decimal point matters. We are just trying to visualize relative popularity. This leads us to the concept of . Once a video hits a certain threshold of views, say ten thousand, the distribution of the graph likely stabilizes. The shape of the curve won’t change drastically whether you survey ten thousand people or a billion. So, why pay the computational cost to track the next billion? By sampling a subset of viewers, YouTube can generate an accurate-enough graph without melting their data centers.</p><p>However, even with sampling, my current design was write-heavy. I am focusing purely on the computational model here for brevity. The architecture of storage and the network model are deep dives for another day. But at the most basic level, the model relies on a counter of some sort. In my initial frequency array model, if a user watches a video from start to finish, and that video is divided into 100 segments, then 100 separate counters are incremented. Now, consider the scale: users upload more than 500 hours of content to YouTube every single minute. Updating every individual segment count of every video for every viewer during that crucial “Cold Start” phase would result in a write load so heavy that it would consume a massive amount of compute and memory.</p><h3>Optimization from First Principles</h3><p>The solution lies in realizing that we don’t actually care about the middle of a continuous viewing session. If I watch a video from segment 1 to segment 5, the only “new” information is where I started and where I stopped. The segments in between (2 through 4) are just implicitly included.</p><p>This reminded me of a beautiful algorithmic trick from competitive programming:  (or ) technique, which allows us to utilize .</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"c\"></code></pre></div><p>Here is how it works. Instead of incrementing the count for every segment from 1 to 5, we only perform two operations. First, we go to the starting segment (index 1) and increment 1. This marks the beginning of a view. Then, we go to the segment immediately after the user stopped watching (index 6) and decrement 1. This marks the drop-off point.</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"c\"></code></pre></div><p>Even if the user skips around, watching 0-5, skipping to 8, then watching till end, we just treat those as separate sessions. We increment index 0, decrement index 6. Then increment index 8, and decrement index 10. The areas they skipped remain untouched.</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"c\"></code></pre></div><figure><figcaption><small><em>Canvas 5: The Difference Array technique.</em>Notice how we only perform two operations: incrementing the start and decrementing the next element from where we skipped. The one extra \"blank\" segment at the very end is to safely catch that final decrement without throwing an \"index out of bounds\" error.</small></figcaption></figure><p>Concurrently, there might be a thousand other users incrementing and decrementing the array. Do we need to worry about integer overflow and underflow? Remember, we are only sampling a small subset of viewers, so it’s a no.</p><p>The mere mention of “integer overflow” in the context of YouTube unlocks a core memory for me. I remember being a kid when the news broke that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Psy's \"Gangnam Style\"</a> had “broken” YouTube. At the time, I thought it was just a metaphor for its explosive popularity. It wasn’t until years later, after trading childhood wonder for computer science textbooks, that I realized the breakage was literal: the video’s view count had smashed through the ceiling of a </p><p>It’s a strange thought: if I hadn’t pursued this path of software engineering (though, looking back at the kid who lived on his computer, that was probably inevitable), I might still be walking around thinking “Gangnam Style” just partied too hard for the servers to handle.</p><blockquote><p>: It turns out I fell for a bit of tech folklore! <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46642406\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">As pointed out by plastic041 on Hacker News</a>, this “integer overflow” was actually a joke by YouTube. The original conversation happened on Google+ (which explains why the primary source is dead). You can read the full debunking on <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/gangnam-style-busts-youtubes-view-counter-not-so-fast/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CNET</a>.</p></blockquote><p>Memories aside, we still need to turn this difference array back into actual view counts. This is where the “Prefix Sum” comes in. We run a pass through the array where each number is the sum of itself and all the numbers before it.</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"c\"></code></pre></div><p>We perform this calculation just once, right before the normalization step. We effectively traded billions of write operations for a single, cheap read-time calculation. It’s elegant, efficient, and exactly the kind of optimization that makes systems scalable.</p><p>Do the same steps in both  and , and run the above calculation on the ’s array. You will get the same result.</p><h2>Investigation: Tracing the Signal</h2><p>At this point I was happy with the implementation, but how close was I to the real thing? Well, for starters, mine didn’t have the bug, which meant I was still missing a critical piece of the puzzle.</p><p>My first instinct was to blame the classic enemy of precise computing: floating point errors. After all, normalization involves division, and we all know computers have a complicated relationship with decimals. I stared at the dips, trying to convince myself that this was just a rounding error, a ghost in the machine born from <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/588004/is-floating-point-math-broken\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">0.1 + 0.2 not equaling 0.3</a>. But the more I looked, the less it fit. A precision bug is usually chaotic, a messy scattering of noise across the entire dataset. It wouldn’t manifest as two perfect, symmetrical dips flanking the highest point while leaving the rest of the curve smooth. This wasn’t random; it felt structural. If it were a floating point issue, the artifacts would be everywhere, not just comfortably nesting next to the peak.</p><p>So, I decided to stop guessing and start looking. I fired up the browser’s developer tools. Right-click. Inspect. The holy grail of web debugging. I hovered over the heatmap, diving into the DOM tree, peeling back layer after layer of nested  containers until I finally hit the source. There it was: a single  element hiding inside the structure.</p><p>This discovery shifted the investigation. I was now looking at a  (SVG), but its origin was a mystery. Was this SVG pre-rendered on YouTube’s servers and sent over as a static asset? Or was the browser receiving a raw payload of data points (my hypothetical frequency array) and generating the curve locally using JavaScript?</p><p>I desperately hoped for the latter. If the SVG was fully baked on the server, my journey would end right here. I’d be staring at a locked black box, with no way to access the rendering code or the logic behind it. All that build-up, all the hypothetical Noogler hats and difference arrays, would be for nothing. But then I saw a glimmer of hope. The SVG path had a specific <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Values/ident\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CSS identifier</a>: . These are the handles that JavaScript grabs onto. If the server just wanted to display a static image, it wouldn’t necessarily need to tag the path with such a specific identifier unless the client code intended to find it and manipulate it.</p><p>This was my lead. If the code was generating or modifying that path on the fly, it had to reference that identifier. It was time to dive into the spaghetti bowl of modern web development: obfuscated code.</p><p>For the uninitiated, looking at production JavaScript is like trying to read a novel where every character’s name has been replaced with a single letter. Variable names like <code>calculateHeatmapDistribution</code> become , , or . This isn’t just to annoy curious developers; it’s about efficiency. Computers don’t care if a variable is named  or . They execute the logic just the same. But  takes up one byte, while the descriptive name takes nineteen. Multiply that by millions of lines of code and billions of requests, and you’re saving a massive amount of bandwidth. The result is a dense, impenetrable wall of text that is fast for the network but a nightmare for humans. But somewhere in that mess, I hoped to find my , since it was an identifier used in the HTML and can’t be obfuscated.</p><p>I jumped over to the sources tab and located the  file, a massive, minified behemoth that powers the YouTube player. With a mix of hope and trepidation, I hit  and ‘ed my magic string. To my surprise, the counter next to the search bar stopped at just two. That was manageable. Better than manageable; it was lucky.</p><p>The first occurrence landed me inside a large nested JavaScript object. As I parsed the structure, it started to look familiar. The keys in this object, such as , , and , perfectly matched the tags and attributes I had seen in the HTML. It was a blueprint. This code was defining the structure of the player’s UI components.</p><p>But something was missing. The most critical part of an SVG path is <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Attribute/d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the d attribute</a>, the string of commands and coordinates that actually tells the browser where to draw the lines. In the code in front of me, the  attribute was there, but it was initialized as an empty string. I tabbed back to the live DOM tree in the inspector. There, the  attribute was packed with a long, complex sequence of numbers and letters.</p><p>The discrepancy was the smoking gun. If the static code had an empty string, but the running application had a full path, it meant only one thing. The curve wasn’t being downloaded as a finished asset. It was being calculated, point by point, right here in the browser, and injected into the DOM dynamically. The logic I was looking for was close.</p><p>To find the logic, I needed another magic string. Since this logic involved calculating the SVG path, it surely must be relying on data from an API call. And since YouTube has public APIs, I turned to Google search once more, this time with <em>“youtube api for most replayed graph”</em> and found the <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72610552/most-replayed-data-of-youtube-video-via-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">exact question on Stack Overflow</a>. Thanks to the community responses, I found the string: .</p><p>The ease with which I found this answer sparked a worrying reflection on how the rise of LLMs is slowly eroding <a href=\"https://stackexchange.com/sites\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">platforms like Stack Overflow</a>. With LLMs, your questions stay with you, people can’t see them. Knowledge sharing, once a peer-to-peer village square, is becoming a private conversation with a centralized server.</p><p>And this centralization is bleeding into hardware too. We are seeing a shift where manufacturers are prioritizing the insatiable hunger of AI data centers over the needs of the individual user. The production lines that once churned out affordable components for gaming rigs and home labs are now retooling for enterprise-grade server racks. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024%E2%80%932026_global_memory_supply_shortage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">As RAM and SSD prices climb</a>, it feels like the personal computer is slowly becoming a luxury, a relic of an era where computing power belonged to the people, not just the cloud.</p><p>But that’s a problem for another day. Right now, I had a magic string. I tabbed back to the Network tab, my fingers moving on autopilot as I fired off a search across all network requests. Jackpot. The counter lit up with 101 occurrences. One was in&nbsp; file, but the other 100 were hiding inside a JSON response. This was the raw vein of data I had been digging for.</p><p>I expanded the response, and there it was, laid out in plain text: a list of objects, each containing a , a , and the magic string, . The values were floats between 0 and 1, just as I had theorized.</p><p>This confirmed everything. YouTube wasn’t sending a pre-drawn picture; they were sending the raw instructions. The server provided the normalized height for each segment, and the client-side JavaScript (presumably that logic I’d glimpsed in ) must be connecting the dots to draw the SVG path. I couldn’t help but feel a surge of satisfaction. My mental model of the system, constructed from scratch with nothing but intuition and a hypothetical ‘Noogler’ hat, was dead on. They were dividing the video into discrete segments and normalizing the view counts, exactly as I had predicted.</p><p>What intrigued me even more than the normalized scores were:  and the total count of these segments.</p><p>First, . It remained constant for every single segment. This felt redundant. Why send the duration if it’s the same for everyone? Is it future-proofing for a world where heatmaps have variable resolution, with finer detail in popular sections and broader strokes elsewhere? But it seemed like a tiny inefficiency, a few extra bytes of JSON that YouTube was paying for in network bandwidth.</p><p>Then there was the count. There were exactly 100 segments for this four-minute music video. Was this a universal constant? I clicked over to a  tutorial (obviously a clickbait). The response? 100 segments. I tried a <em>“ten-hour loop of lofi beats”</em>. Still 100. It didn’t matter, the heatmap was always sliced into exactly one hundred pieces.</p><p>Why 100? Was it the result of some deep statistical analysis on the distribution of video lengths across the platform, determining that 100 points provided the optimal balance between granularity and performance? Or was it simply because humans like round numbers and 100 felt “about right”? If you work at YouTube and know the answer, please let me know. I am genuinely curious.</p><p>Armed with one hundred normalized intensity scores, I decided to render an SVG myself to see how closely my raw recreation matched YouTube’s SVG. I plotted it using a simple SVG <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorials/SVG_from_scratch/Paths#line_commands\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">line command: \"Line To\"</a>. The result was sharp, jagged, and aggressively pointy. It looked like a connect-the-dots drawing done by a ruler-wielding perfectionist. In contrast, the graph on the YouTube player was fluid, smooth, and liquid.</p><h2>Theory: The Geometry of Smoothness</h2><p>My spiky graph would have fit right in with the user interfaces of a decade ago, back when applications were defined by rigid corners and sharp edges. But the digital world has moved on. We are living in the era of the  effect.</p><p>This term comes from a psychological experiment where people are shown two shapes: one blobby and round, the other spiky and jagged. When asked which one is  and which is  almost everyone, across all languages and cultures, agrees: the round one is Bouba, and the spiky one is  It turns out, we have a deep-seated bias towards the round and the soft.</p><p>This preference has reshaped our digital landscape, largely championed by Apple. Steve Jobs famously dragged his engineers around the block to point out that “<a href=\"https://folklore.org/Round_Rects_Are_Everywhere.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Round Rects Are Everywhere!</a>” forcing them to implement the shape into the original Mac’s OS. Today, that influence is inescapable. Look at Windows 11, Google’s Material You, the tabs in your browser, or the icon of the app you’re using right now. The sharp corners have been sanded down. In fact, there is even a new CSS property called .</p><p>It is not just an aesthetic trend; it is a psychological one. Sharp corners signal danger to our primitive brains (think thorns, teeth, or jagged rocks). They say “ouch.” Round corners, on the other hand, signal safety. They feel friendly, approachable, and organic. They are softer on the eyes, reducing cognitive load because our gaze doesn’t have to come to an abrupt halt at every vertex. By smoothing out the edges, designers aren’t just making things look modern; they are making technology feel a little less like a machine and a little more human.</p><p>Driven by this universal preference for organic shapes, I needed to understand the mathematics behind YouTube’s implementation. Was it a ? Real-world data is inherently noisy, and a moving average is the standard tool for smoothing it out. By sliding a “window” across the dataset and averaging the points within it (say, three at a time), it irons out the wrinkles. Instead of a single, erratic value, you get the consensus of the neighborhood.</p><p>I decided to test this theory. I applied a moving average to my jagged plot, hoping to see the familiar YouTube curve emerge. It certainly helped sand down the sharpest peaks, making the graph look less like a mountain range and more like rolling hills. But it created a critical problem. The distinctive dips flanking the main peak (the very artifacts I was trying to replicate) were nowhere to be found. They weren’t in the raw data, and the moving average certainly didn’t create them; if anything, it would have smoothed them out if they were there. My plot was now smooth, but it was featureless. It looked like a low-resolution approximation, missing the specific character of the real thing. Clearly, a simple moving average wasn’t the answer.</p><h3>From Discrete to Continuous</h3><p>So I decided to check the path of the YouTube SVG itself. My recreation relied on the  (). It draws a straight, uncompromising line from point A to point B. Simple, efficient, but undeniably jagged. YouTube, however, wasn’t using lines. Their path was packed with  (). It became clear that the secret wasn’t in the data values themselves, but in how they were connected. I decided to pause the investigation and familiarize myself with the mathematics of curves.</p><p>To understand , I had to start at , or  The equation for a basic line between two points \\(P_0\\) and \\(P_1\\) is:</p>$$P(t) = \\text{Lerp}(P_0, P_1, t) = (1-t)P_0 + tP_1$$<p>Here, \\(t\\) acts as a slider ranging from 0 to 1. At \\(t=0\\), we are at the start point \\(P_0\\). At \\(t=1\\), we arrive at the end point \\(P_1\\).</p><figure><figcaption><small>A simple line connecting two points using the above equation. (You are going to have to settle for a video from here on out because  does a better job than I ever could with an HTML canvas.) Check out the <a href=\"https://www.desmos.com/calculator/3eipb5lodk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">interactive graph on Desmos</a>.</small></figcaption></figure><p>To get a curve, we extend this concept using the . Imagine you have three points: a start \\(P_0\\), an end \\(P_2\\), and a  \\(P_1\\) hovering in between. The math essentially  by nesting the equations. First, we calculate two moving intermediate points to create a sliding segment:</p>$$Q_0 = \\text{Lerp}(P_0, P_1, t) = (1-t)P_0 + tP_1$$$$Q_1 = \\text{Lerp}(P_1, P_2, t) = (1-t)P_1 + tP_2$$<p>Then, we interpolate between those two moving points to find our final position:</p>$$P(t) = \\text{Lerp}(Q_0, Q_1, t) = (1-t)Q_0 + tQ_1$$<p>When you expand this algebra, you get the quadratic formula:</p>$$P(t) = (1-t)^2P_0 + 2(1-t)tP_1 + t^2P_2$$<p>The result is a smooth curve that starts at \\(P_0\\) and travels towards \\(P_2\\), but is magnetically pulled towards \\(P_1\\) without ever touching it.</p><figure><figcaption><small>A quadratic Bézier curve. Notice how since it has only one control point, it can only bend in one direction. <a href=\"https://www.desmos.com/calculator/rnnc9nmfuc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">[Desmos]</a></small></figcaption></figure><p>However, because  relies on a single control point, it lacks the flexibility to create “S” curves or inflections; it can only bend in one direction. For “S” curves we need two control points. Which brings us to the . This adds a second control point, giving us four points total: Start (\\(P_0\\)), Control 1 (\\(P_1\\)), Control 2 (\\(P_2\\)), and End (\\(P_3\\)). We just add another layer of depth to the recursion.</p><p>First layer (edges of the hull):</p>$$Q_0 = \\text{Lerp}(P_0, P_1, t)$$$$Q_1 = \\text{Lerp}(P_1, P_2, t)$$$$Q_2 = \\text{Lerp}(P_2, P_3, t)$$<p>Second layer (connecting the moving points):</p>$$R_0 = \\text{Lerp}(Q_0, Q_1, t)$$$$R_1 = \\text{Lerp}(Q_1, Q_2, t)$$<p>Final layer (the curve itself):</p>$$P(t) = \\text{Lerp}(R_0, R_1, t)$$<p>Substituting everything back in gives the elegant cubic formula:</p>$$P(t) =\\\\(1-t)^3P_0 + 3(1-t)^2tP_1 + 3(1-t)t^2P_2 + t^3P_3$$<p>As \\(t\\) moves from 0 to 1, these equations trace a perfect parabolic arc. This is precisely how the browser renders those smooth, organic shapes, calculating positions pixel by pixel to create the visual comfort we expect.</p><figure><figcaption><small>A cubic Bézier curve. Notice how it can bend in two directions and form “S” curves easily. <a href=\"https://www.desmos.com/calculator/fbwrcoalbv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">[Desmos]</a></small></figcaption></figure><p>It is worth noting that this logic does not have to stop at four points. You can theoretically have Bézier curves with five, ten, or a hundred control points, creating increasingly intricate shapes with a single mathematical definition. However, there is a catch. As you add more points, the computational cost skyrockets. Solving high-degree polynomials for every frame of an animation or every resize event is expensive. That is why modern graphics systems usually stick to cubic curves. If you need a more complex shape, it is far more efficient to chain multiple cubic segments together than to crunch the numbers for a single, massive high-order curve.</p><figure><figcaption><small>A visualization of a 10-point Bézier spline in action. <a href=\"https://www.desmos.com/calculator/axqwsoy6ud\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">[Desmos]</a></small></figcaption></figure><h3>The Invisible Scaffolding</h3><p>This specific bit of math isn’t unique to YouTube’s video player. It is the invisible scaffolding of the entire digital visual world. If you have ever used the Pen Tool in Photoshop, Illustrator, or Figma (or their respective open-source alternatives, Gimp, Inkscape and Penpot), you have directly manipulated these equations. When you pull those little handles to adjust a curve, you are literally moving the control points (\\(P_1\\) and \\(P_2\\)) in the formula above, redefining the gravitational field that shapes the line. But you don’t have to be a designer to interact with them. In fact, you are looking at them right now. The fonts rendering these very words are nothing more than collections of Bézier curves. Your computer doesn’t store a pixelated image of the letter ‘a’; it stores the mathematical instructions (the start points, end points, and control points) needed to draw it perfectly at any size. From the smooth hood of a modeled car in a video game to the vector logo on your credit card, Bézier curves are the unsung heroes that rounded off the sharp edges of the digital age.</p><p>This sequence of connected curves is known as a . YouTube isn’t drawing one massive, complex curve; they are stitching together a hundered smaller cubic curves to form a continuous shape. In fact, my own jagged implementation was a spline too: a . I merely stitched together hundered straight lines.</p><p>However, creating a spline introduces a new challenge: Smoothness. If you just glue two random curves together at a point (known as a “knot point”), you get a sharp corner (a “kiki” joint in our “bouba” graph). To make the transition seamless (technically known as \\(C^1\\) continuity), the join has to be perfect. The tangent of the curve ending at the connection point must match the tangent of the curve starting there. Visually, this means the second control point of the previous curve, the shared knot point, and the first control point of the next curve must all lie on the exact same straight line. It’s a balancing act. If one handle is off by a single pixel, the illusion of fluidity breaks.</p><figure><figcaption><small>Here, there are two curves joined at a knot point. Initially, the knot point is not smooth as the three points (the two control points and the knot point) do not lie on the same straight line. But as the animation progresses, the points become , creating a smooth transition. <a href=\"https://www.desmos.com/calculator/aakwp6eabv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">[Desmos]</a></small></figcaption></figure><p>I attempted to update my script to use this curve command, replacing the simple lines. However, I immediately hit a wall. While the line command is straightforward (requiring only a destination), the curve command is demanding. It requires two invisible ‘magnets’ (the control points  and ) for every single segment.</p><p>The  command functions as a precise geometric instruction, telling the renderer exactly how to shape the curve. The syntax is deceptively simple: . Where&nbsp; and &nbsp;are the control points and&nbsp;&nbsp;is where the curve ends. You might ask: where is the starting point? In SVG paths, it is implicit, the curve begins wherever the previous command ended. For instance, YouTube’s path starts with  (Move to start), immediately followed by a curve definition <code>C 1.0,89.5 2.0,49.9 5.0,47.4</code> which ends at  becoming the starting point for the next command <code>C 8.0,44.9 11.0,79.0 15.0,87.5</code> and so on.</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"html\"></code></pre></div><h2>Resolution: The Invisible Hand</h2><p>These points didn’t appear out of thin air, and they certainly weren’t in the JSON response, which only provided the raw heights. They had to be calculated locally. Somewhere in the client-side code, there was a mathematical recipe converting those raw intensity scores into elegant \\(C^1\\) continuous curve data. This sent me back to the single occurrence of&nbsp;&nbsp;spotted earlier in&nbsp;.</p><blockquote><p> The screenshots below are from the raw, obfuscated source. They are included here only to show the steps I took during the investigation. Don’t try to make sense of them or you might get confused! Feel free to skim past them; I have provided a clean, de-obfuscated version later in the text that explains the logic clearly.</p></blockquote><p>The occurrence led me directly to an interesting function, .</p><p>This function appeared to be building an intermediate array, preparing the data for the final drawing step. Analyzing the code, I could see it was mapping the normalized intensity scores (which range from 0 to 1) onto a coordinate system suitable for the SVG. Similar to what I did in my Linear Spline script.</p><p>Specifically, it was transforming the data to fit a 1000x100 pixel canvas. The  line calculates the width of each segment (1000 divided by 100 segments equals 10 pixels per segment). The loop then iterates through the data points, calculating the x coordinate () and the y coordinate ().</p><p>Crucially, it handles the coordinate system flip. In standard coordinate geometry we learn in school,  is at the bottom and values increase as you go up. In computer graphics (and SVGs), however, the origin  is at the top-left corner. This convention is a historical artifact from the days of  (CRT) monitors. On those old, bulky screens, an electron beam would physically scan across the phosphor surface, starting from the top-left, drawing a line to the right, snapping back (horizontal retrace), and moving down to draw the next line. If you are old enough, you might remember seeing this flickering motion on screens with low refresh rates. Modern LCDs and OLEDs don’t have electron beams, but the software coordinate system stuck. So, to draw a “high” peak on a graph, you actually need a small y-coordinate (closer to the top). The code accounts for this with , inverting the values so that a higher intensity score results in a smaller y value (pushing the point “up” towards the top of the container). It also prepends a starting point at  (bottom-left) and appends a closing point at  (bottom-right), a detail whose importance will become clear shortly.</p><p>This function () was clearly just the preparation step. It was normalizing the data into pixel space, but it wasn’t drawing anything yet. It had to be invoked somewhere. In a proper IDE, I would just hit  to jump to usage. But browser DevTools aren’t quite there yet for this kind of reverse engineering. So, I resorted to the old-school method: a text search for “”. Note the opening parenthesis; that’s the trick to find calls rather than definitions.</p><p>This search led me to a function named :</p><p>Bulls-eye. There it was, plain as day:  (inside the red box). This line confirmed that  (the result of ) was indeed the path string being injected into the SVG.</p><p>The transformed list from  was being stored in  and then passed straight into another function: . To find its definition, I relied on a common pattern in minified JavaScript: functions are typically declared anonymously and assigned to a variable. Debugging obfuscated code becomes much easier when you know these patterns. I simply searched for “” and found the heart of the operation:</p><p>This was it. The smoking gun. I could see the string construction happening in real-time. The code iterates through the points, and for every segment, it appends a  command string. But look closely at the arguments for that command. The end point ( or ) was already known. But the variables  and  (representing the two control points) were being calculated on the fly by a helper function: .</p><p>The control points weren’t just appearing; they were being dynamically generated based on the position of the current point and its neighbors. The logic didn’t stop there. I chased  down the rabbit hole.</p><p>This snippet finally revealed the math.  was creating a new object  (which I found to be a simple Vector class storing  and  differences) and then using  and  to offset the control points. The mysterious  multiplier suggested that the control points were being placed at 20% of the distance determined by the vector calculation.</p><h3>Deciphering the Blueprint</h3><p>After deciphering the minified code, I was able to reconstruct the logic in readable JavaScript.</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"js\"></code></pre></div><p>The reconstructed code reveals a fascinatingly simple geometric strategy. To determine the control point for a specific knot (let’s call it ), the algorithm doesn’t look at  in isolation. Instead, it looks at its neighbors. It draws an imaginary line connecting the previous point () directly to the next point (), completely skipping . The slope of this imaginary line becomes the tangent for the curve at . This specific method of curve generation is known as a .</p><figure><figcaption><small>A visualization of the cardinal spline algorithm in action. In the animation, the tangent scales down as it moves towards the knot point to 0.2 of its original length. <a href=\"https://www.desmos.com/calculator/xhkrvqshnq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">[Desmos]</a></small></figcaption></figure><p>By calculating the tangent at each knot point based on the positions of its neighbors, it ensures that the curve arrives at and departs from each point with the same velocity (tangent vector), guaranteeing that elusive \\(C^1\\) continuity I mentioned earlier.</p><p>Remember those extra points added at  and  that I mentioned earlier? Without them, the first and last segments of the video data would have no outer neighbors. By artificially adding them, the algorithm effectively tells the curve to start and end its journey with a smooth trajectory rising from the baseline, rather than starting abruptly in mid-air.</p><p>And what about that magic  number? That determines the tension of the curve. In the world of splines, this factor controls the length of the tangent vectors. If this value were , we would be looking at a standard <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catmull%E2%80%93Rom_spline\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Catmull-Rom spline</a>, often used in animation for its loose, fluid movement. However, a value of  would collapse the control points onto the anchors, reverting the shape back to a sharp, jagged linear spline.</p><p>And there it was. The answer to the mystery of the dips. It wasn’t a rounding error, a data glitch, or a server-side anomaly. It was the math itself. Specifically, the requirement for continuity. When a data point spikes significantly higher than its neighbors, the <em>Cardinal Spline algorithm</em> calculates a steep tangent to shoot up to that peak. To maintain that velocity and direction smoothly as it passes through the neighboring points, the curve is forced to swing wide (dipping below the baseline) before rocketing upwards. It’s the visual equivalent of a crouch before a jump. The dips weren’t bugs; they were the inevitable artifacts of forcing rigid, discrete data into a smooth, organic flow.</p><figure><figcaption><small>Notice how the dips flatten out as the peak lowers. <a href=\"https://www.desmos.com/calculator/xhkrvqshnq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">[Desmos]</a></small></figcaption></figure><p>I started pulling on this loose thread on a quiet afternoon, simply wondering about a song from . By nightfall, I had followed the thread to its end, tracing the logic from pixel to polynomial. Documenting it, however, was a marathon that spanned many weeks of focused work.</p><p>This project wasn’t just a random curiosity; it was about the joy of digging until I hit the bedrock of logic. It forced me to bridge concepts from disparate domains (frontend engineering, competitive programming, geometry, and design history) and to think deeply about the performance implications of every calculation. I am grateful to live in an era where curiosity can be so readily shared with the world.</p><p>Having made it this far (through over 7,000 words), you have my wholehearted thanks for lending me your time.

      "content": "<p>Hi, we're Sergey and Serafim. We've been building dev tools at 21st.dev and recently open-sourced 1Code (<a href=\"https://1code.dev\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://1code.dev</a>), a local UI for Claude Code.</p><p>Claude Code has been our go-to for 4 months. When Opus 4.5 dropped, parallel agents stopped needing so much babysitting. We started trusting it with more: building features end to end, adding tests, refactors. Stuff you'd normally hand off to a developer. We started running 3-4 at once. Then the CLI became annoying: too many terminals, hard to track what's where, diffs scattered everywhere.</p><p>So we built 1Code.dev, an app to run your Claude Code agents in parallel that works on Mac and Web. On Mac: run locally, with or without worktrees. On Web: run in remote sandboxes with live previews of your app, mobile included, so you can check on agents from anywhere.\nRunning multiple Claude Codes in parallel dramatically sped up how we build features.</p><p>What’s next: Bug bot for identifying issues based on your changes; QA Agent, that checks that new features don't break anything; Adding OpenCode, Codex, other models and coding agents. \nAPI for starting Claude Codes in remote sandboxes.</p><p>Try it out! We're open-source, so you can just bun build it.\nIf you want something hosted, Pro ($20/mo) gives you web with live browser previews hosted on remote sandboxes. We’re also working on API access for running Claude Code sessions programmatically.</p><p>We'd love to hear your feedback!</p>",

      "content": "Hi HN,<p>Maintaining a complex infrastructure stack for web browsing is one of the biggest bottlenecks in building reliable agents. You start with a simple fetch, but quickly end up managing a complex stack of proxies, handling client-side hydration, and debugging brittle selectors. and writing custom parsing logic for every site.</p><p>Tabstack is an API that abstracts that infrastructure. You send a URL and an intent; we handle the rendering and return clean, structured data for the LLM.</p><p>How it works under the hood:</p><p>- Escalation Logic: We don't spin up a full browser instance for every request (which is slow and expensive). We attempt lightweight fetches first, escalating to full browser automation only when the site requires JS execution/hydration.</p><p>- Token Optimization: Raw HTML is noisy and burns context window tokens. We process the DOM to strip non-content elements and return a markdown-friendly structure that is optimized for LLM consumption.</p><p>- Infrastructure Stability: Scaling headless browsers is notoriously hard (zombie processes, memory leaks, crashing instances). We manage the fleet lifecycle and orchestration so you can run thousands of concurrent requests without maintaining the underlying grid.</p><p>On Ethics: Since we are backed by Mozilla, we are strict about how this interacts with the open web.</p><p>- We respect robots.txt rules.</p><p>- We identify our User Agent.</p><p>- We do not use requests/content to train models.</p><p>- Data is ephemeral and discarded after the task.</p><p>The linked post goes into more detail on the infrastructure and why we think browsing needs to be a distinct layer in the AI stack.</p><p>This is obviously a very new space and we're all learning together. There are plenty of known unknowns (and likely even more unknown unknowns) when it comes to agentic browsing, so we’d genuinely appreciate your feedback, questions, and tips.</p><p>Happy to answer questions about the stack, our architecture, or the challenges of building browser infrastructure.</p>",

Just drop a link in the comments.  Please let me know if you do not want your website to be included in the directory.<p>Also, I intend this to be a community maintained resource, so if you would like to join the GitHub project as a maintainer, please let me know either here or via the IRC link in the README.<p>By the way, see also 'Ask HN: Could you share your personal blog here?' - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36575081 - July 2023 - (1014 points, 1940 comments).  In this post, the scope is not restricted to blogs though.  Any personal website is welcome, whether it is a blog, digital garden, personal wiki or something else entirely.<p>UPDATE: It is going to take a while to go through all the submissions and add them.

I needed it to persist cookies across sessions (to handle SSO) and then scrape a Kanban board.</p><p>Existing AI browser tools (like current MCP implementations) often force unsolicited data into the context window—dumping the full accessibility tree, console logs, and network errors whether you asked for them or not.</p><p>webctl is an attempt to solve this with a Unix-style CLI:</p><p>- Filter before context: You pipe the output to standard tools. webctl snapshot --interactive-only | head -n 20 means the LLM only sees exactly what I want it to see.</p><p>- Daemon Architecture: It runs a persistent background process. The goal is to keep the browser state (cookies/session) alive while you run discrete, stateless CLI commands.</p><p>- Semantic targeting: It uses ARIA roles (e.g., role=button name~=\"Submit\") rather than fragile CSS selectors.</p><p>Disclaimer: The daemon logic for state persistence is still a bit experimental, but the architecture feels like the right direction for building local, token-efficient agents.</p><p>It’s basically \"Playwright for the terminal.\"</p>",

(models don’t run locally yet, but both opencode and openwork are built with that future in mind.)\n- hyper extensible: skills are installable modules via a skill/package manager, using the native opencode plugin ecosystem.\n- non-technical by default: plans, progress, permissions, and artifacts are surfaced in the ui, not buried in logs.</p><p>you can already try it:\n- there’s an unsigned dmg\n- or you can clone the repo, install deps, and if you already have opencode running it should work right away</p><p>it’s very alpha, lots of rough edges. i’d love feedback on what feels the roughest or most confusing.</p><p>happy to answer questions.</p>",

      "content": "\n<p>Reddit's API is effectively dead for archival. Third-party apps are gone. Reddit has threatened to cut off access to the Pushshift dataset multiple times. But 3.28TB of Reddit history exists as a torrent right now, and I built a tool to turn it into something you can browse on your own hardware.<p>The key point: This doesn't touch Reddit's servers. Ever. Download the Pushshift dataset, run my tool locally, get a fully browsable archive. Works on an air-gapped machine. Works on a Raspberry Pi serving your LAN. Works on a USB drive you hand to someone.<p>What it does: Takes compressed data dumps from Reddit (.zst), Voat (SQL), and Ruqqus (.7z) and generates static HTML. No JavaScript, no external requests, no tracking. Open index.html and browse. Want search? Run the optional Docker stack with PostgreSQL – still entirely on your machine.<p>API & AI Integration: Full REST API with 30+ endpoints – posts, comments, users, subreddits, full-text search, aggregations. Also ships with an MCP server (29 tools) so you can query your archive directly from AI tools.<p>Self-hosting options:\n - USB drive / local folder (just open the HTML files)\n - Home server on your LAN\n - Tor hidden service (2 commands, no port forwarding needed)\n - VPS with HTTPS\n - GitHub Pages for small archives<p>Why this matters: Once you have the data, you own it. No API keys, no rate limits, no ToS changes can take it away.<p>Scale: Tens of millions of posts per instance. PostgreSQL backend keeps memory constant regardless of dataset size. For the full 2.38B post dataset, run multiple instances by topic.<p>How I built it: Python, PostgreSQL, Jinja2 templates, Docker. Used Claude Code throughout as an experiment in AI-assisted development. Learned that the workflow is \"trust but verify\" – it accelerates the boring parts but you still own the architecture.<p>Live demo: <a href=\"https://online-archives.github.io/redd-archiver-example/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://online-archives.github.io/redd-archiver-example/</a><p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/19-84/redd-archiver\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/19-84/redd-archiver</a> (Public Domain)<p>Pushshift torrent: <a href=\"https://academictorrents.com/details/1614740ac8c94505e4ecb9d88be8bed7b6afddd4\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://academictorrents.com/details/1614740ac8c94505e4ecb9d...</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46602324\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46602324</a></p>\n<p>Points: 285</p>\n<p># Comments: 63</p>\n",

I wanted something native to the Python tools I already use.<p>The Solution: SnackBase is a self-hosted Python (FastAPI + SQLAlchemy) backend that includes:<p>Compliance Core: Immutable audit logs with blockchain-style hashing (prev_hash) for integrity.<p>Native Python Hooks: You can write business logic in pure Python (no webhooks or JS runtimes required).<p>Clean Architecture: Strict separation of layers. No business logic in the API routes.<p>The Stack:<p>Python 3.12 + FastAPI<p>SQLAlchemy 2.0 (Async)<p>React 19 (Admin UI)<p>Links:<p>Live Demo: <a href=\"https://demo.snackbase.dev\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://demo.snackbase.dev</a><p>Repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/lalitgehani/snackbase\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/lalitgehani/snackbase</a><p>The demo resets every hour.

      "content": "\n<p>I’ve been building and selling software since the early 2000s, starting with classic shareware. In 2011, I moved into the App Store world and built an iOS budget app because I needed a simple way to track my own expenses.<p>At the time, my plan was to replace a few larger shareware projects with several smaller apps to spread the risk. That didn’t quite work out — one app, MoneyControl, quickly grew so much that it became my main focus.<p>Fifteen years later, the app is still on the App Store, still actively developed, and still used by people who started with version 1.0. Many apps from that era are long gone.<p>Looking back, these are some of the things that mattered most:<p>Starting early helped, but wasn’t enough on its own.\nEarly visibility made a difference, but long-term maintenance and reliability are what kept users.<p>Focus beat diversification.\nI wanted many small apps. I ended up with one large, long-lived product. Deep focus turned out to be more sustainable.<p>Long-term maintenance is most of the work.\nAdapting to new iOS versions, migrating data safely, handling edge cases, and keeping old data usable mattered more than flashy features.<p>Discoverability keeps getting harder.\nReaching users on the App Store today is much more difficult than it was years ago. Prices are higher than in the old 99-cent days, but visibility hasn’t improved.<p>I’m a developer first, not a marketer.\nI work alone, with occasional help from freelancers. No employees, no growth team. The app could probably have grown more with better marketing, but that was never my strength.<p>You don’t need to get rich to build something sustainable.\nI didn’t build this for an exit. I’ve been able to make a living from my work for over 20 years, which feels like success to me.<p>Building things you actually use keeps you honest.\nEvery product I built was something I personally needed. That authenticity mattered more than any roadmap.<p>This week I released version 10 with a new design and a major technical overhaul. It feels less like a milestone and more like preparing the app for the next phase.<p>Happy to answer questions about long-term app maintenance, indie development, or keeping a product alive across many iOS generations.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46599341\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46599341</a></p>\n<p>Points: 159</p>\n<p># Comments: 59</p>\n",

We’re Will and Jorge, and we’ve built LAD (Language-Aided Design), a SolidWorks add-in that uses LLMs to create sketches, features, assemblies, and macros from conversational inputs (<a href=\"https://www.trylad.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.trylad.com/</a>).<p>We come from software engineering backgrounds where tools like Claude Code and Cursor have come to dominate, but when poking around CAD systems a few months back we realized there's no way to go from a text prompt input to a modeling output in any of the major CAD systems. In our testing, the LLMs aren't as good at making 3D objects as they are are writing code, but we think they'll get a lot better in the upcoming months and years.<p>To bridge this gap, we've created LAD, an add-in in SolidWorks to turn conversational input and uploaded documents/images into parts, assemblies, and macros. It includes:<p>- Dozens of tools the LLM can call to create sketches, features, and other objects in parts.<p>- Assembly tools the LLM can call to turn parts into assemblies.<p>- File system tools the LLM can use to create, save, search, and read SolidWorks files and documentation.<p>- Macro writing/running tools plus a SolidWorks API documentation search so the LLM can use macros.<p>- Automatic screenshots and feature tree parsing to provide the LLM context on the current state.<p>- Checkpointing to roll back unwanted edits and permissioning to determine which commands wait for user permission.<p>You can try LAD at <a href=\"https://www.trylad.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.trylad.com/</a> and let us know what features would make it more useful for your work. To be honest, the LLMs aren't great at CAD right now, but we're mostly curious to hear if people would want and use this if it worked well.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46591100\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46591100</a></p>\n<p>Points: 190</p>\n<p># Comments: 106</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>Hi! I’m Nathan: an ML Engineer at Mozilla.ai: I built agent-of-empires (aoe): a CLI application to help you manage all of your running Claude Code/Opencode sessions and know when they are waiting for you.<p>- Written in rust and relies on tmux for security and reliability\n- Monitors state of cli sessions to tell you when an agent is running vs idle vs waiting for your input\n- Manage sessions by naming them, grouping them, configuring profiles for various settings<p>I'm passionate about getting self-hosted open-weight LLMs to be valid options to compete with proprietary closed models. One roadblock for me is that although tools like opencode allow you to connect to Local LLMs (Ollama, lm studio, etc), they generally run muuuuuch slower than models hosted by Anthropic and OpenAI. I would start a coding agent on a task, but then while I was sitting waiting for that task to complete, I would start opening new terminal windows to start multitasking. Pretty soon, I was spending a lot of time toggling between terminal windows to see which one needed me: like help in adding a clarification, approving a new command, or giving it a new task.<p>That’s why I build agent-of-empires (“aoe”). With aoe, I can launch a bunch of opencode and Claude Code sessions and quickly see their status or toggle between them, which helps me avoid having a lot of terminal windows open, or having to manually attach and detach from tmux sessions myself. It’s helping me give local LLMs a fair try, because them being slower is now much less of a bottleneck.<p>You can give it an install with<p>curl -fsSL <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njbrake/agent-of-empires/main/scripts/install.sh\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njbrake/agent-of-empires/m...</a>  | bash<p>Or brew install njbrake/aoe/aoe<p>And then launch by simply entering the command `aoe`.<p>I’m interested in what you think as well as what features you think would be useful to add!<p>I am planning to add some further features around sandboxing (with docker) as well as support for intuitive git worktrees and am curious if there are any opinions about what should or shouldn’t be in it.<p>I decided against MCP management or generic terminal usage, to help keep the tool focused on parts of agentic coding that I haven’t found a usable solution for.<p>I hit the character limit on this post which prevented me from including a view of the output, but the readme on the github link has a screenshot showing what it looks like.<p>Thanks!</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46588905\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46588905</a></p>\n<p>Points: 117</p>\n<p># Comments: 44</p>\n",
