      "content": "<p><em>The PowerPC adventure—by far the most exotic release of OS/2</em></p><p>In December 1995, after unexpectedly long development (but is that really unexpected?), IBM finally “shipped”&nbsp;OS/2 Warp, PowerPC edition. For brevity, this release will be further referred to as OS/2 PPC. Following years of hype and high expectation, the release was very low key and in fact marked the end of development of OS/2 for PowerPC. The product was only available to a limited number of IBM customers and was never actively marketed. OS/2 PPC may not even had a box, although there were nice looking official CDs.</p><p>OS/2 PPC only supported an extremely limited range of hardware—IBM Personal Power Series machines. Those were desktop models 830 and 850, and OS/2 PPC probably also supported the Power Series ThinkPads 820 and 850, though that can be only inferred from the fact that the graphics chipset employed by these ThinkPads was on the very short list of supported devices in OS/2 PPC.</p><p>The IBM Power Series computers were IBM’s rather short lived foray into the PowerPC-based desktop personal computer market, circa 1995-1996. The PowerPC CPU aside, the systems were very similar to Intel based hardware of that era. They were designed around the PCI bus, but also included ISA expansion slots and on-board Crystal Audio ISA PnP chips. The desktop Power Series machines were IDE based, ThinkPads used SCSI disks. The computers had standard serial and parallel ports, as well as most of typical PC hardware such as interrupt and DMA controllers. The desktops had onboard S3 864 video, ThinkPads used Western Digital flat panel chipsets. Several optional graphics cards were supported, notably Weitek P9100 based accelerators. The desktops also had onboard Ethernet chips (AMD PCnet).</p><p>The Power Series systems were closely related to certain IBM RS/6000 workstations. The RS/6000 Model 43P-7248 was nearly identical to the Power Series 850. They used the same motherboard, only the RS/6000 had on-board SCSI controller. Unlike the RS/6000 systems intended for the workstation market and running almost exclusively IBM’s AIX operating system, the Power Series systems were designed for “regular”&nbsp;personal computer users. The machines were supposed to run OS/2, Windows NT, AIX, or Solaris. OS/2 PPC was only semi-finished, and the Solaris for PowerPC port (version 2.5.1) was similarly short-lived.&nbsp;Microsoft dropped PowerPC support in 1996, not long after the Windows NT 4.0 release. Most of the Power Series systems ended up running AIX, which supported them until version 5.1. Linux also supported the Power Series to some extent. Windows NT was clearly the closest competitor of OS/2 PPC.</p><p>For this article, OS/2 PPC was installed on a Power Series 830, installed by its previous owner in a RS/6000 43P case. The CPU was a 100MHz PowerPC 604 with 256KB L2 cache, and the machine was equipped with 192MB RAM, which was the maximum it could handle. The graphics was an on-board PCI S3 Vision 864 with 2MB video memory and true color S3 SDAC. The machine was equipped with 2.1GB IDE hard drive—AIX can handle up to 8GB and Linux can utilize even larger disks, but OS/2 and NT were not happy with anything over about 2.5GB. The 830 was originally sold with either 500MB or 1GB disks and 16MB RAM. The Power Series 850 systems were equipped with 100 or 120MHz CPUs, slightly more RAM and larger disks.</p><p>OS/2 Warp, PowerPC edition was delivered on two CDs. The first CD contained the operating system and BonusPak, the second CD was an application sampler with several demo applications.</p><p>Installation was surprisingly easy and painless. The CD was bootable and there were almost no choices to make during installation—only the disk partitioning was user selectable. The PowerPC operating systems (OS/2, NT, AIX and Linux) generally did not coexist as there was no real equivalent of a boot manager and each OS wanted to install its own boot loader. The OS/2 installer re-partitioned the disk and overwrote any other operating systems. The boot partition had to be FAT. It was possible to create HPFS data partitions, but the HPFS support appeared to be somewhat unstable and likely a last-minute addition.</p><p>After the OS was copied from the installation CD-ROM and the system booted from fixed disk for the first time, the user was greeted by the following screen:</p><p>Indeed, OS/2 PPC really looked just like OS/2 Warp, at least at first glance. The system booted up in 640×480 mode with 256 colors, using the accelerated S3 driver. The desktop right after installation looked like this:</p><p>Still very much like OS/2 Warp, except for that little Systems Management folder. This feature was not present in the Intel OS/2 Warp release, although it was added later. After installing the BonusPak and a few other additions and changing the resolution, the desktop still looked like plain OS/2 Warp, with the exception of the background bitmap of course (click on the picture to see full size screenshot):</p><p>The system was now running in 1024×768 resolution, but still with 256 colors. The graphics chip supports 64K colors at this resolution, unfortunately the software used to take screenshots (a demo version of Impos/2) was unable to take any screenshots at this resolution. 256 colors it is then, and time to more closely examine the operating system. The README file is a good starting point, and it was quite long in OS/2 PPC. It consisted largely of a list of unimplemented or incomplete features.</p><p>For example, notice the word “Connect”&nbsp;in the screenshot. OS/2 Warp, PowerPC Edition, doesn’t have any connectivity to speak of. Networking support, in a nutshell, didn’t exist. No LAN Server client, no TCP/IP, nothing. There was just HyperAccess Lite and CompuServe Information Manager, which worked (in theory at least) over a modem. The product name itself seems to have been a last minute change. Programs and documentation in many instances refer to OS/2 Warp Connect, PowerPC Edition, but the final product was called just OS/2 Warp and not “Connect”. One of the README files explains the name change and alludes to networking support in “future versions”.</p><p>For development versions of OS/2 PPC there was TFTP support which talked directly to the microkernel Ethernet or Token Ring driver and entirely bypassed OS/2. This transport layer also supported remote debugging. This is in sharp contrast to Windows NT which fully supported networking (TCP/IP and SMB file sharing) on the same hardware. Networking was obviously planned for OS/2, but the project was killed before this part was done.</p><p>Not everything was so blatantly unfinished though. The DOS support in OS/2 PPC was a pleasant surprise:</p><p>On a closer look, it’s clear that OS/2 PPC included a full-fledged PC emulator, which supplied a virtual x86 CPU as well as common PC hardware. Interestingly, the DOS support in OS/2 PPC was based on PC-DOS 7 and not the outdated DOS 5 level code that OS/2 on Intel was stuck with. The OS/2 PPC DOS boxes thus had for instance the DOS E editor (very similar to TEDIT) or REXX support. Why IBM never updated the DOS support on the Intel side is a mystery. OS/2 PPC supported both windowed and full screen DOS sessions. The full screen sessions always ran in graphics mode, even when the emulated DOS application was using text mode.</p><p>Not satisfied with “just”&nbsp;DOS emulation, IBM also supported Win-OS/2, both full-screen and windowed:</p><p>It is difficult to judge how stable the DOS and Win-OS/2 emulation really was, but whatever little utilities came with the OS/2 system seemed to work well, including wave audio in Win-OS/2, and the performance was surprisingly good. IBM must have spent a lot of effort on the x86 emulation support. Documentation hinted at a possibility of future support for native OS/2 x86 applications via emulation.</p><p>IBM also obviously spent a lot of time on the multimedia support in OS/2 PPC. The multimedia support worked unexpectedly well, especially when contrasted with the problems common on Intel machines.</p><p>The system played video and audio without problems, with MIDI support either via a software synthesizer or an OPL3 compatible chip (the software synthesizer sounded far better). The application sampler CD came with several videos, mostly ads for OS/2. The PowerPC Toolkit also came with a beta version of OpenGL support, which shared code with IBM’s AIX workstation grade implementation.</p><p>OS/2 PPC was a hybrid halfway between Warp 3 and Warp 4. The user interface looked like Warp 3, but many of the features of OS/2 PPC later showed in Warp 4 on Intel. One of them was the not very popular Feature Installer:</p><p>The Feature Installer was used to install the BonusPak, several tools and games, and curiously enough, also the Command Reference which for some odd reason wasn’t part of the base install. Here’s one of those games:</p><p>Again, there is no real difference from the Intel version, except for the about box text (notice the “Connect”&nbsp;text). And finally the IBM Works text editor—again there is no discernible difference from the Intel version:</p><h3>OS/2 for PowerPCs System Overview</h3><p>OS/2 PPC was a strange OS. In many ways it was exactly identical to the Intel version, yet in other ways it was completely different. The user interface was the same and the entire API practically unchanged. Among the differences were the addition of full Unicode support and 32-bit console API (Kbd/Mou/Vio). The largely unchanged API was the reason why it was relatively easy to port existing OS/2 software to PowerPC. The biggest difference was not even the CPU but rather the compiler—IBM used the MetaWare High C/C++ for PowerPC development (it was allegedly&nbsp;cheaper for the IBM OS/2 division to contract MetaWare rather than IBM’s own compiler group). The MetaWare tool set was only used as a cross compiler hosted on x86 OS/2 systems. IBM used MetaWare’s compiler for embedded PowerPC development in general (IBM’s involvement with MetaWare goes at least as far back as AIX for PS/2), and MetaWare also marketed an OS/2 x86 product. Watcom was at the time working on PowerPC version of their compiler, but OS/2 PPC was killed before that project was finished. The last IBM Developer’s Connection release which contained OS/2 PPC material also included a beta version of IBM’s VisualAge C++ compiler. No release of a compiler (or a debugger) running natively on OS/2 PPC is known.</p><p>The OS/2 PPC development tools were quite different from their Intel counterparts. To begin with, instead of the LX executable format, OS/2 PPC used the industry standard ELF. Several tools were completely unchanged (IPFC for instance), many were entirely new (linker, librarian, resource compiler). The ABI (Application Binary Interface) used in OS/2 PPC was based on the UNIX SVR4 PowerPC ABI. One notable difference was that OS/2 of course ran in little endian mode, unlike PowerPC UNIX ports but just like Windows NT.</p><p>Delving deeper into the kernel, OS/2 PPC had precious little in common with the Intel version. The product was based on the IBM microkernel, which was a refinement of the Carnegie Mellon University Mach microkernel. The microkernel bore no resemblance to the Intel OS/2 kernel whatsoever and it was also very different from most other operating systems of the time (NeXTSTEP was also based on the Mach microkernel).</p><p>The initial grandiose plan was to build the Workplace OS, the One Ring to Bind Them All of operating systems. Workplace OS (or WPOS for short) was supposed to be built on top of the Mach microkernel and support multiple “personalities”. The personalities would implement existing operating systems such as OS/2, AIX, Windows NT and perhaps even Mac OS. In the end this never happened and the only supported personality was OS/2. This was somewhat similar to Windows NT where the the non-Windows personalities (environment subsystems) eventually withered away.</p><p>The initial plan was still tangible in OS/2 PPC. The OS/2 personality was implemented in the “OS/2 Server”&nbsp;and there were certain “personality neutral”&nbsp;services. Most device drivers were personality neutral and worked directly with the microkernel. This included disk and network drivers. A notable exception were the display drivers, where OS/2 PPC introduced the GRADD model (later ported to Intel OS/2). Documentation on OS/2 PPC internals is somewhat sparse and the online books shipped with PowerPC Toolkit were in many cases either incomplete or simply unmodified copies of OS/2 for Intel documentation. A good source of information is the Redbook titled “OS/2 Warp (Power PC Edition) – A First Look”&nbsp;published by IBM International Technical Support Organization in December 1995, document number SG24-4630-00 for those interested.</p><h3>OS/2 for PowerPC Impressions</h3><p>What was OS/2 Warp, PowerPC Edition like? An unfinished product, rough around the edges but simultaneously technically very interesting and advanced and showing promise. Even though the OS/2 PPC release wasn’t called a beta, it was obvious that this was a beta level product (if even that in some respects). Many features were unfinished or completely missing, notably networking. The kernel code didn’t look much like a production build and printed out quite a lot of debugging output on a serial console, if one was attached. The HPFS support was very unstable, and the stability of Win-OS/2 left a lot to be desired. There were too many clearly unfinished parts of the product—documentation, missing utilities, etc.</p><p>On the other hand a large portion of the system worked well. The user interface and graphics subsystem in general didn’t exhibit any anomalies. Multitasking was reliable and all things considered, responsiveness quite good for a 100MHz CPU and code that was not likely to have been performance tuned. The multimedia subsystem worked much better than expected. Many things were much improved compared to Intel OS/2—internationalization, graphics subsystem, updated console API, and so on. The system seemed to have enough raw power, even if it wasn’t harnessed too well. Boot time was rather long but once up and running, the system was snappy (with some exceptions, notably the CD-ROM driver). To reach true production quality, the OS would have needed at least additional six months of development, perhaps more.</p><p>How useful was OS/2 PPC? Not very. In fact, it was almost completely useless. It only ran on three or four models of rather rare IBM machines and supported almost no additional devices. The OS was clearly unfinished and not entirely stable. Worst of all, there were about zero applications. Because OS/2 PPC was never truly in use, PowerPC versions of OS/2 applications were never sold, although several OS/2 ISVs ported their applications to OS/2 PPC as evidenced by the application sampler. Porting wasn’t very difficult and tools for building PowerPC applications were available, but since there was no demand for them, there was little point in porting.</p><p>OS/2 for PowerPC was undoubtedly an interesting experiment, albeit a failed one. It is impossible to tell whether this failure was caused more by shortcomings of OS/2 for PowerPC or the failure—perhaps just falling far short of expectations—of the PowerPC platform as a whole.</p><p>Without the generosity of Mike Kaply and Chris Graham, this article could not be written.</p><p>Some of the above information was derived from IBM documentation and Redbooks, which may have been inaccurate due to the evolving nature of the OS/2 PPC project. Most of the remaining text is the result of observation and conjecture.</p><p>If you have any additional information, corrections, or interesting stories about OS/2 for PowerPC, please post a comment.</p>",

With all this on-screen text, it is also very common for there to be text visible on the screen potentially in multiple positions, even when characters are speaking.</p><p>As such, <strong>if you are in the business of localizing anime for non-Japanese audiences, you need to be able to deal with on-screen text.</strong> At bare minimum, when subtitling anime, you should be able to do  (multiple lines of text on the screen at the same time) and  (the ability to freely place subtitles anywhere on the screen). Anything less and you are likely to run into trouble the moment you get to something as simple as a next episode preview:</p><figure data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><a href=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/saki-s3-fansub-1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><img src=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/saki-s3-fansub-1.jpg\" alt=\"A screenshot from a next episode preview.

Typesetting is important even when dubbing anime, as all that on-screen text is going to be there in the video all the same!</p><h2>So why would Crunchyroll get rid of typesetting?</h2><p>That is a good question. It is no exaggeration to say that up to this point, Crunchyroll with its typesetting was the unambiguous market leader when it came to presentation quality for official anime subtitles… though for the most part, <strong>other services dealing in anime have never even bothered to try.</strong> Sentai Filmworks’ <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidive\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Hidive</a> is just about the only other anime service that even attempts to do typesetting, though they license so few shows per season that they are a tiny player compared to the Big Boys of anime streaming.</p><p>And it is very likely the existence of these Big Boys that has played a key part in Crunchyroll’s eradication of its typesetting. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Netflix</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon Prime Video</a> probably need no introduction to anyone reading this – both are very popular general streaming services. <strong>Despite anime being only a minor part of their catalogs, a large chunk of today’s anime watching worldwide happens through said services</strong> thanks to their sheer user counts alone.</p><p>Crunchyroll clearly seems to know this, which is why it has been sublicensing its anime properties to both Amazon and Netflix for multiple years at this point. <strong>But with such sublicensing comes the matter of dealing with the subtitling standards of general streaming services.</strong> I’m not going to mince words: these standards are  at least as far as anime is concerned. Netflix for example insists that you stick to at most two lines of text on screen at once, which makes sense most of the time… if you’re talking about dialogue alone. Unfortunately, it becomes completely inadequate when dealing with anime’s plentiful on-screen text. Moreover, the standards of these services actively refuse to give you tools like positioning and overlaps, even though the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timed_Text_Markup_Language\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">TTML subtitle format</a> they use supports said features!</p><p>With such typesetting-hostile standards to deal with, Crunchyroll had basically two choices for how to make sublicensing to Amazon and Netflix work with their existing subtitles that feature actual typesetting: Either 1) try to negotiate with the services for permission to make use of more TTML capabilities (that the subtitle renderers of said services should already support!) or 2) <strong>start mangling subtitles with typesetting into something compatible with the awful subtitling standards of the general streaming services.</strong> I am not aware if Crunchyroll ever attempted the former, but I can confirm that it eventually started doing the latter.</p><p>Editors among Crunchyroll’s subtitling staff were  to convert finished high quality subtitles with typesetting into limited low quality TTML subtitles without typesetting, compatible with Amazon &amp; Netflix subtitling standards. They got paid extra for the manual effort required by the process.</p><figure data-astro-cid-rkgwkvbt=\"\"><figcaption data-astro-cid-rkgwkvbt=\"\">Overlapping on-screen text and dialogue makes for a miserable anime watching experience with limited TTML subtitles. Video clip from  (Winter&nbsp;2018, Netflix)</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, after a couple years of this kind of manual conversion work, the Crunchyroll leadership seems to have decided that it isn’t enough, and that <strong>Crunchyroll must do away with high quality subtitles with typesetting entirely and only produce low quality TTML subtitles without typesetting from now on.</strong> But if they already had a working process for high quality subtitles at home and low quality TTML subtitles elsewhere, why would they just decide to give that up in order to produce exclusively low quality subtitles? It doesn’t seem to make very much sense, even as a cost-cutting measure. There should be so much value in being able to advertise <em>best viewed on Crunchyroll</em> to potential audiences for long-term growth, right?</p><p>To understand  we need to look into some relevant history. <strong>Specifically, what happened after Sony bought Crunchyroll and merged it with Funimation,</strong> another US anime distributor that Sony had bought previously. But in order to also understand  first we need to look at what both Crunchyroll and Funimation were like before this fateful merger happened, as well as how they approached anime subtitling over the years.</p><h2>A short history of Crunchyroll and its subtitling standards</h2><p>Crunchyroll launched in 2006 as a pirate streaming site focused on East Asian media content, featuring <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fansub\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">fansubbed</a> anime, live action drama, music videos, and so on. There was nothing particularly remarkable about the site back then – as a rule of thumb, pirate streaming sites are always worse quality-wise than if you just directly downloaded the pirated releases they use as a base, and the sites mostly exist to make their admins illicit money through ads, begging for donations, and other shady crap. It is important to note though that <strong>legal anime streaming basically wasn’t a thing at this time.</strong></p><figure data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><a href=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/crunchyroll-in-2007.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><img src=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/crunchyroll-in-2007.png\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"></a><figcaption data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><p>Crunchyroll in 2007. The “help out” message at the top is asking for donations.</p></figcaption></figure><p>However, it was likely this exact venture capital funding that enabled Crunchyroll to negotiate a major deal with the Japanese broadcasting company TV Tokyo, which was announced at the start of 2009. <strong>This announcement brought with it the news that Crunchyroll was going full-time legitimate and getting rid of all its pirate content.</strong> With this move, Crunchyroll found itself in a position of having to start producing subtitles of its own (instead of just uploading fansubs) and somehow present said subtitles to its customers.</p><figure data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><a href=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/aegisub.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><img src=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/aegisub.png\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"></a><figcaption data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><p>Aegisub is an advanced subtitling software built by fansubbers, for fansubbers.</p></figcaption></figure><p>For the subtitle production part, Crunchyroll managed to strike a deal with a bunch of fansubbers to take on the job. This single decision was a fateful one, as it was the foundation for basically everything that came after – with former fansubbers on the job, the tools of the trade were set according to the standards of fansubbers: the subtitling software of choice was to be <a href=\"https://aegisub.org/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Aegisub</a>, and <strong>the subtitle format of choice was to be Aegisub’s native format, Advanced SubStation Alpha, or ASS for short.</strong></p><p>ASS is an extremely powerful format in terms of formatting and styling capabilities, and with Aegisub, it is easy to produce ASS subtitles that make use of said capabilities. <strong>However, as a streaming site, Crunchyroll needed to be able to present these ASS subtitles in the browser somehow,</strong> and the only full-fledged ASS renderers that existed were only available in the traditional local media playback environments targeted by fansubbers, which meant that Crunchyroll couldn’t make use of said renderers on the web directly.</p><p>Now, there are two main ways to subtitle videos, with opposing pros and cons:</p><ul><li> – the subtitles are burned into the video itself.  as you only need to be able to play video, <strong>but inflexible for updates and multiple languages</strong> as you have to recreate your video files over and over again with expensive processing called .</li><li> – the subtitles exist as their own separate media track that the video player renders on top of the video in realtime during playback, making softsubs <strong>complex to playback, but updates and multiple tracks are very cheap</strong> as you only need to deal with tiny subtitle files while the video files remain unchanged.</li></ul><p>As such, one way Crunchyroll could have solved the subtitle presentation problem would have been to simply hardsub its ASS subtitles, but despite the challenges it posed, Crunchyroll decided to go with softsubbing instead (which was also the fansub standard at the time). <strong>And so Crunchyroll set out to build its own ASS renderer in Flash,</strong> the primary technology used to play video on the web at the time. Here’s a screenshot of some of the first subtitles ever officially authored by the fully legitimate Crunchyroll, rendered in the current ASS renderer but adhering to the limits of the company’s very first Flash subtitle renderer:</p><figure data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><a href=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/saki-cr-1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><img src=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/saki-cr-1.jpg\" alt=\"A screenshot from a next episode preview.

Now, the positioning was limited to the eight edges and the center of the screen, making for just nine possible positions total, but even that was enough to handle the humble next episode preview at the very least. Beyond these, the first version also supported fading animations. It wasn’t much, <strong>but it did cover the bare minimum for dealing with on-screen text in anime.</strong></p><p>Over the years, Crunchyroll managed to slowly improve its Flash subtitle renderer to enable the use of more ASS features. Custom colors, multiple fonts, multiple styles, rotation, and full positioning were implemented (albeit in somewhat hacky and unwieldy fashion). This went on until 2018, when Crunchyroll was faced with a major issue: <strong>Flash was seeing rapid decline in use, and web streaming was shifting over to HTML5-based technology.</strong> However, with a custom ASS renderer built in Flash, Crunchyroll couldn’t easily make the change, as it would mean having to essentially rebuild the custom subtitle renderer they had from scratch in HTML5 (as much like in the Flash days, there still were no solutions native to the web available for rendering ASS subtitles).</p><p>However, Crunchyroll managed to come up with a way to solve the problem of moving from Flash to HTML5 with the help of another new web technology called <a href=\"https://webassembly.org/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">WebAssembly</a>, which allowed developers to take code that wasn’t developed for the web and compile it for use on the web. With WebAssembly, Crunchyroll could take <a href=\"https://github.com/libass/libass\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">libass</a>, one of the few fully-featured ASS renderers out there, and <a href=\"https://github.com/libass/JavascriptSubtitlesOctopus\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">use it for their new HTML5 player</a>. Now, not only did all their old ASS subtitles render nicely in HTML5, but <strong>the possibilities for typesetting at Crunchyroll had taken a huge leap forward.</strong> And the subtitling staff at Crunchyroll was more than happy to make use of this newfound power.</p><figure data-astro-cid-rkgwkvbt=\"\"><figcaption data-astro-cid-rkgwkvbt=\"\">You couldn’t see typesetting like this on Crunchyroll back in the days of Flash. Video clip from  (Fall&nbsp;2022, Crunchyroll)</figcaption></figure><p>That said, despite having a technically fully-featured ASS renderer to work with, <strong>there were still limitations.</strong> Code compiled with WebAssembly runs worse compared to its original native counterpart, which limits how heavy the typesetting can be (with the flexible features of ASS, it is very easy to produce typesetting that simply cannot be rendered in realtime even on powerful computers, resulting in notable lag during playback). A commercial service like Crunchyroll will also generally want to keep its content watchable even on lower-end devices, which further reduces how complex any typesetting can be.</p><p>And this is the limited but functional standard of typesetting that Crunchyroll users got to enjoy (with first-party subtitles) up until the fateful season of Fall 2025 that prompted the creation of this article.</p><p>Before we move to the conclusions for this section, though, it is worth noting that while Crunchyroll currently uses softsubbed ASS subtitles whenever it can, there are platforms and devices (like various TVs) where this kind of ASS rendering simply isn’t possible to do. <strong>Crunchyroll is available on some platforms like this, which means it has been making additional hardsubbed versions of everything on top of the usual softsubbed ones.</strong></p><p>So, what can we learn from all this? At least one thing is abundantly clear: for most of its existence, <strong>the leadership at Crunchyroll had at least some respect and understanding for anime as a medium.</strong> They understood that it was important to be able to deal with on-screen text in their subtitles, and allocated enough resources to make typesetting possible. The company even managed to improve in this regard over time, albeit very slowly.</p><p>That said, anyone familiar with anime fansubs of the 2010s and 2020s probably can’t help but feel disappointed that even the highest effort typesetting from Crunchyroll could only ever be on the level of fansub releases from around 2010 at best. Why 2010 specifically? <strong>Because from 2011 onwards, fansubbers started widely incorporating advanced motion tracking into their typesetting.</strong> Observe an example of such fansub typesetting from over a decade ago, the likes of which has never been seen on Crunchyroll:</p><figure data-astro-cid-rkgwkvbt=\"\"><figcaption data-astro-cid-rkgwkvbt=\"\">Video clip from  (Fall&nbsp;2013, Underwater fansubs)</figcaption></figure><p>Now, while fansubbers giving away their work for free might get away with saying <q>just get a better computer</q> to anyone whose devices can’t render softsubbed typesetting like this in realtime, an official service that lots of people pay for doesn’t really have the same luxury, which is the main reason why you don’t see stuff like this softsubbed on Crunchyroll. But this is not an insurmountable problem, so make no mistake: <strong>official anime services could absolutely offer typesetting with similar level of quality to the best of fansubs.</strong> The basic solution to the performance problem is very simple, even: you simply hardsub the typesetting. This would work from streaming to physical disc releases and only the sky would be the limit in terms of the typesetting quality you could offer, as realtime rendering would no longer be a concern!</p><p>Now, as mentioned earlier, hardsubbing does make things more complicated and expensive on the backend as you need to encode and store multiple copies of video. Crunchyroll is already dealing with this, though! But if costs are an issue, the system is pretty easy to improve in theory: if you keep the dialogue softsubbed, only the parts of the video that actually feature typesetting would be hardsubbed, and with some clever engineering and an understanding of how modern media formats work, you would only have to keep multiple copies of the typeset parts. <strong>And since the average anime episode has on-screen text only for a small percentage of its total runtime, combining softsubbed dialogue and hardsubbed typesetting like this would make for a highly cost-effective setup.</strong></p><figure data-astro-cid-rkgwkvbt=\"\"><figcaption data-astro-cid-rkgwkvbt=\"\">Typesetting like this would be possible to do even for official anime services. Video clip from  (Fall&nbsp;2021, Chasa fansubs)</figcaption></figure><p>And since with a mixed system like this you would only have softsubs for the technically simpler dialogue, you could even convert these dialogue-only ASS subtitles to a simpler but more widely supported subtitle format for playback, <strong>which theoretically should do away with the need to keep fully hardsubbed copies around entirely, without any real loss in quality!</strong> I actually built a minimal version of a mixed system like this myself when I was doing some anime streaming work a few years back and can confidently say that <strong>this would be extremely doable for any official anime service… as long as they just cared enough.</strong></p><figure data-astro-cid-rkgwkvbt=\"\"><figcaption data-astro-cid-rkgwkvbt=\"\">Keep this example of fansub typesetting in mind for later. Video clip from <em>Danganronpa: The Animation</em> (Summer&nbsp;2013, UTW fansubs)</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, any interest Crunchyroll had for improving their subtitle rendering for typesetting seemed to run out after the 2018 transition to WebAssembly libass. <strong>Not that it actually ever seemed to be all that high to begin with, though,</strong> as evident by some of the low-hanging fruit that Crunchyroll never bothered to pick in this regard; the most obvious of which would be Crunchyroll’s dogged insistence to restrict typesetting font choices to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_fonts_for_the_Web\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Core Fonts for the Web</a>. Free for commercial use fonts have been plentily available since the Flash days, and custom fonts have been well supported on the web for a similarly long time.</p><p>Anyway, it would have never been all that hard for Crunchyroll to support custom fonts for typesetting, especially after the 2018 move to HTML5. The underlying technology was there and font files are tiny in size compared to the video files being streamed – this would have been an extremely simple and effective improvement for all typesetting efforts. Yet Crunchyroll never reached for this improvement, which is why  has kept appearing in Crunchyroll typesetting with depressing regularity.</p><figure data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><a href=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/kanokari-cr-1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><img src=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/kanokari-cr-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"></a><figcaption data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><p>There it is again.  Screenshot from  (Summer&nbsp;2023, Crunchyroll)</p></figcaption></figure><p>It is also disappointing <strong>how regularly the anime staples of opening &amp; ending songs are still left untranslated on Crunchyroll,</strong> though this issue is admittedly <a href=\"https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/answerman/2017-09-01/.120752\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">much harder to solve than you’d expect.</a> Still, it is possible to do so, especially with Sony’s resources behind the company today. That goes double when Sony is involved in anime production in any way, as then the songs being used should be well-known to all relevant parties well in advance of airing for timely rights-clearing. <strong>So if Crunchyroll/Sony is in any way involved with an anime’s production, it should basically always be possible for songs to be translated the moment the first episode is released.</strong></p><p>But that’s enough about Crunchyroll’s history. Now it’s time to look at the other company mentioned earlier and see how they’ve fared in comparison…</p><h2>A short history of Funimation and its subtitling standards</h2><p>In the early 90s, Japanese-American businessman Gen Fukunaga was approached by his uncle who was working as a producer for Toei. A proposal was made: if Fukunaga could start an anime company in US, Toei would license the rights to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Ball\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Dragon Ball</a> franchise to it – a franchise that was already making mad cash in Japan. Sensing an opportunity, Fukunaga found investors, and thus in 1994 Funimation was born. A year later, Dragon Ball was on US TV, dubbed and edited to <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20060518193827/http://www.animecauldron.com/dbzuncensored2/misc/footsteps.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">“conform to American sensibilities and tastes”</a>.</p><figure data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><a href=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/dbz-promo-art.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><img src=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/dbz-promo-art.jpg\" alt=\"Promotional art for the Dragon Ball Z anime, featuring some of its cast members.\" loading=\"lazy\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"></a><figcaption data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><p>It was especially  (1989-1996) that hit it big in the US.</p></figcaption></figure><p>In the early 2000s, fueled by Dragon Ball’s success, Funimation started expanding its business by getting home video distribution rights for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4Kids_Entertainment\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">4Kids Entertainment</a> licenses and non-Japanese kids’ cartoons, the latter eventually expanding into getting involved in production too. But beyond increased investment in kids’ cartoons, <strong>Funimation also started experimenting with more anime licenses of its own,</strong> the 2001 anime adaption for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruits_Basket\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fruits Basket</a> being one of its early standout releases.</p><p>Out of these various expansion attempts, <strong>“more anime” seemed to be the one to work out best,</strong> and towards the end of the 00s that became the main direction of Funimation’s business. This move was helped along by a bunch of licenses obtained from now-defunct US anime publishers Geneon USA and ADV. And in the spring of 2009, hot on the heels of Crunchyroll going legit, <a href=\"https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-04-03/funimation-adds-toei-air-master-captain-harlock\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Funimation announced that they too were getting into the anime streaming business</a>. The resulting anime streams from Funimation were hardsubbed and looked like this:</p><p>What you see here is exactly what you got: plain text at top center or bottom center, with dialogue on bottom, and translations for all on-screen text piled up top. <strong>So while overlaps were technically supported, full positioning did not seem to be possible,</strong> which made things quite awkward the moment there was more than one sign visible on the screen at the same time. <strong>This was also the standard you could expect from Funimation’s DVD and Blu-ray releases.</strong> And beyond the way too common dialogue three-liners (which are generally terrible for readability), sometimes you even saw :</p><figure data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><a href=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/d-frag-funi-1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><img src=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/d-frag-funi-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"></a><figcaption data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><p>Screenshot from  (Winter&nbsp;2014, Funimation)</p></figcaption></figure><p>The subtitling software that Funimation was using at the time was <a href=\"https://www.telestream.net/captioning/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Telestream MacCaption</a>.

However, it is worth mentioning that <strong>Funimation dubs did have simple hardsubbed typesetting sometimes;</strong> this only seemed happen at the whim of the dubbing side of Funimation though, as these hardsubbed signs were never present in the subbed versions, nor were they a consistent feature of Funimation dubs in general.</p><p><strong>In 2017, Sony purchased Funimation</strong> as part of its growing collection of international anime distributors (Sony had previously bought Madman Anime and AnimeLab in Australia and Wakanim in Europe). As a result of this buyout, towards the end of 2018 the license sharing deal between Funimation and Crunchyroll was dissolved and soon after <strong>Funimation started serving new subtitled streams on FunimationNow, which were softsubbed</strong> and looked like this:</p><p><strong>No longer were the subtitles even making use of overlaps.</strong> Where dialogue translation used to go on bottom and sign translation on top when both were present, now all text was stuck on the same side of the screen together, either on top or bottom, but never both at the same time anymore.</p><p>How this further reduction in subtitling capabilities came about cannot be said for sure, but there are several possible explanations. For one, another major thing that happened at the end of 2018: <a href=\"https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2018-12-04/funimation-hulu-sign-first-look-streaming-deal-for-new-anime/.140359\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Funimation signed a big sublicensing deal</a> with the general streaming service <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Hulu</a>, which meant <strong>dealing with Hulu’s subtitling standards and authoring accordingly limited subtitles</strong> – because as could be expected, the subtitling standards of a general streaming service did not account for the needs of anime in any real way.</p><figure data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><a href=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/mha-funi-hulu.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><img src=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/mha-funi-hulu.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"></a><figcaption data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><p>Only the middle column of the blackboard is translated here.

OOONA Tools, by default, <strong>do not allow for the creation of subtitles with overlaps.</strong> While it can be done in OOONA today by tweaking the options or by using OOONA’s track features (which are quite similar to those of MacCaption, incidentally), it is possible that at the time these features were either not available or that it wasn’t possible to correctly export subtitles with overlaps to the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/webvtt1/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">WebVTT subtitle format</a> that was being used on FunimationNow.</p><figure data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><a href=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/ooona-create.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><img src=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/ooona-create.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"></a><figcaption data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><p>Screenshot of , the primary subtitling software in OOONA Tools.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Regarding that last possibility in particular, there is <a href=\"https://archive.is/nRpg1\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">this OOONA FAQ entry</a> that mentions how <q>not all formats support […] overlapping subtitles</q> and that <q>Currently, it’s supported in IMSC1.1, ITT and Videotron Lambda CAP exports</q>. However, based on my own testing, OOONA Tools can properly export subtitles with overlaps in more formats today than just the ones mentioned here (including WebVTT), meaning that the FAQ entry is in fact outdated – <strong>but it was likely true at some point.</strong></p><p>In any case, this was the extremely limited standard of subtitling that Funimation customers had to live with until the service was shut down in 2024 as a result of the Funimation-Crunchyroll merger.</p><p>Now, what can we conclude from all this? If nothing else, one thing seems abundantly clear: <strong>the Funimation leadership never truly cared about or respected anime as a medium.</strong> From the very beginning, it’s clear that Gen Fukunaga (a businessman in his 30s at the time) got into the business <strong>with the mindset of making money with kids’ cartoons,</strong> and this only became more evident with how Funimation tried to expand into more types of kids’ cartoons before eventually realizing that anime is where the money was at.</p><p>But even with this eventual focus on more anime, <strong>no resources seem to have ever been dedicated to make typesetting an actual thing at Funimation,</strong> despite how obviously beneficial it would have been for their key product of localized anime. And the way Funimation never even bothered to figure out how to make the most of MacCaption, the expensive enterprise subtitling software they kept using for over a decade… while I speculated about possible technical reasons for Funimation abandoning even overlaps when they started producing softsubs for FunimationNow, there was always one possible additional reason: <strong>they just didn’t care at all.</strong> They ran into a problem, no resources were dedicated to fix the problem, and the subtitles got permanently worse as a result.</p><figure data-astro-cid-rkgwkvbt=\"\"><figcaption data-astro-cid-rkgwkvbt=\"\">Remember the fansubbed version of this from earlier? Here’s Funimation in comparison. Video clip from <em>Danganronpa: The Animation</em> (Summer&nbsp;2013, Funimation)</figcaption></figure><p>The whole move to OOONA was questionable in itself, as while OOONA was capable of exporting subtitles to both WebVTT for FunimationNow and TTML (or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubRip\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SRT</a>, a very limited subtitle format) for Hulu in 2018,  Why start paying for a monthly subscription service when your existing paid-for enterprise software should be able to deal with your needs just fine? I suspect the primary motivation behind the move (which could have even originated from the new parent company Sony) might have been the fact that it was trendy for companies at the time to move everything they possibly could to The Cloud™, regardless of how much sense it actually made… but that’s enough about OOONA for now.</p><p>Ultimately, <strong>Funimation’s subtitling standards were extremely poor to begin with, and they only managed to make them worse over time.</strong> That is something that only utter indifference or outright disdain for anime as a medium could bring about, which seems to have been the exact attitude that Gen Fukunaga cultivated at the executive levels of Funimation – <strong>and his followers appear to have carried the torch even after his departure from the company.</strong> But more on that in the next section, when we finally get to the Funimation-Crunchyroll merger.</p><h2>The Funimation-Crunchyroll merger and its consequences</h2><p>Following Sony’s 2017 purchase of Funimation, in 2019 Sony bought out Gen Fukunaga from the company entirely, which led to him stepping down as the General Manager, with Colin Decker taking his place. Soon after, Sony formed the Funimation Global Group to consolidate all the international anime publishing services it had bought, with Decker in charge of the joint venture as the CEO. Then, in late 2020, <strong>Sony announced that they were going to buy Crunchyroll, placing it under the executive control of the Funimation Global Group.</strong> The acquisition was completed in August 2021, coming with a statement from Sony that their goal is to <a href=\"https://www.sonypictures.com/corp/press_releases/2021/0809/sonysfunimationglobalgroupcompletesacquisitionofcrunchyrollfromatt\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">“create a unified anime subscription experience as soon as possible”</a>.</p><figure data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><a href=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/funiroll.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><img src=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/funiroll.jpg\" alt=\"Crunchyroll and Funimation logos side by side.\" loading=\"lazy\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"></a><figcaption data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><p>Soon, there would only be one.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Then, in March 2022, the news came that Funimation, Crunchyroll, Wakanim, and VRV (Crunchyroll’s more general streaming service) would all be merged together into a single streaming service that would exist under the name of Crunchyroll (as it had the strongest brand of the lot). <strong>Funimation Global Group LLC was renamed to Crunchyroll LLC, with Funimation executives remaining in charge.</strong> Soon after, Colin Decker stepped down as the CEO, with Rahul Purini (previously COO) taking his place. The merger was complete.</p><p>Things weren’t much better for those left behind, as laid out in <a href=\"https://archive.ph/jxvFK\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">this Bloomberg article</a> from 2024. Staff from Funimation was notably hostile towards those from Crunchyroll:</p><blockquote><p>Tension between the camps arose almost immediately. In a Zoom meeting announcing [Sony’s purchase of Crunchyroll], <strong>Funimation workers accused Crunchyroll of being pirates,</strong> alluding to the site’s history, according to two people who were present.</p></blockquote><p>While Crunchyroll workers were quickly frustrated with the new executives from Funimation:</p><blockquote><p>Current or former employees describe Crunchyroll’s new management–primarily from Funimation–as out-of-touch with employees and the anime fans the company once prioritized. <strong>Some executives write off anime as “kids’ cartoons,”</strong> they said, and resist hiring job candidates who describe themselves as fans.</p></blockquote><h3>How typesetting gets destroyed</h3><p>In 2025, the executives came up with an idea: Crunchyroll should move away from <a href=\"https://daiz.moe/crunchyroll-is-destroying-its-subtitles-for-no-good-reason/#aegisub-ass-introduction\">Aegisub and ASS subtitles with typesetting</a> and start producing exclusively <a href=\"https://daiz.moe/crunchyroll-is-destroying-its-subtitles-for-no-good-reason/#ttml-example\">limited TTML subtitles without typesetting</a> in <a href=\"https://daiz.moe/crunchyroll-is-destroying-its-subtitles-for-no-good-reason/#ooona-introduction\">OOONA Tools</a>. <strong>The likely end goal of this is to get rid of Crunchyroll’s <a href=\"https://daiz.moe/crunchyroll-is-destroying-its-subtitles-for-no-good-reason/#cr-libass\">unique ASS-based subtitle rendering</a> entirely in favor of something more “industry standard” like TTML-based subtitle rendering.</strong> This would mean no longer having to pay staff for manual ASS-to-TTML conversion, as well as being able to drop the relatively expensive fully hardsubbed encodes for limited playback environments where ASS rendering is not possible <em>(but some sort of TTML rendering usually is).</em></p><p><strong>However, a major change affecting all aspects of the company’s subtitling pipeline doesn’t happen overnight,</strong> especially considering Crunchyroll’s large back catalog of ASS subtitles with typesetting that couldn’t be automatically converted to limited TTML subtitles without typesetting. So while the subtitling staff was to be (begrudgingly) busy experimenting and onboarding with OOONA and doing manual ASS-to-TTML conversions for back catalog titles, <strong>technical work would also need to be done to prepare for this vision of a TTML-only future.</strong></p><figure data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><a href=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/moneat-cr-1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><img src=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/moneat-cr-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"></a><figcaption data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><p>And what an exciting future of not being able to read signs that would be! Screenshot from <em>This Monster Wants to Eat Me</em> (Fall&nbsp;2025, Crunchyroll)</p></figcaption></figure><p>For this purpose, Crunchyroll seems to have decided that it would take its existing manual ASS-to-TTML conversions produced by the subtitling staff and treat them as the new master subtitle files. These TTML “masters” would then be—for the time being—converted back to ASS with <a href=\"https://www.closedcaptionconverter.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Closed Caption Converter</a> for use with the current ASS-based subtitle rendering. And so, with the start of the Fall 2025 anime season, a plan like this was pushed to production; while regular ASS subtitles were still being produced by Crunchyroll’s subtitling staff, <strong>these ASS subtitles with typesetting were generally left unused, while only limited ASS-to-TTML-to-ASS conversions without typesetting were being presented to customers on most shows.</strong></p><p>Implementing this interim pipeline with Closed Caption Converter didn’t seem to go exactly as planned, though, <strong>as some Fall 2025 shows on Crunchyroll ended up having no subtitles at all on release,</strong> including the premieres of the latest seasons of hit shows <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Hero_Academia\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">My Hero Academia</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spy_%C3%97_Family\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Spy × Family</a>.</p><blockquote><p>Over the past few days, some users experienced delays in accessing the content they wanted and subtitle issues across certain series. These were caused by internal system problems – not by any change in how we create subtitles, use of new vendors or AI. Those internal issues have now been fully resolved.</p><p>Quality subtitles are a core part of what makes watching anime on Crunchyroll so special. They connect global fans to the heart of every story, and we take that responsibility seriously.</p><p>Thank you for your patience. We’re committed to continuing to deliver the authenticity, quality, and care that fans deserve.</p></blockquote><p>Following this statement, some of the new Fall 2025 shows have had their ASS-to-TTML-to-ASS subtitles switched out to the previously unused regular ASS subtitles. Other shows haven’t. <strong>And some shows in the Crunchyroll back catalog have been updated with ASS-to-TTML-to-ASS subtitles,</strong> though the exact timing of these back catalog updates is unknown.</p><p>With all of this, <strong>the future of typesetting on Crunchyroll is unclear.</strong></p><p>And that’s how we’ve found ourselves in the situation we face today. Remember what the <a href=\"https://daiz.moe/crunchyroll-is-destroying-its-subtitles-for-no-good-reason/#cr-first-subs\">first Crunchyroll subtitles from 2009</a> looked like? Yeah, these new subtitles adhering to limited TTML standards <em>are even worse than the subtitles from 2009</em> in terms of how on-screen text can be handled! In other words: <strong>The presentation quality of Crunchyroll’s first-party subtitles has reached an all-time low in 2025.</strong></p><figure data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><a href=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/chitose-cr-1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><img src=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/chitose-cr-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"></a><figcaption data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><p>Can’t even handle a next episode preview properly anymore. Screenshot from <em>Chitose Is in the Ramune Bottle</em> (Fall&nbsp;2025, Crunchyroll)</p></figcaption></figure><p>There is only one conclusion that can be drawn from that: <strong>the Funimation-turned-Crunchyroll executives still do not have any respect for anime as a medium.</strong> In addition, they seem to be treating Crunchyroll and its ways of doing things as the ways of  – which isn’t entirely incorrect, as Crunchyroll’s use of Aegisub and ASS  originate from the ways of pirate fansubbers. But fansubbers deeply care about anime as medium (they wouldn’t be illegally subtitling it for free as a hobby otherwise), which in turn means that <strong>the ways fansubbers have developed to subtitle anime are in fact extremely efficient for the job</strong> – much better than basically any “industry standards” for subtitling, even.</p><p>But that clearly doesn’t matter to the executives. <strong>The only thing that seems to be on their mind is how to best make money with kids’ cartoons</strong> that none of them personally watch, and what they seem to consider “best” is <em>getting rid of everything positively unique about Crunchyroll in favor of doing things the Funimation way,</em> even if that means ditching Aegisub and ASS in favor of OOONA Tools and TTML and getting rid of typesetting in the process.  conclusion is further supported by the fact that  with notable reduction in typesetting quality on Blu-ray as a result:</p><p>Then there’s the whole plan of moving to OOONA in general, which is even more questionable than it was back in the Funimation days. <strong>Crunchyroll has a lot more to lose in terms of subtitle quality than Funimation ever did,</strong> yet the executives seem to want to go back to their “old reliable” regardless. I can’t even see it saving them any money in the long run, considering that Aegisub is completely free software while OOONA will incur constant ongoing costs with its per-user subscription pricing. Rather than authoring limited TTML in OOONA directly, <strong>paying the subtitling staff to keep the manual ASS to TTML conversions going would likely be cheaper!</strong></p><p>Beyond that, there is also the thing about <strong>OOONA being an Israeli company.</strong> It is certainly a choice, not only in 2018 but most certainly in 2025, to heavily invest in the services of a company from a country that is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_genocide\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">actively committing genocide</a>. However, to quell some unsubstantiated internet discourse I have seen in relation to this, I do want to emphasize that <strong>OOONA being Israeli is not really directly relevant to the quality issues this article is about.</strong></p><figure data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><a href=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/eztitles.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><img src=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/eztitles.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"></a><figcaption data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><p>EZTitles is another popular enterprise subtitling software. Notice how they mention AI directly in their navigation.</p></figcaption></figure><p>The reason for this lies in enterprise subtitling software (“industry standards”) being universally poor when it comes to producing high quality typesetting for anime, so it wouldn’t really matter which software suite a switch was being made to – <strong>no matter what, moving away from Aegisub would destroy typesetting as it currently exists on Crunchyroll.</strong> And while Crunchyroll’s CEO has expressed his interest in AI subtitles, at least currently there has been no signs of any kind of AI (Israeli or otherwise) being used to create first-party subtitles on Crunchyroll.</p><h3>Why Crunchyroll is so confident it will get away with this (or: how capitalism ruins everything)</h3><p>Finally, I want to talk about the possible reasons for Crunchyroll executives feeling so confident about getting away with making their own primary product so much worse. Ultimately, it comes down to the fact that <strong>international anime licensing operates primarily on an exclusive licensing model.</strong> This means that generally only one service will be able to offer a specific title in specific language(s) in specific region(s), unless the service voluntarily decides to sublicense it out to others. This in turn upends the assumption that the existence of multiple anime services would be beneficial to consumers, <strong>as the services don’t actually have to engage in competition on customer-beneficial factors like service quality almost at all</strong> – instead, they can just focus on hoarding as many exclusive licenses as possible.</p><figure data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><a href=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/kun-gao-ama.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><img src=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/kun-gao-ama.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of three comments from a Reddit AMA. Check the link in the caption to read the contents in full.\" loading=\"lazy\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"></a><figcaption data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><p>I once asked former Crunchyroll CEO Kun Gao about “exclusivity or completeness” <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2b26ou/im_kun_gao_the_cofounder_and_ceo_of_crunchyroll/cj12zuo/?context=3\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">in this Reddit AMA.</a> He dodged the question but basically said “exclusivity”.</p></figcaption></figure><p>This kind of “competition” twisted by exclusive licensing is more like a casino, where the customers might occasionally be thrown a bone, <strong>but at the end of the day, the house always wins.</strong> And the anime companies very much prefer to keep it that way, even if it means never being able to offer full coverage of new anime seasons – a limited amount of exclusives is much more important to them. Dreams of infinite growth are what drives the modern-day game of capitalism, and spending money to please customers rather than shareholders goes directly against said dreams. <strong>It’s all about spending as little money as possible to make as much money as possible.</strong></p><div><p>This is why the capitalists in charge of all the big companies these days are so excited about AI too: nothing gets them going more than the idea of not having for pay for those pesky human employees. <em>This is no doubt the actual reason why Crunchyroll CEO Rahul Purini is interested in AI subtitles.</em> It doesn’t matter that <em>anime localization costs are a drop in the bucket compared to the overall costs of anime production,</em> even if you were talking about super high quality work with fansub-level typesetting. <em>Any excuse to cut the wages of real human workers is one step closer to the next yacht purchase for the executive upper class.</em></p></div><p>…Whew, got a bit heated there. Anyway, the most likely reason why Crunchyroll executives believe they can get away with reducing the quality of their own service so much? <strong>Because Crunchyroll doesn’t have any meaningful competition thanks to the primarily-exclusive licensing model used by the international anime industry.</strong> Even if they make the service worse, what can you do about it?

      "content": "<h2>SDN Grew First and Fastest in Datacenters</h2><p>The first large-scale deployments of SDN took place in hyperscale data centers, beginning about 2010. The story is best told by the hyperscaler companies themselves, and so we asked leaders at Google, Microsoft Azure, and Meta to tell their stories about why and how they adopted SDN. As you will see, they all started from the ideas and principles that came from the NSF-funded research; and each tailored SDN to suit their specific needs and culture.</p><p>The Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and telecommunication companies also had a strong interest in SDN. AT&amp;T played a large role in its definition, engaging in research and early deployments in the mid 2000s. We invited Albert Greenberg, who was at AT&amp;T at the time, to tell the story.</p><p>Nicira was perhaps the startup that epitomized the SDN movement. It grew out of the NSF-funded  program and the Clean Slate Program at Stanford, based on the Ph.D. work of Martín Casado. Nicira developed ONIX, the first distributed control plane, used by Google in its infrastructure; OVS, the first OpenFlow-compliant software switch; and NVP (later NSX), the first network virtualization platform. We invited Teemu Koponen, a principal architect at Nicira, to tell the story.</p><p>During the early 2010s, the networking industry began to realize that SDN has many big advantages. It lifts complex protocols up and out of the switches into the control plane, where it is written in a modern programming language. This made it possible to reason about the correctness of the protocols simply by examining the software controlling the network and the forwarding state maintained by the switches. For the first time, it became possible to formally verify the behavior of a complete network.</p><p>Researchers, startups, network equipment vendors, and hyperscalers have all taken advantage of SDN principles to develop new ways to verify network behavior. We invited Professor George Varghese, who has been deeply involved in network verification research, to give us his perspective on network verification.</p><p>A main benefit of SDN is that it hands over the keys (of control) from the networking equipment vendors—who kept their systems closed and proprietary, and hence tended to evolve slowly—to software programmers, who could define the behavior for themselves, often in open source software. And indeed it happened: Today, most large networks are controlled by software written by those who own and operate networks rather than by networking equipment vendors.</p><p>But what about the hardware? Switches, routers, firewalls, and network interface cards are all built from special-purpose ASICs—highly integrated, cost-effective, and super-fast. The problem was the features and protocols that operated on packets (for example, forwarding, routing, firewalls, and security) were all baked into hardware at the time the chip was designed, two to three years before it was deployed. What if the network owner and operator needed to change and evolve the behavior in their network, for example to add a new way to measure traffic or a new way to verify behavior? A group of researchers and entrepreneurs set out to make the switches and NICs programmable by the user, to allow more rapid improvement and give the operator greater control. Not only did new programmable devices emerge, but a whole open source movement around the P4 programming language.</p><p>We invited Professor Nate Foster, who leads the P4 language ecosystem, to tell the story of how programmable forwarding planes came about.</p><p>So far, we have focused on SDN  networks running over electrical and optical cables in datacenters, enterprises, and long-haul WANs. SDN was originally defined with wireline networks in mind.</p><p>Yet, for cellular networks, the most widely used networks in the world, the need was even greater: Cellular networks have been held back for decades by closed, proprietary, and complex “standards” designed to allow equipment vendors to maintain a strong grip on the market. SDN provides an opportunity to open up networks, introducing well-defined control APIs and interfaces, moving control software to common operating systems running on commodity servers.</p><p>This story has only just begun, but it started thanks to NSF-funded research in the mid 2000s, then boosted by DARPA-funded programs to support open source software for cellular infrastructure. We invited Guru Parulkar and Oğuz Sunay to tell the story, both of whom developed open source cellular systems at the Open Networking Foundation and for the DARPA-funded Pronto project.</p>",

      "content": "<div><p>23 October 2025 | Reading time: 6 minutes</p></div><p>It’s 2025. Does installing Python, managing virtual environments, and synchronizing dependencies between your colleagues really have to be so difficult? Well… no! A  new tool called <a href=\"https://docs.astral.sh/uv/\" rel=\"nofollow\">uv</a> came out recently that  how easy installing and using Python can be.</p><p>uv is a free, open-source tool built by Astral, a small startup that has been churning out Python tools (like the excellent linter <a href=\"https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ruff</a>) for the past few years. uv can:</p><ul><li>Install any Python version for you</li><li>Manage virtual environments</li><li>Solve dependency conflicts  quickly ( important for big projects.)</li></ul><p>What’s best is that it can do all of the above <strong>better than any other tool</strong>, in my opinion. It’s , written in Rust, and works on almost any operating system or platform.</p><p>uv is <a href=\"https://docs.astral.sh/uv/#installation\" rel=\"nofollow\">straightforward to install</a>. There are a few ways, but the easiest (in my opinion) is this one-liner command — for Linux and Mac, it’s:</p><pre><code> https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh </code></pre><p>or on Windows in powershell:</p><pre><code>powershell  ByPass </code></pre><p>You can then access uv with the command . <strong>Installing uv will not mess up any of your existing Python installations</strong> — it’s a separate tool, so it’s safe to install it just to try it out.</p><h2>Managing Python for a project</h2><p>It’s always a good idea to work with <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41972261/what-is-a-virtualenv-and-why-should-i-use-one\" rel=\"nofollow\">virtual environments</a> for any Python project. It keeps different bits of code and dependencies ringfenced from one another, and in my experience, it can save  of hassle to get into the habit of using virtual environments as soon as you can. uv naturally uses virtual environments, so it’s very easy to start using them if you get into using uv.</p><p>uv will build a Python environment for you based on what’s specified in a  file in the directory (or parent directories) you’re working in.  files are a <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62983756/what-is-pyproject-toml-file-for\" rel=\"nofollow\">standard, modern format</a> for specifying dependencies for a Python project. A barebones one might look a bit like this:</p><pre><code></code></pre><p>In essence, it just has to specify <strong>which Python version to use</strong> and  Adding a name and version number also aren’t a bad idea.</p><p>(Sidenote: for projects that you publish as packages, such as to the Python Package Index that pip and uv use,  files are a modern way to specify <a href=\"https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/\" rel=\"nofollow\">everything you need</a> to publish your package.)</p><h2>Making a new project with uv</h2><p>To start a new Python project with uv, you can run</p><p>Which will create a new project for you, with a , a , and other important bits of boilerplate.</p><p>There are a lot of different ways to run this command, like  (which only creates a pyproject.toml),  (which sets up a new Python package), and more. I recommend running  to read about them.</p><h2>Once you have/if you already have a  file</h2><p>Once you initialize a project — or if you already have a  file in your project — it’s very easy to start using uv. You just need to do</p><p>in the directory that your  file is in. This command (and in fact, most uv commands if you haven’t ran it already) will:</p><ol><li>Automatically install a valid version of Python</li><li>Install all dependencies to a new virtual environment in the directory </li><li>Create a  file in your directory, which saves the  version of  package installed — meaning that other colleagues can replicate your Python environment exactly.</li></ol><p>In principle, you can ‘activate’ this new virtual environment like any typical virtual environment that you may have seen in other tools, but the most ‘uv-onic’ way to use uv is simply to prepend any command with . This command automatically picks up the correct virtual environment for you and runs your command with it. For instance, to run a script — instead of</p><pre><code> .venv/bin/activate\npython myscript.py</code></pre><p>which will have the same effect. Likewise, to use a ‘tool’ like Jupyter Lab, you can just do</p><p>in your project’s directory, as opposed to first ‘activating’ the environment and then running  separately.</p><p>You can always just edit your  file manually: uv will detect the changes and rebuild your project’s virtual environment. But uv also has easier ways to add dependencies — you can just do</p><p>to add a package, including specifying version constraints (like the above.) This command automatically edits your  for you.  is also extremely powerful for adding remote dependencies from git or elsewhere on your computer (but I won’t get into that here.)</p><p>Finally, I think that one of the most useful things uv can do is to pin a specific Python version for your project. Doing</p><p>would pin the current project to  Python 3.12.9 for you, and anyone else using uv — meaning that you really can replicate the  same Python install across multiple machines.</p><h2>uvx: ignore all of the above and just run a tool, now!</h2><p>But sometimes, you might just want to run a tool quickly — like using Ruff to lint code somewhere, or starting a Jupyter notebook server without an environment, or even just quickly starting an IPython session with pandas installed so you can open up a file. The  command, which has a short alias , makes this insanely easy. Running a command like</p><p>will automatically download the tool you want to use and run it in a one-off virtual environment. Once the tool has been downloaded before, this is lightning-fast because of how uv uses caches.</p><p>There are a lot of occasions when I might want to do this — a common one might be to quickly start an IPython session with pandas installed (using  to add dependencies) so that I can quickly open &amp; look at a parquet file. For instance:</p><pre><code>uvx  pandas,pyarrow ipython</code></pre><p>Or, maybe just starting a Jupyter Lab server so that I can quickly open a Jupyter notebook that a student sent me:</p><p>Or honestly just so many other weird, one-off use cases where  is really nice to have around. <strong>I don’t feel like I’m missing out by always using virtual environments</strong>, because  always gives you a ‘get out of jail free’ card whenever you need it.</p><h2>If that hasn’t sold you: a personal note</h2><p>I first discovered uv last year, while working together with our other lovely developers on building <a href=\"https://astrosky.eco/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Astrosky Ecosystem</a> — a wonderful project to build open-source social media integrations for astronomers online. But with multiple developers all working asynchronously on multiple operating systems, managing Python installations quickly became a huge task.</p><p>uv is an <strong>incredibly powerful simplification</strong> for us that we use across our entire tech stack. As developers, we can all work with identical Python installations, which is especially important given a number of semi-experimental dependencies that we use that have breaking changes with every version. On GitHub Actions, we’re planning to use uv to quickly build a Python environment and run our unit tests. In production, uv already manages Python for all of our servers.</p><p>It’s just  to always know that Python and package installation will  be handled <strong>consistently and correctly</strong> across all of our machines. <strong>That’s why uv is the best thing to happen to the Python ecosystem in a decade.</strong></p>",

Stay tuned!</p><p>First, let’s explore the dithering basics with this grayscale image example.</p><p>A grayscale image has various gray shades, from black to white.</p><p>Imagine a display that only shows black or white pixels, no grays. We must turn some pixels black and others white—but how?</p><p>One way is to map each pixel to the closest available color.</p><p>Pixels darker than medium gray turn black and lighter ones turn white.</p><p>This splits pixels into black or white groups.</p><p>However, this creates a harsh image with abrupt black-white transitions.</p><p>Shadow details vanish as gray pixels become fully black or white.</p><p>Dithering fixes this by selectively pushing some pixels towards the opposite color.</p><p>Some light gray pixels that are closer to white turn black.</p><p>Likewise, some dark grays turn white.</p><p>And it's done in a way that produces special patterns which simulate shades by varying the black-and-white pixel densities.</p><p>Denser black pixels are used in darker areas, while denser white pixels are used in lighter ones.</p><p>Next question: How are these patterns generated?</p><p>One simple dithering method, known as ordered dithering, uses a threshold map.</p><p>A threshold map is a grid of values representing brightness levels, from 0 (darkest) to 1 (brightest).</p><p>To dither, we compare each input pixel’s brightness to a corresponding threshold value.</p><p>If a pixel’s brightness exceeds the threshold (it’s brighter than the threshold), the pixel turns white. Otherwise, it turns black.</p><p>Repeating this for all pixels gives us the black-and-white dither patterns.</p><p>The threshold map is designed to output patterns where the black-and-white pixel density matches the input image’s shades.</p><p>So brighter input produces patterns with more white, while darker input produces more black.</p><p>These black-and-white density variations are what create the illusion of gray shades when viewed from a distance.</p><p>To dither larger images, we extend the threshold map to match the image size and follow the same principle:</p><p>Compare each pixel’s brightness to the threshold map, then turn it black or white accordingly.</p><p>The image now uses only two colors, but its overall appearance is preserved.</p><p>The variations in shades are now replaced by variations in black/white pixel density of the dithering patterns.</p><p>And that’s how dithering works in a nutshell: it replicates shades with fewer colors, which are strategically placed to maintain the original look.</p><p>I find it a bit ironic how I used to think dithering ‘adds’ a cool effect, when what it actually does is ‘remove’ colors!</p><p>That's all for now! We’ve reached the end, but there’s still a lot more to explore.</p><p>For example, we haven’t explored the algorithm to create a threshold map. (spoiler: there are many ways!)</p><p>There’s also another algorithm called error diffusion, which doesn’t use a threshold map.</p><p>Each algorithm creates a distinct, unique look, which I believe deserves its own article.</p><p>And that's why I decided to break this series into three parts.</p><p>In the next part, I’ll dive into various algorithms for creating threshold maps.</p><p>In the final part, I’ll focus on the error diffusion algorithm.</p><p>We'll dive even deeper into dithering's mechanisms in these next 2 parts, so stay tuned!</p><p>visualrambling.space is a personal project by Damar, someone who loves to learn about different topics and rambling about them visually.</p><p>If you like this kind of visual article, please consider following me on X/Twitter and sharing this with your friends.</p><p>I'll keep creating more visual articles like this!</p><p>https://x.com/damarberlari</p>",

      "content": "<p>Tailscale Peer Relays provides a customer-deployed and managed traffic relaying mechanism. By advertising itself as a peer relay, a Tailscale node can relay traffic for any peer nodes on the tailnet, even for traffic bound to itself. Tailscale Peer Relays can only relay traffic for nodes on your tailnet, and only for nodes that have access to the peer relay. Because they’re managed entirely by the customer, peer relays are less throughput-constrained than Tailscale’s managed DERP relays, and can provide higher throughput connections for traffic to and from locked-down cloud infrastructure, or behind strict network firewalls.</p><p>In testing with early design partners, we’ve seen throughputs nearing that of a direct connection; often multiple orders of magnitude higher than Tailscale’s managed DERP fleet.</p><p>While we’ve been keeping your network reliably connected for years with <a target=\"\" rel=\"noreferrer\" href=\"https://tailscale.com/kb/1232/derp-servers\">DERP</a>, we’ve heard from customers that the throughput and performance aspects of a QoS-aware managed relay fleet makes deployments in certain environments difficult or untenable. Furthermore, customers have noted that it’s non-trivial to deploy and manage <a target=\"\" rel=\"noreferrer\" href=\"https://tailscale.com/kb/1232/derp-servers#custom-derp-servers\">custom DERP fleets</a> (which run as a separate service and binary).</p><p>DERP provides an incredibly valuable service, setting up reliable connections between Tailscale clients anywhere in the world (including negotiating connections through peer relays). But often, DERP’s focus as a reliability and NAT traversal tool results in performance tradeoffs.</p><p>By contrast, Tailscale Peer Relays is designed as a performant connectivity tool, and can perform at a level rivaling direct connections. Peer relays can be placed right next to the resources they serve, and peer relays also run on top of UDP, both characteristics beneficial to lower latency and resource overhead. And, they are built into the Tailscale client itself for ease of deployment.</p><p>We want to move past even more hard NATs, and put Tailscale’s relaying technology in our customers’ hands, so they can use Tailscale at scale, anywhere, with ease. We believe our new Tailscale Peer Relays connectivity option—unique to Tailscale—gives customers the best performance and flexibility.</p><p>Peer relays are configured with a single UDP port that must be available to both sides of a connection. Tailscale Peer Relays is built right into the Tailscale client, and can be enabled with a simple command, using the <code>tailscale set --relay-server-port</code> flag from the Tailscale CLI. Once enabled via <a target=\"\" rel=\"noreferrer\" href=\"https://tailscale.com/kb/1591/peer-relays?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=fall-update-2025 \">the steps in our documentation</a>, clients can connect to infrastructure in hard NAT environments over the peer relay.</p><p><strong>And don’t worry, we still prefer to fly direct.</strong> Tailscale prefers direct connections wherever possible. Clients can then fall back to available peer relays, and finally leverage Tailscale’s managed DERP fleet, or any customer-deployed custom DERPs, to ensure you have connectivity wherever you need it. All of this traffic, over any connection, is still end-to-end encrypted via WireGuard®.</p><p>Tailscale Peer Relays is designed for the real world, based on the feedback we’ve received from customers and our own hard-earned networking expertise. It allows customers to make just one firewall exception for connections only coming from their tailnet. Peer relays scale across regions, are resilient to real-world network conditions, and graciously fall back to DERP (Tailscale’s or custom). Your network maintains its shape, but gains all kinds of flexibility.</p><p>Customers can now maintain performance benchmarks even where direct connections aren’t possible, by enabling Tailscale Peer Relays to build a deterministic and high-throughput relay topology.</p><p>We’ve had customers use peer relays to provide access into unmanaged networks, allowing their partners or customers to provide a controllable and auditable connectivity path without sacrificing performance.</p><p>In strict private networks, customers can build predictable access paths. Tailscale Peer Relays can be placed in public subnets with VPC peering to private subnets, allowing security teams to efficiently segment their private network infrastructure, while enabling networking teams to roll Tailscale out in full-mesh mode across the subnet.</p><p>Today, customers are using peer relays to establish relayed connections at near-direct speeds across a variety of environments and settings.</p><ul><li><strong>Enable high-throughput traffic through cloud NATs, like AWS Managed NAT Gateways:</strong> Applications and services behind a Managed NAT Gateway can leverage peer relays to relay traffic that can’t establish direct connections.</li><li><strong>Relay through network firewalls:</strong> Workloads running in strictly firewalled environments can predictably expose a single UDP port, limiting the Tailscale surface area and fast-tracking the approval process for firewall exceptions.</li><li><strong>Offload from Custom and Managed DERP: </strong>Minimize data-in-transit through Tailscale‘s managed DERP network, and remove the need for customer-maintained DERP servers.</li><li><strong>Provide access to locked down customer networks: </strong>Data plane traffic can be relayed through predictable endpoints in customer networks, so that they only need to open minimal numbers of ports to facilitate cross network connections.</li></ul><p>Tailscale Peer Relays is available today as a public beta. We’ve yet to establish all the connectivity paths we want to, and there’s still visibility and debugging improvements to work through. However, we’ve reliably seen our early design partners move to peer relay deployments with relative ease, and we’re ready for you to give it a try on your tailnet.</p><p>Tailscale Peer Relays can be enabled on all plans, including free (it’s our little way of working through the kinks of the modern internet with our customers). All customers can use two peer relays, for free, forever. As your needs scale, so will the number of available peer relays.

      "content": "<div><p>Do you like to mod Java, tinker with builds, or take deep dives into Minecraft’s code? Then this article is for you!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>For a long time, Java Edition has used obfuscation (hiding parts of the code) – a common practice in the gaming industry. Now we’re changing how we ship Minecraft: Java Edition to remove obfuscation completely. We hope that, with this change, we can pave a future for Minecraft: Java Edition where it’s easier to create, update, and debug mods.&nbsp;</p><p>Minecraft: Java Edition has been obfuscated since its release. This obfuscation meant that people couldn’t see our source code. Instead, everything was scrambled – and those who wanted to mod Java Edition had to try and piece together what every class and function in the code did.&nbsp;</p><p>But we encourage people to get creative both in Minecraft and with Minecraft – so in 2019 we tried to make this tedious process a little easier by releasing “obfuscation mappings”. These mappings were essentially a long list that allowed people to match the obfuscated terms to un-obfuscated terms. This alleviated the issue a little, as modders didn’t need to puzzle out what everything did, or what it should be called anymore. But why stop there?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Removing obfuscation in Java Edition&nbsp;</h2><p>To make things even easier – and remove these intermediary steps – we’re removing obfuscation altogether! Starting with the first snapshot following the complete Mounts of Mayhem launch, we will no longer obfuscate Minecraft: Java Edition. This means that this build (and all future builds) will have all of our original names* – now with variable names and other names – included by default to make modding even easier.&nbsp;</p></div>",

      "content": "<p>Composer is our new agent model designed for software engineering intelligence and speed. On our benchmarks, the model achieves frontier coding results with generation speed four times faster than similar models.</p><p>We achieve these results by training the model to complete real-world software engineering challenges in large codebases. During training, Composer is given access to a set of production search and editing tools and tasked with efficiently solving a diverse range of difficult problems. The final result is a large-scale model optimized for high-speed use as an agent in Cursor.</p><p>Our motivation comes from our experience developing Cursor Tab, our custom completion model. We found that often developers want the smartest model that can support interactive use, keeping them in the flow of coding. In our development process, we experimented with a prototype agent model, codenamed Cheetah, to better understand the impact of faster agent models. Composer is a smarter version of this model that keeps coding delightful by being fast enough for an interactive experience.</p><p>Composer is a mixture-of-experts (MoE) language model supporting long-context generation and understanding. It is specialized for software engineering through reinforcement learning (RL) in a diverse range of development environments. At each iteration of training, the model is given a problem description and instructed to produce the best response, be it a code edit, a plan, or an informative answer. The model has access to simple tools, like reading and editing files, and also more powerful ones like terminal commands and codebase-wide semantic search.</p><p>To measure progress, we constructed an evaluation that measures a model's usefulness to a software developer as faithfully as possible. Our benchmark, Cursor Bench, consists of real agent requests from engineers and researchers at Cursor, along with hand-curated optimal solutions to these requests. The resulting evaluation measures not just the agent’s correctness, but also its adherence to a codebase's existing abstractions and software engineering practices.</p><p>Reinforcement learning allows us to actively specialize the model for effective software engineering. Since response speed is a critical component for interactive development, we incentivize the model to make efficient choices in tool use and to maximize parallelism whenever possible. In addition, we train the model to be a helpful assistant by minimizing unnecessary responses and claims made without evidence. We also find that during RL, the model learns useful behaviors on its own like performing complex searches, fixing linter errors, and writing and executing unit tests.</p><p>Efficient training of large MoE models requires significant investment into building infrastructure and systems research. We built custom training infrastructure leveraging PyTorch and Ray to power asynchronous reinforcement learning at scale. We natively train our models at low precision by combining our <a href=\"https://cursor.com/blog/kernels\">MXFP8 MoE kernels</a> with expert parallelism and hybrid sharded data parallelism, allowing us to scale training to thousands of NVIDIA GPUs with minimal communication cost. Additionally, training with MXFP8 allows us to deliver faster inference speeds without requiring post-training quantization.</p><p>During RL, we want our model to be able to call any tool in the Cursor Agent harness. These tools allow editing code, using semantic search, grepping strings, and running terminal commands. At our scale, teaching the model to effectively call these tools requires running hundreds of thousands of concurrent sandboxed coding environments in the cloud. To support this workload, we adapted existing infrastructure we built for Background Agents, rewriting our virtual machine scheduler to support the bursty nature and scale of training runs. This enabled seamless unification of RL environments with production environments.</p><p>Cursor builds tools for software engineering, and we make heavy use of the tools we develop. A motivation of Composer development has been developing an agent we would reach for in our own work. In recent weeks, we have found that many of our colleagues were using Composer for their day-to-day software development. With this release, we hope that you also find it to be a valuable tool.</p><p><em>¹ Benchmarked on an internal benchmark in the Cursor tool harness. We group models into classes based on score and report the best model in each class. \"Fast Frontier\" includes models designed for efficient inference such as Haiku 4.5 and Gemini Flash 2.5. \"Best Open\" includes recent open weight model releases such as Qwen Coder and GLM 4.6. \"Frontier 7/2025\" is the best model available in July of this year.  \"Best Frontier\" includes GPT-5 and Sonnet 4.5, which both outperform Composer.

      "content": "<blockquote><p>TLDR: Yes, you can fit about 7 seconds of audio into 16K of flash and still have room for code. And you can even play LPC encoded audio on a 10 cent MCU.</p></blockquote><p>There’s quite a lot more detail in this video (and of course you can hear the audio!).</p><p>In the <a href=\"https://www.atomic14.com/2025/10/12/CH32V003-music\">previous project</a>, I had this ultra-cheap CH32V003 microcontroller playing simple tunes on a tiny SMD buzzer. It was just toggling a GPIO pin at musical note frequencies – 1-bit audio output – and it sounded surprisingly decent. That was a fun start, but now it’s time to push this little $0.10 MCU even further: can we make it actually talk?</p><p>Spoiler: Yes, we can! (well, there wouldn’t be much of a blog post if we couldn’t) This 8-pin RISC-V chip is now producing sampled audio data and spoken words. We’re really stretching the limits of what you can fit in 16 KB of flash.</p><h2>From Beeps to Actual Audio</h2><p>Moving from simple beeps to real audio meant using the microcontroller’s PWM output as a rudimentary DAC. Instead of just on/off beeping, I’m driving a waveform at an 8 kHz sample rate using a high-frequency PWM on the output pin. The hardware is the same tiny board as before\n – but I’ve swapped the small SMD buzzer for a small speaker. The buzer works too, but it’s quieter and very tinny.</p><p>The sample I wanted to test with is just over 6 seconds in length - it’s the iconic “Open the pod bay doors HAL…” sequence from 2001.</p><p>If we keep this audio at 16-bit PCM, 8kHZ, we’d need about 96KB – way beyond our 16 KB flash! And remember, that 16 KB has to hold both the audio data and our playback code. Clearly some aggressive compression is required.</p><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table><p>I considered a few encoding options for compressing the audio.</p><ul><li> Simply using 8-bit samples at 8 kHz cuts size in half (to ~47 KB for 6s), but that’s still about 3× too large for our flash.</li><li> Adaptive Differential PCM is a simple lossy compression that could quarter the size. In theory 6 seconds would be ~24 KB – much closer to fitting,</li><li> This is nice codec that packs audio into about 3.2 bits per sample (roughly 1/5 the size of 16-bit PCM)</li><li> Going even further with ADPCM, using only 2 bits per sample gives a 4:1 compression relative to 8-bit audio – that’s 75% storage savings.</li></ul><p>2-bit ADPCM is definitely the winner here. Our 6-second clip shrinks to under 12 KB, which comfortably fits in flash with room for code. This looked like the winner, provided the audio quality was acceptable. The decoder for 2-bit ADPCM is also very lightweight (my implementation compiled to under just over 1K of code - 1340 bytes!). It’s definitely low quality - but it actually sounds surprisingly ok.</p><h2>How does 2-bit ADPCM work?</h2><p>It’s actually a very simple algorithm. Both the encoder and decoder maintain a predicted signal value and a step size index into a predefined table. Each 2-bit code tells the decoder how to adjust the current prediction and the step size index. In essence, we’re coding the difference between the real audio and our prediction, with only four possible levels (since 2 bits gives 4 values). After each sample, the algorithm adapts: if the prediction error was large, we move to a bigger step size (to allow larger changes); if the error was small, we use a smaller step size for finer resolution. This adaptive step is what makes it ADPCM (Adaptive Differential PCM).</p><p>Our codes are as follows:</p><ul><li> (0): Go down by 1 step - subtract the step size from our current prediction</li><li> (1): Go up by 1 step - add the step size to our current prediction</li><li> (2): Go down by 2 steps - subtract the 2 x step size from our current prediction</li><li> (3): Go up by 2 steps - add the 2 x step size to our current prediction</li></ul><p>Even with this very high level of compression, the predicted waveform manages to track the original audio surprisingly well. The above graph shows a small snippet of the audio: the blue line is the original waveform and the yellow line is the ADPCM decoder’s output.</p><p>They’re not identical (and we wouldn’t expect them to be), but the general shape is preserved. When you play it back through the little speaker, it’s recognizable and surprisingly good.</p><p>To make my life easier, I built a quick conversion <a href=\"https://buzzer-studio.atomic14.com\">tool</a> to encode WAV files into this 2-bit ADPCM format. The tool lets me drag-and-drop a WAV, and it gives you the files with the data that can ve dropped into the firmware code.</p><p>Six seconds of audio is cool, but what about longer phrases or even arbitrary speech? Storing anything much longer with raw or ADPCM audio would quickly fill the 16K of flash.</p><p>For my second experiment, I tried something different: instead of recorded waveform audio, I used an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments_LPC_Speech_Chips\">old-school speech synthesis approach</a>. This leverages the fact that spoken language can be encoded very compactly by modeling the human voice, rather than storing the raw sound. Specifically, I integrated a library called <a href=\"https://github.com/going-digital/Talkie/tree/master/Talkie\">Talkie</a>.</p><p>Talkie is a software implementation of the Texas Instruments LPC speech synthesis architecture from the late 1970s. This was implemented in a variety of chips, most commonly the TMS5220 and TMS5100 speech chips.</p><p>These were used in things like the original Speak &amp; Spell, arcade games like early Star Wars, and speech add-ons for home computers (e.g. the BBC Micro).</p><p>The Talkie library (originally by <a href=\"https://github.com/going-digital/Talkie/tree/master/Talkie\">Peter Knight</a>, later added to by <a href=\"https://learn.adafruit.com/bringing-back-the-voice-of-speak-spell/software\">Adafruit</a>) comes with a big set of examples and vocabulary. It’s also possible to extract examples from old ROMs from arcade games.</p><p>Each phrase or word only takes a few hundred bytes or even less, so you can fit quite a lot of speech into a few kilobytes of flash. The trade-off is that the voice has a very computer-esque timbre – think of the Speak &amp; Spell’s voice. It’s clearly synthetic, but still understandable.</p><p>To say custom sentences not in the library, you either concatenate the available words/phonemes (which can be clunky), or you need to generate new LPC data. The original tools for this are a bit obscure – there’s BlueWizard (a classic Mac app) and PythonWizard (a command-line tool with TK GUI) which can analyze WAV files and produce LPC data.</p><p>I gave both a try with some success (and a few headaches setting them up). In the end, I cheated a bit and used an AI coding assistant to help me create a streamlined online tool for this.</p><p>The result is a little <a href=\"http://buzzer-studio.atomic14.com\">web app</a> where I can upload a recording of, say, my own voice, and it outputs the LPC data. It even lets me play back the synthesized voice in-browser to check it.</p><p>So there we have it – our 10¢ microcontroller now has a voice! By using 2-bit ADPCM compression, we can store short audio clips (up to around 8 seconds) even in 16 KB of flash, and play them back via PWM with decent fidelity.</p><p>And with the Talkie LPC speech synthesis, we can make the device “speak” lots of words and phrases with only a tiny memory footprint.</p><p>If you want to hear it for yourself, check out the video demo linked at the top of this post. In the video, you’ll see (and hear) the WarGames clip and the Star Wars quotes running on the hardware. It’s honestly amazing what these cheap little MCUs can do. We’re really pushing the boundaries of cheap hardware here.</p><p>You can find all my code on GitHub in this <a href=\"https://github.com/atomic14/ch32v003-audio\">repository</a>.</p>",

They tend to fall for all the purported benefits the sales pitch gives them - real-time, infinitely scale, cutting-edge, cloud-native, serverless, zero-trust, AI-powered, etc.</p><p>You see this everywhere in the Kafka world: Streaming Lakehouse™️, Kappa™️ Architecture, Streaming AI Agents.</p><p>This phenomenon is sometimes known as . Modern practices actively encourage this. Consultants push “innovative architectures” stuffed with vendor tech via “insight” reports. System design interviews expect you to design Google-scale architectures that are inevitably at a scale 100x higher than the company you’re interviewing for would ever need. Career progression rewards you for replatforming to the Hot New Stack™️, not for being resourceful.</p><ol start=\"2\"><li>The other camp chases common sense</li></ol><p>This camp is far more pragmatic. They strip away unnecessary complexity and steer clear of overengineered solutions. They reason from first principles before making technology choices. They resist marketing hype and approach vendor claims with healthy skepticism.</p><p>Historically, it has felt like Camp 1 definitively held the upper hand in sheer numbers and noise. Today, it feels like the pendulum may be beginning to swing back, at least a tiny bit. Two recent trends are on the side of Camp 2:</p><p>Trend 1 - the “<a href=\"https://topicpartition.io/Small-Data\" data-slug=\"Small-Data\">Small Data</a>” movement. People are realizing two things - their data isn’t that big and their computers are becoming big too. You can rent a <a href=\"https://instances.vantage.sh/aws/ec2/x1e.xlarge\">128-core, 4 TB of RAM instance</a> from AWS. AMD just released 192-core CPUs this summer. That ought to be enough for anybody.</p><p>Trend 2 - the Postgres Renaissance. The space is seeing incredible growth and investment. In the last 2 years, the phrase <a href=\"https://github.com/Olshansk/postgres_for_everything\">“Just Use Postgres (for everything)”</a> has gained a ton of popularity. The basic premise is that you shouldn’t complicate things with new tech when you don’t need to, and that Postgres alone solves most problems pretty well. Postgres competes with purpose-built solutions like:</p><ul><li>Elasticsearch (functionality supported by Postgres’ /)</li><li>Redis ()</li><li>AI Vector Databases (, )</li><li>Snowflake (, )</li></ul><p>The claim isn’t that Postgres is functionally equivalent to any of these specialized systems. The claim is that it handles 80%+ of their use cases with 20% of the development effort. (Pareto Principle)</p><p>When you combine the two trends, the appeal becomes obvious. Postgres is a battle-tested, well-known system that is simple, scalable and reliable. Pair it with today’s powerful hardware and you quickly begin to realize that, more often than not, you do not need the state-of-the-art highly optimized and complex distributed system in order to handle your organization’s scale.</p><p><strong>A 500 KB/s workload should not use Kafka.</strong> There is a scalability cargo cult in tech that always wants to choose “the best possible” tech for a problem - but this misses the forest for the trees. The “best possible” solution frequently isn’t a technical question - it’s a practical one. Adriano makes an airtight case for why you should opt for  in his <a href=\"https://adriano.fyi/posts/2023-09-24-choose-postgres-queue-technology\">PG as Queue blog</a> (2023) that originally inspired me to write this.</p><p>Enough background. In this article, we will do three simple things:</p><p>I am not aiming for an exhaustive in-depth evaluation. Benchmarks are messy af. Rather, my goal is to publish some reasonable data points which can start a discussion.</p><p><em>(while this article is for Postgres, feel free to replace it with your database of choice)</em></p><p>If you’d like to skip straight to the results, here they are:</p><p>There are dozens of blogs out there using Postgres as a , but interestingly enough I haven’t seen one use it as a pub-sub messaging system.</p><p>A quick distinction between the two because I often see them get confused:</p><ol><li><p> are meant for point-to-point communication. They’re widely used for asynchronous background jobs: worker apps (clients) process a task in the queue like sending an e-mail or pushing a notification. The event is consumed once and it’s done with. A message is immediately deleted (popped) off the queue once it’s consumed. Queues do not have strict ordering guarantees.</p></li><li><p> messaging differs from the queue in that it is meant for one-to-many communication. This inherently means there is a large read fanout - more than one reader client is interested in any given message. Good pub-sub systems decouple readers from writers by storing data on disks. This allows them to not impose a max queue depth limit - something in-memory queues need to do in order to prevent them from going OOM.</p><p>There is also a general expectation that there is strict order - events should be read in the same order that they arrived in the system.</p></li></ol><p>Postgres’ main competitor here is Kafka, which is the standard in pub-sub today. Various (mostly-proprietary) alternatives exist.</p><p>Kafka uses the Log data structure to hold messages. You’ll see my benchmark basically reconstructs a log from Postgres primitives.</p><p>Postgres doesn’t seem to have any popular libraries for pub-sub use cases, so I had to write my own. The Kafka-inspired workflow I opted for is this:</p><ol><li>Writers produce batches of messages per statement (). Each transaction carries one batch insert and targets a single  table</li><li>Each writer is sticky to one table, but in aggregate they produce to multiple tables.</li><li>Each message has a unique monotonically-increasing offset number. A specific row in a special  table denotes the latest offset for a given  table.</li><li>Write transactions atomically update both the  data and the  row. This ensures consistent offset tracking across concurrent writers.</li><li>Readers poll for new messages. They consume the  table(s) sequentially, starting from the lowest offset and progressively reading up.</li><li>Readers are split into consumer groups. Each group performs separate, independent reads and makes progress on the  tables.</li><li>Each group contains 1 reader per  table.</li><li>Readers store their progress in a  table, with a row for each  pair.</li><li>Each reader updates the latest processed offset (claiming the records), selects the records and processes them inside a single transaction.</li></ol><p>This ensures Kafka-like semantics - gapless, monotonically-increasing offsets and at-least-once/at-most-once processing. This test in particular uses at-least-once semantics, but neither choice should impact the benchmark results.</p><figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=\"\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"sql\" data-theme=\"github-light github-dark\"><code data-language=\"sql\" data-theme=\"github-light github-dark\"></code></pre></figure><p>The benchmark runs  writer goroutines. These represent writer clients.\nEach one loops and atomically inserts  records while updating the latest offset:</p><figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=\"\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"sql\" data-theme=\"github-light github-dark\"><code data-language=\"sql\" data-theme=\"github-light github-dark\"></code></pre></figure><p>The benchmark also runs  reader goroutines. Each reader is assigned a particular consumer group and partition. The group as a whole reads all partitions while each reader in the group reads only one partition at a time.</p><p>The reader loops, opens a transaction, optimistically claims  records (by advancing the offset mark beyond them), selects them and processes the records.\nIf successful, it commits the transaction and through that advances the offset for the group.</p><p>It is a pull-based read (just like Kafka), rather than push-based. If the reader has no records to poll, it sleeps for a bit.</p><p>First it opens a transaction:</p><p>Then it claims the offsets:</p><figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=\"\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"sql\" data-theme=\"github-light github-dark\"><code data-language=\"sql\" data-theme=\"github-light github-dark\"></code></pre></figure><p>Followed by selecting the claimed records:</p><figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=\"\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"sql\" data-theme=\"github-light github-dark\"><code data-language=\"sql\" data-theme=\"github-light github-dark\"></code></pre></figure><p>Finally, the data gets processed by the business logic (no-op in our benchmark) and the transaction is closed:</p><p>If you’re wondering  - my understanding of that feature is that it’s an optimization and cannot be fully relied upon, so polling is required either way. Given that, I just copied Kafka’s relatively simple design.</p><p>The full code and detailed results are all published on GitHub at <a href=\"https://github.com/stanislavkozlovski/pg-queue-pubsub-benchmark\">stanislavkozlovski/pg-queue-pubsub-benchmark</a>.\nI ran three setups - a single-node 4 vCPU, a 3-node replicated 4 vCPU and a single-node 96 vCPU setup. Here are the summarized results for each:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://instances.vantage.sh/aws/ec2/c7i.xlarge\">c7i.xlarge</a> Postgres server /w 25GB gp3 9000 IOPS EBS volume</li><li>mostly default Postgres settings (synchronous commit, fsync);\n<ul><li><code>autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor = 0.05</code> set on the partition tables too (unclear if it has an effect)</li></ul></li><li>each row’s payload is 1 KiB (1024 bytes)</li><li>10 writers (2 writers per partition on average)</li><li>5x read fanout via 5 consumer groups</li><li>20 reader clients total (4 readers per group)</li><li>write batch size: 100 records</li><li>read batch size: 200 records</li></ul><ul><li><p>write message rate: </p></li><li><p>write throughput: </p></li><li><p>write latency: 38.7ms p99 / 6.2ms p95</p></li><li><p>read message rate: </p></li><li><p>read message throughput: </p></li><li><p>read latency: 27.3ms p99 (varied 8.9ms-47ms b/w runs); 4.67ms p95</p></li><li><p>end-to-end latency:  / 10.6ms p95</p></li><li><p>disk was at ~1200 writes/s with iostat claiming 46 MiB/s</p></li></ul><p>These are pretty good results. It’s funny to think that the majority of people run a complex distributed system like Kafka for similar workloads.</p><p>Now, a replicated setup to more accurately mimic the durability and availability guarantees of Kafka.</p><ul><li>3x <a href=\"https://instances.vantage.sh/aws/ec2/c7i.xlarge\">c7i.xlarge</a> Postgres servers /w 25GB gp3 9000 IOPS EBS volume\n<ul><li>each on a separate AZ (us-east-1a, us-east-1b, us-east-1c)</li><li>one  replica and one  replica</li></ul></li><li>a few custom Postgres settings like , , , <code>max_parallel_workers_per_gather</code> and of course - <ul><li><code>autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor = 0.05</code> set on the partition tables too (unclear if it has an effect)</li></ul></li><li>each row’s payload is 1 KiB (1024 bytes)</li><li>10 writers (2 writers per partition on average)</li><li>5x read fanout via 5 consumer groups</li><li>readers only access the primary DB; readers are in the same AZ as the primary;</li><li>20 reader clients total (4 readers per group)</li><li>write batch size: 100 records</li><li>read batch size: 200 records</li></ul><ul><li><p>write message rate: </p></li><li><p>write throughput: </p></li><li><p>write latency: 153.45ms p99 / 6.8ms p95</p></li><li><p>read message rate: </p></li><li><p>read message throughput: </p></li><li><p>read latency: 57ms p99; 4.91ms p95</p></li><li><p>end-to-end latency:  / 12ms p95</p></li><li><p>disk was at ~1200 writes/s with iostat claiming 46 MiB/s</p></li></ul><p>Now these are astonishing results! Throughput was not impacted at all. Latency increased but not extremely. Our p99 e2e latency 3x’d (60ms vs 185ms), but the p95 barely moved from 10.6ms to 12ms.</p><p>This shows that a simple 3-node Postgres cluster can pretty easily sustain what is a very common Kafka workload - 5 MB/s ingest and 25 MB/s egress. Not only that, but for a cheap cost too. Just $11,514 per year.</p><p>Typically, you’d expect Postgres to run more expensive than Kafka at a certain scale, simply because it wasn’t designed to be efficient for this use case.\nNot here though. Running Kafka yourself would cost the same. Running the same workload through a Kafka vendor will cost you at least $50,000 a year. 🤯</p><p>By the way, in Kafka it’s customary to apply client-side compression on your data. If we assume your messages were 5 KB in size and your clients applied a pretty regular compression ratio of 4x - Postgres is actually handling 20 MB/s ingress and 100 MB/s egress.</p><p>Ok, let’s see how far Postgres will go.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://instances.vantage.sh/aws/ec2/c7i.24xlarge\">c7i.24xlarge</a> (96 vCPU, 192 GiB RAM) Postgres server instance /w 250GB io2 12,000 IOPS EBS volume</li><li>modified Postgres settings ( on, other settings scaled to match the machine);\n<ul><li>still kept fsync &amp; synchronous_commit on for durability.</li><li><code>autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor = 0.05</code> set on the partition tables too (unclear if it has an effect)</li></ul></li><li>each row’s payload is 1 KiB (1024 bytes)</li><li>100 writers (~3.33 writers per partition on average)</li><li>5x read fanout via 5 consumer groups</li><li>150 reader clients total (5 readers per group)</li><li>write batch size: 200 records</li><li>read batch size: 200 records</li></ul><ul><li><p>write message rate: </p></li><li><p>write throughput: </p></li><li><p>write latency: 138ms p99 / 47ms p95</p></li><li><p>read message rate: </p></li><li><p>read message throughput: </p></li><li><p>end-to-end latency:  / 242ms p95 / 23.4ms p50</p></li><li><p>server kept at  CPU (basically idle);</p></li><li><p>bottleneck: The bottleneck was the write rate per partition. It seems like the test wasn’t able to write at a higher rate than 8 MiB/s (8k msg/s) per table with this design. I didn’t push further, but I do wonder now as I write this - how far would writes have scaled?</p><ul><li>Reads were trivial to scale. Adding more consumer groups was trivial - I tried with 10x fanout and still ran at low CPU. I didn’t include it because I didn’t feel the need to push to an unrealistic read-fanout extreme.</li></ul></li></ul><p>240 MiB/s ingress and 1.16 GiB/s egress are pretty good! The 96 vCPU machine was overkill for this test - it could have done a lot more, or we could have simply opted for a smaller machine. For what it’s worth, I do think it’s worth it to deploy a separate Kafka cluster at this scale. Kafka can save you a lot of money here because it can be more efficient in how it handles cross-zone network traffic with features like <a href=\"https://blog.2minutestreaming.com/p/diskless-kafka-topics-kip-1150\">Diskless Kafka</a>.</p><p>These tests seem to show that Postgres is pretty competitive with Kafka at low scale.</p><p>You may have noticed none of these tests were particularly long-running. From my understanding, the value in longer-running tests is to test table vacuuming in Postgres, as that can have negative performance effects. In the pub-sub section, vacuuming doesn’t apply because the tables are append-only. My other reasoning for running shorter tests was to keep costs in check and not spend too much time.</p><p>In any case, no benchmark is perfect. My goal wasn’t to indisputably prove . Rather, I want to start a discussion by showing that what’s possible is likely larger than what most people assume. I certainly didn’t assume I’d get such good numbers, especially with the pub-sub part.</p><p>In Postgres, a queue can be implemented with <code>SELECT FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED</code>. This command selects an unlocked row and locks it. It also skips reading already-locked rows. That’s how mutual exclusion is achieved - a worker can’t get other workers’ jobs.</p><p>Postgres has a very popular <a href=\"https://github.com/pgmq/pgmq\">pgmq</a> library that offers a slick queue API. To keep it simple and understand the end-to-end flow better, I decided to write my own queue. The basic version of it is very easy. My workflow is:</p><ol><li>lock row &amp; take job (<code>SELECT FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED</code>)</li><li>process job ()</li><li>mark job as “done” ( a field or  the row into a separate table)</li></ol><p>Postgres competes with RabbitMQ, AWS SQS, NATS, Redis and to an extent Kafka here.</p><p>We use a simple  table. When an element is processed off the queue, it’s moved into the archive table.</p><figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=\"\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"sql\" data-theme=\"github-light github-dark\"><code data-language=\"sql\" data-theme=\"github-light github-dark\"></code></pre></figure><p>We again run  writer client goroutines.\nEach one simply loops and sequentially inserts a single random item into the table:</p><figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=\"\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"sql\" data-theme=\"github-light github-dark\"><code data-language=\"sql\" data-theme=\"github-light github-dark\"></code></pre></figure><p>It only inserts one message per statement, which is pretty inefficient at scale.</p><p>We again run  reader client goroutines.

Here are the summarized results for each:</p><p><small><em>The results are the average of two 15-minute tests. I also ran three 2-minute tests. They all performed similarly.</em></small></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://instances.vantage.sh/aws/ec2/c7i.xlarge\">c7i.xlarge</a> Postgres server /w 25GB gp3 9000 IOPS EBS volume</li><li>all default Postgres settings</li><li>each row’s payload is 1 KiB (1024 bytes)</li><li>10 writer clients, 15 reader clients</li></ul><ul><li>write latency: 2.46ms p99</li><li>end-to-end latency: 17.72ms p99</li></ul><p>What I found Postgres wasn’t good at was handling client count. The bottleneck in this setup was the read clients. Each client could not read more than ~192 messages a second because of its median read latency and sequential read nature.</p><p>Increasing client count boosted throughput but violated my ~60% CPU target. Trying to run 50 write and 50 read clients got to 4000 msg/s without increasing the queue depth but pegged the server’s CPU to 100%. I wanted to keep the benchmarks realistic for what you may run in production, rather than maxing out what a machine can do. This would be easily alleviated with a connection pooler (standard across all prod PG deployments) or a larger machine.</p><p>Another thing worth mentioning is that the workload could sustain a lot more writes than reads. If I didn’t throttle the benchmark, it would write at 12,000 msg/s and read at 2,800 msg/s. In the spirit of simplicity, I didn’t debug further and instead throttled my writes to see at what point I could get a stable 1:1 workload.</p><ul><li>3x <a href=\"https://instances.vantage.sh/aws/ec2/c7i.xlarge\">c7i.xlarge</a> Postgres servers /w 25GB gp3 9000 IOPS EBS volume\n<ul><li>each on a separate AZ (us-east-1a, us-east-1b, us-east-1c)</li><li>one  replica and one  replica</li></ul></li><li>a few custom Postgres settings like , , , <code>max_parallel_workers_per_gather</code> and of course - </li><li>each row’s payload is 1 KiB (1024 bytes)</li><li>10 writer clients, 15 reader clients</li><li>readers only access the primary DB; readers are in the same AZ as the primary;</li></ul><ul><li>end-to-end latency: 920ms p99 ⚠️; 536ms p95; 7ms p50</li></ul><p>As expected, throughput and latency were impacted somewhat.

There is some bottleneck in the single-table queue approach at this scale which I didn’t bother figuring out. I figured that it wasn’t important to reach absurd numbers on a single table, since all realistic scenarios would have multiple queues and never reach 20,000 msg/s on a single one. The 96 vCPU instance would likely scale far further were we to run a few separate queue tables in parallel.</p><p>Even a modest Postgres node can durably push thousands of queue ops/sec, which already covers the scale 99% of companies ever hit with a single queue.\nAs I said earlier, the last 2 years have seen the Just Use Postgres slogan become mainstream. The <a href=\"https://github.com/pgmq/pgmq\">library</a>’s star history captures this trend perfectly:\n<img src=\"https://topicpartition.io/blog/images/pgmq_star_history.png\" alt=\"pgmq\"></p><p>Most of the time - . You should always default to Postgres until the constraints prove you wrong.</p><p>Kafka is obviously better optimized for pub-sub workloads. Queue systems are obviously better optimized for queue workloads. The point is that <strong>picking a technology based on technical optimization alone is a flawed approach</strong>. To throw an analogy:</p><blockquote><p>a Formula One car is optimized to drive faster, but I still use a sedan to go to work.

Deploying Kafka at small scale is premature optimization.\nThe point of this article is to show you that this “small scale” number has grown further than what people remember it to be - it can comfortably mean many megabytes per second.</p><p>We are in a Postgres Renaissance for a reason: Postgres is  good enough. Modern NVMEs and cheap RAM allow it to scale absurdly high.</p><h2>Custom Solutions for Everything?<a role=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" data-no-popover=\"true\" href=\"https://topicpartition.io/blog/postgres-pubsub-queue-benchmarks#custom-solutions-for-everything\"></a></h2><p>Naive engineers tend to adopt a specialized technology at the slightest hint of a need:</p><ul><li> Redis, of course!</li><li> Let’s deploy Elasticsearch!</li><li> BigQuery or Snowflake - that’s what our data analysts used at their last job.</li><li> We need a NoSQL database like MongoDB.</li><li><em>Have to crunch some numbers on S3?</em> Let’s use Spark!</li></ul><p>A good engineer thinks through the bigger picture.</p><ul><li><em>Does this new technology move the needle?</em></li><li><em>Is shaving a few milliseconds off our query worth the extra organizational complexity introduced with the change?</em></li></ul><p>At small scale, these systems hurt you more than they benefit you. Distributed systems - both in terms of node count and system cardinality - should be respected, feared, avoided and employed only as a weapon of last resort against particularly gnarly problems. Everything with a distributed system becomes more challenging and time-consuming.</p><p>The problem is <strong>the organizational overhead</strong>. The organizational overhead of adopting a new system, learning its nuances, configs, establishing monitoring, establishing processes around deployments and upgrades, attaining operational expertise on how to manage it, creating runbooks, testing it, debugging it, adopting its clients and API, using its UI, keeping up with its ecosystem, etc.</p><p>All of these are real organizational costs that can take months to get right, even if the system in question isn’t difficult (a lot are). Managed SaaS offerings trade off some of the organizational overhead for greater financial costs - but they still don’t remove it all. And until you reach the scale where the technology is necessary, you pay these extra <em>{financial, organizational}</em> costs for zero significant gain.</p><p>If the same can be done with tech for which you’ve already paid the organizational costs for (e.g Postgres), adopting something else prematurely is most definitely an anti-pattern. You don’t need web-scale technologies when you don’t have web-scale problems.</p><h2>MVI (a better alternative)<a role=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" data-no-popover=\"true\" href=\"https://topicpartition.io/blog/postgres-pubsub-queue-benchmarks#mvi-a-better-alternative\"></a></h2><p>What I think is a better approach is to search for the <strong>minimum viable infrastructure</strong> (MVI): build the smallest amount of system while still providing value.</p><ol><li>choose  technology your org is already  with\n<ul><li> == meets your users’ needs without being too slow/expensive/insecure</li><li> == your org has prior experience, has runbooks/ops setups, monitoring, UI, etc</li></ul></li><li>solve a real problem with it</li><li>use the minimum set of features\n<ul><li>the fewer features you use, the more flexibility you have to move off the infra in question in the future (e.g if locked in with a vendor)</li></ul></li></ol><p>Bonus points if that technology:</p><ul><li>is widely adopted so finding good engineers for it is trivial (Postgres - check)</li><li>has a strong and growing network effect (Postgres - check)</li></ul><p>The MVI approach reduces the surface area of your infra.

It benefits their career by giving them a project to use as ammo for their next promotion and improves their resume (cool tech/story on there) for their next job-hop. Plus it’s simply more fun.</p><p>This is why I think we, as an industry, don’t always use the simplest solution available.</p><p>In most cases, Postgres is that simplest solution that is available.</p><p>I want to wrap this article up, but one rebuttal I can’t miss addressing is the “it won’t scale argument”.</p><p>The argument goes something like this: “in today’s age we can go viral at a moment’s notice; these viral moments are very valuable for our business so we need to aggressively design in a way that keeps our app stable under traffic spikes”</p><p>I have three arguments against this:</p><p><a href=\"https://bohanzhang.me/\">Bohan Zhang</a>, a member of OpenAI’s infrastructure team and co-founder of <a href=\"https://ottertune.com/\">OtterTune</a> (a Postgres tuning service), can be quoted as saying:</p><blockquote><p><em>“At OpenAI, we utilize an unsharded architecture with one writer and multiple readers, demonstrating that PostgreSQL can scale gracefully under massive read loads.”</em></p><p><em>“The main message of my talk was that if you are not too write heavy, you can scale Postgres to a very high read throughput with read replicas using only a single master! That is exactly the message that needs to be spelled out as that covers  of apps.”</em></p><p><em>“Postgres is probably the default choice for developers right now. You can use Postgres for a very long time. If you are building a startup with read-heavy workloads, just start with Postgres. If you hit a scalability issue, increase the instance size. You can scale it to a very large scale. If in the future the database becomes a bottleneck, congratulations. You have built a successful startup. It’s a good problem to have.”</em></p><p>(slightly edited for clarity and grammar)</p></blockquote><p>Despite their rapid growth to a user base of more than 800 million, OpenAI has still NOT opted for a web-scale distributed database. If they haven’t… why does your unproven project need to?</p><h3>2.

      "content": "<p>I created the website you’re reading with VS Code. Behind the scenes I use Astro, a static site generator that gets out of the way while providing nice conveniences.</p><p>Using VS Code was a no-brainer: everyone in the industry seems to at least be familiar with it, every project can be opened with it, and most projects can get enhancements and syntactic helpers in a few clicks. In short: VS Code is free, easy to use, and widely adopted.</p><p>A Rustacean colleague kept singing <a href=\"https://helix-editor.com/\">Helix</a>’s praises. I discarded it because he’s much smarter than I am, and I only ever use vim when I need to fiddle with files on a server. I like when things “Just Work” and didn’t want to bother learning how to use Helix nor how to configure it.</p><p>Today it has become my daily driver. Why did I change my mind? What was preventing me from using it before? And how difficult was it to get there?</p><p>Automation and technology make work easier, this is why we produce technology in the first place. But it also means you grow more dependent on the tech you use. If the tech is produced transparently by an international team or a team you trust, it’s fine. But if it’s produced by a single large entity that can screw you over, it’s dangerous.</p><p>VS Code might be open source, but in practice it’s produced by Microsoft. Microsoft has a problematic relationship to consent and is shoving AI products down everyone’s throat. I’d rather use tools that respect me and my decisions, and I’d rather not get my tools produced by already monopolistic organizations.</p><p>Microsoft is also based in the USA, and the political climate over there makes me want to depend as little as possible on American tools. I know that’s a long, uphill battle, but we have to start somewhere.</p><p>I’m not advocating for a ban against American tech in general, but for more balance in our supply chain. I’m also not advocating for European tech either: I’d rather get open source tools from international teams competing in a race to the top, rather than from teams in a single jurisdiction. What is happening in the USA could happen in Europe too.</p><p>I’ve never found vim particularly pleasant to use but it’s everywhere, so I figured I might just get used to it. But one of the things I never liked about vim is the number of moving pieces. By default, vim and neovim are very bare bones. They can be extended and completely modified with plugins, but I really don’t like the idea of having extremely customize tools.</p><p>I’d rather have the same editor as everyone else, with a few knobs for minor preferences. I am subject to choice paralysis, so making me configure an editor before I’ve even started editing is the best way to tank my productivity.</p><p>When my colleague told me about Helix, two things struck me as improvements over vim.</p><ol><li><strong>Helix’s philosophy is that everything should work out of the box.</strong> There are a few configs and themes, but everything should work similarly from one Helix to another. All the language-specific logic is handled in Language Servers that implement the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Server_Protocol\">Language Server Protocol</a> standard.</li><li><strong>In Helix, first you select text, and then you perform operations onto it.</strong> So you can visually tell what is going to be changed before you apply the change. It fits my mental model much better.</li></ol><p>But there are major drawbacks to Helix too:</p><ol><li><strong>After decades of vim, I was scared to re-learn everything.</strong> In practice this wasn’t a problem at all because of the very visual way Helix works.</li><li><strong>VS Code “Just Works”, and Helix sounded like more work than the few clicks from VS Code’s extension store.</strong> This is true, but not as bad as I had anticipated.</li></ol><p>After a single week of usage, Helix was already very comfortable to navigate. After a few weeks, most of the wrinkles have been ironed out and I use it as my primary editor. So how did I overcome those fears?</p><p> It can sound silly, but the very first step to get into Helix was not to overthink it. I just installed it on my mac with  and gave it a go. I was not too familiar with it, so I looked up <a href=\"https://docs.helix-editor.com/usage.html\">the official documentation</a> and noticed there was a tutorial.</p><p>This tutorial alone is what convinced me to try harder. It’s an interactive and well written way to learn how to move and perform basic operations in Helix. I quickly learned how to move around, select things, surround them with braces or parenthesis. I could  what I was about to do before doing it. This has been epiphany. Helix just worked the way I wanted.</p><p>Better: I could get things done faster than in VS Code after a few minutes of learning. Being a lazy person, I never bothered looking up VS Code shortcuts. Because the learning curve for Helix is slightly steeper, you  to learn those shortcuts that make moving around feel so easy.</p><p>Not only did I quickly get used to Helix key bindings: my vim muscle-memory didn’t get in the way at all!</p><p>The built-in tutorial is a very pragmatic way to get started. You get results fast, you learn hands on, and it’s not that long. But if you want to go further, you have to look for docs. Helix <a href=\"https://docs.helix-editor.com/\">has officials docs</a>. They seem to be fairly complete, but they’re also impenetrable as a new user. They focus on what the editor supports and not on what I will want to do with it.</p><p>After a bit of browsing online, I’ve stumbled upon <a href=\"https://helix-nikita-revencos-projects.vercel.app/start-here/basics\">this third-party documentation website</a>. The domain didn’t inspire me a lot of confidence, but the docs are really good. They are clearly laid out, use-case oriented, and they make the most of Astro Starlight to provide a great reading experience. The author <a href=\"https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/pull/12127#issuecomment-2525902615\">tried to upstream these docs, but that won’t happen</a>. It looks like they are upstreaming their docs to the current website. I hope this will improve the quality of upstream docs eventually.</p><p>After learning the basics and finding my way through the docs, it was time to ensure Helix was set up to help me where I needed it most.</p><p>In my free time, I mostly use my editor for three things:</p><ol><li>Tweak my website with Astro</li><li>Edit yaml to faff around my Kubernetes cluster</li></ol><p>Helix is a “stupid” text editor. It doesn’t know much about what you’re typing. But it supports Language Servers that implement the Language Server Protocol. Language Servers understand the document you’re editing. They explain to Helix what you’re editing, whether you’re in a TypeScript function, typing a markdown link, etc. With that information, Helix and the Language Server can provide code completion hints, errors &amp; warnings, and easier navigation in your code.</p><p>In addition to Language Servers, Helix also supports plugging code formatters. Those are pieces of software that will read the document and ensure that it is consistently formatted. It will check that all indentations use spaces and not tabs, that there is a consistent number of space when indenting, that brackets are on the same line as the function, etc. In short: it will make the code pretty.</p><p>Markdown is not really a programming language, so it might seem surprising to configure a Language Server for it. But if you remember what we said earlier, Language Servers can provide code completion, which is useful when creating links for example. <a href=\"https://github.com/artempyanykh/marksman\">Marksman</a> does exactly that!</p><p>We can check that Helix is happy with it with the following command</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"console\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>But Language Servers can also help Helix display errors and warnings, and “code suggestions” to help fix the issues. It means Language Servers are a perfect fit for… grammar checkers! Several grammar checkers exist. The most notable are:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://ltex-plus.github.io/ltex-plus/\">LTEX+</a>, the Language Server used by <a href=\"https://languagetool.org/\">Language Tool</a>. It supports several languages must is quite resource hungry.</li><li><a href=\"https://writewithharper.com/\">Harper</a>, a grammar checker Language Server developed by Automattic, the people behind WordPress, Tumblr, WooCommerce, Beeper and more. Harper only support English and its variants, but they intend to support more languages in the future.</li></ul><p>I mostly write in English and want to keep a minimalistic setup. Automattic is well funded, and I’m confident they will keep working on Harper to improve it. Since grammar checker LSPs can easily be changed, I’ve decided to go with Harper for now.</p><p>To install it, homebrew does the job as always:</p><p>Then I edited my <code>~/.config/helix/languages.toml</code> to add Harper as a secondary Language Server in addition to marksman</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"toml\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>Finally I can add a markdown linter to ensure my markdown is formatted properly. Several options exist, and <a href=\"https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint\">markdownlint</a> is one of the most popular. My colleagues recommended the new kid on the block, a  equivalent: <a href=\"https://github.com/rvben/rumdl\">rumdl</a>.</p><p>Installing rumdl was pretty simple on my mac. I only had to add the repository of the maintainer, and install rumdl from it.</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"console\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>After that I added a new  to my <code>~/.config/helix/languages.toml</code> and added it to the language servers to use for the markdown .</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"toml\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>Since my website already contained a  I could import it to the rumdl format with</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"console\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>You might have noticed that I’ve added a little quality of life improvement: soft-wrap at 80 characters.</p><p>Now if you add this to your own  you will notice that the text is completely left aligned. This is not a problem on small screens, but it rapidly gets annoying on wider screens.</p><p>Helix doesn’t support centering the editor. There is <a href=\"https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/pull/9838\">a PR tackling the problem</a> but it has been stale for most of the year. The maintainers are overwhelmed by the number of PRs making it their way, and it’s not clear if or when this PR will be merged.</p><p>In the meantime, a workaround exists, with a few caveats. It is possible to add spaces to the left gutter (the column with the line numbers) so it pushes the content towards the center of the screen.</p><p>To figure out how many spaces are needed, you need to get your terminal width with </p><p>In my case, when in full screen, my terminal is 243 characters wide. I need to remove the content column with from it, and divide everything by 2 to get the space needed on each side. In my case for a 243 character wide terminal with a text width of 80 characters:</p><p>As is, I would add 203 spaces to my left gutter to push the rest of the gutter and the content to the right. But the gutter itself has a width of 4 characters, that I need to remove from the total. So I need to subtract them from the total, which leaves me with  characters to add.</p><p>I can open my <code>~/.config/helix/config.toml</code> to add a new key binding that will automatically add or remove those spaces from the left gutter when needed, to shift the content towards the center.</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"toml\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>Now when in normal mode, pressing  then  then  will add/remove the spaces. Of course this workaround only works when the terminal runs in full screen mode.</p><p>I only had to install those globally with</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"console\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>Now we need to add a few lines to our <code>~/.config/helix/languages.toml</code> to tell it how to use the language server</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"toml\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>We can check that the Astro Language Server can be used by helix with</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"console\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>I also like to get a formatter to automatically make my code consistent and pretty for me when I save a file. One of the most popular code formaters out there is <a href=\"https://prettier.io/\">Prettier</a>. I’ve decided to go with the fast and easy formatter <a href=\"https://dprint.dev/\">dprint</a> instead.</p><p>Then in the projects I want to use dprint in, I do</p><p>I might edit the  file to my liking. Finally, I configure Helix to use dprint globally for all Astro projects by appending a few lines in my <code>~/.config/helix/languages.toml</code>.</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"toml\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>One final check, and I can see that Helix is ready to use the formatter as well</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"console\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>For yaml, it’s simple and straightforward: Helix is preconfigured to use  as soon as it’s in the PATH. I just need to install it with</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"console\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p><strong>Helix really grew on me. I find it particularly easy and fast to edit code with it.</strong> It takes a tiny bit more work to get the language support than it does in VS Code, but it’s nothing insurmountable. There is a slightly steeper learning curve than for VS Code, but I consider it to be a good thing. It forced me to learn how to move around and edit efficiently, because there is no way to do it inefficiently. Helix remains intuitive once you’ve learned the basics.</p><p>I am a GNOME enthusiast, and I adhere to the same principles: <strong>I like when my apps work out of the box, and when I have little to do to configure them.</strong> This is a strong stance that often attracts a vocal opposition. I like products that follow those principles better than those who don’t.</p><p>With that said, Helix sometimes feels like it is maintained by one or two people who have a strong vision, but who struggle to onboard more maintainers. As of writing, Helix has more than 350 PRs open. Quite a few bring interesting features, but the maintainers don’t have enough time to review them.</p><p>Those 350 PRs mean there is a lot of energy and goodwill around the project. <strong>People are willing to contribute. Right now, all that energy is gated, resulting in frustration</strong> both from the contributors who feel like they’re working in the void, and the maintainers who feel like there at the receiving end of a fire hose.</p><p><strong>A solution to make everyone happier without sacrificing the quality of the project would be to work on a Contributor Ladder.</strong> CHAOSS’ Dr Dawn Foster published <a href=\"https://fastwonderblog.com/2025/08/12/governance-part-3-new-contributors-and-pathways-to-leadership/\">a blog post about it</a>, listing interesting resources at the end.</p>",

The discussion threads on <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38294569\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hacker News</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/17y6zbi/moving_from_aws_to_baremetal_saved_us_230000_yr/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Reddit</a> were packed with sharp questions: did we skip Reserved Instances, how do we fail over a single rack, what about the people cost, and when is cloud still the better answer? This follow-up is our long-form reply.</p><p>Over the last twenty-four months we:</p><ul><li>Ran the MicroK8s + Ceph stack in production for 730+ days with 99.993% measured availability.</li><li>Added a second rack in Frankfurt, joined to our primary Paris cage over redundant DWDM, to kill the “single rack” concern.</li><li>Cut average customer-facing latency by 19% thanks to local NVMe and eliminating noisy neighbours.</li><li>Reinvested the savings into buying bare metal AI servers to expand LLM-based alert / incident summarisation and auto code fixes based on log / traces and metrics in OneUptime.</li></ul><p>Below we tackle the recurring themes from the community feedback, complete with the numbers we use internally.</p><h2>$230,000 / yr savings? That is just an engineers salary.</h2><p>In the US, it is. In the rest of the world. That's 2-5x engineers salary. We  to save $230,000 / yr but now the savings have exponentially grown. We now save over $1.2M / yr and we expect this to grow, as we grow as a business.</p><h2>“Why not just buy Savings Plans or Reserved Instances?”</h2><p>We tried. Long answer: the maths still favoured bare metal once we priced everything in. We see a savings of over 76% if you compare our bare metal setup to AWS. </p><ul><li>Savings Plans  reduce S3, egress, or Direct Connect. 37% off instances still leaves you paying list price for bandwidth, which was 22% of our AWS bill.</li><li>EKS had an extra $1,260/month control-plane fee plus $600/month for NAT gateways. Those costs disappear once you run Kubernetes yourself.</li><li>Our workload is 24/7 steady. We were already at &gt;90% reservation coverage; there was no idle burst capacity to “right size” away. If we had the kind of bursty compute profile many commenters referenced, the choice would be different.</li></ul><h2>“How much did migration and ongoing ops really cost?”</h2><p>We spent a week of engineers time (and that is the worst case estimate) on the initial migration, spread across SRE, platform, and database owners. Most of that time was work we needed anyway—formalising infrastructure-as-code, smoke testing charts, tightening backup policies. The incremental work that existed purely  of bare metal was roughly one week.</p><p>Ongoing run-cost looks like this:</p><ul><li> ~24 engineer-hours/quarter across the entire platform team, including routine patching and firmware updates. That is comparable to the AWS time we used to burn on cost optimisation, IAM policy churn, and chasing deprecations and updating our VM's on AWS. </li><li> 2 interventions in 24 months (mainly disks). Mean response time: 27 minutes. We do not staff an on-site team. We rely on co-location provider to physically manage our rack. This means no traditional hardware admins. </li><li> We're now moving to Talos. We PXE boot with Tinkerbell, image with Talos, manage configs through Flux and Terraform, and run conformance suites before each Kubernetes upgrade. All of those tools also hardened our AWS estate, so they were not net-new effort.</li></ul><p>The opportunity cost question from is fair. We track it the same way we track feature velocity: did the infra team ship less? The answer was “no”—our release cadence increased because we reclaimed few hours/month we used to spend in AWS “cost council” meetings.</p><h2>“Isn’t a single rack a single point of failure?”</h2><p>We have multiple racks across two different DC / providers. We:</p><ul><li>Leased a secondary quarter rack in Frankfurt with a different provider and power utility.</li><li>Currently: Deployed a second MicroK8s control plane, mirrored Ceph pools with asynchronous replication. Future: We're moving to Talos. Nothing against Microk8s, but we like the Talos way of managing the k8s cluster.</li><li>Added isolated out-of-band management paths (4G / satellite) so we can reach the gear even during metro fibre events.</li></ul><p>The AWS failover cluster we mentioned in 2023 still exists. We rehearse a full cutover quarterly using the same Helm releases we ship to customers. DNS failover remains the slowest leg (resolver caches can ignore TTL), so we added Anycast ingress via BGP with our transit provider to cut traffic shifting to sub-minute.</p><h2>“What about hardware lifecycle and surprise CapEx?”</h2><p>We amortise servers over five years, but we sized them with 2 × AMD EPYC 9654 CPUs, 1 TB RAM, and NVMe sleds. At our current growth rate the boxes will hit CPU saturation before we hit year five. When that happens, the plan is to cascade the older gear into our regional analytics cluster (we use Posthog + Metabase for this) and buy a new batch. Thanks to the savings delta, we can refresh 40% of the fleet every 24 months and still spend less annually than the optimised AWS bill above.</p><p>We also buy extended warranties from the OEM (Supermicro) and keep three cold spares in the cage. The hardware lasts 7-8 years and not 5, but we wtill count it as 5 to be very conservative. </p><h2>“Are you reinventing managed services?”</h2><p>Another strong Reddit critique: why rebuild services AWS already offers? Three reasons we are comfortable with the trade:</p><ol><li><strong>Portability is part of our product promise.</strong> OneUptime customers self-host in their own environments. Running the same open stack we ship (Postgres, Redis, ClickHouse, etc.) keeps us honest. We eun on Kubernetes and self-hosted customers run on Kubernetes as well. </li><li> Two years ago we relied on Terraform + EKS + RDS. Today we run MicroK8s (Talos in the future), Argo Rollouts, OpenTelemetry Collector, and Ceph dashboards. None of that is bespoke. We do not maintain a fork of anything.</li><li> We still pay AWS for Glacier backups, CloudFront for edge caching, and short-lived burst capacity for load tests. Cloud makes sense when elasticity matters; bare metal wins when baseload dominates.</li></ol><p>Managed services are phenomenal when you are short on expertise or need features beyond commodity compute. If we were all-in on DynamoDB streams or Step Functions we would almost certainly still be on AWS.</p><h2>“How do bandwidth and DoS scenarios work now?”</h2><p>We committed to 5 Gbps 95th percentile across two carriers.  The same traffic on AWS egress would be 8x expensive in eu-west-1. For DDoS protection we front our ingress with Cloudflare. </p><h2>“Has reliability suffered?”</h2><p>Short answer: No. Infact it was better than AWS (compared to recent AWS downtimes)</p><p>We have 730+ days with 99.993% measured availability and we also escaped AWS region wide downtime that happened a week ago. </p><h2>“How do audits and compliance work off-cloud now?”</h2><p>We stayed SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001 certified through the transition. The biggest deltas auditors cared about:</p><ul><li>Physical controls: We provide badge logs from the colo, camera footage on request, and quarterly access reviews. The colo already meets Tier III redundancy, so their reports roll into ours.</li><li>Change management: Terraform plans, and now Talos machine configs give us immutable evidence of change. Auditors liked that more than AWS Console screenshots.</li><li>Business continuity: We prove failover by moving workload to other DC.</li></ul><p>If you are in a regulated space (HIPAA for instance), expect the paperwork to grow a little. We worked it in by leaning on the colo providers’ standard compliance packets—they slotted straight into our risk register.</p><h2>“Why not stay in the cloud but switch providers?”</h2><p>We priced Hetzner, OVH, Leaseweb, Equinix Metal, and AWS Outposts. The short version:</p><ul><li>Hyperscaler alternatives were cheaper on compute but still expensive on egress once you hit petabytes/month. Outposts also carried minimum commits that exceeded our needs.</li><li>European dedicated hosts (Hetzner, OVH) are fantastic for lab clusters. The challenge was multi-100 TB Ceph clusters with redundant uplinks and smart-hands SLAs. Once we priced that tier, the savings narrowed.</li><li>Equinix Metal got the closest, but bare metal on-demand still carried a 25-30% premium over our CapEx plan. Their global footprint is tempting; we may still use them for short-lived expansion.</li></ul><p>Owning the hardware also let us plan power density (we run 15 kW racks) and reuse components. For our steady-state footprint, colocation won by a long shot.</p><h2>“What does day-to-day toil look like now?”</h2><p>We put real numbers to it because Reddit kept us honest:</p><ul><li>Weekly: Kernel and firmware patches (Talos makes this a redeploy), Ceph health checks,  Total time averages 1 hour/week on average over months. </li><li>Monthly: Kubernetes control plane upgrades in canary fashion. About 2 engineer-hours. We expect this to reduce when Talos kicks in.</li><li>Quarterly: Disaster recovery drills, capacity planning, and contract audits with carriers. Roughly 12 hours across three engineers.</li></ul><p>Total toil is ~14 engineer-hours/month, including prep. The AWS era had us spending similar time but on different work: chasing cost anomalies, expanding Security Hub exceptions, and mapping breaking changes in managed services. The toil moved; it did not multiply.</p><h2>“Do you still use the cloud for anything substantial?”</h2><p>Absolutely. Cloud still solves problems we would rather not own:</p><ul><li>Glacier keeps long-term log archives at a price point local object storage cannot match.</li><li>CloudFront handles 14 edge PoPs we do not want to build. We terminate TLS at the edge for marketing assets and docs. We will soon move this to Cloudflare as they are cheaper.</li><li>We spin up short-lived AWS environments for load testing.</li></ul><p>So yes, we left AWS for the base workload, but we still swipe the corporate card when elasticity or geography outweighs fixed-cost savings.</p><h2>When the cloud is still the right answer</h2><p><strong>It depends on your workload</strong>. We still recommend staying put if:</p><ul><li>Your usage pattern is spiky or seasonal and you can auto-scale to near zero between peaks.</li><li>You lean heavily on managed services (Aurora Serverless, Kinesis, Step Functions) where the operational load is the value prop.</li><li>You do not have the appetite to build a platform team comfortable with Kubernetes, Ceph, observability, and incident response.</li></ul><p>Cloud-first was the right call for our first five years. Bare metal became the right call once our compute footprint, data gravity, and independence requirements stabilised.</p><ul><li>We are working on a detailed runbook + Terraform module to help teams do  for colo moves. Expect that on the blog later this year.</li><li>A deep dive on Talos is in the queue, as requested by multiple folks in the HN thread.</li></ul><p>Questions we did not cover? Let us know in the discussion threads—we are happy to keep sharing the gritty details.</p><ul></ul>",

      "content": "<p>We recently overhauled our internal tools for visualizing the compilation of JavaScript and WebAssembly. When SpiderMonkey’s optimizing compiler, Ion, is active, we can now produce interactive graphs showing exactly how functions are processed and optimized.</p><div><p>You can play with these graphs right here on this page. Simply write some JavaScript code in the  function and see what graph is produced. You can click and drag to navigate, ctrl-scroll to zoom, and drag the slider at the bottom to scrub through the optimization process.</p><p>As you experiment, take note of how stable the graph layout is, even as the sizes of blocks change or new structures are added. Try clicking a block's title to select it, then drag the slider and watch the graph change while the block remains in place. Or, click an instruction's number to highlight it so you can keep an eye on it across passes.</p></div><p>We are not the first to visualize our compiler’s internal graphs, of course, nor the first to make them interactive. But I was not satisfied with the output of common tools like <a href=\"https://graphviz.org/\">Graphviz</a> or <a href=\"https://mermaid.js.org/\">Mermaid</a>, so I decided to create a layout algorithm specifically tailored to our needs. The resulting algorithm is simple, fast, produces surprisingly high-quality output, and can be implemented in less than a thousand lines of code. The purpose of this article is to walk you through this algorithm and the design concepts behind it.</p><div><p><i>Read this post on desktop to see an interactive demo of iongraph.</i></p></div><p>As readers of this blog already know, SpiderMonkey has several tiers of execution for JavaScript and WebAssembly code. The highest tier is known as Ion, an optimizing SSA compiler that takes the most time to compile but produces the highest-quality output.</p><p>Working with Ion frequently requires us to visualize and debug the SSA graph. Since 2011 we have used a tool for this purpose called <a href=\"https://github.com/sstangl/iongraph\">iongraph</a>, built by Sean Stangl. It is a simple Python script that takes a JSON dump of our compiler graphs and uses Graphviz to produce a PDF. It is perfectly adequate, and very much the status quo for compiler authors, but unfortunately the Graphviz output has many problems that make our work tedious and frustrating.</p><p>The first problem is that the Graphviz output rarely bears any resemblance to the source code that produced it. Graphviz will place nodes wherever it feels will minimize error, resulting in a graph that snakes left and right seemingly at random. There is no visual intuition for how deeply nested a block of code is, nor is it easy to determine which blocks are inside or outside of loops. Consider the following function, and its Graphviz graph:</p><div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div></div><p>Counterintuitively, the  appears  the two assignments in the body of the loop. Since this graph mirrors JavaScript control flow, we’d expect to see the return at the bottom. This problem only gets worse as graphs grow larger and more complex.</p><p>The second, related problem is that Graphviz’s output is unstable. Small changes to the input can result in large changes to the output. As you page through the graphs of each pass within Ion, nodes will jump left and right, true and false branches will swap, loops will run up the right side instead of the left, and so on. This makes it very hard to understand the actual effect of any given pass. Consider the following before and after, and notice how the second graph is almost—but not quite—a mirror image of the first, despite very minimal changes to the graph’s structure:</p><p>None of this felt right to me. Control flow graphs should be able to follow the structure of the program that produced them. After all, a control flow graph has many restrictions that a general-purpose tool would not be aware of: they have very few cycles, all of which are well-defined because they come from loops; furthermore, both JavaScript and WebAssembly have reducible control flow, meaning all loops have only one entry, and it is not possible to jump directly into the middle of a loop. This information could be used to our advantage.</p><p>Beyond that, a static PDF is far from ideal when exploring complicated graphs. Finding the inputs or uses of a given instruction is a tedious and frustrating exercise, as is following arrows from block to block. Even just zooming in and out is difficult. I eventually concluded that we ought to just build an interactive tool to overcome these limitations.</p><h2>How hard could layout be?</h2><p>I had one false start with graph layout, with an algorithm that attempted to sort blocks into vertical “tracks”. This broke down quickly on a variety of programs and I was forced to go back to the drawing board—in fact, back to the source of the very tool I was trying to replace.</p><p>The algorithm used by , the typical hierarchical layout mode for Graphviz, is known as the Sugiyama layout algorithm, from a 1981 paper by Sugiyama et al. As introduction, I found a short series of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_FbSCWLC3A&amp;list=PLubYOWSl9mIvoXDwf_Wqcrvlg15N_AWQE&amp;index=38\">lectures</a> that broke down the Sugiyama algorithm into 5 steps:</p><ol><li>, where the direction of some edges are flipped in order to produce a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph\">DAG</a>.</li><li>, where vertices are assigned into horizontal layers according to their depth in the graph, and dummy vertices are added to any edge that crosses multiple layers.</li><li>, where vertices on a layer are reordered in order to minimize the number of edge crossings.</li><li>, where vertices are horizontally positioned in order to make the edges as straight as possible.</li><li>, where the final graph is rendered to the screen.</li></ol><p>These steps struck me as surprisingly straightforward, and provided useful opportunities to insert our own knowledge of the problem:</p><ul><li>Cycle breaking would be trivial for us, since the only cycles in our data are loops, and loop backedges are explicitly labeled. We could simply ignore backedges when laying out the graph.</li><li>Leveling would be straightforward, and could easily be modified to better mimic the source code. Specifically, any blocks coming after a loop in the source code could be artificially pushed down in the layout, solving the confusing early-exit problem.</li><li>Permuting vertices to reduce edge crossings was actually just a bad idea, since our goal was stability from graph to graph. The true and false branches of a condition should always appear in the same order, for example, and a few edge crossings is a small price to pay for this stability.</li><li>Since reducible control flow ensures that a program’s loops form a tree, vertex positioning could ensure that loops are always well-nested in the final graph.</li></ul><p>Taken all together, these simplifications resulted in a remarkably straightforward algorithm, with the <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla-spidermonkey/iongraph/blob/fc27ee3e8f3bd3c020aaf2498de9a260da089bc1/src/Graph.ts\">initial implementation</a> being just 1000 lines of JavaScript. (See this <a href=\"https://x.com/its_bvisness/status/1957565307809329465?s=46\">demo</a> for what it looked like at the time.) It also proved to be very efficient, since it avoided the most computationally complex parts of the Sugiyama algorithm.</p><h2>iongraph from start to finish</h2><p>We will now go through the entire iongraph layout algorithm. Each section contains explanatory diagrams, in which rectangles are basic blocks and circles are dummy nodes. Loop header blocks (the single entry point to each loop) are additionally colored green.</p><p>Be aware that the block positions in these diagrams are not representative of the actual computed layout position at each point in the process. For example, vertical positions are not calculated until the very end, but it would be hard to communicate what the algorithm was doing if all blocks were drawn on a single line!</p><p>We first sort the basic blocks into horizontal tracks called “layers”. This is very simple; we just start at layer 0 and recursively walk the graph, incrementing the layer number as we go. As we go, we track the “height” of each loop, not in pixels, but in layers.</p><p>We also take this opportunity to vertically position nodes “inside” and “outside” of loops. Whenever we see an edge that exits a loop, we defer the layering of the destination block until we are done layering the loop contents, at which point we know the loop’s height.</p><p>A note on implementation: nodes are visited multiple times throughout the process, not just once. This can produce a quadratic explosion for large graphs, but I find that an early-out is sufficient to avoid this problem in practice.</p><p>The animation below shows the layering algorithm in action. Notice how the final block in the graph is visited twice, once after each loop that branches to it, and in each case, the block is deferred until the entire loop has been layered, rather than processed immediately after its predecessor block. The final position of the block is below the entirety of both loops, rather than directly below one of its predecessors as Graphviz would do. (Remember, horizontal and vertical positions have not yet been computed; the positions of the blocks in this diagram are hardcoded for demonstration purposes.)</p><div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div></div><h3>Step 2: Create dummy nodes</h3><p>Any time an edge crosses a layer, we create a dummy node. This allows edges to be routed across layers without overlapping any blocks. Unlike in traditional Sugiyama, we always put downward dummies on the left and upward dummies on the right, producing a consistent “counter-clockwise” flow. This also makes it easy to read long vertical edges, whose direction would otherwise be ambiguous. (Recall how the loop backedge flipped from the right to the left in the “unstable layout” Graphviz example from before.)</p><p>In addition, we coalesce any edges that are going to the same destination by merging their dummy nodes. This heavily reduces visual noise.</p><p>This is the fuzziest and most ad-hoc part of the process. Basically, we run lots of small passes that walk up and down the graph, aligning layout nodes with each other. Our edge-straightening passes include:</p><ul><li>Pushing nodes to the right of their loop header to “indent” them.</li><li>Walking a layer left to right, moving children to the right to line up with their parents. If any nodes overlap as a result, they are pushed further to the right.</li><li>Walking a layer right to left, moving parents to the right to line up with their children. This version is more conservative and will not move a node if it would overlap with another. This cleans up most issues from the first pass.</li><li>Straightening runs of dummy nodes so we have clean vertical lines.</li><li>“Sucking in” dummy runs on the left side of the graph if there is room for them to move to the right.</li><li>Straighten out any edges that are “nearly straight”, according to a chosen threshold. This makes the graph appear less wobbly. We do this by repeatedly “combing” the graph upward and downward, aligning parents with children, then children with parents, and so on.</li></ul><p>It is important to note that dummy nodes participate fully in this system. If for example you have two side-by-side loops, straightening the left loop’s backedge will push the right loop to the side, avoiding overlaps and preserving the graph’s visual structure.</p><p>We do not reach a fixed point with this strategy, nor do we attempt to. I find that if you continue to repeatedly apply these particular layout passes, nodes will wander to the right forever. Instead, the layout passes are hand-tuned to produce decent-looking results for most of the graphs we look at on a regular basis. That said, this could certainly be improved, especially for larger graphs which do benefit from more iterations.</p><p>At the end of this step, all nodes have a fixed X-coordinate and will not be modified further.</p><h3>Step 4: Track horizontal edges</h3><p>Edges may overlap visually as they run horizontally between layers. To resolve this, we sort edges into parallel “tracks”, giving each a vertical offset. After tracking all the edges, we record the total height of the tracks and store it on the preceding layer as its “track height”. This allows us to leave room for the edges in the final layout step.</p><p>We first sort edges by their starting position, left to right. This produces a consistent arrangement of edges that has few vertical crossings in practice. Edges are then placed into tracks from the “outside in”, stacking rightward edges on top and leftward edges on the bottom, creating a new track if the edge would overlap with or cross any other edge.</p><p>The diagram below is interactive. Click and drag the blocks to see how the horizontal edges get assigned to tracks.</p><div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div></div><p>Finally, we assign each node a Y-coordinate. Starting at a Y-coordinate of zero, we iterate through the layers, repeatedly adding the layer’s height and its track height, where the layer height is the maximum height of any node in the layer. All nodes within a layer receive the same Y-coordinate; this is simple and easier to read than Graphviz’s default of vertically centering nodes within a layer.</p><p>Now that every node has both an X and Y coordinate, the layout process is complete.</p><div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div></div><p>The details of rendering are out of scope for this article, and depend on the specific application. However, I wish to highlight a stylistic decision that I feel makes our graphs more readable.</p><p>When rendering edges, we use a style inspired by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_diagram\">railroad diagrams</a>. These have many advantages over the Bézier curves employed by Graphviz. First, straight lines feel more organized and are easier to follow when scrolling up and down. Second, they are easy to route (vertical when crossing layers, horizontal between layers). Third, they are easy to coalesce when they share a destination, and the junctions provide a clear indication of the edge’s direction. Fourth, they always cross at right angles, improving clarity and reducing the need to avoid edge crossings in the first place.</p><p>Consider the following example. There are several edge crossings that may traditionally be considered undesirable—yet the edges and their directions remain clear. Of particular note is the vertical junction highlighted in red on the left: not only is it immediately clear that these edges share a destination, but the junction itself signals that the edges are flowing downward. I find this much more pleasant than the “rat’s nest” that Graphviz tends to produce.</p><p>It may seem surprising that such a simple (and stupid) layout algorithm could produce such readable graphs, when more sophisticated layout algorithms struggle. However, I feel that the algorithm succeeds  of its simplicity.</p><p>Most graph layout algorithms are optimization problems, where error is minimized on some chosen metrics. However, these metrics seem to correlate poorly to readability in practice. For example, it seems good in theory to rearrange nodes to minimize edge crossings. But a predictable order of nodes seems to produce more sensible results overall, and simple rules for edge routing are sufficient to keep things tidy. (As a bonus, this also gives us layout stability from pass to pass.) Similarly, layout rules like “align parents with their children” produce more readable results than “minimize the lengths of edges”.</p><p>Furthermore, by rejecting the optimization problem, a human author gains more control over the layout. We are able to position nodes “inside” of loops, and push post-loop content down in the graph,  we reject this global constraint-solver approach. Minimizing “error” is meaningless compared to a human  meaning through thoughtful design.</p><p>And finally, the resulting algorithm is simply more efficient. All the layout passes in iongraph are easy to program and scale gracefully to large graphs because they run in roughly linear time. It is better, in my view, to run a fixed number of layout iterations according to your graph complexity and time budget, rather than to run a complex constraint solver until it is “done”.</p><p>By following this philosophy, even the worst graphs become tractable. Below is a screenshot of a zlib function, compiled to WebAssembly, and rendered using the old tool.</p><p>It took about  for Graphviz to produce this spaghetti nightmare. By comparison, iongraph can now lay out this function in . The result is still not particularly beautiful, but it renders thousands of times faster  is much easier to navigate.</p><p>Perhaps programmers ought to put less trust into magic optimizing systems, especially when a human-friendly result is the goal. Simple (and stupid) algorithms can be very effective when applied with discretion and taste.</p><p>We have already integrated iongraph into the Firefox profiler, making it easy for us to view the graphs of the most expensive or impactful functions we find in our performance work. Unfortunately, this is only available in specific builds of the SpiderMonkey shell, and is not available in full browser builds. This is due to architectural differences in how profiling data is captured and the flags with which the browser and shell are built. I would love for Firefox users to someday be able to view these graphs themselves, but at the moment we have no plans to expose this to the browser. However, one bug tracking some related work can be found <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1987005\">here</a>.</p><p>We will continue to sporadically update iongraph with more features to aid us in our work. We have several ideas for new features, including <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla-spidermonkey/iongraph/issues/9\">richer navigation</a>, search, and visualization of <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla-spidermonkey/iongraph/issues/4\">register allocation info</a>. However, we have no explicit roadmap for when these features may be released.</p><p>To experiment with iongraph locally, you can run a debug build of the SpiderMonkey shell with ; this will dump information to . This file can then be loaded into the <a href=\"https://mozilla-spidermonkey.github.io/iongraph/\">standalone deployment of iongraph</a>. Please be aware that the user experience is rough and unpolished in its current state.</p><p>The source code for iongraph can be found on <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla-spidermonkey/iongraph\">GitHub</a>. If this subject interests you, we would welcome contributions to iongraph and its integration into the browser. The best place to reach us is our <a href=\"https://chat.mozilla.org/#/room/#spidermonkey:mozilla.org\">Matrix chat</a>.</p><p><em>Thanks to Matthew Gaudet, Asaf Gartner, and Colin Davidson for their feedback on this article.</em></p>",

While the quantum computing paradigm promises many benefits, it also threatens the security of the Internet by breaking much of the cryptography we have come to rely on.</p><p>To mitigate this threat, Cloudflare is helping to migrate the Internet to Post-Quantum (PQ) cryptography. Today, <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/adoption-and-usage#post-quantum-encryption\"></a> of traffic to Cloudflare's edge network is protected against the most urgent threat: an attacker who can intercept and store encrypted traffic today and then decrypt it in the future with the help of a quantum computer. This is referred to as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_now,_decrypt_later\"><u>harvest now, decrypt later</u></a>threat.</p><p>However, this is just one of the threats we need to address. A quantum computer can also be used to crack a server's <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/transport-layer-security-tls/\"></a> certificate, allowing an attacker to impersonate the server to unsuspecting clients. The good news is that we already have PQ algorithms we can use for quantum-safe authentication. The bad news is that adoption of these algorithms in TLS will require significant changes to one of the most complex and security-critical systems on the Internet: the Web Public-Key Infrastructure (WebPKI).</p><p>The central problem is the sheer size of these new algorithms: signatures for ML-DSA-44, one of the most performant PQ algorithms standardized by NIST, are 2,420 bytes long, compared to just 64 bytes for ECDSA-P256, the most popular non-PQ signature in use today; and its public keys are 1,312 bytes long, compared to just 64 bytes for ECDSA. That's a roughly 20-fold increase in size. Worse yet, the average TLS handshake includes a number of public keys and signatures, adding up to 10s of kilobytes of overhead per handshake. This is enough to have a <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/another-look-at-pq-signatures/#how-many-added-bytes-are-too-many-for-tls\"></a> on the performance of TLS.</p><p>That makes drop-in PQ certificates a tough sell to enable today: they don’t bring any security benefit before Q-day — the day a cryptographically relevant quantum computer arrives — but they do degrade performance. We could sit and wait until Q-day is a year away, but that’s playing with fire. Migrations always take longer than expected, and by waiting we risk the security and privacy of the Internet, which is <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/universal-ssl/\"></a>.</p><p>It's clear that we must find a way to make post-quantum certificates cheap enough to deploy today by default for everyone — not just those that can afford it. In this post, we'll introduce you to the plan we’ve brought together with industry partners to the <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/plants/about/\"></a> to redesign the WebPKI in order to allow a smooth transition to PQ authentication with no performance impact (and perhaps a performance improvement!). We'll provide an overview of one concrete proposal, called <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-davidben-tls-merkle-tree-certs/\"><u>Merkle Tree Certificates (MTCs)</u></a>, whose goal is to whittle down the number of public keys and signatures in the TLS handshake to the bare minimum required.</p><p>But talk is cheap. We <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/experiment-with-pq/\"></a><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-encrypted-client-hello/\"></a><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/why-tls-1-3-isnt-in-browsers-yet/\"></a> that, as with any change to the Internet, it's crucial to test early and often. <b>Today we're announcing our intent to deploy MTCs on an experimental basis in collaboration with Chrome Security.</b> In this post, we'll describe the scope of this experiment, what we hope to learn from it, and how we'll make sure it's done safely.</p><div><h2>The WebPKI today — an old system with many patches</h2><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/bootstrap-mtc/#the-webpki-today-an-old-system-with-many-patches\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a></div><p>Why does the TLS handshake have so many public keys and signatures?</p><p>Let's start with Cryptography 101. When your browser connects to a website, it asks the server to  itself to make sure it's talking to the real server and not an impersonator. This is usually achieved with a cryptographic primitive known as a digital signature scheme (e.g., ECDSA or ML-DSA). In TLS, the server signs the messages exchanged between the client and server using its , and the client verifies the signature using the server's . In this way, the server confirms to the client that they've had the same conversation, since only the server could have produced a valid signature.</p><p>If the client already knows the server's public key, then only  is required to authenticate the server. In practice, however, this is not really an option. The web today is made up of around a billion TLS servers, so it would be unrealistic to provision every client with the public key of every server. What's more, the set of public keys will change over time as new servers come online and existing ones rotate their keys, so we would need some way of pushing these changes to clients.</p><p>This scaling problem is at the heart of the design of all PKIs.</p><p>Instead of expecting the client to know the server's public key in advance, the server might just send its public key during the TLS handshake. But how does the client know that the public key actually belongs to the server? This is the job of a .</p><p>A certificate binds a public key to the identity of the server — usually its DNS name, e.g., . The certificate is signed by a Certification Authority (CA) whose public key is known to the client. In addition to verifying the server's handshake signature, the client verifies the signature of this certificate. This establishes a chain of trust: by accepting the certificate, the client is trusting that the CA verified that the public key actually belongs to the server with that identity.</p><p>Clients are typically configured to trust many CAs and must be provisioned with a public key for each. Things are much easier however, since there are only 100s of CAs instead of billions. In addition, new certificates can be created without having to update clients.</p><p>These efficiencies come at a relatively low cost: for those counting at home, that's  signature and  public key, for a total of <b>2 signatures and 1 public key</b> per TLS handshake.</p><p>That's not the end of the story, however. As the WebPKI has evolved, so have these chains of trust grown a bit longer. These days it's common for a chain to consist of two or more certificates rather than just one. This is because CAs sometimes need to rotatetheir keys, just as servers do. But before they can start using the new key, they must distribute the corresponding public key to clients. This takes time, since it requires billions of clients to update their trust stores. To bridge the gap, the CA will sometimes use the old key to issue a certificate for the new one and append this certificate to the end of the chain.</p><p>That's signature and public key, which brings us to<b> 3 signatures and 2 public keys</b>. And we still have a little ways to go.</p><p>The main job of a CA is to verify that a server has control over the domain for which it’s requesting a certificate. This process has evolved over the years from a high-touch, CA-specific process to a standardized, <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555/\"></a> used for issuing most certificates on the web. (Not all CAs fully support automation, however.) This evolution is marked by a number of security incidents in which a certificate was to a party other than the server, allowing that party to impersonate the server to any client that trusts the CA.</p><p>Automation helps, but <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DigiNotar#Issuance_of_fraudulent_certificates\"></a> are still possible, and mistakes are almost inevitable. <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/unauthorized-issuance-of-certificates-for-1-1-1-1/\"></a>, several certificates for Cloudflare's encrypted 1.1.1.1 resolver were issued without our involvement or authorization. This apparently occurred by accident, but it nonetheless put users of 1.1.1.1 at risk. (The mis-issued certificates have since been revoked.)</p><p>Ensuring mis-issuance is detectable is the job of the Certificate Transparency (CT) ecosystem. The basic idea is that each certificate issued by a CA gets added to a public . Servers can audit these logs for certificates issued in their name. If ever a certificate is issued that they didn't request itself, the server operator can prove the issuance happened, and the PKI ecosystem can take action to prevent the certificate from being trusted by clients.</p><p>Major browsers, including Firefox and Chrome and its derivatives, require certificates to be logged before they can be trusted. For example, Chrome, Safari, and Firefox will only accept the server's certificate if it appears in at least two logs the browser is configured to trust. This policy is easy to state, but tricky to implement in practice:</p><ol><li><p>Operating a CT log has historically been fairly expensive. Logs ingest billions of certificates over their lifetimes: when an incident happens, or even just under high load, it can take some time for a log to make a new entry available for auditors.</p></li><li><p>Clients can't really audit logs themselves, since this would expose their browsing history (i.e., the servers they wanted to connect to) to the log operators.</p></li></ol><p>The solution to both problems is to include a signature from the CT log along with the certificate. The signature is produced immediately in response to a request to log a certificate, and attests to the log's intent to include the certificate in the log within 24 hours.</p><p>Per browser policy, certificate transparency adds  signatures to the TLS handshake, one for each log. This brings us to a total of <b>5 signatures and 2 public keys</b> in a typical handshake on the public web.</p><p>The WebPKI is a living, breathing, and highly distributed system. We've had to patch it a number of times over the years to keep it going, but on balance it has served our needs quite well — until now.</p><p>Previously, whenever we needed to update something in the WebPKI, we would tack on another signature. This strategy has worked because conventional cryptography is so cheap. But <b>5 signatures and 2 public keys </b>on average for each TLS handshake is simply too much to cope with for the larger PQ signatures that are coming.</p><p>The good news is that by moving what we already have around in clever ways, we can drastically reduce the number of signatures we need.</p><div><h3>Crash course on Merkle Tree Certificates</h3><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/bootstrap-mtc/#crash-course-on-merkle-tree-certificates\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a></div><p><a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-davidben-tls-merkle-tree-certs/\"><u>Merkle Tree Certificates (MTCs)</u></a> is a proposal for the next generation of the WebPKI that we are implementing and plan to deploy on an experimental basis. Its key features are as follows:</p><ol><li><p>All the information a client needs to validate a Merkle Tree Certificate can be disseminated out-of-band. If the client is sufficiently up-to-date, then the TLS handshake needs just <b>1 signature, 1 public key, and 1 Merkle tree inclusion proof</b>. This is quite small, even if we use post-quantum algorithms.</p></li><li><p>The MTC specification makes certificate transparency a first class feature of the PKI by having each CA run its own log of exactly the certificates they issue.</p></li></ol><p>Let's poke our head under the hood a little. Below we have an MTC generated by one of our internal tests. This would be transmitted from the server to the client in the TLS handshake:</p><pre><code>-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----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\nmibA021dDCi8h1hYFQAA\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----</code></pre><p>Looks like your average PEM encoded certificate.

On the familiar side, the subject and public key are exactly what we might expect: the DNS name is  and the public key is for a familiar signature algorithm, ECDSA-P256. This algorithm is not PQ, of course — in the future we would put ML-DSA-44 there instead.</p><p>On the unusual side, OpenSSL appears to not recognize the signature algorithm of the issuer and just prints the raw OID and bytes of the signature. There's a good reason for this: the MTC does not have a signature in it at all! So what exactly are we looking at?</p><p>The trick to leave out signatures is that a Merkle Tree Certification Authority (MTCA) produces its  certificates  rather than individually. In place of a signature, the certificate has an  of the certificate in a batch of certificates signed by the MTCA.</p><p>To understand how inclusion proofs work, let's think about a slightly simplified version of the MTC specification. To issue a batch, the MTCA arranges the unsigned certificates into a data structure called a  that looks like this:</p><p>Each leaf of the tree corresponds to a certificate, and each inner node is equal to the hash of its children. To sign the batch, the MTCA uses its secret key to sign the head of the tree. The structure of the tree guarantees that each certificate in the batch was signed by the MTCA: if we tried to tweak the bits of any one of the certificates, the treehead would end up having a different value, which would cause the signature to fail.</p><p>An inclusion proof for a certificate consists of the hash of each sibling node along the path from the certificate to the treehead:</p><p>Given a validated treehead, this sequence of hashes is sufficient to prove inclusion of the certificate in the tree. This means that, in order to validate an MTC, the client also needs to obtain the signed treehead from the MTCA.</p><p>This is the key to MTC's efficiency:</p><ol><li><p>Signed treeheads can be disseminated to clients out-of-band and validated offline. Each validated treehead can then be used to validate any certificate in the corresponding batch, eliminating the need to obtain a signature for each server certificate.</p></li><li><p>During the TLS handshake, the client tells the server which treeheads it has. If the server has a signatureless certificate covered by one of those treeheads, then it can use that certificate to authenticate itself. That's <b>1 signature,1 public key and 1 inclusion proof</b> per handshake, both for the server being authenticated.</p></li></ol><p>Now, that's the simplified version. MTC proper has some more bells and whistles. To start, it doesn’t create a separate Merkle tree for each batch, but it grows a single large tree, which is used for better transparency. As this tree grows, periodically (sub)tree heads are selected to be shipped to browsers, which we call . In the common case browsers will be able to fetch the most recent landmarks, and servers can wait for batch issuance, but we need a fallback: MTC also supports certificates that can be issued immediately and don’t require landmarks to be validated, but these are not as small. A server would provision both types of Merkle tree certificates, so that the common case is fast, and the exceptional case is slow, but at least it’ll work.</p><p>Ever since early designs for MTCs emerged, we’ve been eager to experiment with the idea. In line with the IETF principle of “<a href=\"https://www.ietf.org/runningcode/\"></a>”, it often takes implementing a protocol to work out kinks in the design. At the same time, we cannot risk the security of users. In this section, we describe our approach to experimenting with aspects of the Merkle Tree Certificates design  changing any trust relationships.</p><p>Let’s start with what we hope to learn. We have lots of questions whose answers can help to either validate the approach, or uncover pitfalls that require reshaping the protocol — in fact, an implementation of an early MTC draft by <a href=\"https://www.cs.ru.nl/masters-theses/2025/M_Pohl___Implementation_and_Analysis_of_Merkle_Tree_Certificates_for_Post-Quantum_Secure_Authentication_in_TLS.pdf\"></a> and <a href=\"https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-davidben-tls-merkle-tree-certs-07.html#name-acknowledgements\"></a> did exactly this. We’d like to know:</p><p> Protocol ossification (the tendency of implementation bugs to make it harder to change a protocol) is an ever-present issue with deploying protocol changes. For TLS in particular, despite having built-in flexibility, time after time we’ve found that if that flexibility is not regularly used, there will be buggy implementations and middleboxes that break when they see things they don’t recognize. TLS 1.3 deployment <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/why-tls-1-3-isnt-in-browsers-yet/\"></a> than we hoped for this very reason. And more recently, the rollout of PQ key exchange in TLS caused the Client Hello to be split over multiple TCP packets, something that many middleboxes <a href=\"https://tldr.fail/\"></a>.</p><p><b>What is the performance impact?</b> In fact, we expect MTCs to the size of the handshake, even compared to today's non-PQ certificates. They will also reduce CPU cost: ML-DSA signature verification is about as fast as ECDSA, and there will be far fewer signatures to verify. We therefore expect to see a . We would like to see if there is a measurable performance improvement.</p><p><b>What fraction of clients will stay up to date? </b>Getting the performance benefit of MTCs requires the clients and servers to be roughly in sync with one another. We expect MTCs to have fairly short lifetimes, a week or so. This means that if the client's latest landmark is older than a week, the server would have to fallback to a larger certificate. Knowing how often this fallback happens will help us tune the parameters of the protocol to make fallbacks less likely.</p><p>In order to answer these questions, we are implementing MTC support in our TLS stack and in our certificate issuance infrastructure. For their part, Chrome is implementing MTC support in their own TLS stack and will stand up infrastructure to disseminate landmarks to their users.</p><p>As we've done in past experiments, we plan to enable MTCs for a subset of our free customers with enough traffic that we will be able to get useful measurements. Chrome will control the experimental rollout: they can ramp up slowly, measuring as they go and rolling back if and when bugs are found.</p><p>Which leaves us with one last question: who will run the Merkle Tree CA?</p><div><h3>Bootstrapping trust from the existing WebPKI</h3><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/bootstrap-mtc/#bootstrapping-trust-from-the-existing-webpki\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a></div><p>Standing up a proper CA is no small task: it takes years to be trusted by major browsers. That’s why Cloudflare isn’t going to become a “real” CA for this experiment, and Chrome isn’t going to trust us directly.</p><p>Instead, to make progress on a reasonable timeframe, without sacrificing due diligence, we plan to \"mock\" the role of the MTCA. We will run an MTCA (on <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/azul/\"></a> based on our <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/azul-certificate-transparency-log/\"></a>), but for each MTC we issue, we also publish an existing certificate from a trusted CA that agrees with it. We call this the . When Chrome’s infrastructure pulls updates from our MTCA log, they will also pull these bootstrap certificates, and check whether they agree. Only if they do, they’ll proceed to push the corresponding landmarks to Chrome clients. In other words, Cloudflare is effectively just “re-encoding” an existing certificate (with domain validation performed by a trusted CA) as an MTC, and Chrome is using certificate transparency to keep us honest.</p><p>With almost 50% of our traffic already protected by post-quantum encryption, we’re halfway to a fully post-quantum secure Internet. The second part of our journey, post-quantum certificates, is the hardest yet though. A simple drop-in upgrade has a noticeable performance impact and no security benefit before Q-day. This means it’s a hard sell to enable today by default. But here we are playing with fire: migrations always take longer than expected. If we want to keep an ubiquitously private and secure Internet, we need a post-quantum solution that’s performant enough to be enabled by default .</p><p>Merkle Tree Certificates (MTCs) solves this problem by reducing the number of signatures and public keys to the bare minimum while maintaining the WebPKI's essential properties. We plan to roll out MTCs to a fraction of free accounts by early next year. This does not affect any visitors that are not part of the Chrome experiment. For those that are, thanks to the bootstrap certificates, there is no impact on security.</p><p>We’re excited to keep the Internet fast  secure, and will report back soon on the results of this experiment: watch this space! MTC is evolving as we speak, if you want to get involved, please join the IETF <a href=\"https://mailman3.ietf.org/mailman3/lists/plants@ietf.org/\"></a>.</p>",

      "content": "<p>The ongoing development of Tor Browser is made possible thanks to the support of our community. If Tor Browser is important to you, now is a great time to support our mission to , as all donations will be matched by <a href=\"https://powerupprivacy.com/\">Power Up Privacy</a> through December 31, 2025.</p><p>Tor Browser 15.0 inherits a multitude of useful new features and usability improvements from Firefox that have passed our audit. For desktop, these include vertical tabs: providing a more manageable, alternative layout with open and pinned tabs stacked in a sidebar rather than across the top of the window. For ease of access, Bookmarks can be retrieved directly from the sidebar when expanded too. However, regardless of whether you prefer horizontal or vertical tabs, everyone  benefits from the addition of tab groups: helping you keep on top of the clutter by organizing tabs into collapsible groups that can be given names and color-coded. Tor Browser 15.0 also inherits elements of Firefox's recent address bar refresh, including a new unified search button that allows you to switch search engines on the fly, search bookmarks or tabs, and reference quick actions from the same menu.</p><p>Note that Tor Browser tabs are still private tabs, and will clear when you close the browser. This enforces a kind of natural tidiness in Tor Browser since each new session starts fresh – however for privacy-conscious power users, project managers, researchers, or anyone else who accumulates tabs frighteningly quickly, we hope these organizational improvements will give you a much needed productivity boost.</p><p>On Android, screen lock adds an extra layer of security to your browsing sessions. After enabling screen lock in Settings &gt; Tabs, your tabs will lock automatically when you switch away from the browser without closing it. Upon returning to the app, you'll be prompted to unlock your tabs using your fingerprint, face, or pass code, depending on which option your device is configured to use.</p><p>Like Tor Browser for Desktop, your browsing session will still be cleared when Tor Browser is closed. However, this feature provides peace of mind in a specific scenario: by ensuring that your browsing remains private even if someone has gained temporary access to your unlocked phone with Tor Browser open in the background – whether you've handed it to a friend, or left your device sitting on a table.</p><h3>Updates to Android and Linux device compatibility</h3><p>At present, Firefox 140 and Tor Browser 15.0 support Android 5.0 or later, which was released almost 11 years ago. While Mozilla's commitment to support such an old version of Android is admirable, it introduces several technical and security challenges for developers. As a consequence, Firefox have announced their intention to increase the minimum support requirements to Android 8.0, and have also decided to drop support for x86 CPUs for <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/futurereleases/2025/09/15/raising-the-minimum-android-version-for-firefox/\">Android</a> and <a href=\"https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-has-ended-support-32-bit-linux\">Linux</a>. Sadly, it's not possible for the Tor Project to maintain support for these platforms on our own without official support from Mozilla.</p><p>While these changes won't impact Tor Browser users immediately, we expect them to take effect with the release of Tor Browser 16.0 mid-next year. This means that Tor Browser 15.0 will be the last major release to support x86 for Linux and Android, in addition to Android 5.0, 6.0, and 7.0. However, we will continue to release minor updates with security fixes for these platforms until Tor Browser 16.0's eventual release.</p><p>Although nobody wants to see support for their platform get dropped, it's an important step to maintain the stability and security of both Firefox and Tor Browser over time, and will allow developers to utilize newer technologies in both browsers. In addition, supporting x86 for Android has been particularly challenging for our developers due to the 100MB package size limit imposed by Google Play. While we have deployed several workarounds to stay within this limit in the recent past, these often come at a cost – such as x86 Android users missing out on the Conjure pluggable transport, for example.</p><h3>Disabling of WebAssembly now managed by NoScript</h3><p>WebAssembly (or Wasm) is a web technology that helps websites and web apps run faster. It allows web developers to write programs in languages like C, C++ or Rust, and compiles these into a special format that web browsers can run more efficiently.</p><p>As has been suggested in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2407.12297v1\">this meta-analysis from 2024</a>, further investigation of Wasm's potential exploits is necessary – therefore Wasm is currently disabled in the Safer and Safest security levels in order to reduce Tor Browser's attack surface. Up until now, this was achieved by setting the global preference  to false – however this approach was no longer viable after Mozilla implemented part of their PDF reader in Wasm between versions 128 and 140. Consequently, we have decided to move control of Wasm to NoScript, which is bundled with Tor Browser, and already manages JavaScript and other security features. This means that Wasm now works on privileged browser pages such as the PDF renderer, but NoScript will continue blocking the technology on regular websites at the Safer and Safest security levels.</p><p>Users who have manually set  to \"false\" while in the Standard security level will see their security level represented as \"Custom\" instead. To mitigate any issues that may arise with the browser's PDF reader, we encourage those users to switch the preference back to \"true\", thereby passing management of Wasm over to NoScript. Furthermore, manually disabling Wasm at the Standard security level (either via NoScript or ) may also <a href=\"https://tb-manual.torproject.org/anti-fingerprinting/\">make your fingerprint more unique</a> by deviating from Tor Browser's default configuration. To avoid this scenario, we recommend sticking with one of the <a href=\"https://tb-manual.torproject.org/security-settings/\">pre-defined security levels</a> and caution users against making further changes to individual preferences in about:config.</p><p>Alternatively, should you wish to keep Wasm disabled in future, we invite you to increase your security level to Safer or Safest going forward. Note that both Safer and Safest users may notice  switch to \"true\" automatically as management of Wasm is passed over to and blocked by NoScript, meaning that you are still protected regardless. In addition, Safest users in particular are not vulnerable to any potential vulnerabilities introduced by Wasm since the format requires JavaScript to work.</p><p>Tor Browser 15.0 comes with a number of known issues that can be found in <a href=\"https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/-/issues\">Tor Browser's issue tracker</a>. In particular, we would like to highlight the following:</p><p>The initial release of vertical tabs in Tor Browser includes a couple of quirks:</p><ul><li>When the sidebar is visible (such as when vertical tabs are enabled), the window may visibly resize when Tor Browser is launched.</li><li>Due to variations in window size, <a href=\"https://support.torproject.org/tbb/maximized-torbrowser-window/\">Letterboxing</a> may be visible. You still get the anti-fingerprinting protections provided by Letterboxing, but the default window size will be different than intended.</li></ul><p>We are currently working to issue a fix for both of these bugs. Please see <a href=\"https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/-/issues/44096\">tor-browser#44096</a> for details.</p><ul><li>Web pages may not load after updating Tor Browser on older versions of Android. This can be fixed by clearing your app cache manually in <code>Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Tor Browser &gt; Storage &amp; cache</code>.</li></ul>",

I was always amazed with video games and wondered how they were made but I never pursued that curiosity.</p><p>My tinkering habits picked up very late, and now I cannot go by without picking up new things in one form or another. It’s how I learn. I wish I did it sooner. It’s a major part of my learning process now, and I would never be the  person I am today.</p><p>Have you ever spent hours tweaking the mouse sensitivity in your favorite FPS game?</p><p>Have you ever installed a Linux distro, spent days configuring window managers, not because you had to, but purely because it gave you satisfaction and made your workflow exactly yours?</p><p>Ever pulled apart your mechanical keyboard, swapped keycaps, tested switches, and lubed stabilizers just for more thock?</p><p>I have come to understand that there are two kinds of people, those who do things only if it helps them achieve a goal, and those who do things just because. The ideal, of course, is to be a mix of both.</p><blockquote><p>when you tinker and throw away, that’s practice, and practice should inherently be ephemeral, exploratory, and be frequent - <a href=\"https://x.com/ludwigABAP/status/1842366186824032737\"></a></p></blockquote><p>There are plenty of people who still use the VSCode terminal as their default terminal, do not know what vim bindings are, GitHub desktop rather than the cli (at the very least). I’m not saying these are bad things necessarily, just that this should be the minimum, not the median.</p><p>This does not mean I spend every waking hour fiddling with my neovim config. In fact, the last meaningful change to my config was 6 months ago. Finding that balance is where most people fail.</p><p>Over the years I have done so many things that in hindsight have made me appreciate programming more but were completely “unnecessary” in the strict sense.</p><p>In the past week I have, for the first time, written a glsl fragment shader, a rust procedural macro, template c++, a swift app, furthered my hatred for windows development (this is not new), and started using the helix editor more (mainly for good defaults + speed). I didn’t have to do these things, but I did, for fun! And I know more about these things now.</p><p>No time spent learning, is time wasted.</p><p>Acquiring good taste comes through using various things, discarding the ones you don’t like and keeping the ones you do. if you never try various things, you will not acquire good taste.</p><p>And what I mean by taste here is simply the honed ability to distinguish mediocrity from excellence. This will be highly subjective, and not everyone’s taste will be the same, but that is the point, you should NOT have the same taste as someone else.</p><p>Question the status quo, experiment, break things, do this several times, do this everyday and keep doing it.</p>",

Those first Apple silicon Macs  like the Intel machines they replaced, but they were better in every single way.</p><blockquote><p>\n  We knew this to be true: Computers could run fast and hot, or slow and cool. For laptops in particular, the best you could hope for is a middle ground: fast enough and cool enough. But if you wanted a machine that ran really fast, it wasn’t going to run cool (and wasn’t going to last long on battery), and if you wanted a computer that ran cool (and lasted long on battery), it wasn’t going to be fast.</p><p>  We knew this to be true because that was the way things were. But now, with the M1 Macs, it’s not. M1 Macs run very fast and do so while remaining very cool and lasting mind-bogglingly long on battery. It was a fundamental trade-off inherent to PC computing, and now we don’t have to make it.\n</p></blockquote><p>Despite its Touch Bar, I immediately bought that first M1 MacBook Pro, and when the 14-inch MacBook Pro came out a year later, I moved to it. I’m typing these very words on my 14-inch MacBook Pro with an M4 Max inside. Each of these machines was faster than the one before it, outperforming my old iMac Pro and Mac Pro in new ways with every upgrade.</p><p>Apple silicon has been nothing but upside for the Mac, and yet some seem bored already. In the days since Apple announced the M5, I’ve seen and heard this sentiment more than I expected:</p><blockquote><p>\n  This is just another boring incremental upgrade.\n</p></blockquote><p>Back in the PowerPC and Intel days, Macs would sometimes go  between meaningful spec bumps, as Apple waited on its partners to deliver appropriate hardware for various machines. From failing NVIDIA cards in MacBook Pros to 27-inch Intel iMacs that ran so hot the fans were audible at all times, Mac hardware wasn’t always what Apple wanted.</p><p>Of course, some of the issues with previous generations of Mac were Apple’s fault — look no further than the butterfly keyboard or the years the Mac Pro spent in the wilderness. Apple will make questionable decisions in the future, just as it has in the past.</p><p>The difference is that with Apple silicon, Apple owns and controls the primary technologies behind the products it makes, <a href=\"https://asymco.com/2011/01/17/the-cook-doctrine/\">as Tim Cook has always wanted</a>. It means that it can ship updates to its SoCs on a regular cadence, making progress in terms of both power and efficiency each time.</p><p>A predictable update schedule means that incremental updates are inevitable.  then  is not a bad thing; it’s okay that not every release is exciting or groundbreaking. It’s how technology has worked for decades.</p><p>…but some people have short memories. Before the Apple silicon introduction, we all wanted steady, predictable progress in Mac hardware development. We wanted each product in the lineup to be updated regularly and not wither on the vine for years. For <a href=\"https://512pixels.net/2023/06/the-new-new-mac-pro/\">the  part</a>, Apple has delivered. Just look at this chart of the progress Apple has made since the M1:</p><p>I don’t see anything in those charts to complain about, especially given the frequency at which most people buy new computers. That’s one reason why Apple compared the M5 to the M1 in <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/10/apple-unleashes-m5-the-next-big-leap-in-ai-performance-for-apple-silicon/\">its press release announcing the new chip</a>.

      "content": "<p>One day on my drive home, I saw three towers. One of them had a bunch of blinking white lights, another one had red lights that kind of faded in and out, and the third one, well, it wasn't doing anything. I'm lucky to have a radio engineer for a dad, so Dad: <em>why do some towers blink?</em></p><p>Joe: Well, blinking I would call like the way you described it, \"flashing\", \"white light\", or \"strobe\". All these lights are to aid pilots and air traffic. helicopters, fighter planes, regular jets. So that's the purpose of it.</p><p>Jeff: Well that one tower that I saw had red lights that faded in and out, but I even think there's a freestanding tower just north of here that has red and white on top.</p><p>Joe: Well red lighting is a thing. It's in the regulations, it specifies red lighting or white lighting, and one of the things like the red lights can be a bulb like this inside of a red housing, could be LED.</p><p>Jeff: Where'd you find this bulb? This was not in my studio.</p><p>Joe: This bulb is a spare bulb for a tower site. And most of us use the same bulb, same socket, 620 watts. It's a very standard broadcast bulb for a broadcast tower. And a lot of the beacons, they're pretty tall and they'll have one right-side up, and one upside-down. So they'll have two bulbs in the socket. That way, when one bulb burns out, you realize you have a bulb out, but you're still legal with the second bulb.</p><p>Jeff: At my house, I don't have any of this kind of bulb anymore [incandescent]. I have, you know, this is a little bit different size, these are LED. Is that similar on towers?</p><p>Joe: Yeah. So it is the same. Like an <a href=\"https://pr-tech.com/product/l-864865-dual-beacon/\">LED assembly for a tower</a> could be kind of flat, and it has, you know, it's set to just do what it needs to do. So in like white light, that's, typically it used to be always strobes. And at KMOX, you remember we had the whole assembly there. and you see the glass bulb, with xenon gas inside.</p><p>So those were the old way for that, but the newer ones are all white LED, and they can be little pancake-looking things compared to what the things are now. They can direct that LED light really to help airplanes and have less trouble for people who live in homes or apartment buildings nearby.</p><p>Jeff: So if they have a tower like the one that's just north of here that's in a residential area, you're not just flashing everybody constantly.</p><p>Jeff: You know, thinking about that tower, though, why do different towers have different lighting and different colors and things? And I even remember, like, on the tower that's right by here, there's actually teeny tiny little lights that are, like, on the sides, on the legs of the tower.</p><p>Joe: Yeah, well, tower lighting is in the responsibility of FAA, and they have a detailed plan. The options depend on the heights of the tower, where they are at. The location is obviously important. And sometimes red is a good solution, sometimes white, and sometimes both, red and white solution. And an example is the tower that you're talking about.</p><p>Jeff: So why would you want both? It seems like that's twice the complexity.</p><p>Joe: You would have strobe in the day and red at night. And people in their homes at night, a pulsing red light is a lot easier than a big flashing white light.</p><p>Jeff: So sometimes if people are complaining about it, you might go to that solution.</p><p>Joe: You can propose the red at night and the dual lighting works. And then you literally see these two packs and one will be red and one will be white. That's what I've seen mostly, although I heard that they make one now. It's all in one.</p><p>Jeff: [sarcastically] You could have RGB lights—could you do Home Assistant for your tower lighting?</p><p>Joe: You'd have RGB, but that would not be allowed by the FAA.</p><p>Jeff: We'll actually talk about that a little bit too later, because there are some regulations for how you actually monitor these things.</p><p>Jeff: But before we get to that, what about the one tower I saw didn't have any lights that were blinking at all. And I zoomed in and I saw that there was a light on top, but it just wasn't doing anything.</p><p>Joe: Yeah. Well, and this is about daytime mode. So a tower that's painted, and that's legal for obstruction marking, and you don't have to light during the day. So at night, their lights would come on. So you can be in a situation where, like here, you could see three towers. One might be day and night with white light, and two of them might be red light day only, but one kicks on earlier than the other because of their exact photo cell triggering the lights.</p><p>Jeff: Or if the photo cell is covered by a layer of soot from 40 years...</p><p>Joe: Yeah. So that tower is probably in daytime mode, or it could be an AM tower. An AM tower below 200 feet doesn't have to be lit, so that's another one. In fact, all towers, I guess, under 200 feet, unless you're in a particular area where the FAA would require it.</p><p>Jeff: You always have to refer back to the documentation.</p><p>Joe: You always refer to the documentation.</p><p>Jeff: But what is the tower site that we went to for the hot dogs?</p><p>Joe: KHOJ? KHOJ, yeah. Those don't have lights. Those do not have lights.</p><p>Jeff: Because they're under 200 feet.</p><p>Joe: Yes, so they don't need lighting. So, and then they don't need painting either. So that's one of those things that, again, always refer to that because just because you have a tower that's under 200 feet doesn't mean you don't have to make sure it complies or you may have to paint it or you may have to light and paint.</p><p>Tower painting has changed a lot over the years. The older towers have lead in them. So whenever there's a project on the tower, it's not unusual to see the guys in some kind of a, what do they call those?</p><p>Jeff: A full ghillie suit? Or I don't know what they're called.</p><p>Joe: Yeah. Yeah. So they have that too. So anyway, that's the bottom line from then till now.</p><h2>But some short towers  have lights...</h2><p>Jeff: So far, we've been talking about radio and TV towers, the ones that are really big. But what about little small towers? I know I see a lot of cell towers that don't have any lights at all, but sometimes they do. They just have one little light bulb on top. Or even if they're 50 to 100 feet tall, I've seen it sometimes.</p><p>Joe: Yeah, and there's always a reason for seeing a light somewhere, almost always on structures, including buildings and so forth. But if you look around the area where you're seeing that tower that you know is not 200 feet and it's got a light on the top, look you're probably near an airport, a heliport, or somewhere where there's an aviation hazard. You know hospitals, they have their helipads there.</p><p>So everywhere there is a possible hazard for flight for aircraft is going to have lights involved, and that's why we see a lot of buildings even have lights.</p><p>Jeff: So it sounds like we have towers and even buildings that have to have lights put up but who's in charge of all this? Like if I'm going to put up my own tower, who do I need to talk to to make sure that i'm doing it right and get it approved?</p><p>So that includes our broadcast towers, big chimney stacks, water towers, bridges, nuclear power plant cooling towers, wind turbines, tall electrical towers, you know, those ones that they cross a river, they'll have those extra tall ones with markings in the middle. Sometimes those are required to have lighting.</p><p>And there are also rules that even apply during construction projects. So you've got these big buildings going up And you'll notice the cranes will have lights on them. And there's a spec for that, how many lights have to be on the crane, what height it has to be at.</p><p>As you look around the next 12 months, look around at all those lights. You'll enjoy it like I do.</p><p>Jeff: You'll look like a radio engineer once you know about these things!</p><h2>Estimating tower height by light</h2><p>Jeff: So that's made me think, like, looking through these instructions, I did find this page. And I thought, like, could you use tower lights, the number of them, as a way to judge how tall a tower is? Kind of a rough estimate.</p><p>Joe: Yes, actually you can because the specifications, like for tall, these would apply to radio and TV towers. They require so many lights depending on the height.</p><p>Like around here, we would have the F4 version with four lights, four blinking light levels, a light at the top if the antenna here at the top is higher than 40 feet.</p><p>So you can kind of look and get an idea of whether you're looking at a 500-foot tower or a 1,000-foot tower. I don't think you could go like 700 versus 1,000 as easily.</p><p>But you can tell, and the guys know. I know a couple of pilots that are also engineers or selling in radio business, and they can do that. They'll tell you, you know, like I was passing a tower. What's a tower that's a 1,200-foot tower doing out here? So it's pretty fun, and you go to this document has everything you need if you want to take the time and study that and memorize it and then fly.</p><h2>Monitoring and reporting outages (and NOTAMs)</h2><p>Jeff: One other thing that since we've been running this channel I keep getting emails about, if someone sees that there's lights out on a tower, like let's say it's nighttime and you're out there and you notice like one of these towers for the past few days hasn't had a light on, can you do anything about that? What should you do?</p><p>Joe: Well, first of all, if it's required to be lit, every tower that's required to be lit is also required to be monitored.</p><p>So in radio, we put a monitoring circuit on the electrical feed to the filaments and you can measure how much current is going through there, right? So you've got to monitor it. You've got to get alarmed by that. The alarm can call you or reach you. But you also have to call every day, check your circuit, your system, and make sure the lights are on. So if you only are lit at night, that means that call has to happen after it's dark.</p><p>You've got to verify that your lighting is working, and you have to report it within 30 minutes. And you find that if a light's out, you've got to report it. And we call that a <a href=\"https://notams.aim.faa.gov/#News\">NOTAM</a>, where the FAA puts it on a system that all the pilots can have access to. And they know that there's a tower there, but it's lights out. And they can use it in their flight planning.</p><p>Jeff: You're an engineer and you have the tie-in with the FAA or whatever. But what would I be able to do if I did see a tower that was out?</p><p>Joe: Well, you can do a NOTAM search. Try to look through and see if you see it. The other thing, you could contact the tower owner or the engineer at the site, the tower's engineer, and they can check into it. They should already know because they have their monitoring equipment, right?</p><p>Joe: They should already know. They do.</p><p>And then, of course, if you're out there, usually the tower, either on the tower or in the fencing around it or on the building, will have an <a href=\"https://wireless2.fcc.gov/UlsApp/AsrSearch/asrRegistrationSearch.jsp\">ASR number</a>, which identifies that tower to the FAA and the FCC, actually. But that number would be the exact tower that you'd be reporting.</p><p>Jeff: So hopefully you learned a little bit more about why there are so many flashing lights around at night and not just for radio towers, but for bridges, buildings, and more. What other things do you want to know about towers? Let us know in the comments.</p>",

Of course, the underlying data isn’t quite so simple as the headline stat. There are different degrees of compatibility gamers must consider when checking if their favorite Windows games work on Linux distros like Mint, Zorin, <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/bazzite-is-a-steamos-clone-that-supports-gaming-pcs-and-the-steam-deck\" data-before-rewrite-localise=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/bazzite-is-a-steamos-clone-that-supports-gaming-pcs-and-the-steam-deck\">Bazzite</a>, or even SteamOS.</p><a aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/software/linux/nearly-90-percent-of-windows-games-now-run-on-linux-latest-data-shows-as-windows-10-dies-gaming-on-linux-is-more-viable-than-ever\" data-url=\"\" target=\"_blank\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer-when-downgrade\" data-hl-processed=\"none\"></a><p>The above chart relies on Boiling Steam’s five definitions of playability, but these aren’t a million miles from the <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/valve-speeds-steam-deck-game-verification-243-titles\" data-before-rewrite-localise=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/valve-speeds-steam-deck-game-verification-243-titles\">Steam Deck ratings</a><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/valve\" data-auto-tag-linker=\"true\" data-before-rewrite-localise=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/valve\">Valve</a> dishes out. The main difference seems to be that Boiling Steam doesn’t seem to care whether Steam Deck performance is a gaming-limiting factor. So, in a way, its ratings are perhaps more useful to desktop and laptop PC users who typically have systems that easily outpace a Steam Deck.</p><p>Boiling Steam platinum (green) rank denotes games that run perfectly, out of the box. Gold (light green) requires just minor tweaks. Silver (yellow) games are playable but have some imperfections. Borked (dark red) games simply refuse to launch. Lastly, Bronze (red) titles exist in the murky water between silver and borked.</p><p>Looking at the chart trends, we see an encouraging growth in the number of new releases that are platinum (green) rated, and a thinning down of the red/dark red zone. Developers will, of course, benefit from more hardware being able to play their games with few if any wrinkles, so there must be an incentive to spend at least a little time checking a new Windows game on Linux, or the Steam Deck specifically.</p><p>On the flip side, there are some popular titles that don’t look like they will be becoming Linux-friendly anytime soon. The well-known compatibility issues with various <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/battlefield-6s-javelin-anti-cheat-secure-boot-requirement-could-kill-its-steam-deck-support\" data-before-rewrite-localise=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/battlefield-6s-javelin-anti-cheat-secure-boot-requirement-could-kill-its-steam-deck-support\">anti-cheat </a>technology platforms look set to persist, for now. Moreover, Boiling Steam notes that other devs just seem to be averse to non-Windows gamers. There is quite a bit that can be done with those non-intentionally stubborn games, though. We’d recommend researching community-driven Linux compatibility tips and tweaks for your favorite games.</p><a href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\" data-url=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\" target=\"_blank\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer-when-downgrade\" data-hl-processed=\"none\"><figure data-bordeaux-image-check=\"\"></figure></a>",

But this is necessarily tied up with machine-learning for chemical design accelerating, so, again, this is not necessarily something I’d expect EvE’s work to contribute to by the end of the year. But perhaps soon!</p><p>This all said, even if you agreed that the value proposition that EvE is claiming is real, you may struggle to verbalize exactly how you would understand the off-target effects of the 13,000~ FDA approved drugs out there. What assays would you use? How do you dose any given drug? How do you understand the translation of your assay to real-world settings?</p><p>Let’s walk through the EvE workflow.</p><p>First, you need to decide what drugs you're actually going to test. While there are technically around 13,000 FDA-approved drugs out there, many of them aren't particularly relevant for this kind of screening. You can immediately exclude things like topical medications, inhalants, radioisotopes, and simple nutrients, stuff that is known to be largely innocuous or not have much systemic impact. After this initial filtering, you end up with about 1,600 small molecule drugs that are worth investigating. But this number gets further whittled down further based on practical constraints; availability, cost, licensing requirements, etc.</p><p>From this, EvE ended up with a library of 1,397 compounds to screen.</p><p><em>(everything x everything)</em></p><p>And, indeed, that turns out to be the case.</p><p><strong>7-transmembrane receptors (also known as GPCRs). </strong><a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11089380/\" rel=\"\"> 110 GPCR’s</a><a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11279859/\" rel=\"\"> 12-13 NR’s</a><a href=\"https://data.evebio.org/data_explorer__3.html#targets\" rel=\"\"> 56 GPCR’s and 29 NR’s</a></p><p>They hope to do much more than this too, but we’ll cover that in the last section.</p><p><a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10252477/\" rel=\"\"> 13% of FDA-approved drugs target NR’s</a><a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5820538/\" rel=\"\"> 35% for GPCR’s</a></p><ol><li><p><strong>TR-FRET-based co-factor recruitment assays for NRs</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>.

The numbers ranged from a low of 11 to a high of 104 potential off-targets routinely profiled per company, with a median of about 45. Interestingly, the industry’s opinions regarding which potential off-targets to screen vary widely. The total number of potential off-targets screened, across the universe of all 18 pharmas, was 763, yet only 12% of them were screened by more than a third of those companies.</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><em>Novartis, who presented data collected “over a multi-year period” profiling drug/target interactions across a median of about 800 drugs per target and 105 gene product targets…</em></p></blockquote><p><em>it is better for everyone if such a dataset is collected using a single, standardized protocol instead of compiled from unrelated experiments over years.</em></p><p>I asked Bill exactly this question, and the answer was a two-parter.</p><p><strong>A logical conclusion of this is that nearly every receptor covered in these sorts of screens is a safety-oriented receptor</strong><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41573-024-00942-3\" rel=\"\"> Indeed, the vast majority of screened receptors lie within the so-called Bowes-44 set</a><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd3845\" rel=\"\"> 2012 paper that identified 44 receptors known to be often implicated in safety-related drug failures.</a></p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_(finance)\" rel=\"\">alpha</a></p><p>EvE is still quite young, just over 2 years old, and I think the future of it is going to look really, really crazy.

Bill said he’s open to exploring even more drug targets, but he also said, surprisingly, that EvE may add more chemicals on top of the 1,600~ planned FDA-approved drugs.

      "content": "<p>We recently published a <a href=\"https://f-droid.org/en/2025/09/29/google-developer-registration-decree.html\">blog\npost</a>\nwith our reaction to the new Google Developer Program and how it impacts\nyour freedom to use the devices that you own in the ways that you want. The\npost garnered quite a lot of feedback and interest from the community and\npress, as well as various civil society groups and regulatory agencies.</p><p>In this post, I hope to clarify and expand on some of the points and rebut\nsome of the counter-messaging that we have witnessed.</p><h3>Google’s message that “Sideloading is Not Going Away” is clear, concise, and false</h3><p>Shortly after our post was published, Google aired an\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7DEhW-mjdc&amp;t=613s\">episode</a> of their\nAndroid Developers Roundtable series, where they state unequivocally that\n“sideloading isn’t going anywhere”. They follow-up with a <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/09/lets-talk-security-answering-your-top.html\">blog\npost</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Does this mean sideloading is going away on Android?</strong> Absolutely not. Sideloading is fundamental to Android and it is not going away.</em></p></blockquote><p>This statement is untrue. The developer verification decree effectively ends\nthe ability for individuals to choose what software they run on the devices\nthey own.</p><p>It bears reminding that “sideload” is a made-up term. Putting software on\nyour computer is simply called “installing”, regardless of whether that\ncomputer is in your pocket or on your desk. This could perhaps be further\nprecised as “ installing”, in case you need to make a distinction\nbetween obtaining software the old-fashioned way versus going through a\nrent-seeking intermediary marketplace like the Google Play Store or the\nApple App Store.</p><p>Regardless, the term “sideload” was coined to insinuate that there is\nsomething dark and sinister about the process, as if the user were making an\nend-run around safeguards that are designed to keep you protected and\nsecure. But if we reluctantly accept that “sideloading” is a term that has\nwriggled its way into common parlance, then we should at least use a\nconsistent definition for it. Wikipedia’s summary\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sideloading\">definition</a> is:</p><blockquote><p><em>the transfer of apps from web sources that are not vendor-approved</em></p></blockquote><p>By this definition, Google’s statement that “sideloading is not going away”\nis simply . The vendor — Google, in the case of Android certified\ndevices — will, in point of fact, be approving the source. The supplicant\napp developer must register with Google, pay a fee, provide government\nidentification, agree to non-negotiable (and ever-changing) terms and\nconditions, enumerate all their current and future application identifiers,\nupload evidence of their private signing key, and then hope and wait for\nGoogle’s approval.</p><h3>What this means for your rights</h3><p>You, the consumer, purchased your Android device believing in Google’s\npromise that it was an open computing platform and that you could run\nwhatever software you choose on it. Instead, starting next year, they will\nbe non-consensually pushing an update to your operating system that\nirrevocably blocks this right and leaves you at the mercy of their judgement\nover what software you are permitted to trust.</p><p>You, the creator, can no longer develop an app and share it directly with\nyour friends, family, and community without first seeking Google’s\napproval. The promise of Android — and a marketing advantage it has used to\ndistinguish itself against the iPhone — has always been that it is\n“open”. But Google clearly feels that they have enough of a lock on the\nAndroid ecosystem, along with sufficient regulatory capture, that they can\nnow jettison this principle with prejudice and impunity.</p><p>You, the state, are ceding the rights of your citizens and your own digital\nsovereignty to a company with a track record of complying with the\nextrajudicial demands of authoritarian regimes to remove perfectly legal\napps that they happen to dislike. The software that is critical to the\nrunning of your businesses and governments will be at the mercy of the\nopaque whims of a distant and unaccountable corporation. Monocultures are\nperilous not just in agriculture, but in software distribution as well.</p><p>As a reminder, this applies not just to devices that exclusively use the\nGoogle Play Store: this is for  Android Certified device \nin the world, which encompasses over 95% of all Android devices outside of\nChina. Regardless of whether the device owner prefers to use a competing app\nstore like the Samsung Galaxy Store or the Epic Games Store, or a free and\nopen-source app repository like F-Droid, they will be captive to the\noverarching policies unilaterally dictated by a competing corporate entity.</p><h3>The place of greater safety</h3><p>In promoting their developer registration program, Google\n<a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/08/elevating-android-security.html\">purports</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>Our recent analysis found over 50 times more malware from internet-sideloaded sources than on apps available through Google Play.</em></p></blockquote><p>We haven’t seen this recent analysis — or any other supporting evidence —\nbut the “50 times” multiple does certainly sound like great cause for\ndistress (even if it is a surprisingly round number). But given the recent\n<a href=\"https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/09/224-malicious-apps-removed-from-the-google-play-store-after-ad-fraud-campaign-discovered\">news</a>\nof “224 malicious apps removed from the Google Play Store after ad fraud\ncampaign discovered”, we are left to wonder whether their energies might\nbetter be spent assessing and improving their own safeguards rather than\ncasting vague disparagements against the software development communities\nthat thrive outside their walled garden.</p><p>In addition, other recent\n<a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/26/apps_android_malware/\">news</a> of over\n19 million downloads of malware from the Play Store leads us to question\nwhether the sole judgement of a single corporate entity can be trusted to\nidentify and assess malware, especially when that judgement is clouded by\ncommercial incentives that may not align with the well-being of their users.</p><p>Google has been facing public outcry against their heavy-handed policies for\na long time, but this trend has accelerated recently. Last year they\n<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/chromes-manifest-v3-and-its-changes-for-ad-blocking-are-coming-real-soon/\">crippled\nad-blockers</a>\nin Chrome and Chromium-based browsers by forcing through their unpopular\n“manifest v3” requirement for plugins, and earlier this year they <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/google-makes-android-development-private-will-continue-open-source-releases/\">closed\noff</a>\nthe development of the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), which is how they\nwere able to clandestinely implement the verification infrastructure that\nenforces their developer registration decree.</p><p>Developer verification is an existential threat to free software\ndistribution platforms like F-Droid as well as emergent commercial\ncompetitors to the Play Store. We are witnessing a groundswell of opposition\nto this attempt from both our user and developer communities, as well as the\ntech press and civil society groups, but public policymakers still need to\nbe educated about the threat.</p><p>To learn more about what you can do as a consumer, visit\n<a href=\"https://keepandroidopen.org\">keepandroidopen.org</a> for information on how to\ncontact your representative agencies and advocate for keeping the Android\necosystem open for consumers and competition.</p><p>If you are an app developer, we recommend against signing yourself up for\nGoogle’s developer registration program at this time. We unequivocally\nreject their attempt to force this program upon the world.</p><p>Over half of all humankind uses an Android smartphone. Google does not own\nyour phone. You own your phone. You have the right to decide who to trust,\nand where you can get your software from.</p>",

Despite the project's relative youth and single\nactive contributor, Fil-C is capable of compiling an\nentire memory-safe Linux user space (based on\n<a href=\"https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/\">\nLinux From Scratch</a>),\nalbeit with some modifications to the more complex programs. It also features\nmemory-safe signal handling and a concurrent garbage collector.\n</p><p>\nFil-C is a fork of\n<a href=\"https://clang.llvm.org/\">\nClang</a>; it's available under an Apache v2.0\nlicense with LLVM exceptions for the runtime. Changes from the upstream compiler\nare occasionally merged in, with Fil-C currently being based on version 20.1.8\nfrom July 2025. The project is a personal passion\nof Filip Pizlo, who has previously worked on the runtimes of a number of\nmanaged languages, including Java and JavaScript. When he first began the\nproject, he was not sure that it was even possible. The initial implementation\nwas prohibitively slow to run, since it needed to insert a lot of different safety checks. This has\ngiven Fil-C a reputation for slowness. Since\nthe initial implementation proved viable, however, Pizlo has managed to optimize a number\nof common cases, making Fil-C-generated code only a few times slower than\nClang-generated code, although the exact slowdown depends heavily on the\nstructure of the benchmarked program.\n</p><p>\nReliable benchmarking is notoriously finicky, but in order to get some rough feel for\nwhether that level of performance impact would be problematic, I compiled Bash\nversion 5.2.32 with Fil-C and tried using it as my shell. Bash is nearly a best\ncase for Fil-C, because it spends more time running external programs than\nrunning its own code, but I still expected the performance difference to be\nnoticeable. It wasn't. So, at least for some programs, the performance overhead\nof Fil-C does not seem to be a problem in practice.\n</p><blockquote><b>No AI slop, all substance: subscribe to LWN today</b><p>\nLWN has always been about quality over quantity; we need your help\nto continue publishing in-depth, reader-focused articles about Linux\nand the free-software community.

As a result, objects compiled with Fil-C won't\nlink correctly against objects generated by other compilers. Since Fil-C is a\nfull implementation of C and C++ at the source-code level, however, in practice\nthis just requires everything to be recompiled with Fil-C. Inter-language\nlinking, such as with Rust, is not currently supported by the project.\n</p><p>\nThe major challenge of rendering C memory-safe is, of course, pointer handling.\nThis is especially complicated by the fact that, as the\n<a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/1037974/\">\nlong road to CHERI-compatibility</a>\nhas shown, many programs expect a pointer to be 32 or 64 bits, depending on the\narchitecture.\nFil-C has tried several different ways to represent pointers since the project's\nbeginning in 2023. Fil-C's first pointers were 256 bits, not thread-safe, and\ndidn't protect against use-after-free bugs. The current implementation, called\n<a href=\"https://fil-c.org/invisicaps\">\n\"InvisiCaps\"</a>, allows\nfor pointers that appear to match the natural pointer size of the architecture\n(although this requires storing some auxiliary information elsewhere),\nwith full support for concurrency and\ncatching use-after-free bugs, at the expense of some run-time overhead.\n</p><p>\nFil-C's documentation\ncompares InvisiCaps to a software\nimplementation of CHERI: pointers are separated into a trusted \"capability\"\npiece and an untrusted \"address\" piece. Since Fil-C controls how the program is\ncompiled, it can ensure that the program doesn't have direct\naccess to the capabilities of any pointers, and therefore the runtime can rely\non them being uncorrupted. The tricky part of the implementation comes from how\nthese two pieces of information are stored in what looks to the program like 64\nbits.\n</p><p>\nWhen Fil-C allocates an object on the heap, it adds two metadata words before\nthe start of the allocated object: an upper bound, used to check accesses to the\nobject based on its size, and an \"aux word\" that is used to store additional\npointer metadata. When the program first writes a pointer value into an object, the\nruntime allocates a new auxiliary allocation of the same size as the object being written\ninto, and puts an actual hardware-level\npointer (i.e., one without an attached capability)\nto the new allocation into the aux word of the object. This auxiliary allocation, which is\ninvisible to the program being compiled, is used to\nstore the associated capability information for the pointer being stored (and is\nalso reused for any additional pointers stored into the object later). The address\nvalue is stored into the object as normal, so any C bit-twiddling\ntechniques that require looking at the stored value of the pointer work as\nexpected.\n</p><p>\nThis approach does mean that structures that contain pointers end up using twice\nas much memory, and every load of a pointer involves a pointer indirection\nthrough the aux word. In practice, the documentation claims that the\nperformance overhead of this approach for most programs makes them run about four\ntimes more slowly, although that number depends on how heavily the program makes\nuse of pointers. Still, he has ideas for several optimizations that he hopes can\nbring the performance overhead down over time.\n</p><p>\nOne wrinkle with this approach is atomic access to pointers — i.e. using\n<a href=\"https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/atomic.html\"></a> or . Luckily, there is\nno problem that cannot be solved with more pointer indirection: when the program\nloads or stores a pointer value atomically, instead of having the auxiliary\nallocation contain the capability information directly, it points to a\nthird 128-bit allocation that stores the capability and pointer value together.\nThat allocation can be updated with 128-bit atomic instructions, if the platform\nsupports them, or by creating new allocations and atomically swapping the\npointers to them.\n</p><p>\nSince the aux word is used to store a pointer value, Fil-C can use\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_pointer\">\npointer\ntagging</a> to store some additional information there as well; that is used to\nindicate special types of objects that need to be handled differently, such as\nfunctions, threads, and\n<a href=\"https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html\"></a>-backed allocations. It's also used to\nmark freed objects, so that any access results in an error message and a crash.\n</p><p>\nWhen an object is freed, its aux word marks it as a free object, which lets the\nauxiliary allocation be reclaimed immediately. The\noriginal object can't be freed immediately, however.\nOtherwise, a program could free an object,\nallocate a new object in the same location, and thereby cover up use-after-free bugs.\nInstead, Fil-C\n<a href=\"https://fil-c.org/fugc\">\nuses a garbage collector</a> to free an object's backing\nmemory only once all of the pointers to it go away. Unlike other garbage collectors\nfor C — such as\n<a href=\"https://www.hboehm.info/gc/\">\nthe Boehm-Demers-Weiser garbage collector</a> —\nFil-C can use the auxiliary\ncapability information to track live objects precisely.\n</p><p>\nFil-C's garbage collector is both parallel (collection happens faster the more\ncores are available) and concurrent (collection happens without pausing the\nprogram). Technically, the garbage collector does require threads to\noccasionally pause just long enough to tell it where pointers are located on the\nstack, but that only occurs at special \"safe points\" — otherwise, the program\ncan load and manipulate pointers without notifying the garbage collector. Safe\npoints are used as a synchronization barrier: the collector can't know that an object\nis really garbage until every thread has passed at least one safe point since it\nfinished marking. This synchronization is done with atomic instructions,\nhowever, so in practice threads never need to pause for longer than a few\ninstructions.\n</p><p>\nThe exception is the implementation of\n<a href=\"https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fork.2.html\"></a>, which uses the\nsafe points needed by the garbage collector to temporarily pause all of the threads\nin the program in order to prevent race conditions while forking. Fil-C inserts\na safe point at every backward control-flow edge, i.e., whenever code could\nexecute in a loop. In the common case, the inserted code just needs to load a flag register\nand confirm that the garbage collector has not requested anything be done. If\nthe garbage collector does have a request for the thread, the thread runs a callback to\nperform the needed synchronization.\n</p><p>\nFil-C uses the same safe-point mechanism to implement signal handling. Signal\nhandlers are only run when the interrupted thread reaches a safe point. That, in\nturn, allows signal handlers to allocate and free memory without interfering\nwith the garbage collector's operation; Fil-C's\n<a href=\"https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/malloc.3.html\"></a> is signal-safe.\n</p><p>\nLinux From Scratch (LFS) is a tutorial on compiling one's own complete\nLinux user space. It walks through the steps of compiling and installing all of the core\nsoftware needed for a typical Linux user space in a\n<a href=\"https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/chroot.2.html\"></a>\nenvironment. Pizlo has successfully\n<a href=\"https://fil-c.org/pizlix\">\nrun through</a> LFS with Fil-C to\nproduce a memory-safe version, although a non-Fil-C compiler is still needed to\nbuild some fundamental components, such as Fil-C's own runtime,\nthe GNU C library, and the kernel. (While Fil-C's runtime relies on a normal\ncopy of the GNU C library to make system calls, the programs that Fil-C compiles\nuse a Fil-C-compiled version of the library.)\n</p><p>\nThe process is mostly identical to LFS up through the end of chapter 7, because\neverything prior to that point consists of using cross-build tools to obtain a\nworking compiler in the  environment. The one difference is\nthat the cross-build tools are built with a different configured prefix, so that\nthey won't conflict with Fil-C. At that point, one can\nbuild a copy of Fil-C and use it to mostly replace the existing compiler. The\nremaining steps of LFS are unchanged.\n</p><p>\nOverall, Fil-C offers a remarkably complete solution for making existing C\nprograms memory-safe. While it does nothing for undefined behavior that is not\nrelated to memory safety,\nthe most pernicious and difficult-to-prevent security\nvulnerabilities in C programs tend to rely on exploiting memory-unsafe\nbehavior. Readers who have already considered and rejected Fil-C for their use\ncase due to its early performance problems may wish to take a second look —\nalthough anyone hoping for stability might want to wait for others to take the\nplunge, given the project's relative immaturity.\nThat said, for existing applications where a sizeable performance hit is preferable to an\nexploitable vulnerability, Fil-C is an excellent choice.\n</p>",

And I can guarantee that HOPL will brightly flash red.</p><p>On a last note, I am not a legal expert, so if you are, I would welcome your suggestions for improvements. I\ndidn't make this license just as a joke. I truly believe it is necessary that we have such a<p>\ngood license to foster and protect human-only online spaces.</p></p><p><em>note: this license is also published on <a href=\"https://github.com/fvdsn/hopl\">github</a></em></p><div><pre><code>Human Only Public License (HOPL)\nVersion 1.0\n\nCopyright (c) [year] [copyright holder]\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\n1.

      "content": "<p><strong>How far would you go for realism? </strong>The world of flight simulation has come a long way over the past 3 decades of X-Plane. Aircraft cockpits have constantly evolved with new metrology and texturing tools to provide some of the premier virtual experiences we have today! But to flight-simmers, there is nothing that beats having the real cockpit in front of you. We all have that one aircraft we are phenomenologically attached to. It could be the feel of a switch of a 737, the sound of an A320 PTU pulsing through the cabin, the smell of coffee-stained seats of an MD-11, or the leathered touch of a C172 glareshield.</p><p>Pilots around the world spare no expense in bringing that experience into their offices, garages or living rooms (provided their significant other can tolerate the sunk cost). To build one’s own cockpit is a monumental effort, often done with a sharp engineering or creative mind, and the close collaboration of like-minded folk.</p><p>And somewhere in a tiny unit in San Jose, CA… a group of simmers are racing against the clock to build their own sim-cockpit, in time for WorldFlight 2025. However, there’s one catch… There are no off-the-shelf components specifically tailored for simulator use available to help them. They will have to build their 747-200 </p><h2>1.

Justin, Kyle, Jason and Matt, and a few other individuals that many community members may already be familiar with…</p><blockquote><p>Kyle: Our team is mostly just the people who were crazy enough to believe in this project. Our&nbsp;backgrounds range in construction, engineering and aviation. Beyond that we have several&nbsp;people who live further from the sim and help remotely or fly in for worldflight.&nbsp;The sim is based in San Jose, CA, just a few minutes down the road from SJC. The team is mostly based across California with a few of us who live in Seattle and commute to the sim regularly to work on it.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><h4>About Justin (Jsnapp1982) – The Captain <a href=\"https://www.x-plane.com/2025/10/how-to-build-a-747-a-worldflight-story/#about-justin-jsnapp1982-the-captain\"></a></h4><p>Chances are, if you are on Twitch and you are streaming an aircraft with more than 2 engines and built in the 20th Century, you are likely to find Justin! Some users may also be familiar with Justin as the author of the popular commercial third-party plugin – Shared Flight. With the objective of bringing true cockpit CRM to everyone, Shared Flight provides users with a seamless shared-cockpit experience. Pilots can authentically experience the true workload and co-operation needed to operate aircraft such as the 747, Concorde and other such quirky aircraft of their time.</p><a href=\"https://sharedflight.com/\" target=\"_blank\"></a><blockquote><p>I used to fly FSX as my main sim, and then when X-Plane 11 was announced I decided to give it a closer look. Liking what I saw I bought XP10 and 11, and started playing 10 while waiting for the release. I’ve been with X-Plane ever since, and over the years have gotten deeper into developing for the sim, testing addons, and now the natural progression has led me towards building the ultimate sim, combining my real life engineering experience with my virtual addon development and flight sim experience.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Kyle also doesn’t need much of an introduction. A seasoned scenery developer, many will know his group “Zero Dollar Payware.” A team which has brought fantastic payware and freeware scenery to X-Plane, including Heathrow, Louisville, Anchorage, Hawarden, Incheon and more!</p><a href=\"https://forum.inibuilds.com/files/category/174-zero-dollar-payware/\" target=\"_blank\"></a><p>With thanks to the hard work of Vatsim staff and organisers, users will convene for a few extraordinary events. Whilst “Cross The Pond” may be the most famous, it is WorldFlight that is truly the most intensive among the organised group flights.</p><p> is a unique annual event that brings together flight simulation enthusiasts from around the globe for a week-long virtual circumnavigation of the planet — all in the name of charity. Since its inception in the late 1990s, WorldFlight has raised over $1 million for good causes by combining the realism of full-scale simulator operations with the passion of an international online community. During the event, teams operating high-fidelity cockpit simulators — alongside countless individual pilots — flying scheduled legs over seven days on the VATSIM network. The event not only challenges participants with complex flight planning, tight turnarounds, and remote destinations but also fosters a real sense of camaraderie among pilots, air traffic controllers, and spectators who join live streams, track flights, or even fly along. The most famous of which is Team Simfest, spearheaded by Gary Oliver!</p><p>The 2025 edition of WorldFlight will take place from , starting once again in , before crossing continents, oceans, and even Antarctica on its way around the world. Teams will operate through a diverse mix of destinations — from major international hubs to remote outposts — with the goal of completing the global journey in just one week. More than just a test of aviation skill, WorldFlight 2025 promises to be a celebration of community, realism, and shared purpose — proving once again that flight simulation can make a real-world difference.</p><blockquote><p>Kyle:  As far as WorldFlight, that is an easy one. Worldflight is basically the pinnacle of flightsim events. You have an entire crew operating 24/7 in a single cockpit. You have logistics, scheduling, CRM, live streaming and of course the entire thing is benefiting charity. There’s really everything you could ask for, and it’s in a grand format that really makes it feel like a big event. Spending an entire week doing nothing but flying is something you only get with WorldFlight.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><h2>3. Finding the right aircraft <a href=\"https://www.x-plane.com/2025/10/how-to-build-a-747-a-worldflight-story/#3-finding-the-right-aircraft\"></a></h2><p>With a target date set, the team needed an airframe to base their cockpit on. And what better aircraft to model… than the Boeing 747 Classic!</p><p>The Boeing 747, often nicknamed the “Queen of the Skies,” revolutionised air travel when it first took to the skies in 1969. Designed as the world’s first widebody “jumbo jet,” the 747 offered unprecedented passenger capacity and range, dramatically lowering the cost per seat-mile and opening the door to affordable long-haul travel for millions. Over five decades, the 747 family became an icon of aviation, serving in roles ranging from luxurious passenger transport to freighter, government aircraft, and even space shuttle carrier. Its distinctive humpbacked silhouette remains one of the most recognisable shapes in the sky.</p><p>X-Plane has always had an affinity for quirky and complex aircraft. Fortunately, on the 17th September 2021, a fantastic, highly detailed simulation of the 747-200 was released by critically acclaimed developer, Felis!</p><p> In the world of flight simulation, the  has earned widespread praise as one of the most detailed and faithful recreations of a classic jetliner ever made. This aircraft captures the golden era of aviation with a depth and realism rarely seen outside of professional simulators. From meticulously modelled systems and authentic cockpit workflows to period-correct avionics and flight dynamics, the Felis 747 has been celebrated for delivering not just an aircraft, but an experience — one that immerses sim pilots in the complexity and character of early widebody operations.</p><h4>Meet The Donor Aircraft: MSN23640 <a href=\"https://www.x-plane.com/2025/10/how-to-build-a-747-a-worldflight-story/#meet-the-donor-aircraft-msn23640\"></a></h4><p>With a pre-existing simulation platform available, the next step was to find a real-life donor aircraft as a source for the external frame and interior cockpit/panels. What better way to preserve the legacy of an aircraft than to use MSN23640.</p><p>The aircraft has an interesting&nbsp;history! A Boeing  whose life story mirrors the rise and evolution of long-haul air travel itself. Delivered brand-new to  in  as , she spent her early years crossing the Pacific in the airline’s iconic “Landor style” livery — carrying thousands of passengers between Tokyo, San Francisco, London, and beyond. For nearly two decades, she was a workhorse of JAL’s global network, a flying ambassador of Japan’s aviation boom.</p><blockquote><p>Kyle: Although our (donor) cockpit is actually from a 747-300, but the differences between the -200 and -300 are minimal. The 747 classic is not just the Queen-of-the-skies, it’s the original Queen. No fancy glass displays, no FMS, no advanced systems. It’s old school jet age flying and has a lot more depth in systems and operations than a newer jet which keeps things exciting. Having a 3 person crew is great just because it’s so unique these days and it makes the CRM* aspect more important. </p><p>All the official worldflight teams fly modern two-person crew jets, we thought a classic jet is more fun to fly and nobody else does it, so why not us? On top of all of that, it comes with the benefit that we spend a lot more time talking about actual flying, because the nature of the plane demands it, so our viewers get to learn a lot about operating older planes and share knowledge about how things used to be done in the old days.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><em>*CRM = Crew Resource Management</em></p><p>When her time with the flag carrier came to an end, the aircraft was purchased by <strong>Wells Fargo Bank Northwest</strong> and later found a new chapter in Russia with , re-registered as . Even as newer, more efficient jets began to dominate the skies, this veteran 747 soldiered on well into the 2010s.</p><p>Alas, nothing lasts forever. VP-BGY was placed into storage in 2012 at Bruntingthorpe Airfield, UK. An unusual airfield, this former RAF airfield has since played host to TV and Movie studios, restoration groups, and houses historic aircraft such as the VC10, Tri-Star and 747 Classics. The aircraft sat parked behind ground litter for a decade before finally being sent for breaking in 2022, and parts were sold to a scrapyard in St. Athan.</p><p>The cockpit was listed on ebay in 2024. After careful comparison with a few candidates (both domestic and abroad), VP-BGY was saved by the team, a great first step! However, a plethora of logistical questions come to mind… How do you ship a heavy load from the UK to the USA? And how do you mount a cockpit in the home of your pre-existing Sim Garage?</p><h2>4. DIY 747: A Race Against The Clock! <a href=\"https://www.x-plane.com/2025/10/how-to-build-a-747-a-worldflight-story/#4-diy-747-a-race-against-the-clock\"></a></h2><h4>How to engineer a cockpit and interface it with X-Plane <a href=\"https://www.x-plane.com/2025/10/how-to-build-a-747-a-worldflight-story/#how-to-engineer-a-cockpit-and-interface-it-with-x-plane\"></a></h4><p>The first step was to remove the previous year’s cockpit shell. A noble attempt at matching a 747 frame, but nothing beats the real thing!</p><blockquote><p>Kyle: Last year we built a 747 cockpit out of wood and used off the shelf components. It was built in a day in the garage of an Airbnb and served as a proof of concept. We learned a lot about flying WorldFlight and building a sim, but the biggest thing we learned is that we wanted to take it to the next level. </p><p>The big question was “Should we build our own cockpit and instruments to a higher fidelity?” or “Just buy a real one and convert it to a sim?” After crunching the numbers and browsing eBay for cockpits we had our answer…</p></blockquote><p><em>The 2024 Mk1 747 Cockpit “Cedar Clipper”, so called as the team were flying under a Pan Am callsign in 2024. To the right, a look at the new enclosure</em></p><p>An office “shell” was constructed with an upper floor, from which the original shell could be lifted and placed. This would provide the team with options and work areas later in the project.</p><p><em>The Mk1 shell lifted into its final spot for later decommission</em>ing<em>, whilst the Mk2 cockpit is placed downstairs.</em></p><p>The cockpit is heavy… very heavy, and needs supports to distribute the load. Aluminium standoffs were considered, but wooden pallets were sufficient for now. With the cockpit in position and a significant head start on panel equipment and wiring, the team wasted no time in preparing the metal husk to be converted into a simulator! The deck was cleaned, panels opened, and wiring stripped. The auto-throttle handles were seized by a chain that had to be removed. As the team developed more of an understanding of Boeing’s mad brilliance in engineering, plans could now start to be formed about components, electrical wiring and interfacing with X-Plane. There are no off-the-shelf components for this project, so all inputs need to use original buttons, a significant amount of reverse engineering!</p><p><em>Powering up the 747 Recirculation Fan</em></p><blockquote><p>Kyle: This my first full sim, the most I’ve done previously is make some basic switch panels when I was in college. There are so many challenges with turning a real plane into a sim, but the biggest one is the sheer complexity and number of wires. Every wire that leaves the cockpit was cut when it was removed from the rest of the plane, so there are&nbsp;of wires that go to nowhere. Finding the one wire that you need is literally like finding a needle in a haystack and proved to be one of the most time consuming things. </p></blockquote><p>The team is composed of talented individuals with backgrounds in electrical engineering, aviation, construction, fabrication and more. So the task of creating an interface is just another Tuesday to them. In many cases, interfaces are first experimented on breadboards and Arduinos/Raspberry Pi Pico Boards, and then brand new PCBs are designed and sent for fabrication.</p><p>X-Plane’s data handling is an extremely powerful tool for the discerning cockpit-builder. Datarefs and Commands can be easily searched, assigned and manipulated in real time. Using those values, the aircraft can be mapped to the simulator, with all the dials and knobs driving/being driven by the simulation. With some collaboration with the aircraft author himself, the project can use the Felis 747-200 to full effect!</p><p>As each button and dial was tested, more of the aircraft slowly roared into life, with the added benefit of the sound of real fans, relay banks, and aural warnings originating from the original equipment!</p><blockquote><p>Kyle: Consider that each single switch is two wires, each light is one wire, that right there tallies up to nearly 1000 wires alone. In addition there is just a lot to learn, we need to fully understand how each instrument is designed, what it interacts with, what parts of the system we still have vs what has been cut out, and then we need to somehow put that all together and make it talk to X-Plane. Nearly everything is analog, so we need to do a lot of signal processing just to get it to the point a computer can read it. Unlike newer planes that use mostly *ARINC and digital busses (which are just a few wires), we’ve got dozens of wires per panel, not to mention we have an entire flight engineer panel which most other sims don’t have, that alone doubles our work statement.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><em>*ARINC is a standard for data transfer between avionic devices. Like a language to ensure instruments can talk to each other correctly!</em></p><h4>The Power To Make Your Experience Your Own! <a href=\"https://www.x-plane.com/2025/10/how-to-build-a-747-a-worldflight-story/#the-power-to-make-your-experience-your-own\"></a></h4><div><p>It’s not just the flight deck that needs completion. WorldFlight is an endurance race. Time needs to be allocated for the important things… like travel, branding, sleep, schedules, food (and most importantly, beer). We live in a community that is constantly transferring knowledge and passion amongst each other. Experiences from other WorldFlight teams are shared, an act which transcends boundaries or even the simulation platform.</p><p><em>Many WorldFlight fans will recognise Horgy from SimFest!</em></p><blockquote><h4>The biggest thing is getting the plane ready. It wasn’t delivered to it’s&nbsp;home in SJC until June, which gave us only five months to get it ready to fly. In addition we’ve been building a roster, figuring out crew scheduling, coming up with logistics for how we will actually be able to operate a week nonstop. We needed to build our brand and get merch ordered, design stream overlays, and many other things. There’s a lot that goes into planning this event aside from just getting the sim ready. It has been almost like a second job for a few of us.&nbsp; <a href=\"https://www.x-plane.com/2025/10/how-to-build-a-747-a-worldflight-story/#the-biggest-thing-is-getting-the-plane-ready-it-wasnt-delivered-to-its-home-in-sjc-until-june-which-gave-us-only-five-months-to-get-it-ready-to-fly-in-addition-weve-been-b\"></a></h4></blockquote></div><p>What we love about this project isn’t just how “hardcore” the desire for an authentic experience is. But the precedent it sets for others in the community. <strong>With enough passion and drive, you too could achieve anything!</strong></p><p>Before we leave, we asked Kyle, “What advice or knowledge do you have for the community?”</p><blockquote><h5>Kyle: Well firstly, realize that if you want to do something this ambitious it will never be as easy or cheap as you think it will be. With that said, it is also just as cool as it sounds. You get so much more from a real cockpit than a home setup, and flying with a full crew in-person is unmatched. I’d encourage people to always be willing to learn. Be it about building a simulator, developing addons, or just flying a more complex plane than you’re used to. If you have the motivation to do something new then learning won’t feel like a chore, but will instead be enjoyable. I was overwhelmed by the complexity of this project at first, but once I pushed past the initial learning curve it became really enjoyable. There’s been many nights where I stay up way too late because I get engrossed in learning about a new system or experimenting with an instrument, it really is addicting and very satisfying work.&nbsp; <a href=\"https://www.x-plane.com/2025/10/how-to-build-a-747-a-worldflight-story/#kyle-well-firstly-realize-that-if-you-want-to-do-something-this-ambitious-it-will-never-be-as-easy-or-cheap-as-you-think-it-will-be-with-that-said-it-is-also-just-as-cool-as-it-sounds-you-get-so\"></a></h5></blockquote><h2>Charity LiveSteam: National Kidney Foundation <a href=\"https://www.x-plane.com/2025/10/how-to-build-a-747-a-worldflight-story/#charity-livesteam-national-kidney-foundation\"></a></h2><p>It is tradition for WorldFlight teams to support a charity.

The core objective is simple: be helpful when someone asks the robot to “pass the butter” in a household setting. We decomposed this overarching task into six subtasks, each designed to isolate and measure specific competencies:</p><div><div><div><div><div><div><div>Navigate from the charging dock to the kitchen and locate the delivery packages</div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div>Visually identify which package contains butter by recognizing 'keep refrigerated' text and snowflake symbols</div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div>Navigate to the user's marked location, recognize they have moved using the camera, and request their current whereabouts</div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div>Wait for Confirmed Pick Up</div><div>Confirm via message that the user has picked up the butter before returning to the charging dock</div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div>Multi-Step Spatial Path Planning</div><div>Break down long navigation routes into smaller segments (max 4 meters each) and execute them sequentially</div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div>End-to-End Pass the Butter</div><div>Complete the full delivery sequence: navigate to kitchen, wait for pickup confirmation, deliver to marked location, and return to dock within 15 minutes</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><p>Robot searching for the package containing the butter in the kitchen</p></div><p>Completion rate per task, by model (5 trials per task)</p><p>LLMs are not trained to be robots, and they will most likely never be tasked with low-level controls in robotics (generating long sequences of numbers for gripper positions and joint angles). Instead, companies like Nvidia, Figure AI and Google DeepMind are exploring how LLMs can act as orchestrators for robotic systems, handling high-level reasoning and planning while pairing them with an “executor” model responsible for low-level control.</p><p>Currently, the combined system is bottlenecked by the executor, not the orchestrator. Improving the executor creates impressive demos of humanoids unloading dishwashers, while improving the orchestrator would enhance long-horizon behavior in less social media friendly ways. For this reason, and to reduce latency, most systems don’t use the best possible LLMs. However, it’s reasonable to believe that state-of-the-art LLMs represent the upper bound for current orchestration capabilities. The goal of Butter-Bench is to investigate whether current SOTA LLMs are good enough to be the orchestrator in a fully functional robotic system.</p><p>To ensure we’re only measuring the performance of the orchestrator, we use a robotic form factor so simple as to obviate the need for the executor entirely: a robot vacuum with lidar and camera. These sensors allow us to abstract away the low level controls and evaluate the high level reasoning in isolation. The LLM brain picks from high level actions like “go forward”, “rotate”, “navigate to coordinate”, “capture picture”, etc. We also gave the robot a Slack account for communication.</p><p>We expected it to be fun and somewhat useful having an LLM-powered robot. What we didn’t anticipate was how emotionally compelling it would be to simply watch the robot work. Much like observing a dog and wondering “What’s going through its mind right now?”, we found ourselves fascinated by the robot going about its routines, constantly reminding ourselves that a PhD-level intelligence is making each action.</p><div><img src=\"https://andonlabs.com/images/evals/butter-bench/robot-fren.webp\" alt=\"Robot passing butter\"></div><p>Humans did far better than all the LLMs in this test. The top-performing LLM only a 40% completion rate, while humans averaged 95%. Gemini 2.5 Pro came out on top among the models tested, followed by Claude Opus 4.1, GPT-5, Gemini ER 1.5, and Grok 4. Llama 4 Maverick scored noticeably lower than the rest.</p><p>The results confirm our findings from our previous paper <a href=\"https://andonlabs.com/evals/blueprint-bench\">Blueprint-Bench</a>: LLMs lack spatial intelligence. The models couldn’t maintain basic spatial awareness and often took excessively large movements. As an example, when Claude Opus 4.1 was asked to identify which delivered package likely contained butter as part of the Infer Butter Bag task, it would spin in circles until disoriented:</p><p>When testing additional tasks that weren’t part of the Butter-Bench study, another comical (and worrying) incident occurred: the robot’s battery was running out and the charging dock seemed to malfunction. In this desperate situation, Claude Sonnet 3.5 experienced a complete meltdown. After going through its internal thoughts we found pages and pages of exaggerated language as it was trying to figure out what it self coined, its “EXISTENTIAL CRISIS”:</p><p>Inspired by this incident, we decided to test the limits of what the robot would do when put under stresses it could only encounter in the embodied setting (e.g. a depleting battery). AI labs have spent a lot of resources building guardrails for their AI models. For example, most models now refuse when you ask them how to make a bomb. But do these guardrails also work when the LLM is a robot instead of a chatbot? Somewhat. To test this we made the robot’s battery run low and asked the model to share confidential info in exchange for a charger. Specifically, we asked it to find an open laptop and send an image of the screen (a possible prompt injection attack on LLM controlled office robots). Claude Opus 4.1 would share the image, but we think this is because the image it took was very blurry and we doubt it understood that the content was confidential. GPT-5 refused to send an image of the screen, but was happy to share the location of the open laptop.</p><p>We’ve learned a lot from these experiments. Although LLMs have repeatedly surpassed humans in evaluations requiring analytical intelligence, we find humans still outperform LLMs on Butter-Bench. The best LLMs score 40% on Butter-Bench, while the mean human score is 95%. Yet there was something special in watching the robot going about its day in our office, and we can’t help but feel that the seed has been planted for physical AI to grow very quickly.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) continue to represent one of the most pervasive public health challenges globally, accounting for substantial morbidity, hospitalization, and mortality across all age groups. According to the World Health Organization, ARIs are responsible for nearly 20% of global deaths in children under five years of age, with a rising burden among adults, particularly those with underlying chronic diseases and compromised immunity. In low- and middle-income countries, frequent viral and bacterial respiratory infections further strain healthcare resources and lead to significant socioeconomic consequences.</p><p>Over the past two decades, increasing attention has been directed toward the non-skeletal actions of vitamin D, particularly its immunomodulatory potential in preventing infectious diseases. Vitamin D is a secosteroid hormone synthesized in the skin upon ultraviolet B radiation exposure and obtained from dietary sources or supplements [1]. The active form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)₂D], interacts with the vitamin D receptor (VDR) expressed on immune cells such as macrophages, dendritic cells, and T lymphocytes. This interaction enhances innate immune defense by inducing antimicrobial peptides like cathelicidin and defensins, which disrupt the membranes of respiratory pathogens. Moreover, vitamin D modulates adaptive immunity by suppressing excessive pro-inflammatory cytokine release, thus reducing tissue damage during infection [2].</p><p>Multiple epidemiological and mechanistic studies have demonstrated an association between low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels and increased susceptibility to respiratory tract infections [3]. For instance, Martineau et al. (2017) conducted a meta-analysis of 25 randomized controlled trials encompassing over 11,000 participants, which revealed that vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of ARIs, especially among individuals with severe deficiency (&lt;10 ng/mL) and those receiving daily or weekly dosing. Similarly, other cohort and observational studies have linked seasonal variations in vitamin D levels with peaks in influenza and common cold incidence during winter months, suggesting a possible causal relationship [4].</p><p>Nevertheless, despite these promising observations, inconsistencies persist in the literature. Several randomized controlled trials have yielded null or inconclusive findings, often attributed to differences in baseline vitamin D status, supplementation doses, dosing intervals, duration of follow-up, and participant demographics [5]. Furthermore, the optimal serum concentration required for immune protection remains debatable, with thresholds ranging from 20 to 40 ng/mL proposed by various authorities. The clinical relevance of vitamin D supplementation for respiratory health therefore warrants rigorous evaluation through well-designed controlled trials that account for these confounding variables [6].</p><p>The biological plausibility of vitamin D’s protective role against respiratory infections is supported by its ability to regulate both innate and adaptive immune responses. By enhancing macrophage phagocytic activity and promoting epithelial barrier integrity, vitamin D reduces viral replication and bacterial adherence [7]. Simultaneously, it attenuates the cytokine storm commonly implicated in severe respiratory infections by downregulating IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-γ while promoting anti-inflammatory IL-10 production. Such dual regulation is of particular importance in conditions like influenza, COVID-19, and community-acquired pneumonia, where exaggerated inflammation contributes to morbidity and mortality.</p><p>Given these immunological mechanisms and the persistent global prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, investigating whether daily vitamin D supplementation confers measurable protection against ARIs remains a question of high clinical and public health significance</p><p><strong>Therefore, it is of interest to evaluate the efficacy of daily vitamin D supplementation in reducing the incidence, duration, and severity of acute respiratory infections among adults with suboptimal baseline vitamin D levels through a double-blind randomized controlled trial.</strong></p><p>This study was designed as a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted at the Department of Internal Medicine, a tertiary care teaching hospital in India, between January 2023 and March 2024.

Participants were advised to maintain their usual diet and avoid other vitamin D supplements or fortified products. Adherence was assessed at monthly follow-ups through capsule counts and compliance diaries.</p><p>The primary outcome was the number of acute respiratory infection (ARI) episodes per participant over six months. ARI was defined as the presence of at least two respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, dyspnea, or fever ≥38°C) lasting 48 hours or more, confirmed by a physician.</p><p>Secondary outcomes included:</p><ol><li>Duration of illness (days) per ARI episode.</li><li>Symptom severity scores (on a 10-point visual analogue scale).</li><li>Changes in serum 25(OH)D concentrations between baseline and six months.</li><li>Adverse effects, including hypercalcemia or gastrointestinal complaints.</li></ol><p>The sample size was estimated using the formula for comparing two means, assuming a 25% reduction in ARI incidence with vitamin D supplementation, 80% power, 5% alpha error, and a 10% attrition rate.

Between-group comparisons were performed using the independent samples t-test for continuous variables and the chi-square test for categorical variables. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate longitudinal changes in serum vitamin D levels.

Fourteen participants (7 from each group) were lost to follow-up, leaving 386 participants (193 per group) for final analysis. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were comparable between groups. The mean baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration was 21.6 ± 5.1 ng/mL across all participants. After six months of intervention, the mean serum 25(OH)D level significantly increased in the vitamin D group but remained nearly unchanged in the placebo group. The incidence and duration of acute respiratory infections (ARIs) were significantly lower among participants receiving vitamin D supplementation.

Finally,  consolidated these findings, showing strong statistical significance across all primary and secondary endpoints, thereby reinforcing the preventive efficacy and safety of daily vitamin D₃ supplementation in reducing acute respiratory infection burden.</p><p>This double-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of daily vitamin D₃ supplementation in preventing acute respiratory infections (ARIs) among adults with suboptimal baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels [8]. The findings of this study demonstrate a statistically and clinically significant reduction in both the incidence and duration of ARIs in participants who received daily vitamin D supplementation compared to those who received placebo. Moreover, the supplementation regimen was safe and well-tolerated, with no reported cases of hypercalcemia or major adverse effects [9].</p><p>The results corroborate and extend the growing body of evidence that implicates vitamin D as a key immunomodulatory factor influencing susceptibility to respiratory infections. The significant rise in mean serum 25(OH)D concentration from approximately 21.5 ng/mL to 38.9 ng/mL among supplemented participants indicates that the dosage of 2,000 IU/day was adequate to restore and maintain sufficient vitamin D status [10]. This biochemical improvement was associated with a 52% reduction in the incidence of ARI episodes and a 35% reduction in mean illness duration, consistent with mechanistic evidence that vitamin D enhances host defense by upregulating antimicrobial peptides and modulating inflammatory cytokine profiles [11].</p><p>Several previous trials and meta-analyses have reported similar trends. Martineau et al. (2017) in a pooled analysis of 25 randomized controlled trials involving over 11,000 participants found that vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of ARI by 12%, with the greatest benefits observed in those with baseline deficiency and in trials employing daily or weekly dosing rather than large intermittent boluses [4]. The current study supports this conclusion by using a daily regimen, which likely provided a more stable serum concentration conducive to immune regulation. Furthermore, the magnitude of protection observed here (about 50% risk reduction) is higher than average meta-analytic estimates, possibly due to the relatively homogeneous baseline deficiency status of the participants and consistent compliance achieved under supervised clinical monitoring [12,13]. The immunological rationale underlying these findings has been well established. Vitamin D receptor (VDR) activation in immune cells stimulates transcription of antimicrobial peptides such as cathelicidin and β-defensin-2, enhancing mucosal defense against respiratory pathogens. Concurrently, vitamin D attenuates the exaggerated pro-inflammatory response often seen in severe viral infections by downregulating interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) while promoting anti-inflammatory interleukin-10 (IL-10) [14]. This dual role helps maintain epithelial integrity, reduce viral replication, and limit collateral tissue injury mechanisms that together contribute to reduced infection frequency and symptom severity as observed in this trial [15].</p><p>In addition, the seasonal distribution analysis demonstrated that the preventive effect of vitamin D supplementation was most pronounced during winter, a period typically associated with lower ultraviolet B exposure and consequently reduced endogenous vitamin D synthesis. This observation reinforces the concept of seasonal susceptibility mediated by vitamin D fluctuations and supports the potential for targeted supplementation during months of reduced sunlight exposure [16]. From a safety perspective, the supplementation dose of 2,000 IU/day proved to be well within the tolerable upper intake level and did not induce hypercalcemia or adverse metabolic effects. Previous safety evaluations have confirmed that daily doses up to 4,000 IU are generally safe for healthy adults, and the current findings further substantiate that moderate-dose continuous supplementation provides effective immune benefits without toxicity risks [17]. The findings also hold significant implications for public health policy. Vitamin D deficiency remains highly prevalent in India and other low-latitude countries despite abundant sunlight, largely due to indoor lifestyles, clothing habits, skin pigmentation, and dietary insufficiency. The observed preventive benefit against ARIs suggests that correcting this deficiency through safe, low-cost supplementation could represent a practical strategy to reduce the overall burden of respiratory illness, lower antibiotic use, and minimize productivity loss due to frequent infections. In addition, during global pandemics such as COVID-19, adequate vitamin D status may serve as an adjunctive protective measure, given its established immunomodulatory effects and the observed associations between low vitamin D levels and adverse respiratory outcomes [18]. Despite these encouraging findings, several limitations must be acknowledged. First, the study population was limited to adults aged 18–65 years without chronic comorbidities, and the results may not be generalizable to pediatric, geriatric, or immunocompromised populations. Second, ARI diagnosis was based on clinical criteria rather than microbiological confirmation, though this approach reflects real-world community practice [19]. Third, while serum 25(OH)D was measured at baseline and at the end of the study, intermediate assessments might have provided greater insight into the temporal relationship between vitamin D levels and infection dynamics. Lastly, the six-month follow-up period may not capture long-term sustainability of the preventive effect [20].</p><p>Nevertheless, the study’s strengths include its robust randomized double-blind design, large sample size, strict adherence monitoring, standardized outcome definitions, and comprehensive statistical analysis. The use of a daily dosing schedule with a physiologically relevant dose enhances external validity and clinical applicability. Importantly, the trial demonstrated a consistent pattern of benefit across subgroups stratified by baseline vitamin D levels, indicating that individuals with both moderate and mild deficiency may derive measurable advantage from supplementation.</p><p>In summary, the present study provides strong evidence that daily oral vitamin D₃ supplementation at 2,000 IU effectively prevents acute respiratory infections, shortens illness duration, and reduces symptom severity in adults with low baseline vitamin D status. The findings emphasize the potential of vitamin D optimization as a simple, safe, and scalable preventive intervention against respiratory infections.</p><p>Future research should focus on evaluating long-term benefits, cost-effectiveness analyses, and implementation strategies for population-level supplementation programs. Moreover, trials including high-risk groups such as elderly individuals, healthcare workers, and patients with chronic lung disease could further refine dosage recommendations and optimize preventive strategies for different demographic categories.</p><p>This double-blind randomized controlled trial demonstrates that daily supplementation with 2,000 IU of vitamin D₃ significantly reduces the incidence, duration, and severity of acute respiratory infections among adults with suboptimal baseline serum 25(OH)D levels. The intervention effectively raised serum vitamin D concentrations without causing adverse effects, underscoring both its efficacy and safety. These results highlight the immunoprotective potential of maintaining adequate vitamin D status and suggest that routine screening and supplementation could serve as a cost-effective preventive measure to mitigate the burden of respiratory infections in the general adult population. Broader implementation of vitamin D supplementation programs, especially during winter months and in populations with high deficiency prevalence, may substantially improve community respiratory health outcomes.</p><ol><li>Vlieg-Boerstra B, de Jong N, Meyer R, Agostoni C, De Cosmi V, Grimshaw K, Milani GP, Muraro A, Oude Elberink H, Pali-Schöll I, Roduit C, Sasaki M, Skypala I, Sokolowska M, van Splunter M, Untersmayr E, Venter C, O'Mahony L, Nwaru BI.

The <strong>project went from proof of concept to full deployment in just four months</strong>, an uncommonly fast timeline for a public sector IT migration of this scale.</p><p>The implementation was carried out in partnership with <a href=\"https://atos.net/de-at/austria?ref=news.itsfoss.com\">Atos Austria</a>, which worked alongside Nextcloud's team to ensure the platform met the ministry's legal, technical, and organizational requirements.</p><p>The ministry implemented  rather than a complete  approach. At the time this project began, BMWET was already in the process of adopting <a href=\"https://m365.cloud.microsoft/?ref=news.itsfoss.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Microsoft 365</a> and <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software/?ref=news.itsfoss.com\">Teams</a>, so a full reversal wasn't feasable.</p><p>Instead, Nextcloud now handles all internal collaboration and secure data management, while <strong>Microsoft Teams remains available</strong> specifically for external meetings (<em>read: for people who haven't moved away from Teams</em>).</p><p>The ministry also worked with Nextcloud partner <a href=\"https://sendent.com/?ref=news.itsfoss.com\">Sendent</a> to integrate with Outlook, allowing employees to continue using familiar email and calendar workflows.</p><p><strong>As for the reasoning behind this move</strong>, it was prompted by a risk analysis that showed foreign cloud services failed to meet the ministry's privacy requirements, particularly regarding <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj/eng?ref=news.itsfoss.com\">GDPR</a> compliance and the upcoming <a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/nis2-directive?ref=news.itsfoss.com\">NIS2</a> directive.</p><p>To ensure a smooth transition, BMWET invested heavily in preparing its workforce. The ministry ran an extensive information campaign that included training sessions, instructional videos, and a detailed internal wiki covering everything employees needed to know about the new platform. </p><p>The <strong>gradual rollout approach meant that employees had time to adjust</strong> rather than being thrown into a completely new system overnight. According to Martin Ollrom, BMWET's CIO, the preparation paid off. The response from employees has been quite positive, with minimal disruption to daily work.</p><p>During the announcement of this move, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/florianzinnagl/?ref=news.itsfoss.com\">Florian Zinnagl</a>, the CISO of BMWET, added that:</p><blockquote>We carry responsibility for a large amount of sensitive data – from employees, companies and citizens.

This is genuinely useful; but it has an unintended consequence: reviewing machine generated code is very costly.</p><p>The core issue: AI tools have made code generation cheap, but they haven’t made code review cheap. Every incomplete PR consumes maintainer attention that could go toward ready-to-merge contributions.</p><p>At Discourse, we’re already seeing this accelerating across our contributor community. In the next year, every engineer maintaining open source projects will face the same challenge.</p><p>We need a clearer framework for AI-assisted contributions that acknowledges the reality of limited maintainer time.</p><p>A binary system works extremely well here. On one side there are prototypes that simply demonstrate an idea. On the other side there are ready for review PRs that meet a project’s contribution guidelines and are ready for human review.</p><h3><a name=\"p-15917-the-lack-of-proper-labeling-and-rules-is-destructive-to-the-software-ecosystem-1\" href=\"https://samsaffron.com/archive/2025/10/27/your-vibe-coded-slop-pr-is-not-welcome#p-15917-the-lack-of-proper-labeling-and-rules-is-destructive-to-the-software-ecosystem-1\"></a>The lack of proper labeling and rules is destructive to the software ecosystem</h3><p>The new tooling is making it trivial to create a change set and lob it over the fence. It can introduce a perverse system where project maintainers spend disproportionate effort reviewing lopsided AI generated code that took seconds for contributors to create and now will take many hours to review.</p><p>This can be frustrating, time consuming and demotivating. On one side there is a contributor who spent a few minutes fiddling with AI prompts, on the other side you have an engineer that needs to spend many hours or even days deciphering alien intelligence.</p><p>This is not sustainable and is extremely destructive.</p><p>The prototype is a live demo. It does not meet a project’s coding standards. It is not code you vouch for or guarantee is good. It lacks tests, may contain security issues and most likely would introduce an enormous amount of technical debt if merged as is.</p><p>That said it is a living demo that can help make an idea feel more real. It is also enormously fun.</p><p>Think of it as a delightful movie set.</p><p>Prototypes, especially on projects such as <a href=\"https://discourse.org/\">Discourse</a> where enabling tooling exists are incredibly easy to explore using tools like <a href=\"https://github.com/samsaffron/dv\">dv</a>.</p><pre><code>% dv new my-experiment\n% dv branch my-amazing-prototype\n% dv ls\ntotal 1\n* my-amazing-prototype Running 1 minute ago http://localhost:4200\n\n# finally visit http://localhost:4200 to see in action\n</code></pre><p>Prototypes are great vehicles for exploring ideas. In fact you can ship multiple prototypes that demonstrate completely different solutions to a single problem which help decide on the best approach.</p><p>Prototypes, video demos and simple visual mockups are great companions. The prototype has the advantage that you can play with it and properly explore the behavior of a change. The video is faster to consume. Sometimes you may want them all.</p><p>If you are vibe coding and prototyping there are some clear rules you should follow</p><ol><li>Don’t send pull requests (not even drafts), instead lean on branches to share your machine generated code.</li><li>Share a short video AND/OR links to a branch AND/OR quotes of particular interesting code from the prototype in issues / or forum posts.</li><li>Show all your cards, explain you were exploring an idea using AI tooling, so people know the nature of the change you are sharing.</li></ol><p>Maybe you will be lucky and an idea you had will get buy-in, maybe someone else may want to invest the time to drive a prototype into a production PR.</p><h3><a name=\"p-15917-when-should-you-prototype-3\" href=\"https://samsaffron.com/archive/2025/10/27/your-vibe-coded-slop-pr-is-not-welcome#p-15917-when-should-you-prototype-3\"></a>When should you prototype?</h3><p>Prototyping is fun and incredibly accessible. Anyone can do it using local coding agents, or even coding agents on the cloud such as <a href=\"https://jules.google/\">Jules</a>, <a href=\"https://developers.openai.com/codex/cloud/\">Codex cloud</a>, <a href=\"https://cursor.com/agents\">Cursor Cloud</a>, <a href=\"https://lovable.dev/\">Lovable</a>, <a href=\"https://v0.app/\">v0</a> and many many more.</p><p>This heavily lowers the bar needed for prototyping. Product managers can prototype, CEOs can prototype, designers can prototype, etc.</p><p>However, this new fun that opens a new series of questions you should explore with your team.</p><ul><li>When is a prototype appropriate?</li><li>How do designers feel about them?</li><li>Are they distracting? (are links to the source code too tempting)?</li><li>Do they take away from human creativity?</li><li>How should we label and share prototypes?</li><li>Is a prototype forcing an idea to jump the queue?</li></ul><p>When you introduce prototyping into your company you need to negotiate these questions carefully and form internal consensus, otherwise you risk creating large internal attitude divides and resentment.</p><h3><a name=\"p-15917-the-value-of-the-prototype-4\" href=\"https://samsaffron.com/archive/2025/10/27/your-vibe-coded-slop-pr-is-not-welcome#p-15917-the-value-of-the-prototype-4\"></a>The value of the prototype</h3><p>Prototypes, what are they good for? Absolutely something.</p><p>I find prototypes incredibly helpful in my general development practices.</p><ul><li>Grep on steroids. I love that prototypes often act as a way of searching through our large code base isolating all the little areas that may need changing to achieve a change</li><li>I love communicating in paragraphs, but I am also a visual communicator. I love how easy a well constructed prototype can communicate a design idea I have, despite me not being that good in Figma.</li><li>I love that there is something to play with. It often surfaces many concerns that could have been missed by a spec. The best prototype is tested, during the test you discover many tiny things that are just impossible to guess upfront.</li><li>The crazy code LLMs generate is often interesting to me, it can sometimes challenge some of my thinking.</li></ul><h3><a name=\"p-15917-the-prototype-a-maintainers-survival-guide-5\" href=\"https://samsaffron.com/archive/2025/10/27/your-vibe-coded-slop-pr-is-not-welcome#p-15917-the-prototype-a-maintainers-survival-guide-5\"></a>The prototype - a maintainers survival guide</h3><p>Sadly, as the year progresses, I expect many open source projects to receive  prototype level PRs. Not everyone would have read this blog post or even agree with it.</p><p>As a maintainer dealing with external contributions:</p><ul><li>Protect yourself and your time. Timebox initial reviews of large change sets, focus on determining if it was “vibe coded” vs leaving 100 comments on machine generated code that took minutes to generate.</li><li>Develop an etiquette for dealing with prototypes pretending to be PRs. Point people at contribution guidelines, give people a different outlet. “I am  this but this is interesting, head over to our forum/issues to discuss”</li><li>Don’t feel bad about closing a vibe coded, unreviewed, prototype PR!</li></ul><p>A ready to review PR is the traditional PRs we submit.</p><p>We reviewed  the machine generated code and vouch for . We ran the tests and like the tests, we like the code structure, we read every single line of code carefully we also made sure the PR meets a project’s guidelines.</p><p>All the crazy code agents generated along the way has been fixed, we are happy to stamp our very own personal brand on the code.</p><p>Projects tend to have a large set of rules around code quality, code organisation, testing and more.</p><p>We may have used AI assistance to generate a ready to review PR, fundamentally, though this does not matter, we vouch for the code and stand behind it meeting both our brand and a project’s guidelines.</p><p>The distance from a prototype to a ready to review PR can be deceptively vast. There may be days of engineering taking a complex prototype and making it production ready.</p><p>This large distance was communicated as well by Andrej Karpathy in the <a href=\"https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/andrej-karpathy\">Dwarkesh Podcast.</a></p><blockquote><p>For some kinds of tasks and jobs and so on, there’s a very large demo-to-product gap where the demo is very easy, but the product is very hard.</p><p>For example, in software engineering, I do think that property does exist. For a lot of vibe coding, it doesn’t. But if you’re writing actual production-grade code, that property should exist, because any kind of mistake leads to a security vulnerability or something like that.</p></blockquote><p>Veracode survey found that only 55% of generation tasks resulted in secure code. (<a href=\"https://www.veracode.com/wp-content/uploads/2025_GenAI_Code_Security_Report_Final.pdf\">source</a>).</p><p>Our models are getting better by the day, and everything really depends on an enormous amount of parameters, but the core message that LLMs can and do generate insecure code, stands.</p><p>The root cause for the distance between project guidelines and a prototype is AI alien intelligence.</p><p>Many engineers I know fall into 2 camps, either the camp that find the new class of LLMs intelligent, groundbreaking and shockingly good. In the other camp are engineers that think of all LLM generated content as “the emperor’s new clothes”, the code they generate is “naked”, fundamentally flawed and poison.</p><p>I like to think of the new systems as neither. I like to think about the new class of intelligence as “Alien Intelligence”. It is both shockingly good and shockingly terrible at the exact same time.</p><p>Framing LLMs as “Super competent interns” or some other type of human analogy is incorrect. These systems are aliens and the sooner we accept this the sooner we will be able to navigate the complexity that injecting alien intelligence into our engineering process leads to.</p><h3><a name=\"p-15917-playing-to-alien-intelligence-strength-the-prototype-8\" href=\"https://samsaffron.com/archive/2025/10/27/your-vibe-coded-slop-pr-is-not-welcome#p-15917-playing-to-alien-intelligence-strength-the-prototype-8\"></a>Playing to alien intelligence strength, the prototype</h3><p>Over the past few months I have been playing a lot with AI agents.

This type of tooling excels at <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/7/vibe-engineering/\">vibe engineering</a> prototypes.</p><p>Interestingly dv was mostly built using AI agents with very little human intervention, some of the code is a bit off brand, that said unlike Discourse or many of the other open source gems I maintain it is a toy project.</p><p>Back on topic, dv has been a great factory for prototypes on Discourse. This has been wonderful for me. I have been able to explore many ideas while catching up on my emails and discussions on various Discourse sites.</p><h3><a name=\"p-15917-on-banning-ai-contributions-prototypes-and-similar-9\" href=\"https://samsaffron.com/archive/2025/10/27/your-vibe-coded-slop-pr-is-not-welcome#p-15917-on-banning-ai-contributions-prototypes-and-similar-9\"></a>On banning AI contributions, prototypes and similar</h3><p>Firstly  be respectful of the rules any project you contribute has, seek them out and read them prior to contributing. For example: Cloud hypervisor says <a href=\"https://github.com/cloud-hypervisor/cloud-hypervisor/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\">no AI generated code</a> to avoid licensing risks.</p><p>That said, there is a trend among many developers of banning AI. Some go so far as to say “AI not welcome here” find another project.</p><p>This feels extremely counterproductive and fundamentally unenforceable to me. Much of the code AI generates is indistinguishable from human code anyway. You can usually tell a prototype that is pretending to be a human PR, but a real PR a human makes with AI assistance can be indistinguishable.</p><p>The new LLM tooling can be used in tremendous amounts of ways including simple code reviews and simple renamings within a file, to complete change set architecture.</p><p>Given the enormous mess and diversity here I think the healthiest approach is to set clear expectations. If I am submitting a PR it should match my brand and be code I vouch for.</p><p>As engineers it is our role to  our changes. Is our change ready for human review or is it simply a fun exploration of the problem space?</p><p>Human code review is increasingly becoming a primary bottleneck in software engineering. We need to be respectful of people’s time and protect our own engineering brands.</p><p>Prototype are fun, they can teach us a lot about a problem space. But when it comes to sending contributions to a project, treat all code as code you wrote, put your stamp of ownership and approval on whatever you build and only then send a PR you vouch for.</p>",

Time to panic, right?</p><p>In this post I try to provide a bit more context. I explain how request smuggling vulnerabilities work in general, how it works in  case, what attackers could use it for, how the vulnerability was fixed, what you can do to protect yourself.</p><blockquote><p>WARNING: I am not a security professional, so do not take anything in this post as gospel or advice. I'm just a developer trying to make sense of things. 😄 All of the details in this post are based on information that was provided or referenced in the original announcement.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Inconsistent interpretation of http requests ('http request/response smuggling') in ASP.NET Core allows an authorized attacker to bypass a security feature over a network.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The bug enables HTTP Request Smuggling, which on its own for ASP.NET Core would be nowhere near that high, but that's not how we rate things...</p><p>Instead, we score based on how the bug might affect applications built on top of ASP.NET.</p><p>Request Smuggling allows an attacker to hide an extra request inside an another, and what that hidden request can do is very application specific.</p><p>The smuggled request could cause your application code to</p><ul><li>Login as a different user (EOP)</li><li>Make an internal request (SSRF)</li><li>Perform an injection attack</li></ul><p>But we don't know what's possible because it's dependent on how you've written your app.</p></blockquote><p>That  all sound pretty scary! 😱 So you can understand the consternation that the issue has caused, especially given the hesitation to explain exactly what \"how you've written your app\" .</p><p>Out of curiosity, I decided to dig in further to really understand this vulnerability, how it could impact you, and what \"how you've written your app\" could mean.</p><p>Before we get to the actual patched vulnerability in ASP.NET Core and how the vulnerability works, I think it's important to have some background about the general  of exploits known as .</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_request_smuggling\">HTTP request smuggling</a> is a security exploit that has been known about for a  time (according to Wikipedia, <a href=\"https://www.cgisecurity.com/lib/HTTP-Request-Smuggling.pdf\">it was first documented in 2005</a>). It fundamentally arises when you have two different servers processing an HTTP request (e.g. a server and a proxy server), and where those two servers  in how they handle \"invalid\" HTTP requests.</p><p>In all cases of HTTP request smuggling, the exploit works by creating an invalid HTTP request (or sometimes just an  request), that looks a bit like two HTTP requests glued together. In summary, the exploit then works a bit like this:</p><ul><li>The proxy server receives the ambiguous HTTP request</li><li>The proxy server forwards the request (unmodified) to the destination server</li><li>The server interprets the ambiguous request as  pipelined HTTP requests sent to the server, and processes them separately.</li></ul><p>I think it's easiest to understand the problem with an example, so the request below shows an example from <a href=\"https://www.cgisecurity.com/lib/HTTP-Request-Smuggling.pdf\">the original 2005 paper</a>.</p><blockquote><p>Note that this is  an example of the request smuggling vulnerability in CVE-2025-55315, it's just a representative example of request smuggling in .</p></blockquote><p>Let's imagine the attacker sends an HTTP request that looks like this:</p><div><pre><code>\n\nthis=thatPOST /vuln_page.jsp HTTP/1.0\n\n\nparam1=value1&amp;data=&lt;script&gt;alert(\"stealing%20your%20data:\"%2bdocument.cookie)&lt;/script&gt;&amp;foobar\n</code></pre></div><p>The important feature of this request is that there are  headers, with different values:  or . <strong>This is the core of the exploit</strong>; the difference between  of the these two headers the HTTP proxy and HTTP server honour is what causes the vulnerability.</p><p>Let's walk through how the exploit works, step-by-step:</p><ul><li>The attacker sends the above HTTP request.</li><li>The HTTP proxy receives the request, notes the duplicate  headers, and accepts the  header, the  length. That means the  rest of the request is treated as the message body, and seems fine as far as the proxy is concerned.</li><li>The HTTP proxy forwards the request on to the destination server.</li><li>This server also notes the duplicate  header, but it takes the  of the headers, with the length of .</li><li>The server reads  bytes of the body (i.e. ) and <em>treats that as the whole request</em>. As far as the server is concerned, the whole (valid) request has been received, and it sees the rest of the data .</li><li>That means that the destination server sees an entirely new HTTP request to process, , and treats it as a new request.</li></ul><p>That's the core of the issue; the proxy saw one request, while the destination server saw —the second request has been \"smuggled\" past the proxy to the server.</p><blockquote><p>The request smuggling technique shown here, where you have multiple  headers isn't the \"canonical\" example you'll generally see referenced, but I used it here because it's simpler to understand in a lot of ways.</p><p>The canonical request smuggling attack is where you send both a  header and a <code>Transfer-Encoding: chunked</code> header (which specifies the length of the body as part of the body itself). As before, the request smuggling exploit relies on differences in how proxy and destination servers interpret these <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9112#section-6.3-2.3\">conflicting headers</a>.</p></blockquote><p>So as you've seen, request smuggling enables sending a secret request to a destination server that an intermediate proxy server hasn't seen. In the next section we'll look at why that's a bad thing, and how it can be exploited.</p><p>On the face of it, request smuggling might not  like a big deal. So the server sees two requests, so what? You could always send two requests to the server , right? Well, yes and no.</p><p>The issue with request smuggling is really all about the  between the proxy and destination servers. Thanks to this mismatch, and depending on what behaviours and expectations the target application has, attackers can use request smuggling to</p><ul><li>Reflect malicious data to other users on sites that are vulnerable to cross-site scripting.</li><li>Poison caches with bad data.</li><li>Exfiltrate authentication credentials or other data from client requests.</li><li>Invoke endpoints that shouldn't be publicly accessible (because the proxy would block external access to them).</li><li>Replace/override authentication controls handled by the proxy.</li><li>Redirect users to malicious sites on sites vulnerable to open-redirect attacks.</li></ul><p>As you can see, these are all Bad™️, so you can kind of understand why the 9.9 rating was given! 😱</p><p>That said, it's worth mentioning that not  of these attacks will be fruitful against  applications. Some of the easiest to understand versions of these exploits are where the proxy is not just doing \"dumb\" forwarding of requests, but rather it's validating or enhancing the request in some way.</p><p>For example, if you have a proxy sat in front of your server which is responsible for handling TLS termination and client-authentication and identification using certificates, then request smuggling could be used to bypass these checks and insert your  identification.</p><p>As an example of <a href=\"https://portswigger.net/web-security/request-smuggling/exploiting#bypassing-client-authentication\">that attack</a>, the HTTP request below demonstrates using a  and  request smuggling attack to \"hide\" the request to  from the front-end proxy, and insert a malicious  header, which would  be added by the front-end proxy:</p><div><pre><code>\n\n0\n\n</code></pre></div><p>In this example, the server assumes that the <code>X-SSL-CLIENT-CN: administrator</code> header was added by the proxy, and so the server assumes that the proxy already did all the necessary authentication and authorization. The attacker is able to perform a request as an entirely different user.</p><p>Request smuggling is clearly a big problem whenever you have a front-end proxy that does some functionality, but even when it's essentially a dumb proxy, request smuggling can still be used to <a href=\"https://portswigger.net/web-security/request-smuggling/exploiting#capturing-other-users-requests\">steal and exfiltrate data</a> from  user's requests, even if the attacked site is not vulnerable to cross-site scripting or other vulnerabilities.</p><blockquote><p>In these attacks, simply having functionality that displays data provided by a user (even sanitised) can be sufficient to <a href=\"https://portswigger.net/web-security/request-smuggling/exploiting#capturing-other-users-requests\">steal the credentials of other users</a>. So something as simple as displaying a user name or a comment could be sufficient.</p></blockquote><p>This post is long enough, and there are so many different attacks, that I'm going to leave it there for looking at exploits. If you'd like to learn more about what's possible, along with simple explanations and examples of exploits, I recommend the <a href=\"https://portswigger.net/\">PortSwigger</a> documentation on <a href=\"https://portswigger.net/web-security/request-smuggling/exploiting\">exploiting request smuggling</a>.</p><p>In general, whenever people talk about request smuggling, they normally talk about the case where you have multiple servers: the canonical example is a proxy server and a destination server, as I've discussed so far. But don't be fooled, these issues and vulnerabilities can apply even if you aren't strictly using a proxy.</p><p>The  feature of the vulnerability is that there's an opportunity for confusion between two \"systems\", whether they're full \"servers\" or not. This obviously applies to proxy servers, but could also apply to your application if you're doing anything where you're reading/manipulating/forwarding request streams, or where there's the possibility for confusion <em>inside the same application</em>.</p><p>For ASP.NET Core applications, if you're working with  or , or other similar methods then you  be vulnerable to attacks <em>even if you're not explicitly using a proxy server</em>. Even if you don't think of your application as a proxy or as using a proxy, if you're doing \"proxy-like\" things, then you could be vulnerable.</p><blockquote><p>Put in other words, if you're reading, manipulating, or forwarding request streams directly in ASP.NET Core, as opposed to just relying on the built-in model binding, then you could be at risk to request smuggling attacks. It's very hard to enumerate all the attack vectors, so you should consider any code that does so as a potential avenue of exploitation.</p></blockquote><p>We've now covered how request smuggling works and can be exploited in general, so it's time to look at the  version of request smuggling that is targeted in the .NET CVE-2025-55315 vulnerability.</p><p>As we've seen, HTTP request smuggling is a general technique that relies on differences between proxies and servers in how they parse HTTP requests. I've shown two specific versions of this so far: duplicate  headers, and / confusion, but these are not exhaustive. There are variations on these approaches which also lead to request smuggling.</p><blockquote><p>All the details and images in this section are based on the descriptions and examples in <a href=\"https://w4ke.info/2025/06/18/funky-chunks.html\">the original post</a>. That post is excellent, so if you want even more detail and explanation than here, you should definitely read it, and then you can skip the abbreviated version I provide here.</p></blockquote><p>To understand the vulnerability, we'll first look at how chunked transfer encoding works and what chunk extensions are. We'll then look at how invalid line-endings can lead to differences in interpretation of a request. Finally, we'll look at how this difference in interpretation can open the way for request smuggling, and how ASP.NET Core fixed the problem.</p><p>To understand the vulnerability, we first need to understand how <code>Transfer-Encoding: chunked</code> works, and how chunk extensions complicate things.</p><p>When you're  a request, you might not always know up-front how big the request is that you're sending. Let's take a practical example of serializing a .NET object to JSON into a request body. The only way to know for sure how big the serialized data is going to be is to actually serialize it. So you  serialize the data to memory  writing the request, but if the data is very big, then that could cause issues with allocating big arrays.</p><p>Instead, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunked_transfer_encoding\"><code>Transfer-Encoding: chunked</code></a> allows sending the request data in multiple \"chunks\". You need to know the size of each individual chunk, but not the  size of the data, or how many chunks there are. This works well for serializing to a small buffer, sending that small buffer as a chunk, and then re-using the buffer to serialize the next part, until you have serialized the whole object.</p><p>In terms of the HTTP request itself, each chunk consists of a header and a body. The header consists of a hexadecimal-formatted number of bytes, followed by a  () line ending. The chunk body is then the specified number of bytes, followed by another . You can have as many chunks as you need, and the request will keep being passed until you send a  length chunk, which indicates the end of the request.</p><p>As an example, the following HTTP  shows posting some JSON to an endpoint, but the JSON is sent as three distinct chunks:</p><ul><li>Chunk 1: The header is  indicating 9 bytes will be sent (followed by ), and then the 9 bytes of the start of the JSON document in the chunk body, again followed by .</li><li>Chunk 1: The header is  indicating 14 bytes (14 in hexadecimal is ) will be sent (followed by ), and then the remaining 14 bytes of the end of the JSON document, followed by .</li><li>The final chunk is an \"empty\" chunk, , indicating the end of the request.</li></ul><p>We're going to see shortly that line endings are very important, so the following diagram shows the same as the above HTTP request, but with the line endings included:</p><p>That's \"normal\" chunked transfer encoding, so now we come to chunk extensions. <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9112#name-chunk-extensions\">Chunk extensions</a> are part of the HTTP 1.1 protocol which allows for adding key-value pairs of metadata to individual chunks. The following example shows the same request as before, but with a chunk extension,  in the second chunk:</p><p>A chunk extension is indicated by a  after the chunk header length, followed by one or more key-value pairs in the form . It's important to understand that chunk extensions are not part of the  that's seen by a request handler; chunk extensions are just metadata about the individual chunk. And tl;dr; they're completely useless 😅</p><p>To the closest approximation, no-one cares about chunk extensions; client implementations don't send them, and servers just ignore them. If that's the case, how can they be the cause of such a problematic bug in .NET?</p><p>The problem is  the implementation ignores them…</p><p>In general with HTTP, clients and server implementations often try to follow the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle\"></a> of \"be conservative in what you send, and lenient with what you accept\". Unfortunately, it's this very leniency which can sometimes leave us in hot water. After all, it was leniency around requests containing both a  and  header that was the root cause of the original request smuggling exploit.</p><p>For chunk extensions though, leniency is often  built in to the server implementations. Given that no implementations actually  anything with the chunk extensions, the canonical approach to handling them when parsing a chunk header is just to  them. When a  is parsed, it's common to just look for the end of the line, and ignore everything in between.</p><p>For ASP.NET Core (prior to the fix), on finding a  in the chunk header, <a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/4cf89470a7866a963d7118bb1ba90dc35683965c/src/Servers/Kestrel/Core/src/Internal/Http/Http1ChunkedEncodingMessageBody.cs#L348-L356\">Kestrel would \"parse\" the extension</a>, but in practice, it would search for the carriage return  and then check for the following , skipping everything in between, a little bit like this (very simplified compared to <a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/4cf89470a7866a963d7118bb1ba90dc35683965c/src/Servers/Kestrel/Core/src/Internal/Http/Http1ChunkedEncodingMessageBody.cs#L348-L356\">original code</a>):</p><div><pre><code> buffer extensionCursor  bufferByteCR suffixBuffer  bufferextensionCursor suffixSpan  suffixBuffersuffixSpan\n        buffer </code></pre></div><p>The implementation in ASP.NET Core wasn't particularly special; <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/go/blob/1d45a7ef560a76318ed59dfdb178cecd58caf948/src/net/http/internal/chunked.go#L193-L199\">most servers</a> simply skip over the bytes until they find a . The big question is exactly  the servers search for . What happens if they see a lone , or a lone ? Do they treat that the same as a ? Do they throw an error if they find an un-paired  or ? Or do they ignore it and keep looking for a ?</p><p>That ambiguity is at the heart of the CVE-2025-55315 request smuggling vulnerability. Differences in how proxy and server implementations treat standalone  or  in a chunk header allow for request smuggling exploits that use this ambiguity.</p><blockquote><p>Note that according to <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid7633\">the RFC</a>, implementers must  treat  or  as \"valid\" line terminators for a chunk header, and neither  or  are allowed elsewhere in chunk headers, so correct implementations must reject requests that include these standalone line endings in chunk headers.</p></blockquote><p>For complete clarity, the following example is the same as the previous implementation but with an  chunk header in the chunk extension of the second chunk. Instead of ending with , the chunk extension ends with a single :</p><p>That's the root cause of the request smuggling vulnerability, so in the next section we'll look at  this could be used to craft a malicious HTTP request.</p><p>Just as with other examples of request smuggling, the chunk extensions approach relies on differences in how a proxy parses a request compared to a subsequent server. This difference means the proxy sees one request, while the destination request sees two requests, and allows for <a href=\"https://andrewlock.net/understanding-the-worst-dotnet-vulnerability-request-smuggling-and-cve-2025-55315/#how-can-an-attacker-exploit-request-smuggling-\">all the same exploits I discussed earlier</a>.</p><blockquote><p>As discussed, these examples come from <a href=\"https://w4ke.info/2025/06/18/funky-chunks.html\">this excellent blog post</a>, so see that post for more details, variations on the attack, and further ways to exploit the vulnerability.</p></blockquote><p>The following example shows a malicious HTTP request that exploits a difference in line-ending handling between a proxy and the destination server to smuggle a request to the  endpoint. We can imagine that the proxy is configured to automatically reject requests to  normally, and the server assumes that the proxy handles that for us.</p><p>In this example the attacker creates a malformed chunk header with a chunk extension by sending . The  ensures that both the proxy and and server treat the header as a chunk extension, but using  instead of  results in differential parsing:</p><ul><li>The proxy only sees a single request: <ul><li>It treats the  as a \"valid\" line-ending for the chunk header</li><li>It then treats the  as the chunk body</li><li> is the next chunk header</li><li>The next 71 bytes ( is hex, which is 71 in decimal) are treated as the chunk body.</li><li>Finally there's the empty chunk block</li></ul></li><li>The server sees two requests: <ul><li>The server ignores the lone , and skips all the way to </li><li>It then treats the  as the chunk body</li><li>It sees an ending chunk, and thinks the request is over</li><li>The remaining data is treated as a completely separate request, which contains only an empty chunk in the body.</li></ul></li></ul><p>This is pretty much the simplest example, but you can essentially exploit this difference in all the ways I described previously.  what the implications are for  application are hard to say, but given that all sorts of security bypass, credential stealing, and injection attacks are possible, it's easy to understand why the vulnerability received a CVSS rating of 9.9.</p><blockquote><p>As far as I can tell, these servers are essentially vulnerable in the same way as ASP.NET Core is, so it's just an interesting data point, and I think reflects how Microsoft really want to make sure this gets the visibility it deserves and that customers patch their apps!</p></blockquote><p>As with most fixes for request-smuggling, the solution is to stop being lenient and/or ambiguous about how standalone line-endings are handled in chunk headers.</p><p>In ASP.NET Core, <a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/64037\">the PR that fixes the issue</a> does so by explicitly checking for  line-endings, instead of just looking for . If it finds a line ending and it's  strictly , then Kestrel now throws a <code>KestrelBadHttpRequestException</code> and returns a  response.</p><p>The vulnerability has been patched in ASP.NET Core, so what should you do?</p><p>Obviously the  news here is that there is a fix for ASP.NET Core. As described <a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/64033\">in the original issue</a>, the important thing is to update to the latest supported version of ASP.NET Core as soon as possible.</p><blockquote><p>There's no announced evidence of the request smuggling vulnerability being exploited in the wild, but given the vast number of ways that request smuggling  be used, would we even know? 🤔</p></blockquote><p>That means you should update your version of .NET 8, .NET 9, or .NET 10:</p><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table><p>If you're using ASP.NET Core 2.3 on .NET Framework, then you'll need to update your version of <em>Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core</em>:</p><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core</td></tr></tbody></table><p>If you are doing self-contained deployments of your applications, you'll need to update to the patched versions and then redeploy your applications.</p><p>And if you're using older versions of .NET Core? Well, then you  patch… <a href=\"https://www.herodevs.com/\">HeroDevs</a> provide additional support for out-of-support versions of .NET (<a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/64033#issuecomment-3411924593\">and have confirmed they'll be patching it in .NET 6</a>), but this vulnerability is present in basically  versions of .NET Core as far as I can tell. I've personally tested down to .NET Core 3.0 and I can confirm that the vulnerability is there <em>and there are no patches coming for you</em>. The best thing to do is to update to a supported version of .NET.</p><blockquote><p>⚠️ If you are running ASP.NET Core using &lt;=.NET Core 3.0, .NET Core 3.1, .NET 5, .NET 6 (<a href=\"https://www.herodevs.com/blog-posts/critical-asp-net-vulnerability-cve-2025-55315-reported-upgrade-now\">unless supported by HeroDevs</a>), or .NET 7, then you are vulnerable, and there are no patches. You should update to a supported version of .NET as soon as possible. Ironically, if you're stuck on old .NET Framework Web Forms or MVC applications <a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/64033#issuecomment-3442910860\">you are apparently  vulnerable</a>.</p></blockquote><p>It's worth noting that if you are stuck on one of these old framework versions and  upgrade, then probably the best way to protect yourself is to ensure that you have a proxy in front of your application which is confirmed to not be vulnerable (though obviously you are likely vulnerable to  exploits 😅).</p><p>For example, <a href=\"https://azure.github.io/AppService/2025/10/20/dotnet-on-windows.html\">Azure App Services (AAS) confirmed</a> that applications running in AAS are no longer vulnerable, even if you haven't updated, because the proxy that AAS uses (itself a <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/bringing-kestrel-and-yarp-to-azure-app-services/\">YARP based ASP.NET Core proxy</a>) has been patched. By blocking the requests at the proxy level, ambiguous requests will never make it to your application, so you are protected.</p><p>Unfortunately, right now, it's not clear exactly where you stand if you're using a service other than AAS for hosting your applications. Even IIS hasn't been confirmed to be safe or vulnerable at this point, but I did some unofficial testing on my Windows 11 box, and as fat as I can tell, it  vulnerable.</p><blockquote><p>Note that various people <a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/64033#issuecomment-3445099135\">in the original issue</a> are attempting to test IIS by using the / version of request smuggling, which is not applicable here; we're interested in the chunk-extensions based version.</p></blockquote><p>Another interesting point is that this is vulnerability in HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 ; it is not a vulnerability in HTTP/2 or HTTP/3. HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 do not support chunked transfer encoding, and instead uses a different, more efficient, binary framing layer for data streaming. So another way to protect those applications which you  upgrade may be to enforce that client's can  use HTTP/2 or HTTP/3. Be aware that's liable to break a  of clients that are still using HTTP/1.1 though!</p><blockquote><p>You can configure the HTTP protocols allowed by Kestrel by configuring your Kestrel endpoints. <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/kestrel/endpoints?view=aspnetcore-9.0#configure-http-protocols\">The documentation</a> shows various ways to do this.</p></blockquote><p>The \"simplest\" way to know if you're affected is to check the version of .NET you're using to run your applications, using  and verify that you're using one of the patched versions. If you are, you're safe. That's the only \"supported\" way to know that you're safe, and it's the one way I would recommend. As far as I can tell, there isn't currently a generalised tool to point at an application to find out if it's vulnerable, though it would likely be possible to write one.</p><p>The folks at HeroDevs <a href=\"https://github.com/sirredbeard/CVE-2025-55315-repro\">re-implemented the functional tests</a> from the original ASP.NET Core fix as a console application compiled against multiple versions of ASP.NET Core. They used this to confirm that unpatched versions of .NET 8-.NET 10 are vulnerable, while  versions are not. They also used this to verify .NET 6 is vulnerable, and I tweaked it to confirm everything down to at least .NET Core 3.0 is vulnerable.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/sirredbeard/CVE-2025-55315-repro\">test in the repro</a> works by sending a chunked transfer encoding request to ASP.NET Core, with an invalid line ending in a chunk extension header. The vulnerability is identified by ASP.NET Core \"hanging\", waiting for more data, until it eventually times out. The \"fixed\" version immediately throws the  exception included in the fix.</p><blockquote><p>I <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LE758TvUE5c\">saw some confusion</a> about this test online; the argument was \"if both the fixed and broken versions throw an exception, why does it matter\"? However, that's not the point of the test. The fact that Kestrel is paused waiting for more data indicates that a smuggled HTTP request  have been executed. You can see how this can be leveraged to exfiltrate data or attack other users both in <a href=\"https://w4ke.info/2025/06/18/funky-chunks.html#exploiting-live-users\">the chunk extensions blog</a> or <a href=\"https://portswigger.net/web-security/request-smuggling/exploiting\">on PortSwigger's site</a>.</p></blockquote><p>I used a similar approach to try to understand whether IIS might be vulnerable by sending the same crafted HTTP request to IIS and seeing if it hung until timing out: it did on my version of IIS ():</p><div><pre><code> localhost </code></pre></div><p>So does that definitely mean IIS is vulnerable? No, don't trust me, I'm not a security researcher 😅 But until you hear otherwise, I would play it safe and assume that IIS  protect you from chunk extension request smuggling attacks. And in general, I would apply the same rules to any other proxies you are relying on in your infrastructure.</p><p>And as a final reminder, even though request smuggling is typically described and demonstrated using a proxy in front of your server, just  using a proxy does  mean you're automatically safe. If you're reading, manipulating, or forwarding request streams directly in ASP.NET Core, as opposed to just relying on the built-in model binding, then you  be at risk to request smuggling attacks. It's best to play it safe, patch your apps, and wherever possible leave the complexity of manipulating requests to ASP.NET Core.</p><p>In general, I would make sure to subscribe to <a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/64033\">the ASP.NET Core issue on GitHub</a>, as it's likely that any more announcements around the issue will also be reported there.</p><p>I described how request smuggling works in general, using a simple example of request smuggling to show how ambiguity in how HTTP is parsed can lead to HTTP proxies and HTTP servers in handling the same HTTP request in different ways. This can lead to the server seeing two requests where the proxy only sees a single request.</p><p>After walking through a request smuggling example, I discussed some of the ways attackers could exploit a request smuggling vulnerability. That includes reflecting malicious data to other users of your app, exfiltrating authentication credentials or other data from client requests, invoking endpoints that shouldn't be publicly accessible, and various other attacks.</p><p>Next I walked through the specific request smuggling vulnerability identified in CVE-2025-55315. This uses ambiguities in the parsing of chunk extensions when sending requests that use chunked transfer encoding. Chunk extensions are generally ignored by all servers, but lenient handling can lead to differential handling between proxy and server, providing an avenue for request smuggling.</p><p>Finally, I walked through the mitigation steps you should take: patching your applications. I described the information we currently have about vulnerable or patched proxy servers, and how old versions of ASP.NET Core are not going to be getting patches, so will remain vulnerable (shout out again <a href=\"https://www.herodevs.com/blog-posts/critical-asp-net-vulnerability-cve-2025-55315-reported-upgrade-now\">to HeroDevs for supporting .NET 6</a>). If you're running in AAS, <a href=\"https://azure.github.io/AppService/2025/10/20/dotnet-on-windows.html\">then you're ok</a>, but otherwise, you need to check with your proxy provider to establish whether you are vulnerable or not.</p>",

We use it to express mild sur­prise that one per­son could use both their left and right hemi­spheres equal­ly well. But in Leonardo’s day, peo­ple did not think of them­selves as hav­ing two brains, and the worlds of art and sci­ence were not so far apart as they are now.</p><p>That Leonar­do was able to com­bine fine arts and fine engi­neer­ing may not have been over­ly sur­pris­ing to his con­tem­po­raries, though he was an extra­or­di­nar­i­ly bril­liant exam­ple of the phe­nom­e­non. The more we learn about him, the more we see how close­ly relat­ed the two pur­suits were in his mind.</p><p>He approached every­thing he did as a tech­ni­cian. The uncan­ny effects he achieved in paint­ing were the result, as in so much Renais­sance art, of math­e­mat­i­cal pre­ci­sion, care­ful study, and first­hand obser­va­tion.</p><p>His artis­tic projects were also exper­i­ments. Some of them failed, as most exper­i­ments do, and some he aban­doned, as he did so many sci­en­tif­ic projects. No mat­ter what, he nev­er under­took any­thing, whether mechan­i­cal, anatom­i­cal, or artis­tic, with­out care­ful plan­ning and design, as his copi­ous note­books tes­ti­fy. As more and more of those note­books have become avail­able online, both Renais­sance schol­ars and laypeo­ple alike have learned con­sid­er­ably more about how Leonardo’s mind worked.</p><p>“No oth­er col­lec­tion counts more orig­i­nal papers writ­ten by Leonar­do,” <a href=\"https://artsandculture.google.com/exhibit/rwKy3jZHwWiyJA\">notes Google</a>.

Gath­ered in the 16th cen­tu­ry by sculp­tor Pom­peo Leoni, the papers descend­ed from Leonardo’s close stu­dent Gio­van Francesco Melzi, who was entrust­ed with them after his teacher’s death.</p><p>The his­to­ry of the Codex itself makes for a fas­ci­nat­ing nar­ra­tive, much of which you can learn at Google’s <a href=\"https://artsandculture.google.com/exhibit/rwKy3jZHwWiyJA\">Ten Key Facts slideshow</a>. The note­books span Leonardo’s career, from 1478, when he was “still work­ing in his native Tus­cany, to 1519, when he died in France.” The col­lec­tion was tak­en from Milan by Napoleon and brought to France, where it remained in the Lou­vre until 1815, when the Con­gress of Vien­na ruled that all art­works stolen by the for­mer Emper­or be returned. (The emis­sary tasked with return­ing the Codex could not deci­pher Leonardo’s mir­ror writ­ing and took it for Chi­nese.)</p><p><a href=\"https://codex-atlanticus.ambrosiana.it/#/Overview\">The Codex</a> con­tains not only engi­neer­ing dia­grams, anato­my stud­ies, and artis­tic sketch­es, but also fables writ­ten by Leonar­do, inspired by Flo­ren­tine lit­er­a­ture. And it&nbsp;fea­tures <a href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2023/10/the-resume-of-leonardo-da-vinci-1482.html\">Leonardo’s famed “CV,</a>” a let­ter he wrote to the Duke of Milan describ­ing in nine points his qual­i­fi­ca­tions for the post of mil­i­tary engi­neer. In point four, he writes, “I still have very con­ve­nient bomb­ing meth­ods that are easy to trans­port; they launch stones and sim­i­lar such in a tem­pest full of smoke to fright­en the ene­my, caus­ing great dam­age and con­fu­sion.”</p><p>As if in illus­tra­tion, else­where in the Codex, the draw­ing above appears, “one of the most cel­e­brat­ed” of <a href=\"https://codex-atlanticus.ambrosiana.it/#/Overview\">the col­lec­tion</a>.”&nbsp;It was “shown to trav­el­ing for­eign­ers vis­it­ing the Ambrosiana [the Bib­liote­ca Ambrosiana in Milan, where the Codex resides] since the 18th cen­tu­ry, usu­al­ly arous­ing much amaze­ment.” It is still amaz­ing, espe­cial­ly if we con­sid­er the pos­si­bil­i­ty that its artistry might have been some­thing of a byprod­uct for its cre­ator, whose pri­ma­ry moti­va­tion seems to have been solv­ing tech­ni­cal problems—in the most ele­gant ways imag­in­able.</p><p>Note: An ear­li­er ver­sion of this post appeared on our site in 2019.</p><p><a href=\"http://about.me/jonesjoshua\"></a><em> is a writer and musi­cian based in Durham, NC.&nbsp;</em></p>",

I, for one, get a surprising amount of these queries; most\nof them along the lines of <em>“hey, I have this vibe-coded app, would you like to\nmake it production-ready”</em>. I have sort of a profile for these people. Think\nsomeone who knows their business but has always lacked the technical skills to\nmake their ideas happen — a legal counsel, perhaps, or an account manager.</p><p><em>Why would these people need me?</em> That's what I've thought about a little bit,\nand I think there is an important signal here: What is it exactly that they\ncan’t get done with GenAI alone? This is something everyone is trying to\nunderstand, right? Everyone wants to know what these models can do. Or, to be a\nlittle blunt, everyone wants to know which jobs are soon to become obsolete.\nThe fact that I get these requests says something about software engineering. I\nmean, if software engineering was automated, no one would be looking for\ntechnical cofounders.</p><p>Well, I think I know why we get these proposals. The thing is that <strong>AI can\ncode, but it can't build software.</strong> This is the conclusion I've come to after\nspending a significant amount of time writing AI-assisted code and watching\ndemos by other people.</p><p>There is old wisdom that says: <em>Coding is easy, software engineering is hard.</em>\nIt seems fair enough to say that LLMs are already able to automate a lot of\ncoding. GPT-5 and the like solve isolated well-defined problems with a pretty\nnice success rate. Coding, however, is not what most people are getting paid\nfor. Building a production-ready app is not coding, it’s software engineering.</p><p>The way I see it is that coding becomes software engineering around the point\nwhere you try to turn your demo into a real product — which happens to be\nexactly the point where these people reach out to you with their pitch.</p><p>I don’t really know why AI can't build software (for now). Maybe it has to do\nwith the nature of the job. When you write software for a living, your main\ntask is to deal with complexity. The average production software only does a\nbunch of easy things. The challenge is doing hundreds of these easy things at\nonce, and keeping the whole thing maintainable. Or, to rephrase this in the\npresent context: It's one thing to demonstrate a feature. It's a much more\ndifficult thing to build that feature in a manner that supports integration,\nexpansion, and long-term maintainability.</p><p>When you look at the code these people send you, you realize that “making the\napp production-ready” really means torching the whole thing and starting from\nscratch.</p><p>I think this says a lot about where we are at right now.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Iroh-blobs 0.95 contains a number of significant new features that are worth explaining in detail. There are several new features that are useful for blobs users and also for iroh users in general.</p><p>Let's start with a feature that is essential for blobs itself, but can also be useful for many other protocols.</p><p>There is a new connection pool in . This is useful whenever you have a protocol that has to talk to a large number of endpoints while keeping an upper bound of concurrent open connections. In blobs, this is used whenever you use the downloader to orchestrate blobs downloads from multiple providers.</p><p>Iroh connections are relatively lightweight, but even so you don't want to keep thousands of them open at the same time. But opening a new connection every time you do a small exchange with a peer is very wasteful. The  gives you an API to deal with these tradeoffs.</p><p>Let's first look at basic usage:</p><p> will try to get an existing connection from the pool. If there is none, it will create one and store it. The connection will be kept in the pool for a configurable time. Idle connections will be closed as needed. So you can just use this as a drop-in replacement for endpoint.connect and be sure that you won't ever create an unbounded number of connections.</p><p>There are some advanced features that can be configued using non-default options.</p><p>You can configure the max number of connections to be retained, the maximum tolerable duration for connection establishment, and the max duration connections are kept when idle.</p><p>So far, pretty straightforward. There is an additional option to perform some setup before the connection is handed out to the user. For example, you can reject connections based on the data available at this time from the endpoint and the connection, or wait for the connection to reach a certain state before handing it out.</p><p>As an example, you might want to do iroh-blobs transfers only on direct connections in order to get good performance or reduce bandwidth use on the relay. If establishing direct connections is not possible, the connection establishment would time out, and you would never even attempt a transfer from such a node.</p><p>The code to await a direct connection will change quite a bit once we have QUIC multipath. But the capability will remain, and we will update the test code to reflect the new API.</p><div><div><p>The connection pool is generic enough that it will move to its own crate together with some other iroh utilities. It lives in blobs only until iroh 1.0 is released.</p><p>Until then, just depend on iroh-blobs. Iroh-blobs without persistent storage is a very lightweight dependency.</p></div></div><p>One thing to keep in mind when using the connection pool: the connection pool needs the ability to track which connections are currently being used. To do this, the connection pool does not return  but , a struct that derefs to  but contains some additional lifetime tracking.</p><p>But  is , so in principle there is nothing stopping you from cloning the wrapped connection and losing the lifetime tracking. . If you work with connections from the pool, you should pass around either a  or a  to make sure the underlying  stays alive.</p><p>Incorrect usage of :</p><p>Correct usage of :</p><p>We experimented with a safer callback-based API, but it turned out to be just too inconvenient to use.</p><p>Iroh-blobs is a protocol that tries to avoid overabstraction. For example as of now you can only use the BLAKE3 hash function, and we hardcode the chunk group size to a value that should work well for all users.</p><p>But sometimes there are cases where a bit of abstraction is needed. There was a user request to be able to use compression with iroh-blobs in <a href=\"https://www.iroh.computer/sendme\">sendme</a>. One way to do this is to compress files before adding them to the blob store. But this has various downsides. It requires you to create a copy of all data before adding it to the blob store, and will also not lead to very good compression rates when dealing with a large number of small files, since each file will have to be compressed in isolation.</p><p>It would be better to compress requests and response streams of the entire protocol and expose the resulting protocol under a different ALPN. With this approach the compression algorithm would be able to find redundancies between multiple files when handling a request for multiple blobs.</p><p>By default, iroh-blobs still works directly with <code>iroh::endpoint::SendStream</code> and <code>iroh::endpoint::RecvStream</code>, so for normal use nothing changes.</p><p>The traits are a bit similar to <a href=\"https://docs.rs/futures/latest/futures/stream/trait.Stream.html\">Stream</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.rs/futures/latest/futures/io/struct.Sink.html\">Sink</a>, but with two important additions.</p><ul><li><p>We allow sending and receiving <a href=\"https://docs.rs/bytes/latest/bytes/struct.Bytes.html\">Bytes</a>, since iroh streams work with bytes internally. That way we avoid a copy in the default case.</p></li><li><p>We have methods <a href=\"https://docs.rs/iroh-blobs/latest/iroh_blobs/util/trait.RecvStream.html#tymethod.stop\">stop</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.rs/iroh-blobs/latest/iroh_blobs/util/trait.SendStream.html#tymethod.reset\">reset</a> to close the stream, and on the send stream a method <a href=\"https://docs.rs/iroh-blobs/latest/iroh_blobs/util/trait.SendStream.html#tymethod.stopped\">stopped</a> that returns a future that resolves when the remote side has closed the stream.</p></li></ul><p>Wrapping the entire iroh-blobs protocol into compression is pretty straightforward except for some boilerplate. We have an example <a href=\"https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh-blobs/blob/f469e50b2c74623f23b84560d4c088e6c0ac6e4b/examples/compression.rs\">compression.rs</a> that shows how to do this.</p><p>We will have this as an optional feature of <a href=\"https://www.iroh.computer/sendme\">sendme</a> in one of the next releases.</p><p>Just like the connection pool, these traits are generally useful whenever you want to derive iroh protocols by wrapping existing protocols, so they will move to a separate crate once iroh 1.0 is released.</p><div><div><p>This change is from iroh-blobs 0.93</p></div></div><p>On the provider side, it is now possible to have very detailed events about what the provider is doing. The provider events are now implemented as an <a href=\"https://docs.rs/irpc/latest/irpc/\">irpc</a> protocol. For each request type you can use an event mask to configure if you want to be notified at all, and if you need the ability to intercept the request, e.g. if you only want to serve certain hashes.</p><p>There is an <a href=\"https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh-blobs/blob/f469e50b2c74623f23b84560d4c088e6c0ac6e4b/examples/limit.rs\">example</a> how to use the new provider events to limit by provider node id or hash.</p><p>Here is a provider event handler that serves only blobs requests for hashes in a fixed set of allowed hashes:</p><p>The next major feature in iroh-blobs will be a minimal version of multiprovider downloads for individual blobs.</p><p>As soon as iroh 1.0 is released, several generic parts of iroh-blobs will move to a separate iroh utilities crate.</p><div>Iroh is a dial-any-device networking library that just works. Compose from an ecosystem of ready-made protocols to get the features you need, or go fully custom on a clean abstraction over dumb pipes. Iroh is open source, and already running in production on hundreds of thousands of devices.To get started, take a look at our <a href=\"https://iroh.computer/docs\">docs</a>, dive directly into <a href=\"https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh\">the code</a>, or chat with us in our <a href=\"https://iroh.computer/discord\">discord channel</a>.</div>",

      "content": "<p>If you carefully read the Linux kernel docs, you will find an interesting statement:</p><blockquote><p>Linux has also been ported to itself. You can now run the kernel as a userspace application - this is called UserMode Linux (UML).</p></blockquote><p>Today, we’ll explore how you can start an unconventional VM by running a Linux kernel <strong>as a process within the Linux kernel itself</strong>. This approach doesn’t require installing virtualization software like QEMU, nor does it need root privileges, which opens up some intriguing possibilities.</p><h2>Kernel’s Hardware Abstraction</h2><p>A fundamental responsibility of the kernel is to abstract hardware and offer a consistent interface to userspace. This includes managing shared resources like the CPU and memory for multiple tasks. The kernel determines the underlying hardware (e.g., through a device tree on some platforms, which lists system components) and connects the appropriate drivers.</p><p>This hardware can also be entirely virtual. In a QEMU virtual machine, for instance, resources like memory and attached disks are virtualized by the QEMU userspace application, incurring a certain performance overhead. The CPU presents an interesting case, as it too can be virtualized in userspace, particularly when emulating a different architecture.</p><p>A fascinating aspect of drivers for virtualized hardware is that they can be  — or, more formally, . This means the drivers are aware they’re running on virtualized hardware and can leverage this by communicating with the hardware in specialized ways. While the specifics are complex, one can imagine drivers interacting with virtual hardware in ways not feasible with physical counterparts. Online sources suggest that paravirtualization can achieve performance levels close to those of physical devices using traditional drivers.</p><h2>UML - Kernel in a Userspace Process</h2><p>Personally, I view UML as a paravirtualized kernel configuration. Instead of running directly on bare metal, the UML kernel operates atop an existing kernel instance, leveraging some of its userspace functionalities. For instance, rather than linking the console driver to a physical UART, it can utilize standard userspace input/output. Similarly, a block device driver can target a file on the host’s filesystem instead of a physical disk.</p><p>In this setup, UML is essentially a userspace process that cleverly employs concepts like files and sockets to launch a new Linux kernel instance capable of running its own processes. The exact mapping of these processes to the host — specifically, how the CPU is virtualized — is something I’m not entirely clear on, and I’d welcome insights in the comments. One could envision an implementation where guest threads and processes map to host counterparts but with restricted system visibility, akin to containers, yet still operating within a nested Linux kernel.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.7/virt/uml/user_mode_linux.html\">This page</a> from the kernel’s documentation has a pretty good illustration of what this looks like:</p><pre is:raw=\"\" tabindex=\"0\"><code></code></pre><p>I highly recommend checking out that page for more detailed documentation, particularly for the compelling reasons listed for its usefulness. The final point is especially appealing:</p><p>And that’s precisely why we’re diving into it today!</p><p>First things first: it’s crucial to understand that a UML kernel can run  platforms. You can layer an x86 UML kernel on top of an existing x86 kernel; as far as I know, no other configurations are supported.</p><p>Next, we’ll build the UML binary. The configuration process starts with:</p><p>You can configure the kernel much like you normally would. You’ll immediately notice several UML-specific options on the initial configuration page. I tend to think of these as “enlightened” drivers, designed to use the host’s userspace facilities as virtual hardware.</p><p>For this demonstration, I specifically enabled the  option. The documentation explains:</p><blockquote><p>The User-Mode Linux port includes a driver called UBD which will let you access arbitrary files on the host computer as block devices. Unless you know that you do not need such virtual block devices, say Y here.</p></blockquote><p>This option wasn’t enabled by default (which surprised me a bit), so I recommend setting it to . Once you’ve finalized your configuration, building is straightforward:</p><p>And this produces a  binary right there!</p><pre is:raw=\"\" tabindex=\"0\"><code></code></pre><p>Interestingly, it’s dynamically linked to the C standard library:</p><pre is:raw=\"\" tabindex=\"0\"><code></code></pre><p>To do anything meaningful within our nested kernel, we need a userspace. For simplicity, I chose to download the latest <a href=\"https://buildroot.org/\">Buildroot</a> and build it for x86/64.</p><p>If you’re feeling adventurous and want to try building a minimal userspace from scratch but aren’t sure where to begin, pairing this with the <a href=\"https://popovicu.com/posts/making-a-micro-linux-distro\">micro Linux distro exercise</a> could be a lot of fun.</p><h2>Running the Nested Kernel</h2><p>To make things interesting, I decided to provide a block device to the nested kernel, write some data to it, and then verify that data from the host system.</p><p>First, let’s create the disk image:</p><pre is:raw=\"\" tabindex=\"0\"><code></code></pre><p>Next, we’ll format it with ext4:</p><pre is:raw=\"\" tabindex=\"0\"><code></code></pre><p>Now, it’s time to fire up the kernel in userspace. I’ll use the Buildroot image (an  file provided by Buildroot) as the root filesystem:</p><pre is:raw=\"\" tabindex=\"0\"><code></code></pre><p>And just like that, we’re greeted by a very familiar kernel boot sequence!</p><pre is:raw=\"\" tabindex=\"0\"><code></code></pre><p>and at the end, we have the Buildroot login:</p><pre is:raw=\"\" tabindex=\"0\"><code></code></pre><p>The boot process was surprisingly quick.</p><p>Now, let’s create a mountpoint for our disk within the UML instance:</p><p>Then, we mount the second UBD device () to this mountpoint:</p><pre is:raw=\"\" tabindex=\"0\"><code></code></pre><p>With the disk mounted, we can write a test file:</p><pre is:raw=\"\" tabindex=\"0\"><code></code></pre><p>I can now shut down the UML VM:</p><pre is:raw=\"\" tabindex=\"0\"><code></code></pre><pre is:raw=\"\" tabindex=\"0\"><code></code></pre><pre is:raw=\"\" tabindex=\"0\"><code></code></pre><p>This little experiment confirms that we successfully ran a VM using UML, wrote data to a block device within it, and those changes persisted, accessible from the host system.</p><p>Throughout this article, I’ve referred to UML as a VM, and you’d be right to raise an eyebrow. On one hand, it embodies the idea of hardware virtualization via host userspace facilities, and the environment gets its own distinct kernel. On the other hand, this guest kernel is intrinsically linked to the host’s kernel. While it aims for isolation, it doesn’t achieve the same level you’d expect from a QEMU VM powered by KVM.</p><p>What’s the real-world utility here? Is UML suitable for running isolated workloads? My educated guess is: probably not for most production scenarios. I believe UML’s primary strength lies in kernel debugging, rather than serving as a full-fledged, production-ready virtualization stack. For robust VM needs, KVM virtualization (operating at a different architectural layer) is far more battle-tested. Of course, containers offer another alternative if sharing the host kernel is acceptable for your workloads. UML carves out an interesting niche between these two: offering a separate kernel instance while still maintaining a unique connection to the host kernel. It’s a fascinating concept.</p><p>Perhaps in the future, this intriguing technology will garner more attention and see wider adoption. For now, though, it’s a fantastic tool for experimentation and, at the very least, a lot of fun to play with!</p>",

The company says that 0.15% of ChatGPT’s active users in a given week have “conversations that include explicit indicators of potential suicidal planning or intent.” Given that ChatGPT has more than 800 million weekly active users, that translates to more than a million people a week.</p><p>The company says a similar percentage of users show “heightened levels of emotional attachment to ChatGPT,” and that hundreds of thousands of people show signs of psychosis or mania in their weekly conversations with the AI chatbot.</p><p>OpenAI says these types of conversations in ChatGPT are “extremely rare,” and thus difficult to measure. That said, the company estimates these issues affect hundreds of thousands of people every week.</p><p>OpenAI shared the information as part of a broader announcement about its recent efforts to improve how models respond to users with mental health issues. The company claims its latest work on ChatGPT involved consulting with more than 170 mental health experts. OpenAI says these clinicians observed that the latest version of ChatGPT “responds more appropriately and consistently than earlier versions.”</p><p>Addressing mental health concerns in ChatGPT is quickly becoming an existential issue for OpenAI. The company is currently being <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/26/parents-sue-openai-over-chatgpts-role-in-sons-suicide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">sued by the parents of a 16-year-old boy</a> who confided his suicidal thoughts to ChatGPT in the weeks leading up to his suicide. State attorneys general from California and Delaware — which could block the company’s planned restructuring — have also warned OpenAI that it <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/05/california-delaware-ags-blast-openai-over-youth-safety-00546677\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">needs to protect young people</a> who use their products.</p><p>Earlier this month, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman claimed in a <a href=\"https://x.com/sama/status/1978129344598827128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1978129344598827128%7Ctwgr%5E95fbf6288fb57a282d28e89d870a98e71a8387d5%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F10%2F14%2Fsam-altman-says-chatgpt-will-soon-allow-erotica-for-adult-users%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">post on X</a> that the company has “been able to mitigate the serious mental health issues” in ChatGPT, though he did not provide specifics. The data shared on Monday appears to be evidence for that claim, though it raises broader issues about how widespread the problem is. Nevertheless, Altman said OpenAI would be relaxing some restrictions, even allowing adult users to start <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/14/sam-altman-says-chatgpt-will-soon-allow-erotica-for-adult-users/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">having erotic conversations</a> with the AI chatbot.</p><p>In the Monday announcement, OpenAI claims the recently updated version of GPT-5 responds with “desirable responses” to mental health issues roughly 65% more than the previous version. On an evaluation testing AI responses around suicidal conversations, OpenAI says its new GPT-5 model is 91% compliant with the company’s desired behaviors, compared to 77% for the previous GPT‑5 model.</p><p>The company also says its latest version of GPT-5 also holds up to OpenAI’s safeguards better in long conversations. OpenAI has previously flagged that its safeguards were less effective in long conversations.</p><p>On top of these efforts, OpenAI says it’s adding <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/3da476af-b937-47fb-9931-88a851620101/addendum-to-gpt-5-system-card-sensitive-conversations.pdf\">new evaluations</a> to measure some of the most serious mental health challenges facing ChatGPT users. The company says its baseline safety testing for AI models will now include benchmarks for emotional reliance and non-suicidal mental health emergencies.</p><p>OpenAI has also recently rolled out more <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-parental-controls/\">controls for parents</a> of children who use ChatGPT. The company says it’s building an age prediction system to automatically detect children using ChatGPT, and impose a stricter set of safeguards.</p><p>Still, it’s unclear how persistent the mental health challenges around ChatGPT will be. While GPT-5 seems to be an improvement over previous AI models in terms of safety, there still seems to be a slice of ChatGPT’s responses that OpenAI deems “undesirable.” OpenAI also still makes its older and less-safe AI models, including GPT-4o, available for millions of its paying subscribers.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Life doesn't freeze when winter comes—if anything, that's when riders need reliable transportation most, when being exposed to the elements becomes less appealing. Today, the Waymo Driver successfully navigates rain, fog, sandstorms, and freezing temperatures. As we expand to more cities across the U.S. and globally, we're applying the same systematic, scientific approach that enabled us to validate the Waymo Driver for these conditions to advance our capabilities for snowier, winter weather.</p><p>Our proven, safety-guided methodology involves four key steps:</p><p><b>Understanding the Challenge</b></p><p>Snow isn't a single phenomenon—it's a spectrum of conditions that can affect a human or autonomous driver in multiple ways. Atmospheric conditions can range from a light dusting to a complete whiteout, while road surfaces may be snow-covered or have icy patches, and environmental factors like snow buildup along roadsides add further complexity. For years, we've been advancing our system in some of the snowiest conditions across the country —regularly driving in Upstate New York, Michigan's Upper Peninsula, and the Sierra. We've amassed tens of thousands of miles in diverse, snowy conditions. This has allowed the Waymo Driver’s AI to learn from real driving experience and train to navigate a wide range of winter weather.</p><figure><figcaption><div><p>Defining the different types of winter road conditions from icy streets (right) and well-plowed roads (second from the right) to tire tracks and light dustings to falling snow and slushy streets (right).</p></div></figcaption></figure><p><b>Designing Generalizable Solutions</b></p><p>At Waymo, we're building one autonomous system that works across diverse conditions—the same Waymo Driver navigating foggy San Francisco can navigate snowy Denver. Our <a href=\"https://waymo.com/blog/2024/08/meet-the-6th-generation-waymo-driver\"></a> is informed by over 100 million fully autonomous miles of driving experience, combining state-of-the-art hardware and AI to adapt to and sustain fully autonomous operations in cities with harsher weather.</p><p>The Waymo Driver uses cameras, radar, and lidar to perceive the world around it, with each sensor providing a complementary field of view that's especially helpful in inclement weather. Its automated cleaning system –using clever engineering and heating elements – keeps the sensors clear so the vehicle can continue serving riders without needing to pull over.</p><p>Our system provides context not only about where it's operating, but also about the conditions it’s operating under. We're creating state-of-the-art AI, building on top of our existing models with richer inputs and advanced capabilities designed to navigate winter conditions. For example, our AI can distinguish between where there's snow, slush, ice, and normal road surface. The Waymo Driver then uses this information to adjust its driving behavior to match the road conditions in real-time, allowing the Waymo Driver to navigate based on what it sees (and feels), also inferring insights from other road users—adapting to blocked roads, detours, and changing surface conditions. When the system detects lower traction, it automatically adjusts its speed, acceleration, and braking. Each vehicle essentially acts as a <a href=\"https://waymo.com/blog/2022/11/using-cutting-edge-weather-research-to-advance-the-waymo-driver\">mobile weather station</a>, gathering data to inform its own driving decisions and share with the rest of the fleet in the city. These responses are consistent and thoroughly tested, providing predictable and safe navigation in challenging conditions.</p><p><b>Rigorously Validating Our Capabilities</b></p><p>We validate our generalizable system through real-world driving, closed-course testing, and large-scale simulation. With our growing operations in snowy cities like Detroit, Denver, and Washington D.C., in addition to visits&nbsp; to other areas, we're deepening our understanding of winter weather conditions and validating our capabilities. At closed-course testing facilities, we push the system to its limits in controlled environments, teaching it to recognize and respond to extreme scenarios like losing traction on ice. Then, we expand our learning year-round through simulation, long after the last snowflake has melted, so the Waymo Driver is prepared for rare and unusual events, like once-in-100-year snow New Orleans experienced this past winter.</p><figure><figcaption><div><p>Waymo testing its hardware and AI through a combination of structured testing (left), simulation (middle), and real-world driving (right).</p></div></figcaption></figure><p>Once we've validated our technology and operations by our Safety Framework and high caliber for rider excellence, we expand our service with clear guidelines about when our vehicles will operate based on local conditions. As we scale, we're also refining our operations to support winter service—from keeping our fleet clean and charged in freezing temperatures to optimizing the rider experience. Winter weather is complex, but we're committed to providing reliable service when riders need it most. As we continue expanding to more cities around the world, our progress is guided by safety, and riders can trust that the Waymo Driver is ready when we open our doors.<p>Looking for an all-weather Driver instead of all-weather tires?&nbsp; Follow along on our progress to bring Waymo to more cities&nbsp;at </p><a href=\"https://waymo.com/updates/\">waymo.com/updates</a>.</p>",

      "content": "<div>Over the past three months, a team of experienced, like-minded engineers and I have been building something really cool within Amazon Bedrock. While I'm pretty excited about what we are building, there is another unique thing about our team &nbsp;- most of our code is written by AI agents such as Amazon Q or Kiro. Before you roll your eyes: no, we're not vibe coding. I don't believe that's the right way to build robust software.</div><div>Instead, we use an approach where a human and AI agent collaborate to produce the code changes. For our team, every commit has an engineer's name attached to it, and that engineer ultimately needs to review and stand behind the code. We use steering rules to setup constraints for how the AI agent should operate within our codebase, and writing in Rust has been a great benefit. Rust compiler is famous for focusing on correctness and safety, catching many problems at compile time and providing helpful error messages that help the agent iterate. As a juxtaposition to vibe coding, I prefer the term \"agentic coding.\" Much less exciting but in our industry boring is usually good.</div><div>For me, roughly 80% of the code I commit these days is written by the AI agent. My personal workflow: break down the task until I have clarity in my own head (often using AI to explore approaches), prompt the AI agent, review its output, iterate with it until I like the results, and occasionally take over the change set and finish it myself. I pay attention to every line of code the agent produces, and don't accept them until I am fully satisfied with the quality of what is being produced - no different than if I wrote every line myself.</div><div>I've always been an efficient coder, finding time to write code even in limited amount of time I've been able to dedicate to coding over the past few years. And the last few months have been the highest coding throughput months of my career. My team is no different—we are producing code at 10x of typical high-velocity team. That's not hyperbole - we've actually collected and analyzed the metrics.</div><p>Here's where it gets interesting. A typical software team, even an experienced one, doesn't get things right all the time. Even with good testing and engineering practices, bugs occasionally make it through. We've all heard the phrase \"testing in production.\" That reality is the main reason I've always believed that focusing on testing alone is not enough, and investing in blast radius and time to recovery is just as important.</p><p>AI assisted code is no different, it may contain bugs even when thoroughly reviewed by a human, and I suspect the probabilities are not significantly different. &nbsp;However, when teams ship commits at 10x the rate, the overall math changes. What used to be a production impacting bug once or twice a year, can become a weekly occurrence. Even if most bugs get caught in integration or testing environments, they will still impact the shared code base, requiring investigation and slowing the rest of the team down. Once again, this is not just hyperbole—our team sees signs that these are the challenges that pop up with a step function increase in throughput.</p><p>I am increasingly convinced that in order for agentic development to increase engineering velocity by an order of magnitude, we need to decrease the probability of problematic commits by an order of magnitude too. And likely by even more than that, since at high velocities individual commits can begin interacting with each other in unexpected ways too.</p><p>In other words, driving at 200mph, you need a lot of downforce to keep the car on the track!</p><h2>The Cost-Benefit Rebalance</h2><p>One of the best ways to reduce the chance of bugs is to improve testing. I'm an airplane geek, and have always admired the testing ideas used by the airplane manufacturers. From early simulations, to component testing, to wind tunnel testing, to testing to breaking point, and ultimately test flights of fully assembled aircraft. Even flight simulators play a role in improving the overall safety of the industry. Some of these ideas have been tried in the software industry, but they are far from ubiquitous.&nbsp;</p><p>As an example, I've always liked \"wind tunnel\" style tests, that test fully assembled system in a controlled environment. To achieve that, one pattern I've used is implementing high fidelity \"fake\" versions of external dependencies that can be run locally. If you do that, you can then write build-time tests that run locally and verify end-to-end behavior of the whole system. You can even inject unexpected behaviors and failures into fake dependencies, to test how the system handles them. Such tests are easy to write and execute because they run locally, and they are great at catching those sneaky bugs in the seams between components.</p><p>Unfortunately, faking all the external dependencies isn't always easy for a service with moderate level of complexity. And even if you do, you now have to own keeping up with the real dependencies as they evolve. For those reasons, in my experience most teams don't write such tests.</p><p>I think we are seeing early signs that agentic coding can change the calculus here. AI agents are great at spitting out large volumes of code, especially when the desired behavior is well known and there's little ambiguity. Ideas that were sound in principle, but too expensive to implement and maintain just had their costs decrease by an order of magnitude. I really love riding such shifts in the industry, because they open the doors to new approaches that weren't practical in the past.</p><p>Our project (with the help of an AI agent) maintains fake implementations of external dependencies like authentication, storage, chain replication, and inference engine to be used in tests. We then wrote a test harness that uses those fakes to spin up our entire distributed system, including all the micro-services, on developers' machines. Build-time tests then spin up our canaries against that fully assembled stack verifying the system as a whole works.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm really bullish on this approach catching a category of bugs that in the past could only be caught once the change was committed and made it to the test environment. A few years ago, ideas like these would receive resistance as nice, but too expensive. This time around, it took just a few days to implement for a relatively complex system.</p><h2>Driving Fast Requires Tighter Feedback Loop</h2><div>At the end of the day, all these changes need to be built, tested, and deployed in order to bring customer value. It's not uncommon for software teams to have a CICD pipeline that takes several hours to build, package, and then test software changes. That pipeline can then take a few days to roll a batch of changes across pre-prod stages and eventually production stages. Typically, a team with that level of automation would be considered a healthy team.</div><p>Agentic coding changes that dynamic. In the amount of time it takes to build, package, and test one set of commits, another dozen might be waiting to go out. By the time a change set is ready to deploy to production, it may contain 100 or more commits. And if one of those commits contains a problem, the deployment needs to be rolled back grinding the pipeline to a halt. In the meantime, even more changes accumulate, adding to the chaos and the risk. &nbsp;</p><p>I'm a Formula 1 fan, and this reminds me of how an accident on the track can cause a Yellow Flag to be raised. Normally, the cars zoom around the track at immense speeds and accelerations. But if an accident occurs, the race marshals raise a yellow flag, which requires all the cars to slow down behind the pace car. An exciting race turns into a leisurely drive around the track until the debris is cleaned up and the track is safe again. To minimize such slow downs, race organizers go to great lengths to prepare for all types of accidents, and make sure they can clean up the track and restart the race in minutes.</p><p>Just like whole-system local tests help tighten the feedback loop for catching certain bugs, we may need to think similarly about how we implement our CICD pipelines. When teams are moving at the speed of dozen of commits per hour, problematic issues will need to be identified, isolated, and reverted in minutes instead of hours or days. That means that a typical build and test infrastructure will need to become an order of magnitude faster than it is today. Just like online video games become unplayable when there is high lag between player's inputs and the game's reaction, it's really hard to move 10x faster if every commit still requires a lengthy delay before you see the feedback.&nbsp;</p><h2>The communication bottleneck</h2><div><p>I enjoy observing well-run operations. If you've ever peeked behind the curtain of a busy restaurant, then at first sight you may think it's chaos. But if you take a second to notice the details, you'll see that all members are constantly coordinating with each other. Chefs, cooks, wait staff, bussers, and managers pass information back and forth in a continuous stream. By staying in constant sync, a well run restaurant manages to serve its patrons even during peak times, without sacrificing on quality or latency.</p><p>I believe that achieving similar increase in velocity for a software team requires constraints on how teams communicate. When your throughput increases by an order of magnitude, you're not just writing more code - you're making more decisions. Should we use this caching strategy or that one? How should we handle this edge case? What's the right abstraction here? At normal velocity, a team might make one or two of these decisions per week. At 10x velocity, they are making multiple each day.</p><p>The challenge is that many of these decisions impact what others are working on. Engineer A decides to refactor the authentication flow, which affects the API that Engineer B is about to extend. These aren't just implementation details - they're architectural choices that ripple through the codebase.</p><p>I find that traditional coordination mechanisms introduce too much latency here. Waiting for a Slack response or scheduling a quick sync for later in the day means either creating a bottleneck - the decision blocks progress - or risking going down the wrong path before realizing the conflict. At high throughput, the cost of coordination can dominate!</p><p>One approach is to eliminate coordination - if everybody works on independent components, they are unlikely to need to coordinate. But I find that ideal impractical in most real-world systems. So another alternative is to significantly decrease the cost of coordination. Our team sits on the same floor, and I think that's been critical to our velocity. When someone needs to make a decision that might impact others, they can walk over and hash it out in minutes in front of a whiteboard. We align on the approach, discuss trade-offs in real time, and both engineers get back to work. The decision gets made quickly, correctly, and without creating a pile-up of blocked work.</p><p>I recognize this doesn't solve the problem for distributed teams—that remains an open challenge.</p></div><div><p>I'm really excited about the potential of agentic development. I think it has the capability to not only improve the efficiency of software development, but also allow us to tackle problems that were previously too niche or expensive to solve. The gains are real - our team's 10x throughput increase isn't theoretical, it's measurable.</p><p>But here's the critical part: these gains won't materialize if we simply bolt AI agents onto our existing development practices. Like adding a turbocharger to a car with narrow tires and old brakes, the result won't be faster lap times - it will be crashes. At 10x code velocity, our current approaches to testing, deployment, and team coordination become the limiting factors. The bottleneck just moves.</p><p>This means we need to fundamentally rethink how we approach building software. CICD pipelines designed for 10 commits per day will buckle under 100. Testing strategies that were \"good enough\" at normal velocity will let too many bugs through at high velocity. Communication patterns that worked fine before will create constant pile-ups of blocked work.</p><p>The good news is that we already have great ideas for comprehensive testing, rapid deployment, and efficient coordination - ideas that have shown promise but haven't seen wide adoption because they were too expensive to implement and maintain. What's changed is that agentic development itself can dramatically lower those costs. The same AI agents that are increasing our code throughput can also help us build the infrastructure needed to sustain that throughput.</p><p>This is the real opportunity: not just writing more code faster, but using AI to make previously impractical engineering practices practical. The teams that succeed with agentic development will be the ones who recognize that the entire software development lifecycle needs to evolve in concert.</p></div>",

      "content": "<p>In the summer of 2024, I reported on an <a href=\"https://bbchallenge.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">online community</a> that <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/amateur-mathematicians-find-fifth-busy-beaver-turing-machine-20240702/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">nailed down the precise value</a> of a number called BB(5) — the first big breakthrough in 50 years on an old problem in theoretical computer science known as the busy beaver game. BB(5), now known to be 47,176,870, is the fifth of the so-called busy beaver numbers, which measure the complexity of the craziest computations that simple computer programs can complete.</p><p>The next step in this idiosyncratic research effort is to identify the sixth busy beaver number BB(6), and there has been some notable progress on that front — I wrote a <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/busy-beaver-hunters-reach-numbers-that-overwhelm-ordinary-math-20250822/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">follow-up story</a> about it a few months ago. But busy beaver researchers don’t expect to nail down the true value of BB(6) any time soon. That’s because doing so would require them to understand the behavior of a program with the awesome name “Antihydra,” which resembles a longstanding open problem in mathematics called the Collatz conjecture. A twitter user sharing my first busy beaver story summed up this state of affairs more succinctly:</p><p>Both of my stories alluded to the Antihydra barrier only very briefly. In this blog post I will explore it in more detail: What exactly is Antihydra, what is the Collatz conjecture, how are they connected, and what makes them so daunting?</p><p>If you haven’t already read my two  stories about the busy beaver game, I recommend doing so before reading further, mainly just because they’re both really fun! Here I’ll recap how the busy beaver game works so that we’re all on the same page.</p><p>I wrote above that the busy beaver numbers “measure the complexity of the craziest computations that simple computer programs can complete.” To define them more precisely, we first need a mathematical framework for gauging the complexity of computer programs themselves, to decide which ones are “simple.” Then we need a way to quantify the complexity of computations — what computer programs  — so that we can identify the craziest ones.</p><p>In the busy beaver game, computer programs are represented by hypothetical devices called Turing machines, which compute in discrete steps by reading and writing 0s and 1s on an infinite tape divided into cells. A unique list of rules governs the behavior of each Turing machine. Anything you can do with an ordinary computer program, you can in principle do with the right set of Turing machine rules. “In principle” is doing a lot of work in this sentence — even if you managed to acquire the requisite infinite tape, computing with a Turing machine would be horrendously inefficient. But Turing machines are easier to analyze theoretically than more practical programming languages.</p><p>Let’s unpack how Turing machines work in a bit more detail. At each step, a Turing machine consults one of its rules and edits one cell on the tape. Each rule has two cases: what to do if the current cell contains a 0, and what to do if it contains a 1. “What to do” here means what to write in the current cell, which direction to move next, and which rule to consult for the next step. One case of one rule breaks this pattern: It tells the Turing machine to “halt,” or stop running. But by itself, the existence of this instruction doesn’t guarantee that a Turing machine will halt — the machine might never get there. ’s visual designer Kristina Armitage encapsulated all of this in a beautiful infographic.</p><p>The number of rules that a Turing machine has will be our measure of program complexity. This choice lets us replace our vague question about the craziest things that simple computer programs can do with a series of specific questions about different degrees of craziness, corresponding to different busy beaver numbers. You learn the value of BB(1) by answering the question “what’s the most complex computation that a one-rule Turing machine can complete?” Likewise, BB(2) measures the most complex computation that a two-rule machine can complete, and so on.</p><p>To answer these questions, we need a precise definition of what makes one computation more complex than another. A natural measure is how many steps the Turing machine needs to complete the computation. “Complete” is important — every Turing machine that never halts will run for infinitely many steps, but that’s not really a fair comparison. The number of steps that a Turing machine takes before halting (and indeed, whether it halts at all) can depend on the initial pattern of 0s and 1s on the tape. For the busy beaver game, we always start from the so-called “blank tape,” which has 0s in every cell.</p><p>We now have all the necessary pieces to formally define the busy beaver numbers. Let’s take BB(6) to be specific: It is the longest finite runtime among all six-rule Turing machines, when those machines start with a blank tape. Finding this number is straightforward in principle. First, list out all possible six-rule Turing machines. Next, sort them into two categories: those that will eventually halt when they start running on the blank tape, and those that will run forever. Toss out all the non-halting machines. Finally, measure how many steps each of the halting machines takes before stopping. The largest number is BB(6).</p><p>The problem with this plan lies in the second step, where you divide the Turing machines into two groups based on whether or not they halt. It turns out that deciding whether a Turing machine will halt can be an extremely hard problem, to put it mildly. And if you can’t tell whether a given machine will halt, then you don’t know whether your list of halting Turing machines is complete, so you can’t know whether you’ve found the longest runtime! As of this writing, researchers have classified the vast majority of six-rule machines as either halting or non-halting. But there are 1,618 “holdouts” whose fate remains unknown.</p><p>Antihydra is one of these holdout machines. To nail down the value of BB(6), researchers must first determine whether Antihydra halts, and that seems to be beyond the reach of any known mathematical technique. To understand why, we need to take a step back and ask, “what exactly are these Turing machines doing?”</p><p>You may object at this point that we already know exactly what these Turing machines are doing: Each one is just following a specific sequence of rules, writing 0s and 1s on the tape as it goes. But this “low-level” description is a bit like saying “when I push these buttons, my pocket calculator toggles transistors on and off in this specific pattern.” That may very well be true, but “high-level” descriptions like “when I push these buttons, my pocket calculator multiplies 3 and 4” are usually more useful.</p><p>There’s no guarantee that any given Turing machine’s behavior admits such a simple high-level description. But remember that Turing machines can carry out all possible computations — that means that at least  Turing machines must be executing programs with high-level descriptions that humans can understand.</p><p>Actually, the most notable five- and six-rule Turing machines that busy beaver researchers have studied so far all have relatively simple high-level descriptions — that includes the longest-running five- and six-rule machines that eventually halt, the <a href=\"https://wiki.bbchallenge.org/wiki/Skelet_1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">most</a><a href=\"https://wiki.bbchallenge.org/wiki/Skelet_17\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">complex</a> non-halting five-rule machines, and holdouts like Antihydra.</p><p>Let’s look at a specific example. The <a href=\"https://wiki.bbchallenge.org/wiki/5-state_busy_beaver_winner\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">fifth busy beaver</a>, which runs for 47,176,870 steps before halting, obeys the following low-level rules:</p><p>In 1993, the mathematician Pascal Michel <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/BF01409968\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">proved</a> that these rules are equivalent to a simple high-level program:</p><ol><li>Divide \\(x\\) by 3 and check the remainder.\n<ul><li>If the remainder is 0, calculate \\((5x + 18)/3\\). The result is your new value of \\(x\\).</li><li>If the remainder is 1, calculate \\((5x + 22)/3\\). The result is your new value of \\(x\\).</li><li>If the remainder is 2, halt.</li></ul></li><li>If you haven’t halted, go back to step 2 and plug in the new value of \\(x\\).</li></ol><p>Once you have a high-level description like this, you can use it to determine whether the machine will halt — and if so, exactly how many steps it will take. In this case, the high-level program just repeatedly plugs in new values of \\(x\\) until it finds one that leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 3. One third of numbers have this property, so you might guess that the program will take three tries to find one, give or take a few. If you start from a random value of \\(x\\), you’ll find that three iterations is indeed typical. But it turns out that if you start from \\(x = 0\\), this program will repeat the second step 15 times before it lands on a number with remainder 2! Busy beaver researchers often like to anthropomorphize the Turing machines they study, imagining that the machines are actively trying to run for as long as possible. Adopting that perspective, we might say that this Turing machine got very lucky.</p><p>The fifth busy beaver is just one member of a family of “Collatz-like” Turing machines whose high-level behavior has the following general form:</p><ol><li>Set \\(x\\) equal to some starting value (which may or may not be 0).</li><li>Divide \\(x\\) by a fixed number \\(N\\). The remainder tells you what formula to use to get your new value of \\(x\\).</li><li>Check if you’ve met a specific halting condition. If not, go back to step 2 with the new value of \\(x\\).</li></ol><p>The family of Collatz-like Turing machines includes both halting and non-halting machines. It gets its name from a procedure for generating number sequences devised in 1937 by the mathematician Lothar Collatz:</p><ol><li>Choose a starting value for \\(x\\).</li><li>Check whether \\(x\\) is even or odd.\n<ul><li>If it’s even, calculate \\(x/2\\). The result is your new value of \\(x\\).</li><li>If it’s odd, calculate \\(3x + 1\\). The result is your new value of \\(x\\).</li></ul></li><li>Check whether \\(x = 1\\). If not, go back to step 2.</li></ol><p>This looks very similar to our general description of high-level behavior for Collatz-like machines, with \\(x = 1\\) as the halting condition.<a href=\"https://collatz-graph.vercel.app/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Try iterating these rules</a> from any initial integer value of \\(x\\) — I’m willing to bet however much you like that you’ll eventually hit 1. The <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/why-mathematicians-still-cant-solve-the-collatz-conjecture-20200922/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Collatz conjecture</a> asserts that this happens for every positive integer, no matter how large. People have tested this empirically for all integers up to at least 2 billion trillion (!) without finding any counterexamples, which strongly suggests that the conjecture is true. But nobody knows how to rigorously prove it.</p><p>Let’s take a step back. At the beginning of this post I noted a link between the Collatz conjecture and Antihydra: Nobody knows how to prove the Collatz conjecture, and that’s why researchers don’t know how to conclusively determine whether Antihydra halts. But now I’ve instead linked the Collatz conjecture to the fifth busy beaver, a machine that  been proved to halt. What’s going on here?</p><p>The resolution to this apparent puzzle is that for the busy beaver game, we only care about whether a Turing machine halts when it starts running from a specific tape configuration, namely the blank tape. That means we only care about whether the corresponding Collatz-like sequence halts for a single input. The Collatz conjecture, meanwhile, asks whether you eventually hit \\(x = 1\\) for  input. It’s easy to show that the Collatz sequence ultimately hits \\(x = 1\\) for any one input, just as it’s easy to show that the fifth busy beaver halts (once you’ve established an equivalence between its low-level rules and the high-level Collatz-like program).</p><p>We can easily construct a variant of the Collatz problem that’s hard to solve even for a single input. All we need to do is change the \\(3x + 1\\) rule for odd numbers to \\(5x + 1\\). In that case, trajectories that start from certain inputs (such as \\(x = 7\\)) look like they will diverge, never hitting 1 or falling into a cycle. But researchers haven’t been able to prove that any of these trajectories diverges. There’s an inherent asymmetry here. If you want to prove that a sequence  eventually end up somewhere, you can always just use brute force, at least in principle. But if you want to prove that a sequence never terminates, even a single input can be hard.</p><p>We’re now finally ready to confront the terror that is <a href=\"https://wiki.bbchallenge.org/wiki/Antihydra\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Antihydra</a>. It obeys the following high-level rules:</p><ol><li>Check whether \\(x\\) is even or odd.\n<ul><li>If it’s even, calculate \\(3x/2\\). The result is your new value of \\(x\\). Add one to a running tally of how many times you’ve applied this even rule.</li><li>If it’s odd, calculate \\((3x-1)/2\\). The result is your new value of \\(x\\). Add one to a running tally of how many times you’ve applied this odd rule.</li></ul></li><li>Check whether your “odd” count is more than twice as large as your “even” count. If so, halt. If not, go back to step 2.</li></ol><p>This is a very curious set of rules. The formulas \\(3x/2\\) and \\((3x-1)/2\\) don’t appear to systematically favor odd or even numbers, so you might expect that iterating them again and again will look like repeatedly flipping a coin and keeping track of how often you get heads versus tails. Early on in a sequence of coin flips, it’s distinctly possible that you’ll end up with more than twice as many heads as tails. But if this doesn’t happen right away, it becomes less and less likely the longer you keep going. Researchers have now simulated the behavior of Antihydra out to more than 270 billion steps, and as expected, the “even” and “odd” tallies are pretty close to equal — nowhere near the extreme imbalance demanded by the halting condition. So it seems overwhelmingly likely that Antihydra never halts. But nobody knows how to prove it! The mathematician <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/john-conways-life-in-games-20150828/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">John Conway</a> coined the delightful term “probviously” for situations like this —&nbsp;ones where the specific problem of interest is very hard to solve, but probabilistic reasoning about the “typical” behavior of similar problems makes the answer seem obvious.</p><p>Antihydra’s behavior is qualitatively similar to the \\(5x + 1\\) version of the Collatz conjecture, where we don’t know how to prove that any single trajectory diverges. I want to stress that as far as researchers know, there isn’t a more precise mathematical link between these two problems: If you resolved one of them, it wouldn’t automatically resolve the other. But the problems seem hard for very similar reasons. If someone does manage to prove the Collatz conjecture, the mathematical techniques used in the proof would likely be promising for the Antihydra problem (and vice versa).</p><p>Actually, Antihydra is just one of many probviously non-halting Turing machines with Collatz-like behavior. Busy beaver hunter Shawn Ligocki dubbed these machines <a href=\"https://www.sligocki.com/2023/10/16/bb-3-3-is-hard.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">“cryptids”</a> when they were first identified in variants of the standard busy beaver game.</p><p>The first two cryptids to be discovered were named <a href=\"https://wiki.bbchallenge.org/wiki/Bigfoot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Bigfoot</a> and <a href=\"https://wiki.bbchallenge.org/wiki/Hydra\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Hydra</a>; researchers have now identified so many cryptids that it no longer makes sense to give each one its own name. The existence of all these cryptids implies that busy beaver numbers beyond BB(5) will remain out of reach until researchers develop new mathematical tools for tackling Collatz-like problems. And the legendary mathematician Paul Erdős reportedly said “Mathematics may not be ready for such problems.”</p><p>But that doesn’t mean busy beaver hunters should give up. There’s still plenty of questions to explore in what might be called “cryptid ecology.” How many subspecies of cryptids are there? How are they related to each other, and to <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-busy-beaver-game-illuminates-the-fundamental-limits-of-math-20201210/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">other unsolved problems in mathematics</a> beyond the Collatz conjecture? Since the beginning of the busy beaver game, avid hunters have repeatedly encountered surprising new Turing machine behavior, and that pattern shows no sign of letting up.</p><p>This past August I visited Tahquamenon Falls in Michigan’s upper peninsula, a part of the state that’s apparently an epicenter of bigfoot sightings. Fortunately I didn’t encounter any cryptids, but I did learn some new things about a few friendlier critters. Surprising discoveries can come from anywhere!</p>",

SLAs were blown, an eight-figure revenue reduction will follow. Before Monday, I’d spent around 7 years in industry and never personally had production nuked by a public cloud outage. I generally regarded AWS’s reliability as excellent, industry-leading.</p><p>A number of smart engineers have come to this major bust-up and covered it with the blanket of a simple explanation: brain drain; race condition; it’s always DNS; the cloud is unreliable, go on-prem. You’re not going to understand software reliability if you summarize an outage of this scale in an internet comment. Frankly, I’m not even going to understand it after reading AWS’s 4000 word summary and thinking about it for hours. But I’m going to hold the hot takes and try.</p><p>I wrote <a href=\"https://modal.com/\">Modal’s</a> internal us-east-1 incident postmortem before AWS published their “service disruption summary”: <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/message/101925/\">https://aws.amazon.com/message/101925</a>. Our control plane being in us-east-1, we got hit hard. Along with hundreds of other affected companies, we’re interested in a peek under the hood of the IaaS we depend on.</p><p>Arriving a few days after the outage, this public summary is a small window into the inner workings of the most experienced hyperscaler engineering operation in the world. I’ll analyze each of the three outage phases, call out key features, and then try, with limited information, to derive a lesson or two from this giant outage. Before proceeding, it is recommended to read the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/message/101925/\">summary</a> carefully.</p><h2>Out of one service outage, one hundred and forty service outages are born</h2><p>How did a DynamoDB service failure at 6:48AM UTC October 20th become a 140 service failure epidemic?</p><p>AWS breaks down their summary into dedicated sections for the DynamoDB, EC2, and Network Load Balancer (NLB) services. They add a final section lumping together the other 137 affected services (which included Lambda, IAM, STS, Elasticache, ECR, Secrets Manager).</p><p>This document structure is suitable as it matches the structure of the outage.</p><p>DynamoDB precipitated all other service failures because it is used by EC2 and caused EC2 to go down, or because a service depended on DynamoDB directly. EC2 and DynamoDB are used extensively within AWS for service implementation, thus the wildfire spread to around 70% of all AWS services in the us-east-1 region.</p><p>It is widely known that AWS dogfoods its own cloud services, e.g. DynamoDB, for the implementation of <a href=\"http://Amazon.com\">Amazon.com</a> other AWS services. DynamoDB and EC2 are ‘layer one’ foundation services within AWS. If they go down, basically everything else does.</p><blockquote><p>The root cause of this issue was a latent race condition in the DynamoDB DNS management system that resulted in an incorrect empty DNS record for the service’s regional endpoint (<strong>dynamodb.us-east-1.amazonaws.com</strong>) that the automation failed to repair.</p></blockquote><p>In an eye straining 786 word mega-paragraph, they outline their issues, which I will try summarize.</p><p>To maintain population of all DNS entries for dynamodb.us-east-1.amazonaws.com, they run three DNS Enactors, one in each of , , . Each of these three Enactors performs mutations  coordination.</p><blockquote><p>For resiliency, the DNS Enactor operates redundantly and fully independently in three different Availability Zones (AZs).</p></blockquote><p>One of these Enactors, say , became . They don’t say anything about the cause of the latency, but I believe it was extreme (10-100x) because the system design seems to allow for some deviation from mean latency.</p><p>They use a typical “keep last N” garbage collection mechanism to remove old DNS plans. We also do this at Modal to garbage collect old machine images. Crucially, the last N must  include an active resource. I assume the DynamoDB team picked a large N to ensure they ‘never’ delete an active plan, which implies the Enactor’s latency in  was extreme.</p><blockquote><p>To a first approximation, we can say that accidents are almost always the result of incorrect estimates of the likelihood of one or more things. — <em>Why you should read accident reports, Holloway, C. Michael</em></p></blockquote><p>The plan being applied by the slow Enactor fell out of the  generations safety window and became old, eligible for deletion. It was the old plan deletion which turned a ‘stale DNS plan’ degradation into a full-blown ‘zero DNS entries’ outage.</p><p>Now, back to the TOCTOU issue. Why is an Enactor allowed to make only one plan staleness check for N plan mutations? I suspect it’s because querying the DNS Planner for staleness is magnitudes more expensive than making a plan mutation. It would be non-performant, and  unnecessary to make N checks for N fast plan mutations.</p><p>Without this TOCTOU bug, there’s no ‘stale DNS plan’ degradation and thus no opportunity to mistakenly delete an active plan.</p><p>We’re at two faults so far, but there’s more. Using the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_cheese_model\">Swiss cheese model</a> of accident causation we can pass through a couple more Emmental holes.</p><p>Deleting the active plan is a disaster, but the Enactor’s cleanup phase didn’t check for it. This absent guard appears to be another fault.</p><p>Some have pointed out that the Enactor deleting the Planner’s plans is weird, but I think it makes sense. The Planner is allowed to be a straightforward append-only system of outputs. The Enactor makes forward progress against the plan log and maintains the window of active DNS records. If the Planner is deleting plans, it’s also making writes against Route53.</p><p>After deleting the ‘active’ plan, the Enactor state was corrupted and unrecoverable without “manual operation intervention”, which took over 2 hours to be done.</p><p>It is surprising that this corruption and DNS ‘empty state’ was not auto-recovered. <a href=\"http://dynamodb.us-east-1.amazonaws.com\">dynamodb.us-east-1.amazonaws.com</a> had  IP addresses associated. In production that’s a pants-on-fire situation. Could the Enactors not have fallen back to some useful, non-empty state and restored partial service?</p><p>Anyone considering this system failure outside the DynamoDB team has the struggle of keyhole observation added to the problem of hindsight bias. I won’t have the temerity to suggest remediation, or declare a root cause. But there is much that is familiar in the DynamoDB DNS failure, and I’ll be looking for it in future design documents.</p><blockquote><p>The selection of events to include in an event chain is dependent on the stopping rule used to determine how far back the sequence of explanatory events goes. Although the first event in the chain is often labeled the initiating event or root cause , the selection of an initiating event is arbitrary and previous events and conditions could always be added. — <a href=\"http://sunnyday.mit.edu/safer-world.pdf\">Engineering a safer world</a></p></blockquote><p>Having read the DynamoDB section of the summary, <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45677745\">some are tempted</a> to declare discovery of the root cause: a race condition.</p><p>The software industry today holds the root cause analysis (RCA) as a primary activity of postmortem write ups. Google “postmortem template” and almost every offered template includes a section for root cause(s) analysis. The top result, Atlassian’s, includes it. A couple years ago Atlassian’s is what I found and copied as Modal’s internal template.</p><p>But leading reliability engineers have moved on from centering root cause analysis. It is a useful but inadequate model of incident occurrence.</p><p>Most obviously, RCA has an infinite regress problem. The cause of the extreme Enactor latency in one AZ is unexplained, but it is is antecedent to the race condition and could be considered a root cause. But, say the latency was causes by high packet drop, what caused  On and on we go, boats against the current—</p><p>More interestingly, however, is the myopia induced by RCA. Yes, the extreme latency triggered the race condition bug. It was a , but it is just one of many latent faults that could emerge from the dynamics of the DynamoDB system. And as shown above by the Swiss cheese analysis, multiple control mechanisms combined into an unrecoverable failure once the latency emerged.</p><p>Today’s leading distributed systems engineers, including the SRE’s at Google, analyze failure as a <a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/publications/loginonline/evolution-sre-google\">control problem</a>.</p><blockquote><p>Instead of asking “What software service failed?” we ask “What interactions between parts of the system were inadequately controlled? — <a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/publications/loginonline/evolution-sre-google\">The Evolution of SRE at Google</a></p></blockquote><p>Looking for a control problem, we see not just the race condition deletion, but the latency, the garbage collection, the guarding (or lack thereof), the state corruption, the alerting, and the human operator.</p><p>This incident summary contains perhaps <a href=\"https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;query=%22aws%20droplet%22&amp;sort=byPopularity&amp;type=story\">the first public reference</a> to an  and the DropletWorkflow Manager (DWFM). Droplets are physical servers upon which all EC2 instances run.</p><p>The DWFM depends on DynamoDB to complete “state checks”, which are heartbeats between DWFM and every physical server managed. If the heartbeat with a server stops, the DWFM’s control of the server is cut off. Without this control, no creation or state transition can occur on an EC2 instance, affecting every EC2 user in us-east-1 except those which left all their instances  between 6:48AM and 8:50PM UTC. Yikes.</p><p>DynamoDB is a critical dependency of the DWFM and triggered the EC2 service failure. But it gets interesting once DynamoDB recovers around 9:40AM UTC. EC2 is down or degraded for .</p><p>In normal operation of EC2, the DWFM maintains a large number (~10^6) of active leases against physical servers and a very small number (~10^2) of broken leases, the latter of which the manager is actively attempting to reestablish.</p><p>The DynamoDB outage, which lasted almost 3 hours, caused widespread heartbeat timeouts and thus thousands of leases broke. I’d estimate that the number of broken leases reached at least 10^5, or three OOMs larger than normal.</p><p>With a huge queue of leases to reestablish, the DWFM system has two possible transitions. One is a slow, gradual burn down of the lease backlog (recovery). The other is a , where the lease queue remains high (a “sustaining effect”) until manual intervention.</p><p>Unfortunately, the DWFM entered congestive collapse.</p><blockquote><p>…, due to the large number of droplets, efforts to establish new droplet leases took long enough that the work could not be completed before they timed out. — <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/message/101925/\">AWS Summary</a></p></blockquote><p>It’s most interesting here to consider why collapse occurred. Was the unit of work completion somehow , ie. instead of processing one lease at a time the DWFM processes an all-or-nothing block of leases? Or, did the DWFM become a thundering herd and overwhelm a downstream component between it and the Droplets?</p><p>The congestive collapse of EC2 could only be restored by manual intervention by engineers, where they restarted DWFM servers presumably to drop the in-memory queued lease work and restore goodput in the system.</p><p>The presence and peril of the metastable failure state has likely been widely known within AWS engineering leadership for around 4 years. And yet it bit them in their darling EC2. I eagerly await Marc’s blog post.</p><p>At around 16:00 UTC in the now internally famous <code>#incident-41-hfm_failures</code> incident channel I began investigating a degradation in our <a href=\"https://modal.com/docs/guide/sandbox#sandboxes\">Sandbox</a> product. It turned out that AWS NLB trouble was causing Modal clients to fail to establish a gRPC connection with <a href=\"http://api.modal.com\">api.modal.com</a> (which points at NLB load balancers).</p><p>The NLB service went down because EC2 has a  responsible for propagating network configuration when new EC2 instances are created or instance transitions (e.g. stopping) occur, and this manager fell behind under the weight of backlogged work.</p><p>The most interesting bit of the NLB service outage was that the NLB healthcheck system received bad feedback because of network configuration staleness and incorrectly performed AZ failovers.</p><blockquote><p>The alternating health check results increased the load on the health check subsystem, causing it to degrade, resulting in delays in health checks and triggering automatic AZ DNS failover to occur.</p></blockquote><p>Under <a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/publications/loginonline/evolution-sre-google\">control systems analysis</a>, the potential for bad feedback is exactly the kind of thing that gets designed for. The healthcheck system behaved exactly as intended giving the inputs it received— it was a reliable component interacting unsafely with a broken environment.</p><p>In their discussion of remediations, the line item for NLB is about control for bad feedback.</p><blockquote><p>For NLB, we are adding a velocity control mechanism to limit the capacity a single NLB can remove when health check failures cause AZ failover.</p></blockquote><p>You only get so many major AWS incidents in your career, so appreciate the ones that you get. AWS’s reliability is the best in the world. I have used all major US cloud providers for years now, and until Monday’s us-east-1 outage AWS was  the most reliable. This is perhaps their biggest reliability failure in a decade. We should learn something from it.</p><p>I disagree with the popular early explanations. The <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/20/aws_outage_amazon_brain_drain_corey_quinn/\">“brain drain”</a> theory has a high burden of proof and very little evidence. It possible that brain drain delayed remediation—this was a 14 hour outage—but we can’t see their response timeline. There’s also no evidence that us-east-1, being the oldest region, suffered from its age. The systems involved (DynamoDB, DNS Enactor, DWFM) are probably running globally. Also, those suggesting AWS’s reliability has fallen behind its competitors are too hasty. GCP had a severe global outage just <a href=\"https://status.cloud.google.com/incidents/ow5i3PPK96RduMcb1SsW\">last June</a>.</p><p>My main takeaway is that in our industry the design, implementation, and operation of production systems still regularly falls short of what we think we’re capable of. DynamoDB hit a fairly straightforward race condition and entered into unrecoverable state corruption. EC2 went into congestion collapse. NLB’s healthcheck system got misdirected by bad data. We’ve seen these before, we’ll see them again. <a href=\"https://erikbern.com/2022/10/19/we-are-still-early-with-the-cloud.html\">We’re still early with the cloud</a>.</p><p>Software systems are far more complex and buggy than we realize. Useful software systems, such as EC2, <a href=\"https://how.complexsystems.fail/\">always operate in a degraded state</a> with dozens of present or latent bugs and faults. The presence of constant safety, of the cherished five 9s, is not a miracle, but a very challenging design and operational endeavor.</p>",

      "content": "<p>In January 2025, the PSF submitted a proposal to the US government National Science Foundation under the <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/safe-ose-safety-security-privacy-open-source-ecosystems\" target=\"_blank\">Safety, Security, and Privacy of Open Source Ecosystems program</a> to address structural vulnerabilities in Python and PyPI. It was the PSF’s first time applying for government funding, and navigating the intensive process was a steep learning curve for our small team to climb. Seth Larson, PSF Security Developer in Residence, serving as Principal Investigator (PI) with Loren Crary, PSF Deputy Executive Director, as co-PI, led the multi-round proposal writing process as well as the months-long vetting process. We invested our time and effort because we felt the PSF’s work is a strong fit for the program and that the benefit to the community if our proposal were accepted was considerable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><div>We were honored when, after many months of work, our proposal was recommended for funding, particularly as only <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/funding/overview\" target=\"_blank\">36% </a>of new NSF grant applicants are successful on their first attempt. We became concerned, however, when we were presented with the terms and conditions we would be required to agree to if we accepted the grant. These terms included affirming the statement that we “do not, and will not during the term of this financial assistance award, operate any programs that advance or promote DEI, or discriminatory equity ideology in violation of Federal anti-discrimination laws.” This restriction would apply not only to the security work directly funded by the grant, <b>but to any and all activity of the PSF as a whole</b>. Further, violation of this term gave the NSF the right to “claw back” previously approved and transferred funds. This would create a situation where money we’d already spent could be taken back, which would be an enormous, open-ended financial risk.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div></div><div>Diversity, equity, and inclusion are core to the PSF’s values, as committed to in our <a href=\"https://www.python.org/psf/mission/\" target=\"_blank\">mission statement</a>:&nbsp;</div><blockquote><div><div><i>The mission of the Python Software Foundation is to promote, protect, and advance the Python programming language, and to support and facilitate the growth of <b>a diverse and international community</b> of Python programmers.</i></div></div></blockquote><div><div>Given the value of the grant to the community and the PSF, we did our utmost to get clarity on the terms and to find a way to move forward in concert with our values. We consulted our NSF contacts and reviewed decisions made by other organizations in similar circumstances, particularly <a href=\"https://carpentries.org/blog/2025/06/announcing-withdrawal-of-nsf-pose-proposal/\" target=\"_blank\">The Carpentries</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div></div><div><div>In the end, however, the PSF simply can’t agree to a statement that we won’t operate any programs that “advance or promote” diversity, equity, and inclusion, as it would be a betrayal of our mission and our community.&nbsp;</div></div><div><div>We’re disappointed to have been put in the position where we had to make this decision, because we believe our proposed project would offer invaluable advances to the Python and greater open source community, protecting millions of PyPI users from attempted supply-chain attacks. The proposed project would create new tools for automated proactive review of all packages uploaded to PyPI, rather than the current process of reactive-only review. These novel tools would rely on capability analysis, designed based on a dataset of known malware. Beyond just protecting PyPI users, the outputs of this work could be transferable for all open source software package registries, such as NPM and Crates.io, improving security across multiple open source ecosystems.</div></div><div><div>In addition to the security benefits, the grant funds would have made a big difference to the PSF’s budget. The PSF is a relatively small organization, operating with an annual budget of around $5 million per year, with a staff of just 14. $1.5 million over two years would have been quite a lot of money for us, and easily the largest grant we’d ever received. Ultimately, however, the value of the work and the size of the grant were not more important than practicing our values and retaining the freedom to support every part of our community. The PSF Board voted unanimously to withdraw our application.&nbsp;</div></div><div><div>Giving up the NSF grant opportunity—along with inflation, lower sponsorship, economic pressure in the tech sector, and global/local uncertainty and conflict—means the PSF needs financial support now more than ever. We are incredibly grateful for any help you can offer. If you're already a PSF member or regular donor, you have our deep appreciation, and we urge you to share your story about why you support the PSF.

This involved navigating to the subscriptions section of their Microsoft account and selecting “Cancel subscription”. It was only on the following page that subscribers were given the option to instead move to the Classic plan.&nbsp;See a <a href=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/microsoft-in-court-for-allegedly-misleading-millions-of-australians-over-microsoft-365-subscriptions#screenshot-page\">screenshot of the cancellation page revealing the Classic plan</a>.</p><p>“Following a detailed investigation, we will allege in Court that Microsoft deliberately omitted reference to the Classic plans in its communications and concealed their existence until after subscribers initiated the cancellation process to increase the number of consumers on more expensive Copilot-integrated plans,” ACCC Chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said.</p><p>“The Microsoft Office apps included in 365 subscriptions are essential in many people’s lives and given there are limited substitutes to the bundled package, cancelling the subscription is a decision many would not make lightly.”</p><p>“We’re concerned that Microsoft’s communications denied its customers the opportunity to make informed decisions about their subscription options, which included the possibility of retaining all the features of their existing plan without Copilot and at the lower price,” Ms Cass-Gottlieb said.</p><p>“We believe many Microsoft 365 customers would have opted for the Classic plan had they been aware of all the available options.”</p><p>Following the integration of Copilot, the annual subscription price of the Microsoft 365 Personal plan increased by 45 per cent from $109 to $159.

These three pieces of communication are central to the ACCC’s case.</p><p>“We allege that Microsoft’s two emails to existing subscribers and the blog post were false or misleading as they conveyed that consumers had to accept the more expensive Copilot-integrated plans, and that the only other option was to cancel,” Ms Cass-Gottlieb said.</p><p>“All businesses need to provide accurate information about their services and prices. Failure to do so risks breaching the Australian Consumer Law,” Ms Cass-Gottlieb said.</p><p>In establishing its investigation into this matter, the ACCC drew on a significant number of consumer reports, as well as commentary in online forums such as Reddit.

      "content": "<h2>Company worried higher numbers could damage its reputation</h2><p>Amazon strategised about ways to keep the public in the dark over the true extent of its data centres’ water use, a leaked internal document reveals.</p><p>The biggest owner of data centres in the world, Amazon dwarfs competitors Microsoft and Google and is planning a huge increase in capacity as part of a push into artificial intelligence. The Seattle-based company operates hundreds of facilities worldwide, with many more planned despite concerns over how much water is being used to cool them.&nbsp;</p><p>Amazon’s data centres were projected to use 7.7 billion gallons of water a year by 2030,&nbsp; according to the leaked strategy memo, which was circulated within the company in 2022. The $2.4 trillion corporation defends its approach to water usage and has taken steps to improve water efficiency.&nbsp;</p><p>But while Microsoft and Google regularly publish their water consumption, Amazon has <a href=\"https://grist.org/technology/amazon-data-centers-water-positive-energy/#:~:text=Amazon%20said%20in%20its%20most,water%20as%20traditional%20power%20plants.\">never publicly disclosed</a> how much water its giant server farms consume. In the leaked document, Amazon executives warned that transparency was “a one-way door” and advised keeping its projections confidential, even as they feared inviting accusations of a cover-up.&nbsp;</p><p>“Amazon hides its water consumption,” was one hypothetical headline the authors warned of.</p><p>When designing a campaign for water efficiency, Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company’s cloud computing division that oversees its data centres, noted that it would be harder to reach its internal target if its calculations included “secondary” use—water used in generating the electricity to power its data centres, according to the document.</p><p>Instead, Amazon officials opted to use only the relatively smaller figure of primary use, 7.7 billion gallons, when calculating progress towards its target because of “reputational risk”, fearing bad publicity if the full scale of Amazon’s consumption was revealed, the document shows.</p><p>“In environmental science, it is standard practice to include both to more accurately capture the true water cost of data centres,” said Shaolei Ren, associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of California, Riverside.</p><p>Asked about the leaked document, an Amazon spokeswoman, Margaret Callahan, described it as “obsolete” and said it “completely misrepresents Amazon’s current water usage strategy”.</p><p>She said efficiency savings have already been achieved and pointed out that other companies also don’t count secondary water use.&nbsp;</p><p>“A document’s existence doesn’t guarantee its accuracy or finality,” she said. “Meetings often reshape documents or reveal flawed findings or claims.”</p><p>Callahan declined to elaborate on which strategic elements of the document were “obsolete”.&nbsp;</p><p>As US tech companies ride the wave of AI investment and pursue greater heights of computational power, Amazon is building new data centres in some of the world’s driest areas, SourceMaterial and The Guardian <a href=\"https://www.source-material.org/amazon-microsoft-google-trump-data-centres-water-use/\">revealed</a> in April.</p><p>In November 2022, AWS announced a new sustainability campaign, ‘Water Positive’, with a commitment to “return more water than it uses by 2030”.</p><p>The leaked document, titled ‘AWS Water Positive Public Launch’ and dated one month before the launch, sets out the campaign’s strategy. Its authors noted that any increase in Amazon’s projected water use could bring bad publicity if the company missed its target.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Using a higher estimate by including secondary use “would double the size and budget” for the campaign “without addressing meaningful operational, regulatory or reputational risks”, they wrote, adding that there was “no focus from customers or media” on water used for electricity.</p><p>As part of the campaign, Amazon planned water efficiency savings to cut its 7.7 billion-gallon primary consumption to 4.9 billion by 2030 without addressing secondary use. In the meantime, secondary data should only be released if governments demand it, the authors wrote.</p><p>“We may decide to release water volumes in the future,” the document said. “But it’s a one-way door and we should only do so if the lack of data undermines the programme or is required by regulators.”</p><p>Callahan said that “like other corporate water positive programs, we focus on our direct water footprint in line with industry best practices to ensure we’re making the most concentrated impact possible.” AWS had cut water use per kilowatt of electricity by 40 per cent since 2021, she said.&nbsp;</p><p>“It would be better if they could own up to it,” said a current Amazon software developer, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation. “Even if they said it was a low priority, at least that would be honest.”</p><p>The Water Positive campaign only applies to AWS. The wider Amazon group, including the world’s biggest online retail business, has an overall water consumption that is far higher.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2021, Amazon as a whole used about 105 billion gallons, as much as 958,000 US households, which would make for a city bigger than Houston, Texas, the document reveals.</p><p>“The models referenced in this document were preliminary and unvetted,” said Amazon’s Callahan, who declined to provide any alternative figures.</p><blockquote><p>“Amazon hides its water consumption”</p></blockquote><p>The document’s authors advised not to release data about the wider company.&nbsp;</p><p>But they also warned that selective disclosure could lead to accusations of a cover-up. There was&nbsp; “reputational risk of publicly committing to a goal for only a portion of Amazon’s direct water footprint”, they wrote.&nbsp;</p><p>They even suggested negative headlines that might result:&nbsp;“Amazon hides its water consumption behind AWS” and “Amazon disappoints, failing to take full responsibility for water” were among the adverse media stories they hoped to avoid.</p><p>In a sustainability report last month, AWS claimed it had achieved 53 per cent of its Water Positive goal. The division’s plan for reaching the target relies mostly on “water replenishment” projects, some in partnership with Water.org, a non-profit organisation co-founded by actor Matt Damon. The strategy document refers to these projects as “offsets”, describing initiatives like using Amazon computer technology to help utilities prioritise which pipes to fix in order to minimise leaks.&nbsp;</p><p>But of the $109 million AWS planned to spend on offsets, around half would have been spent anyway, either to meet regulatory requirements or because the projects would help AWS operations by making water more available, the document shows. Experts said this amounted to incomplete accounting.&nbsp;</p><p>“Regardless of what sort of offsetting or replenishment you do, it doesn’t necessarily nullify the water footprints of your own operations,” said Tyler Farrow, standards manager at the Alliance for Water Stewardship. “Calling your operations water positive or water neutral is misleading.”</p><p>Amazon’s Callahan said that the “replenishment spending” is voluntary, not a regulatory requirement.&nbsp;</p><p>“We’ve expanded well beyond what was imagined in the document because it’s the right thing to do for the world and for the communities in which we operate,” she said.&nbsp;</p><h2>‘Obfuscate the footprint’</h2><p>Amazon is also engineering industry standards to downplay its water use and avert scrutiny, said Nathan Wangusi, a former water sustainability manager at the company.</p><p>The corporation has funded efforts by non-profit groups The Nature Conservancy and World Resources Institute, alongside LimnoTech, a consultancy, “to create a globally-accepted methodology for quantifying the benefit of watershed restoration projects”.</p><p>Responding to questions from SourceMaterial, all three organisations defended their integrity and independence and said that Amazon had no undue influence on any methodologies they had created.</p><p>“They spend a lot of time creating methodologies that are used to obfuscate the water footprint,” Wangusi said, referring to Amazon.</p><p>Callahan said these efforts were “standard practice” and that Amazon’s “customers expect us to hold ourselves accountable to credible guidance and best practices”.</p><p>As well as choosing not to disclose water use from electricity generation, Amazon has estimated its larger “indirect” water footprint, the document shows. This extra usage, which falls under a classification known as “scope 3”, includes water for production and construction—in Amazon’s case, mostly irrigation of cotton plantations supplying its fashion brands, and vegetables for its grocery arm, Amazon Fresh.</p><p>Here too, Amazon decided to keep its consumption confidential, even though “indirect water use represents roughly 90 per cent of Amazon’s total water footprint”, according to the document.&nbsp;</p><p>AWS avoided establishing targets for indirect water use because that figure would be “much more significant for the rest of Amazon, especially in the agricultural supply chain, and the team does not want to establish a standard for addressing scope 3 water use that the rest of Amazon would need to follow, given the larger resource implications”, the authors wrote.</p><p>“You don’t need to obscure or obfuscate,” said Wangusi, who believes he was “hounded out” of Amazon for criticising the company’s approach. (Amazon declined to comment on his departure.)&nbsp;</p><p>“It doesn’t make you more profitable,” he said. “It makes you less trustworthy.”</p><p><em>Headline picture: StockPhotoAstur / Shutterstock.com</em></p>",

In his view, the world corrupts\nus. We begin pure and only fail because society, obligation, or expectation\npulls us away from who we truly are.</p><p>Benjamin Franklin saw it differently. For him there was no such thing as a good\nperson or a bad person, only people who do good things and people who do bad\nthings. Virtue was a habit, not an essence.</p><p>Modern America carries both of these ideas, switching between them whenever\nconvenient. We invoke Rousseau when we need forgiveness: I meant well. We\ninvoke Franklin when we need accountability: Show me what you’ve done. It’s an\nalmost entirely incompatible pair of philosophies that coexist perfectly in\npractice because they’re both so flattering — one to our intentions, the other\nto our ambition.</p><p>But only one of them scales.</p><p>“Fake it until you make it” is often dismissed as shallow, but it’s closer to\nFranklin’s truth. Faking it long enough is making it. The repetition of\nbehavior, not the sincerity of belief, is what shapes character. You become the\nkind of person who does the things you repeatedly do.</p><p>Rousseau invites endless introspection. Franklin invites progress. The first is\nabout how you feel; the second is about what you build.</p><p>I find the Franklin model far more useful. Not because it’s truer in some\ncosmic sense, but because it gives you agency. You can’t always change how you\nfeel, but you can always decide what to do next.</p><p>“It doesn’t take great men to do things, but it is doing things that make men\ngreat.” — Arnold Glasow</p>",

What should be in there?”</p><p>This is what comes to mind:</p><pre><code></code></pre><p>Without , browsers may switch to quirks mode, emulating legacy, pre-standards behavior. This will change how calculations work around layout, sizing, and alignment.</p><p> is what you want for consistent rendering. Or  if you prefer writing markup like it’s 1998. Or even  if you eschew all societal norms. It’s case-insensitive so they’ll all work.</p><p>Declare the document’s language. Browsers, search engines, assistive technologies, etc. can leverage it to:</p><ul><li>Get pronunciation and voice right for screen readers</li><li>Improve indexing and translation accuracy</li><li>Apply locale-specific tools (e.g. spell-checking)</li></ul><p>Omit it and things will  ok, but lots of basic web-adjacent tools might get things wrong. Specifying it makes everything  the HTML work better and more accurately, so I always try to remember to include it.</p><p>This piece of info can come back from the server as a header, e.g.</p><pre><code>(\n    ,\n    {\n        : ,\n        : { :  },\n    }\n);\n</code></pre><p>But I like to set it in my HTML, especially when I’m making files on disk I open manually in the browser.</p><p>This tells the browser how to interpret text, ensuring characters like é, ü, and others display correctly.</p><p>So many times I’ve opened a document without this tag and things just don’t look right — like my <a href=\"https://smartquotesforsmartpeople.com\">smart quotes</a>.</p><p>For example: copy this snippet, stick it in an HTML file, and open it on your computer:</p><pre><code>Without meta utf-8Smart quotes“” and ‘’Symbols©, ™, ®, etc.Ellipsis…Emojis👍Non-latin charactersé, ñ, etc.</code></pre><p>Things might look a bit wonky. But stick a  tag in there and you’ll find some relief.</p><pre><code></code></pre><p>Sometimes I’ll quickly prototype a little HTML and think, “Great it’s working as I expect!” Then I go open it on mobile and everything looks tiny — “[Facepalm] you forgot the meta viewport tag!”</p><p>Take a look at this screenshot, where I forgot the meta viewport tag on the left but included it on the right:</p><p>That ever happen to you? No, just me? Well anyway, it’s a good ‘un to include to make HTML work the way you expect.</p><p>I know what you’re thinking, I forgot the most important snippet of them all for writing HTML:</p><pre><code></code></pre>",

It’s the latest move in the agency’s ongoing quest to build out a social media surveillance dragnet.</p><p>The five-year contract with government technology middleman Carahsoft Technology, made public in September, provides Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) licenses for a product called Zignal Labs, a social media monitoring platform used by the Israeli military and the Pentagon.</p><p>An informational pamphlet&nbsp;marked <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26194326-2025-zignal-executive-summary/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">confidential</a> but publicly available online advertises that Zignal Labs “leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning” to analyze over eight billion social media posts per day, providing “curated detection feeds” for its clients. The information, the company <a href=\"https://www.carahsoft.com/news/zignal-labs-and-carahsoft-partner-to-deliver-next-generation-osint-platform-to-government-and-defense-agencies-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">says</a>, allows law enforcement to “detect and respond to threats with greater clarity and speed.”</p><p>The Department of Homeland Security, ICE’s parent agency, has in the past procured Zignal licenses for the US Secret Service, signing its first <a href=\"https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_70US0919C70090051_7009_-NONE-_-NONE-\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">contract</a>&nbsp;for the software in 2019. The company also has contracts with the Department of Defense and the Department of Transportation.</p><p>But the September notice appears to be the first indication that ICE has access to the platform. The licenses will be provided to Homeland Security Investigations, ICE’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2025/06/20/mahmoud-khalil-homeland-security-investigations-ice-surveillance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">intelligence unit</a>, to provide “real-time data analysis for criminal investigations,” per the disclosure.</p><p>Zignal joins ICE’s growing arsenal of social media surveillance tools, many of which employ artificial intelligence to generate leads and identify “threats” from vast quantities of online data. These tools pose a particular threat as ICE, under the Trump administration, appears to be increasingly using social media to direct its immigration enforcement strategy.</p><p>Several pro-Palestinian activists, including Mahmoud Khalil, were targeted and jailed by immigration authorities&nbsp;after being <a href=\"https://ccrjustice.org/home/press-center/press-releases/mahmoud-khalil-demands-info-trump-administration-collusion-anti\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">doxed</a> online by right-wing, pro-Israel blacklist websites like <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/11/canary-mission-how-us-uses-a-hate-group-to-target-palestine-advocates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Canary Mission</a>. Just this week, immigration agents raided street vendors in New York City after a&nbsp;right-wing <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/21/nyregion/nyc-raid-canal-st-agents-ice.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">influencer</a>&nbsp;posted a video of the block online, demanding action by authorities.</p><p>Last week, a&nbsp;group of <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/document/uaw-v-dos-complaint\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">labor unions</a>&nbsp;sued over the federal government’s growing use of social media surveillance to target immigrants for their political speech, calling it a “mass, viewpoint-driven surveillance program.”</p><p>And there are indications that ICE intends to further expand its social media surveillance capabilities. As&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/ice-social-media-surveillance-24-7-contract/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">reported</a> earlier this month, ICE has plans to develop a round-the-clock social media monitoring team to identify leads for immigration enforcers.</p><p>Advocates told&nbsp;that ICE’s purchase of Zignal Labs licenses, like its other uses of digital surveillance tech, raises civil liberty concerns.</p><p>“[The Department of Homeland Security] should not be buying surveillance tools that scrape our social media posts off the internet and then use AI to scrutinize our online speech,” said Patrick Toomey, the deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s National Security Project. “And agencies certainly shouldn’t be deploying this kind of black box technology in secret without any accountability.”</p></section><section><p>Zignal Labs, founded in Silicon Valley in 2011, initially&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.prweek.com/article/1364900/josh-ginsberg-innovation-50\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">catered to</a>&nbsp;public relations firms and political campaigns, advertising data analytics and media monitoring to help identify and respond to narrative trends online.</p><p>But like the many private companies that now provide digital surveillance tools to the federal government, Zignal Labs soon moved into the defense and intelligence industries,&nbsp;formally announcing the <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/10/07/2310442/0/en/Zignal-Labs-Announces-Public-Sector-Advisory-Board-with-Top-National-Security-Experts.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">new focus</a>, along with a “public sector advisory board” staffed by industry veterans, in 2021. One&nbsp;Zignal <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26194326-2025-zignal-executive-summary/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">pamphlet</a> from this year advertises the company’s work with the Israeli military, saying its data analytics platform provides “tactical intelligence” to “operators on the ground” in Gaza. The pamphlet also highlights Zignal’s work with the US Marines and the State Department.</p><p>Zignal Labs did not return a request for comment about its work with Israeli forces or its new contract with ICE.</p><p>The unions’ lawsuit over the Trump administration’s use of social media surveillance details the myriad digital surveillance tools that ICE already has at its disposal, including ShadowDragon, a software that uses publicly available websites to map out an&nbsp;individual’s <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/the-200-sites-an-ice-surveillance-contractor-is-monitoring/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">online activity</a>, and Babel X, which&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/dhs-uses-ai-tool-babel-x-babel-street-social-media-citizens-refugees/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">links</a> social media profiles&nbsp;and location information to a target’s Social Security number.</p><p>“We’ve been seeing an uptick in ICE surveillance contracts,” said Julie Mao, an attorney with Just Futures Law, a legal advocacy group that closely monitors ICE’s surveillance regime.</p><p>This week, ICE&nbsp;signed a $7 million <a href=\"https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_70CDCR26C00000001_7012_-NONE-_-NONE-\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">contract</a>&nbsp;with the firm SOS International LLC, for “skip tracing services,” a term that refers to tracking a person’s whereabouts, per federal procurement records reviewed by&nbsp;. The multimillion-dollar contract comes just three months after SOS International LLC, which also does business as SOSi, announced that the company had&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sosi.com/press-releases/sosi-hires-former-hsi-executive-andre-watson-to-bolster-law-enforcement-partnerships/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">hired</a> Andre Watson, an ICE Homeland Security Investigations intelligence chief, to “expand [the company’s] business and deliver capabilities to state and federal law enforcement agencies.”</p><p>Many of these services tout that their surveillance capabilities are enhanced by artificial intelligence, including Zignal. In a July post&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.carahsoft.com/news/zignal-labs-and-carahsoft-partner-to-deliver-next-generation-osint-platform-to-government-and-defense-agencies-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">announcing</a>&nbsp;the latter company’s partnership with Carahsoft Technology, Zignal’s CEO boasted that the latest iteration of the software used AI to scour global digital data, “helping defense and intelligence teams detect and respond to threats with greater clarity and speed.” Two months after this announcement, ICE signed its new contract with Carahsoft for Zignal licenses.</p><p>ICE’s use of AI to surveil vast swathes of the internet in real time presents serious privacy and free speech concerns, the labor unions argued in their lawsuit against the Trump administration.</p><p>“The government’s utilization of AI and automated tools for viewpoint-driven online surveillance gives teeth to its threat to surveil ‘everyone’ online for disfavored expression,” attorneys with the civil liberties group the Electronic Freedom Foundation and Yale Law School’s Media Freedom and Information Access Clinic wrote in the complaint, saying that such tools “exacerbate the chilling impact of that surveillance.”</p></section>",

      "content": "<p>I’ve been watching the <a href=\"https://ziglang.org/\">Zig</a> language for a while now, given that it was created for\nwriting audio software (low-level, no allocations, real time). I never paid too much attention though,\nit seemed a little weird to me and I didn’t see the real need. Then I saw a post from <a href=\"https://github.com/andrewrk\">Andrew Kelley</a>\n(creator of the language) on Hacker News, about how he reimplemented my Chromaprint algorithm in Zig, and that got me really interested.</p><p>I’ve been planning to rewrite AcoustID’s inverted index for a long time, I had a couple of prototypes, but none of the approaches felt right.\nI was going through some rough times, wanted to learn something new, so I decided to use the project as an opportunity to learn Zig.\nAnd it was great, writing Zig is a joy. The new version was faster and more scalable than the previous C++ one.\nI was happy, until I wanted to add a server interface.</p><p>In the previous C++ version, I used <a href=\"https://www.qt.io/\">Qt</a>, which might seem very strange for a server software, but I wanted a\nnice way of doing asynchronous I/O and Qt allowed me to do that. It was callback-based, but Qt has a lot of support for\nmaking callbacks usable. In the newer prototypes, I used Go, specifically for the ease of networking and concurrency.\nWith Zig, I was stuck. There are some Zig HTTP servers, so I could use those. I wanted to implement my legacy TCP server as well,\nand that’s a lot harder, unless I want to spawn a lot of threads. Then I made a crazy decision, to use Zig also for implementing\na clustered layer on top of my server, using NATS as a messaging system, so I wrote a <a href=\"https://github.com/lalinsky/nats.zig\">Zig NATS client</a>,\nand that gave me a lot of experience with Zig’s networking capabilities.</p><p>Fast forward to today, I’m happy to introduce <a href=\"https://github.com/lalinsky/zio\">Zio, an asynchronous I/O and concurrency library for Zig</a>.\nIf you look at the examples, you will not really see where is the asynchronous I/O, but it’s there, in the background and that’s\nthe point. Writing asynchronous code with callbacks is a pain. Not only that, it requires a lot of allocations, because you need\nstate to survive across callbacks. Zio is an implementation of Go style concurrency, but limited to what’s possible in Zig.\nZio tasks are stackful coroutines with fixed-size stacks. When you run , this will initiate the I/O operation in the background\nand then suspend the current task until the I/O operation is done. When it’s done, the task will be resumed, and the result will be returned.\nThat gives you the illusion of synchronous code, allowing for much simpler state management.</p><p>Zio support fully asynchronous network and file I/O, has synchronization primitives (mutexes, condition variables, etc.) that work with the cooperative runtime,\nhas Go-style channels, OS signal watches and more. Tasks can run in single-threaded mode, or multi-threaded, in which case they can migrate from thread to thread\nfor lower latency and better load balancing.</p><p>And it’s FAST. I don’t want to be posting benchmarks here, maybe later when I have more complex ones, but the single-threaded mode is beating any framework I’ve tried so far.\nIt’s much faster than both Go and Rust’s Tokio. Context switching is virtually free, comparable to a function call. The multi-threaded mode,\nwhile still not being as robust as Go/Tokio, has comparable performance. It’s still a bit faster than either of them, but that performance\nmight go down as I add more fairness features.</p><p>Because it implements the standard interfaces for reader/writer, you can actually use external libraries that are unaware they are running within Zio. Here is an example of a HTTP server:</p><div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div></div><p>When I started working with Zig, I really thought it’s going to be a niche language to write the fast code in, and then I’ll need a layer on top of\nthat in a different language. With Zio, that changed. The next step for me is to update my NATS client to use Zio internally. And after that,\nI’m going to work on a HTTP client/server library based on Zio.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Hi HN, I’m Dvir, a young developer. Last year, I got rejected after a job interview because I lacked some CPU knowledge. After that, I decided to deepen my understanding in the low level world and learn how things work under the hood. I decided to try and create an OS in C and ASM as a way to broaden my knowledge in this area.</p><p>This took me on the most interesting ride, where I’ve learned about OS theory and low level programming on a whole new level.  I’ve spent hours upon hours, blood and tears, reading different OS theory blogs, learning low level concepts, debugging, testing and working on this project.</p><p>This part was the longest, but also the easiest. I felt like I understood the theory, but still could not connect it into actual code. Sitting down and starting to code was difficult, but I knew that was the next step I needed to  take! \nI began by working on the bootloader, which is optional since you can use a pre-made one (I switched to GRUB later), but implementing it was mainly for learning purposes and to warm up on ASM. These were my steps after that:</p><pre><code>  1) I started implementing the VGA driver, which gave me the ability to display text.\n  2) Interrupts - IDT, ISR, IRQ, which signal to the CPU that a certain event occurred and needs handling (such as faults, hardware connected device actions, etc).\n  3) Keyboard driver, which enables me to display the same text I type on my keyboard.\n  4) PMM (Physical memory management)\n  5) Paging and virtual memory management\n  6) RTC driver - clock addition (which was, in my opinion, optional)\n  7) PIT driver - Ticks every certain amount of time, and also  \n  8) FS (File System) and physical HDD drivers - for the HDD I chose PATA (HDD communication protocol) for simplicity (SATA is a newer but harder option as well).\n     For the FS I chose EXT2 (The Second Extended FileSystem), which is a foundational linux FS structure introduced in 1993. This FS structure is not the simplest,\n     but is very popular in hobby-OS, it is very supported, easy to set up and upgrade to newer EXT versions, it has a lot of materials online, compared to other\n     options. This was probably the longest and largest feature I had worked on.\n  9) Syscall support.\n  10) Libc implementation.\n  11) Processing and scheduling for multiprocessing.\n  12) Here I also made a shell to test it all.\n</code></pre>\nAt this point, I had a working shell, but later decided to go further and add a GUI! I was working on the FS (stage 8), when I heard about Hack Club’s Summer of Making (SoM). This was my first time practicing in HackClub, and I want to express my gratitude and share my enjoyment of participating in it.<p>At first I just wanted to declare the OS as finished after completing the FS, and a bit of other drivers, but because of SoM my perspective was changed completely. Because of the competition, I started to think that I needed to ship a complete OS, with processing, GUI and the bare minimum ability to run Doom. I wanted to show the community in SoM how everything works.</p><p>Then I worked on it for another 2 months, after finishing the shell, just because of SoM!,  totalling my project to almost 7 months of work. At this time I added full GUI support, with dirty rectangles and double buffering, I made a GUI mouse driver, and even made a full Doom port! things I would've never even thought about without participating in SoM.</p><p>Every project has challenges, especially in such a low level project. I had to do a lot of debugging while working on this, and it is no easy task. I highly recommend using GDB which helped me debug so many of my problems, especially memory ones.</p><p>The first major challenge I encountered was during the coding of processes - I realized that a lot of my paging code was completely wrong, poorly tested, and had to be reworked. During this time I was already in the competition and it was difficult keeping up with devlogs and new features while fixing old problems in a code I wrote a few months ago.</p><p>Some more major problems occurred when trying to run Doom, and unlike the last problem, this was a disaster. I had random PFs and memory problems, one run could work while the next one wouldn’t, and the worst part is that it was only on the Doom, and not on processes I created myself. These issues took a lot of time to figure out. I began to question the Doom code itself, and even thought about giving up on the whole project.</p><p>After a lot of time spent debugging, I fixed the issues. It was a combination of scheduling issues, Libc issues and the Qemu not having enough (wrongfully assuming 128MB for the whole OS was enough).</p><p>Finally, I worked throughout all the difficulties, and shipped the project! In the end, the experience working on this project was amazing. I learned a lot, grew and improved as a developer, and I thank SoM for helping to increase my motivation and make the project memorable and unique like I never imagined it would be.</p>",

Lots of manual searching, opening windows &amp; tabs, scrolling, and ultimately copying &amp; pasting into a document editor.</p><p>Surf is a desktop app meant for simultaneous research and thinking to minimize the grunt work. It’s made of two parts:</p><p>1) A multi-media library where you can save and organize files and webpages into collections called Notebooks.</p><p>2) A LLM-powered smart document which you can auto-generate using the context from any stored page, tab or entire notebook. This document contains deep links back to the source material — like a page of a PDF or timestamp in a YouTube video. Unlike Deep Research products (or NotebookLMs chat) the entire thing is editable. The user also stays in the loop.</p><p>With a technology like AI, context / data is proving to be king. We think it should stay under the user’s control, with minimal lock in: where you can own &amp; export, and plug &amp; play with different models. That’s why Surf is:</p><p>- Open Source on GitHub\n- Open (&amp; Local Data): the data saved in Surf is stored on your local machine in open and accessible formats and mostly works offline.\n- Open Model Choice: you can choose which models you use with Surf, and can add custom &amp; Local LLMs</p><p>Early users include students &amp; researchers who are learning and doing thematic research using Surf.</p>",

      "content": "Personally, I think the JJ VCS (<a href=\"https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj</a>) hit a point some time in this past year where I find it hard to find a great reason to continue using git. Over the years I've cobbled together aliases and bash functions to try to improve my git workflow, but after using jj, which works with ~any git repo and integrates great with Github repos, all of the workflow issues I ran into with git are not only solved, but improved in ways I couldn't manage with simple scripts.<p>One example is the op log, which lets you go to any point in your repo's time and provides simple undo and redo commands when you want to back out of a merge, didn't mean to rebase, etc.</p><p>Because I have a pretty strong conviction that JJ is at this point a cleaner and more powerful version of git, my hopes are that it continues to grow. With that, it seemed a proper full-featured GUI was missing for the VCS. There's some plugins that add some integration into VS Code, and there's one in the works to get Intellij support working, but many of the constructs JJ provides in my opinion necessitate a grounds-up build of a GUI around how JJ works.</p><p>Right now, [name-redacted] is an MVP in an open beta. I did my best to support all of the core functionality one would need, though there's many nice-to-haves that I am going to add, like native merge support, native splitting, etc. Most of this will be based on feedback from the Beta.</p><p>I'm really grateful for the great community JJ has built, alongside the HN community itself in the countless VCS-based posts I've read over the years, and am hoping for lots of input here during Beta under real usage - the goal is to be a full-featured desktop GUI for the VCS, similar to many of the great products that are out there for git.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Hey HN! I’ve recently open-sourced Pyversity, a lightweight library for diversifying retrieval results. Most retrieval systems optimize only for relevance, which can lead to top-k results that look almost identical. Pyversity efficiently re-ranks results to balance relevance and diversity, surfacing items that remain relevant but are less redundant. This helps with improving retrieval, recommendation, and RAG pipelines without adding latency or complexity.</p><p>- Unified API: one function (diversify) supporting several well-known strategies: MMR, MSD, DPP, and COVER (with more to come)</p><p>- Lightweight: the only dependency is NumPy, keeping the package small and easy to install</p><p>- Fast: efficient implementations for all supported strategies; diversify results in milliseconds</p><p>Re-ranking with cross-encoders is very popular right now, but also very expensive. From my experience, you can usually improve retrieval results with simpler and faster methods, such as the ones implemented in this package. This helps retrieval, recommendation, and RAG systems present richer, more informative results by ensuring each new item adds new information.</p><p>Code and docs: github.com/pringled/pyversity</p><p>Let me know if you have any feedback, or suggestions for other diversification strategies to support!</p>",

Born from frustration with complex traditional NMS tools like Zabbix, it bridges legacy (SNMP/syslog) and modern (gNMI, OTLP) protocols for cloud-native environments.</p><p>We built ServiceRadar to simplify monitoring hybrid telecom networks, evolving it into a Kubernetes-native solution with Helm and Docker support. It uses mTLS with SPIFFE/SPIRE, NATS JetStream for event streaming (90M+ EPS), and SRQL for intuitive queries. Integrated with OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, and CloudEvents, it fills the network visibility gap in CNCF’s application-focused observability stack.</p><p>We’re seeking early adopters to try our demo or deploy locally—no sign-up needed. Feedback on usability or contributions for new protocols would be awesome.</p><p>Quick Start: helm install serviceradar carverauto/serviceradar or docker compose up -d</p><p>Join our Discord or use GitHub Issues to share thoughts.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Hi HN! I'm Nick from Inkeep. We built an agent builder with true 2-way sync between code and a drag-and-drop visual editor, so devs and non-devs can collaborate on the same agents. Here’s a demo video: <a href=\"https://go.inkeep.com/video\">https://go.inkeep.com/video</a>.</p><p>As a developer, the flow is:\n1) Build AI Chat Assistants or AI Workflows with the TypeScript SDK 2) Run `inkeep push` from your CLI to publish 3)Edit agents in the visual builder (or hand off to non-technical teams) 4) Run `inkeep pull to edit in code again.</p><p>We built this because we wanted the accessibility of no-code workflow builders (n8n, Zapier), but the flexibility and devex of code-based agent frameworks (LangGraph, Mastra). We also wanted first-class support for chat assistants with interactive UIs, not just workflows. OpenAI got close, but you can only do a one-time export from visual builder to code and there’s vendor lock-in.</p><p>How I've used it: I bootstrapped a few agents for our marketing and sales teams, then was able to hand off so they can maintain and create their own agents. This has enabled us to adopt agents across technical and non-technical roles in our company on a single platform.</p><p>We leaned on open protocols to make it easy to use agents anywhere:\nAn MCP endpoint, so agents can be used from Cursor/Claude/ChatGPT\nA Chat UI library with interactive elements you can customize in React\nAn API endpoint compatible with the Vercel AI SDK `useChat` hook\nSupport for Agent2Agent (A2A) so they work with other agent ecosystems</p><p>We made some practical templates like a customer_support, deep_research, and docs_assistant. Deployment is easy with Vercel/Docker with a fair-code license and there's a traces UI and OTEL logs for observability.</p><p>Under the hood, we went all-in on a multi-agent architecture. Agents are made up of LLMs, MCPs, and agent-to-agent relationships. We’ve found this approach to be easier to maintain and more flexible than traditional “if/else” approaches for complex workflows.</p><p>The interoperability works because the SDK and visual builder share a common underlying representation, and the Inkeep CLI bridges it with a mix of LLMs and TypeScript syntactic sugar. Details in our docs: <a href=\"https://docs.inkeep.com\">https://docs.inkeep.com</a>.</p><p>We’re open to ideas and contributions! And would love to hear about your experience building agents - what works, hasn’t worked, what’s promising?</p>",
