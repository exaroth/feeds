It showed you can get grotty even in the Hilton Hotel if you don’t clean it. Everything starts to get tacky, even in the most streamlined surfaces.”</p><p>“When we did ,” said O’Bannon, “which was in the wake of , we thought we wanted -partly for the novelty, partly because it was realer, mostly just for laughs- we wanted to show this once-sterile spaceship in a rundown condition, like some old bachelor apartment.” For O’Bannon, ‘s ‘used universe’ was not as strong a visual element as he had hoped, and &nbsp;“didn’t come across all that clearly either.” For , O’Bannon instructed Ridley Scott that “if we want this spacecraft to look industrial [and] beat-up, you’re gonna have to make it about three times messier to the naked eye than you wanna to see it. And  probably was the first time where an audience clearly saw a futuristic machine in a run-down condition.”</p><p>The design of the Nostromo and the ‘used universe’ aesthetic would be drawn from&nbsp;O’Bannon’s earlier sci-fi effort, coupled with the realism of Kubrick’s Discovery One. “It’s futuristic,” Scott said of Kubrick’s approach to , “but it’s still hung on today’s reality … In two hundred years things won’t change that much, you know. People will still be scruffy or clean. They’ll still clean their teeth three times a day.” Though&nbsp;&nbsp;itself utilised a used universe (or, as Akira Kurosawa called it, a “maculate reality”), Scott wanted to create a tangible reality opposed to&nbsp;‘ fantasy-hinged settings and ships. “I wanted to do the truck driver version, the hard-nosed version,” said Scott. “It was supposed to be the anti-thesis of&nbsp;. The reality, the beauty of something absolutely about function.”</p><p>Before Scott came onto the project as director, writer Dan O’Bannon&nbsp;commissioned&nbsp;his friend and  spaceship designer Ron Cobb to draw what his script was then calling the ‘deep space commercial vessel Snark’ – a nod to Lewis Carroll’s . O’Bannon had promised Cobb a job on Alejandro Jodorowsky’s , but when that film dissolved Cobb, who had terminated the lease on his home and prepared to move to Paris with his wife, was left standing empty-handed. To make up for the letdown, O’Bannon immediately hired Cobb for  which allowed the artist to bounce back from a slump. “He was paid about $400 a week,” Cobb’s wife, Robin Love, told the LA Times in 1988. “We thought it was wonderful!”</p><blockquote><p>: “I&nbsp;was working on my first sci-fi film, John Carpenter’s&nbsp;, which would ultimately metastastize into the feature-length&nbsp;. I tried to reach Cobb to get him to design the whole film, but he was unreachable. For weeks his phone rang without an answer, and then it was disconnected, and then I got his new unlisted number but it was invariably answered by one of the girls who were living with him, who always told me he was out. It was impossible. It took another year and a half to track him down and get him to agree to design us a nice, simple little spaceship for our simple little movie.&nbsp;Finally, one night about ten pm, Carpenter and I drove over to Westwood and rousted him out of a sound sleep. He was hung over from an LSD trip and I felt kind of guilty, but I had to have those designs. We took him over to an all-night coffee shop and fed him and got him half-way awake, and then he brought out this pad of yellow graph paper on which he had sketched a 3-view plan of our spaceship. It was wonderful! A little surfboard-shaped starcruiser with a flat bottom for atmospheric landings. Very technological looking. Very high class stuff.”</p></blockquote><p>“The first person I hired on&nbsp;, the first person to draw money, was Cobb,” O’Bannon said. “He started turning out renderings, large full-colour paintings, while Shusett and I were still struggling with the script – the corrosive blood of the Alien was Cobb’s idea. It was an intensely creative period – the economic desperation, the all-night sessions, the rushing over to Cobb’s apartment to see the latest painting-in-progress and give him the latest pages.”</p><blockquote><p>“I just sat down and started blocking out a ship – which I love to do. Anyway, Dan’s original script called for a small, modest little ship with a small crew. They land on a small planet. They go down a small pyramid and shake up a medium-sized creature. That’s about it. He meant it to be a low budget film, like&nbsp;, and I loved the idea. So I did a few paintings and Dan scurried off with them and a script.”\n~ Ron Cobb</p></blockquote><p>“And he was doing some incredible stuff,” continued O’Bannon. “Wow! I was really happy during this period, seeing the movie appear under Cobb’s fingers. Of course, we usually had to go over and sit on his back to get him to do any work -otherwise he would just party on with his friends- but how beautiful were the results.”</p><div data-shortcode=\"caption\"><a href=\"https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/cobbpic58.gif\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-541\" data-attachment-id=\"541\" data-permalink=\"https://alienseries.wordpress.com/2012/10/23/space-truckin-the-nostromo/cobbpic58/\" data-orig-file=\"https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/cobbpic58.gif\" data-orig-size=\"429,360\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"cobbpic58\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"<p>One of Cobb&amp;#8217;s early Snark designs.</p>\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/cobbpic58.gif?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/cobbpic58.gif?w=429\" src=\"https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/cobbpic58.gif?w=386&amp;h=324\" alt=\"\" width=\"386\" height=\"324\" srcset=\"https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/cobbpic58.gif?w=386&amp;h=324 386w, https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/cobbpic58.gif?w=150&amp;h=126 150w, https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/cobbpic58.gif?w=300&amp;h=252 300w, https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/cobbpic58.gif 429w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 386px) 100vw, 386px\"></a><p>One of Cobb’s early Snark designs.</p></div><p>Coupled with Cobb was English artist, Chris Foss, who O’Bannon had come to know during their tenure together on Alejandro Jodorowsky’s . “Alejandro wanted Doug Trumble to do the special effects [for ],” Foss told MTV in 2011, “and of course, Trumble was a big important American, and certainly wouldn’t succumb to Alejandro’s manipulation. So he picked up this gauche American film student, Dan O’Bannon.

Jodorowsky had gathered together Chris Foss, Jean ‘Moebius’ Giraud, and HR Giger to design his film, and the eclectic team would be later reunited by O’Bannon to design his grungy sci-fi horror movie. “Dan said [to Twentieth Century Fox], ‘Hey, we’ve got to get this guy Chris Foss over here.’ So off I went to Los Angeles …</p><div data-shortcode=\"caption\"><a href=\"https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/foss13.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2272\" data-attachment-id=\"2272\" data-permalink=\"https://alienseries.wordpress.com/2012/10/23/space-truckin-the-nostromo/foss13/\" data-orig-file=\"https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/foss13.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"479,373\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"foss13\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"<p>A sketch of the temporarily named Leviathan, by Chris Foss.</p>\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/foss13.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/foss13.jpg?w=479\" src=\"https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/foss13.jpg?w=383&amp;h=298\" alt=\"A sketch of the temporarily named Leviathan, by Chris Foss.\" width=\"383\" height=\"298\" srcset=\"https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/foss13.jpg?w=383&amp;h=298 383w, https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/foss13.jpg?w=150&amp;h=117 150w, https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/foss13.jpg?w=300&amp;h=234 300w, https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/foss13.jpg 479w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px\"></a><p>A sketch of the temporarily named Leviathan, by Chris Foss.</p></div><div data-shortcode=\"caption\"><a href=\"https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/foss-fountain-line.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2273\" data-attachment-id=\"2273\" data-permalink=\"https://alienseries.wordpress.com/2012/10/23/space-truckin-the-nostromo/foss-fountain-line/\" data-orig-file=\"https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/foss-fountain-line.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"555,445\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Foss Fountain Line\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"<p>Another Foss sketch.

The nose and wings of the ship resemble those of the final design.</p></div><p>The early stages of designing  were done in an almost ramshackle, low-fi manner. “We were put through shed after shed after shed,” said Foss of the times, “and they were going through director after director after director.” Ron Cobb told Den of Geek: “I soon found myself hidden away at Fox Studios in an old rehearsal hall above an even older sound stage with Chris Foss and O’Bannon, trying to visualize . For up to five months Chris and I (with Dan supervising) turned out a large amount of artwork, while the producers, Gordon Carroll, Walter Hill and David Giler, looked for a director.”</p><p>Foss was largely critical of Brandywine’s apparently disinterested approach to setting up the embryonic film. “Walter Hill was very busy smashing cars up for one of his ‘streets’ films,” he told Den of Geek. “He couldn’t be arsed – much too busy! He walked in after months of work and just said, ‘Yep, roomful of spaceships’ and just walked out again.”</p><blockquote><p><strong>Ron Cobb, Steven Speilberg, and aliens:</strong>&nbsp;Cobb told bttf.com: “I first met Speilberg when I was working on&nbsp;, at one point Speilberg was considered as a possible director for the original&nbsp;. It was just a brief thing, he could never work out his schedule to do it, but he was interested.” Later, one of Cobb’s early story pitches to Speilberg, an alien horror tale called&nbsp;, eventually became 1982’s&nbsp;Though Cobb&nbsp;cameo’d&nbsp;as one of .’s doctors (“I got to carry the little critter,”) he wasn’t pleased with the family-friendly direction that the film took from his initial idea:&nbsp;“A banal retelling of the Christ story,” he told the LA Times. “Sentimental and self-indulgent, a pathetic lost-puppy kind of story.” Luckily for the artist, a clause in his contract for . (he was&nbsp;originally&nbsp;to direct before the story took a turn) detailed that he was to earn 1% of the net profit. His first cheque amounted to $400,000. Cobb’s wife quipped: “friends from Australia always ask, ‘What did you do on .?’ And Ron says, ‘I didn’t direct it.'”</p></blockquote><p>When Ridley Scott took over the directorial duties, Cobb and Foss were shipped to England to continue their work. Around this point in time, HR Giger was drawing up the film’s alien, and Moebius was&nbsp;commissioned&nbsp;by Scott to design the film’s space suits, which would be brought into reality by John Mollo. The Snark went through a variety of designs, from a ship embedded in the rock of an asteroid, to an upended pyramidal design, to a hammerhead shape and other varieties of ship with white or yellow or more kaleidoscopic paint-jobs.</p><div data-shortcode=\"caption\"><a href=\"https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/cobbpic55.gif\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-556\" data-attachment-id=\"556\" data-permalink=\"https://alienseries.wordpress.com/2012/10/23/space-truckin-the-nostromo/cobbpic55/\" data-orig-file=\"https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/cobbpic55.gif\" data-orig-size=\"479,360\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"cobbpic55\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"<p>One of the more unusual designs. &amp;#8220;Fanciful Nasa.&amp;#8221; By Ron Cobb.</p>\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/cobbpic55.gif?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/cobbpic55.gif?w=479\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"\" src=\"https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/cobbpic55.gif?w=500\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/cobbpic55.gif 479w, https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/cobbpic55.gif?w=150&amp;h=113 150w, https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/cobbpic55.gif?w=300&amp;h=225 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 479px) 100vw, 479px\"></a><p>One of the more unusual designs. “Fanciful Nasa.” By Ron Cobb.</p></div><p>After many months of scribbling and painting spaceships, the production was no closer to settling what the vessel would actually look like. Due to script rewrites, it also changed names, from Snark to&nbsp;Leviathan before the name Nostromo was settled on. “I called the ship Nostromo from [Joseph] Conrad,” Walter Hill told Film International in 2004, “[For] no particular metaphoric idea, I just thought it sounded good.”</p><p>However, indecision was still rife on the actual look of the thing.</p><blockquote><p>: “He’s great. A really sweet guy. And, I was soon to realise, a real science-fiction freak … &nbsp;He brought in a book by the Swiss artist HR Giger. It’s called Necronomicon … I thought, ‘If we can build that [], that’s it.’ I was stunned, really. I flipped. Literally flipped. And O’Bannon lit up like a lightbulb, shining like a quartz iodine. I realised I was dealing with a real SF freak, which I’d never come across before. I thought, ‘My god, I have an egg-head here for this field.'”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p> “O’Bannon introduced me to Ron Cobb, a brilliant visualiser of the genre, with whom he’d worked on . Cobb seemed to have very realistic visions of both the far and near future, so I quickly decided that he would take a very important part in the making of the film.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>: “Creating spacecraft exteriors came easily to Foss. His mind and imagination seemed to embody the entire history of the industrial revolution. He could conjure up endless spacecraft designs suggesting submarines, diesel locomotives, Mayan interceptors, Mississippi river boats, jumbo space arks, but best of all (ask Dan) were his trademark aero-spacecraft-textures like panels, cowlings, antennae, bulging fuel tanks, vents, graphics etc. As the months passed, along with two or three temporary directors, Chris began to have problems caused by his spectacular creativity. No one in a position to make a decision seemed to be able to make up their mind and/or choose one of his designs. I think Chris was turning out spacecraft designs the decision makers found too original.”</p></blockquote><p>Ridley himself had input on the design: “I was looking for something like , not the fantasy of . I wanted a slow moving, massive piece of steel which was moving along in dead, deep silence … The concept was to have the hull covered with space barnacles or something. I was unable to communicate that idea, and I finally had to go down there and fiddle with the experts. We gradually arrived at a solution.”</p><p>Foss paints a more hectic process. “Finally what happened was that the bloke who had to make the [Nostromo] model completely lost his rag, scooped up a load of paper -they had a room full of smashed-up bits of helicopter and all-sorts- and he just bodged something together. So the actual spaceship in the film hadn’t anything to do with all the days, weeks, of work that we’d all done. It’s as simple as that.”</p><p>Cobb explained:&nbsp;“Brian Johnson, the special effects supervisor under pressure to build the large Nostromo model, went into the deserted art department and, out of frustration, grabbed all the Chris Foss designs off the wall and took them to Bray studios. There he would choose the design himself in order to have enough time to build the damn thing.”</p><p>However, Johnson had also scooped up Cobb’s art, and though Cobb was concentrating on the designs of the ship’s interior, one of his exterior pieces met with approval over Foss’ designs. “Well I soon found out that Brian found and took all of my exterior design sketches as well,” said Cobb. “About a month later I was told that Brian had used my sketch, ‘Nostromo A’, as the basis for the model, even to the extent that it was painted yellow. Ridley found the colour a bit garish and had it repainted grey.”</p><div data-shortcode=\"caption\"><a href=\"https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/cobbnosenh.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-561\" data-attachment-id=\"561\" data-permalink=\"https://alienseries.wordpress.com/2012/10/23/space-truckin-the-nostromo/cobbnosenh/\" data-orig-file=\"https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/cobbnosenh.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"800,374\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"cobbnosenh\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"<p>Cobb&amp;#8217;s grey Nostromo.</p>\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/cobbnosenh.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/cobbnosenh.jpg?w=500\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"\" src=\"https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/cobbnosenh.jpg?w=500&amp;h=233\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"233\" srcset=\"https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/cobbnosenh.jpg?w=500&amp;h=234 500w, https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/cobbnosenh.jpg?w=150&amp;h=70 150w, https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/cobbnosenh.jpg?w=300&amp;h=140 300w, https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/cobbnosenh.jpg?w=768&amp;h=359 768w, https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/cobbnosenh.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"></a></div><p>“Ridley had his own very firm ideas about what he physically wanted to do,” Foss said of the process, “and he almost studiously ignored everything that had gone before … I kind of got the impression that Ridley was quietly going his own way, trying to get on with it and get it done, a bit like just another job.

Cobb told Den of Geek that, “My problem with designing Nostromo’s interiors, the control bridge, corridors, auto doc (or med lab), bulkhead doors, the food deck, etc., was that I grew up with a deep fascination for astronomy, astrophysics, and most of all, aerospace flight. My design approach has always been that of a frustrated engineer (as well as a frustrated writer when it came to cinema design). I tend to subscribe to the idea that form follows function. If I’m to arrive at a cinematic spacecraft design that seamlessly preserves, as in this case, the drama of the script, the audience has to experience it as something impressive and believable.”</p><p>“We’re beyond  in terms of scientific advances,” said Scott of ‘s futurism, “our capabilities are more&nbsp;sophisticated&nbsp; but our ship’s still NASA-orientated, still Earth-manufactured … in our tongue-in-cheek fantasy we project a not-too-distant future in which there are many vehicles tramping around the universe on mining expeditions, erecting military installations, or whatever. At the culmination of many long voyages, each covering many years, these ships -no doubt part of armadas owned by private corporations- look used, beat-up, covered with graffiti, and uncomfortable. We certainly didn’t design the Nostromo to look like a hotel.”</p><blockquote><p>“I didn’t want a conventional shape [for the refinery,] so I drew up a sketch and handed it to the model makers. They refined it, as it were, and built the model. I originally drew it upside-down, with the vague idea that it would resemble a floating inverted cathedral … I think that the machine that they’re on could in fact be 60 years old and just added to over the decades. The metal-work on it could be 50 years old … I would have liked to see it covered with space barnacles or space seaweed, all clogged and choked up, but that was illogical as well.”\n~ Ridley Scott, Fantastic Films, 1979.</p></blockquote><p>The Nostromo model was built under the supervision of Nick Allder and Brian Johnson at Bray Studios, not far from Pinewood, where the live-action scenes were being filmed in parallel with the model shots at Bray. For the refinery, Scott instructed the teams at Bray to make it appear “Victorian Gothic,” with towers and spires and&nbsp;antennae. Bray shop worker Dennis Lowe explained: “At that same time in the workshop Ridley was talking about his first concept of the refinery and he was describing an actual oil refinery with pipes and spires, eventually the term ‘Battleship Bismarck in space’ came up to describe the detailing of the model.”</p><div data-shortcode=\"caption\"><a href=\"https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/blackpool2.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-596\" data-attachment-id=\"596\" data-permalink=\"https://alienseries.wordpress.com/2012/10/23/space-truckin-the-nostromo/blackpool2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/blackpool2.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"548,800\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"blackpool2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"<p>&amp;#8220;I spent a couple of months rigging the Nostromo with neon strips and spotlights that would mimic the Mothership from Close Encounter.

I could only look at the rushes while I was working with the actors, and that’s not a very satisfactory way of working. In the end, I think a director must be heavily involved with the miniatures, and that’s why I shot them myself.”</p><p>According to model builder Jon Sorensen, there were no real hard feelings over the redesigns and reshoots. “Ridley Scott then arrived from Shepperton to take an interest in the models and everything changed radically in terms of tone, colour and look. The yellow was sprayed over a uniform grey. Sections were rebuilt. We started over, discarding all previous footage. There was no anger at this. Surprise maybe. But it was Ridley Scott’s film. We liked him. So we entered the  model shoot Part Deux. I recall Bill Pearson and I talking once on what we thought was an empty, lunch-time model stage when a voice spoke from the shadows. Ridley, asking what we were discussing. We answered that maybe that part might look better moved over to there, (we were discussing the refinery). He smiled back and I guess that signalled what was true; we’d go all the way to help him. That night he bought both Bill and I a beer, a move which astonished the Assistant Director, Ray Beckett who complained that in 10 years of working with Ridley, he’d never been bought a beer. So we bought Ray one instead.”</p><div data-shortcode=\"caption\"><a href=\"https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/014.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-584\" data-attachment-id=\"584\" data-permalink=\"https://alienseries.wordpress.com/2012/10/23/space-truckin-the-nostromo/attachment/014/\" data-orig-file=\"https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/014.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"650,433\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Chiltern Image Service&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Chiltern Image Service&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"014\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"<p>Early shot of the yellow Nostromo approaching the alien planet.</p>\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/014.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/014.jpg?w=500\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/014.jpg?w=450&amp;h=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"450\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/014.jpg?w=450&amp;h=300 450w, https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/014.jpg?w=150&amp;h=100 150w, https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/014.jpg?w=300&amp;h=200 300w, https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/014.jpg 650w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\"></a><p>Early shot of the yellow Nostromo approaching the alien planet.</p></div><div data-shortcode=\"caption\"><a href=\"https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/normal_productionstill69.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2278\" data-attachment-id=\"2278\" data-permalink=\"https://alienseries.wordpress.com/2012/10/23/space-truckin-the-nostromo/normal_productionstill69/\" data-orig-file=\"https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/normal_productionstill69.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"770,508\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"normal_productionstill69\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"<p>The revised Nostromo hanging in orbit.</p>\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/normal_productionstill69.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/normal_productionstill69.jpg?w=500\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/normal_productionstill69.jpg?w=450&amp;h=296\" alt=\"The revised Nostromo hanging in orbit.\" width=\"450\" height=\"296\" srcset=\"https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/normal_productionstill69.jpg?w=450&amp;h=297 450w, https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/normal_productionstill69.jpg?w=150&amp;h=99 150w, https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/normal_productionstill69.jpg?w=300&amp;h=198 300w, https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/normal_productionstill69.jpg?w=768&amp;h=507 768w, https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/normal_productionstill69.jpg 770w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\"></a><p>The revised Nostromo hanging in orbit.</p></div><p>The Nostromo interiors were overseen by art director Roger Christian, who had helped craft the sets for . Christian told Shadowlocked.com: “I art-directed&nbsp;&nbsp;for Ridley Scott with my team because he was struggling to get the designer and the art department to understand ‘that look’ I created with the dressing on&nbsp;&nbsp;I went into Shepperton, and we built and dressed the first corridor section – actually for a test screen for Sigourney Weaver, who the studios were not sure about. I brought my little team of prop guys who’d understood then the process of what to strip down and how to place it. Because it was not something you just do randomly. It had to be done based on a kind of knowledge.”</p><p>“Roger is a brilliant set dresser,” Scott told Fantastic Films. “Though his department was not designing the corridors and sets, their ‘cladding’ of the walls made everything look absolutely real. He would go out with his buyers and prop men and visit aircraft dumps or army surplus stores and drag masses of things in for me to see.”</p><p>“With&nbsp;&nbsp;I was able to go much further with the oily and gritty look than in&nbsp;,” said Roger Christian, “and for the first time create a totally believable ‘space truck’, as Ridley described it. The set ended up looking as if we had rented a well-travelled, well-used, oily, dirty, mineral carrier – an unmistakably real and claustrophobic space vessel. I think this really helped audiences to identify with the movie, as the characters were so like space truckers, trapped in a claustrophobic nightmare.”</p><blockquote><p>“[The Nostromo’s] like the bloody Queen Mary. Do you get a sense of scale in the interior? That it’s big? We couldn’t build the two to three-hundred foot-long corridors which it would have but it’s supposed to be like one of these huge Japanese super-tankers. Three quarters of a mile long. The refinery behind it god-knows how big. I mean… I dunno. A mile square?”\n~ Ridley Scott, Fantastic Films, 1979.</p></blockquote><p>“Ridley saw the ship very much as a metaphor for a Gothic castle,” said Ron Cobb on the subject of the ship’s interiors, “or a WWII submarine … a kind of retro, accessible technology with great big transistors and very low-res video screens.” However, at one point, Scott had other ideas for the Nostromo’s technology:&nbsp;“I wanted to have wafer-thin screens that are plexiglas, that just float on clips -and of course today you’ve got computer screens exactly like that- because I figured that’s where it [technology] would go. I really got those things off Jean Giraud, Moebius, when he’d been drawing and speculating. A lot of his stuff you see thirty years ago is now.”</p><p>Cobb acknowledged the&nbsp;Moebius&nbsp;influence, as well as the ship’s other, perhaps subtler, inspirations: “The ship is a strange mixture of retrofitted old technology, a kind of industrial nightmare, like being trapped in a factory … Ridley’s a wonderful artist and he wanted it to look a lot like a Moebius-designed ship, with all kinds of rounds surfaces and with an Egyptian motif.” This Egyptian motif is prevalent in the Weylan-Yutani logo, a wings of Horus design which adorns the uniforms of the crew in addition to their coffee cups, beer cans, etc. The hypersleep chamber also evokes a burial chamber, with the cryo-chambers arranged in a lotus shape.&nbsp;In addition to the Egyptian motif, another influence was Japan. “The owners of the Nostromo are Japanese,” Scott told Fantastic Films.</p><div data-shortcode=\"caption\"><a href=\"https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/normal_productionstill99_005.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2276\" data-attachment-id=\"2276\" data-permalink=\"https://alienseries.wordpress.com/2012/10/23/space-truckin-the-nostromo/normal_productionstill99_005/\" data-orig-file=\"https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/normal_productionstill99_005.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"518,770\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"normal_productionstill99_005\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"<p>&amp;#8220;The interior of the Nostromo was so believable,&amp;#8221; HR Giger told Famous Monsters, &amp;#8220;I hate these new-looking spacecraft.

I wanted to have sort of anodized gold everywhere. Not steel, gold. Did you know that space landing craft are covered with gold foil? Amazing! So I thought, Why make this out of steel? Let’s make it all warm and oppressive, massive, and gold.'”</p><p>The glittery look can be seen in the opening shots of the ship’s computers bleeping into life, and the gold sheen is most prevalent in the ship’s&nbsp;maintenance&nbsp;area, where Brett finds the Alien’s&nbsp;discarded&nbsp;skin moments before his death. Scott explained the design process for the ship’s golden-hued&nbsp;maintenance&nbsp;garage: “We got hold of marvelous, actual parts of actual huge jet engines and installed them, and they’re like a coppery metal with some steel. We used them as four main supports, like columns, and they give a lot of the feeling of a temple. We played the same music we used in the derelict alien craft and we had  temples. The idol I wanted was through these massive gold doors which were as big as a wall, with a gap in them through which the claw [landing leg] can be seen. When that set was dressed, it looked like Aladdin’s Cave … [the garage is] filled with the equipment that the crew would use in their work on and around the refinery, and when they land on various planets – land crawlers, helicopters, other flying machines.”</p><p>“Ridley has this lavish, sensual visual style,” summarised Dan O’Bannon to Fantastic Films in 1979, “and I think that Ridley is one of the ‘good guys.’ I really think that he was the final pivot point responsible for the picture coming out good.&nbsp; And so a lot of the visual design and a lot of the mood elements inherent in the camerawork, while they’re not what I planned, are great.&nbsp; They’re just different.”</p><p>O’Bannon also nodded to the contributions of Cobb, Foss, Shusett etc., to the picture: “Also, it’s not 100% Ridley either. It’s Ridley superimposing his vision over the cumulative vision of others, you see.&nbsp; Now this could be such a strong director’s picture because Ridley’s directorial and visual hand is so strong.&nbsp; There will probably be tendency among critics to refer to it as Ridley Scott’s vision of the future.&nbsp; And he did have a vision of the future.&nbsp; But it was everybody else that came before, that’s what his vision is …&nbsp;if it sounds like I’m knocking Ridley, I’m not.”</p><div data-shortcode=\"caption\"><a href=\"https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ridley-signed-still.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-601\" data-attachment-id=\"601\" data-permalink=\"https://alienseries.wordpress.com/2012/10/23/space-truckin-the-nostromo/ridley-signed-still/\" data-orig-file=\"https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ridley-signed-still.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"720,428\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"ridley-signed-still\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"<p>The Nostromo at rest on the alien planetoid.</p>\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ridley-signed-still.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ridley-signed-still.jpg?w=500\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ridley-signed-still.jpg?w=450&amp;h=267\" alt=\"\" width=\"450\" height=\"267\" srcset=\"https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ridley-signed-still.jpg?w=450&amp;h=268 450w, https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ridley-signed-still.jpg?w=150&amp;h=89 150w, https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ridley-signed-still.jpg?w=300&amp;h=178 300w, https://alienseries.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ridley-signed-still.jpg 720w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\"></a><p>The Nostromo at rest on the alien planetoid.</p></div>",

      "content": "<p>After I wrote my <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/a-deep-dive-into-how-net-builds-and-ships/\">last post</a> on how .NET builds and ships, I was cautiously optimistic that I wouldn’t be writing another one. Or at least not another one about how we build and ship. That problem was done and dusted. .NET had done it! We’d struck a balance between distributed repository development and the ability to quickly compose a product for shipping. Congratulations everyone, now the infrastructure teams could focus on other things. Security, cross-company standardization, support for building new product features. All the good stuff.</p><p><em>…A year and a half later…</em></p><p>We’re asking how much it will cost to build 3-4 major versions with a dozen .NET SDK bands between them each month. And keep their engineering systems up to date. And hey, there’s this late breaking fix we want to get into next week’s release, so can I check it in today and have the team validate tonight? It can’t be  hard, right? And I have this new cross-stack feature that I want to do some prototyping on…how can I build it?</p><p>The answers were mostly frustrating:</p><p><em>“It’ll cost a lot, and get worse over time.</em>“</p><p>“<em>I don’t think we have enough time for that fix, I can only guess how long the build will take, but it’s at least 36 hours before we can handoff to validation. Maybe more?</em>“</p><p>“<em>I’m sure we can keep that much infrastructure alive, but we’ll slowly drown under the cost of keeping it up to date.</em>“</p><p>“<em>How critical is it that you have a full stack to work with? It’ll take a while to set that up.</em>“</p><p>These are  the answers we want to be giving. And so, we went back to the drawing board, looking for solutions.</p><p>This blog post is about the Unified Build project: .NET’s effort to resolve many of these issues by moving product construction into a ‘virtual monolithic’ repository, consolidating the build into a series of ‘vertical builds’, while still enabling contributors to work outside the monolith. I’ll briefly tell the story of our product construction journey over the life of .NET. I’ll draw attention to the lessons we’ve learned about applying a distributed product construction model to a single product, particularly its drawbacks in overhead and complexity. Finally, I’ll dig into the details of Unified Build and its foundational technology, Linux distro Source Build. We’ll look at the new method of product construction and the results we’re seeing.</p><h2>How did we get here? This is not my beautiful build infrastructure</h2><p>.NET was born out of the closed source infrastructure of the .NET Framework and Silverlight in 2015-2016. It was made open source incrementally as we readied its components for external consumption, and as was the fashion at the time, we split it into multiple repositories. CoreCLR represented the base runtime, CoreFX the libraries, Core-Setup the packaging and installation. Along came ASP.NET Core and EntityFramework Core, and an SDK with a CLI. A few releases saw major revamps of the product in the form of shared frameworks, with WindowsDesktop joining the fold. More repositories and more complexity.</p><p>What is important to understand is that .NET is a product that is developed in separate inter-dependent repositories but needs to be composed together in a relatively short period of time to ship. On paper, the ‘graph’ of the product looks much like any open source ecosystem. A repository produces some software component, publishes it to public registries, and downstream consumers take a dependency on the new component, and publish their own updates. It’s a producer-consumer model where changes ripple through the ‘global’ dependency graph via a series of pull-&gt;build-&gt;publish operations. This model is highly distributed and effective, but it is not necessarily efficient in a time sense. It enables software vendors and repository owners to have significant autonomy over their process and schedules. However, attempting to apply this methodology to a product like .NET, which represents its components using separate, but inter-dependent repositories, has major drawbacks.</p><p>Let’s call this a “distributed product construction methodology”. To get a sense of why it can be a difficult methodology to use, let’s take a look at the process to produce a security release.</p><h3>Example: Security Servicing</h3><p>Consider shipping a security patch. A security vulnerability is discovered somewhere in the .NET Runtime libraries. Because .NET is descended from .NET Framework, let’s say this security vulnerability is also present in .NET Framework 4.7.2. It becomes absolutely vital that .NET’s security update goes out in tandem with the .NET Framework update, or one will zero-day the other. .NET has numerous Microsoft-managed release paths. Microsoft Update, our CDN, Linux and container package registries, nuget.org, Visual Studio, Azure Marketplace, and on and on. That puts some restrictions on timeline. We need to be able to be predictable.</p><p>.NET’s development structure looks a lot like a typical open source ecosystem. The .NET Runtime, the .NET SDK, ASP.NET Core and the WindowsDesktop shared framework are developed by different teams, though with a huge amount of cross-collaboration. They are developed, at times, like independent products. The .NET Runtime forms the base of the product. ASP.NET Core and WindowsDesktop are built on top of that. A huge quantity of the dev tooling (C#, F#, MSBuild) is built on top of the surface area of the .NET Runtime and some auxiliary libraries. The SDK gathers up and builds a CLI, along with tasks, targets and tooling. Much of the shared framework and tooling content is redistributed in-box.</p><p>To build and ship this security patch, we need coordination between the many teams that contribute to the .NET product as a whole. We need the lowest levels of the .NET graph (see below) to build their assets, then feed them downstream to consumers. They need take the update, build, and feed downstream. This will happen continually until the product is “coherent”; no new changes are being fed into the graph and everyone agrees on a single version of each component in the product. Coherency ensures that a component with changes is ingested everywhere that redistributes the component, or information about it. Then, we want to do our validation, take all the shippable assets from the closure of all those unreleased components, and then release them all at once to the world.</p><p>This is a lot of moving parts that need to work well together in a short period of time.</p><h3>Advantages and Disadvantages of Distributes Ecosystems</h3><p>It’s important to note that this distributed ecosystem style of development  have a lot of advantages:</p><ul><li> – Repository boundaries tend to encourage layering and less tightly bound products. During the major version development lifecycle, the individual components of the stack generally remain roughly compatible, even as changes flow quickly and unevenly through the graph.</li><li> – Repository boundaries tend to encourage good, focused communities. The WPF and Winforms communities, for instance, are often distinct. Small repos are also generally more approachable.,</li><li> – Distributed development often allows for incremental changes. For instance, we can make breaking changes to the System.CommandLine surface area, then ingest those in the consumers over time. This doesn’t work all the time (e.g. let’s say the SDK is attempting to ship just one copy of System.Text.Json for all of the tooling to use, but not every consumer agrees on that surface area. Boom?!), but it’s reasonably reliable.</li><li> – Smaller, focused repositories tend to have better inner-loop experiences. Even something as simple as  or  is faster in a small repository. The repository boundary tends to give the (possibly illusory) sense that for your change, you only need to worry about the code and tests you can see.</li><li> – Incrementality helps development be more asynchronous. If my component flows to three downstream consumers who work in three different time zones, those teams can make progress on their own components in their own time, rather than needing to coordinate.</li><li><strong>Low-Cost Sharding/Incremental Builds</strong> – Distributed development allows for ‘optimizing’ away builds of components that don’t change every often and are at the fringes of a dependency graph. For instance, a leaf node that builds some static test assets doesn’t need to be rebuilt every time there is a change to the sdk. The last built assets are just fine.</li></ul><p>If you squint and peer between the lines here though, a lot of the advantages of the distributed model are its significant weaknesses when we need to build and ship software that requires changes in a significant portion of the graph to be completed in a short period of time. Changes at scale across large graphs are often slow and unpredictable. But why? Is there something inherently wrong with this model? Not really. In typical OSS ecosystems (e.g. NuGet or NodeJS package ecosystems), these aspects are often . These ecosystems do not optimize for speed or predictability. Instead, they value the autonomy of each node. Each node needs only to concern itself with what it needs to  and what it needs to  and the changes required to meet those needs. However, when we attempt to apply the distributed model to shipping software quickly, we often struggle because it increases the prevalence of two key concepts, which I’m calling <strong>Product Construction Complexity</strong> and <strong>Product Construction Overhead</strong>. Together these combine to slow us down and make us less predictable.</p><h4>Product Construction Complexity</h4><p>In the context of product construction, ‘complexity’ refers to the quantity of steps that are required for a change to go from a developer’s machine to that change being delivered to customers in all the ways that it needs to be delivered. I recognize that this is a fairly abstract definition. “Step” could mean different things depending on what level of granularity you want to look at. For now, let’s focus on conceptual product construction steps, as shown in the example graph below:</p><p>.NET began with a relatively simple product dependency graph and matching tools to manage that graph. As it grew, new repositories were added to the graph and additional dependency flow was required to construct the product. The graph grew more complex. We invented new tools (Maestro, our dependency flow system) to manage it. It was now easier than ever to add new dependencies. A developer or team looking to add new functionality to the product could often just create a new repository and build and set up the inputs and outputs. They only needed to know how that component fit within a small subsection of the larger product construction graph in order to add a new node. However, .NET doesn’t ship each individual unit independently. The product must become “coherent”, where everyone agrees on the versions of their dependencies, in order to ship. Dependencies or metadata about them are redistributed. You have to “visit” all of the edges. <em>Note: While we do not need to rev every component in the graph, there is a significant portion that changes on every release, either due to fixes or dependency flow.</em> Then you take the outputs of each individual node, combine them all together, and out the door you go.</p><p>More complex graphs have significant downsides:</p><ul><li>The more edges and nodes, the longer it tends to take to achieve coherency.</li><li>Teams are more likely to make a mistake. There are more coordination points, and more points in the workflow where a human can influence an outcome. Tools can help, but they only go so far.</li><li>Complexity can also encourage variance in build environment and requirements. It’s hard to keep everyone aligned on the same processes as teams move and upgrade at different rates. Reproducing that full set of environments can be expensive, and that cost tends to increase over time as infrastructure “rots”.</li></ul><h4>Product Construction Overhead</h4><p>We define overhead as “<em>the amount of time spent not actively producing artifacts that we can ship to customers</em>“. Like complexity, it can be evaluated on a different level of granularity depending on how detailed you want to get. Let’s take a look at two quick examples, and then at the overhead in one of .NET’s older builds.</p><p>A simple multi-repo product construction process might look like the following:</p><p>In the above graph, the overhead nodes (dotted nodes) do not actively contribute to the production of the packages in D. The time it takes the dependency flow service to create the PR is overhead. Waiting for a dev to notice and review the PR is overhead. Waiting for approval for package push is overhead. That’s not to say that these steps aren’t , just that they are places where we say we’re not actively creating outputs for customers.</p><p>How about builds? If we zoom into a repository build process, we can often see quite a lot of overhead. Consider this very simple build:</p><p>There are a few interesting measures of overhead in a system. We can measure it a % of overall time. Add up the time spent in each step based on its classification, then divide the total overhead by the total time. This gives a nice measure of overall resource efficiency. However, from a wall clock perspective, overall overhead doesn’t tell us much. To understand overhead’s effect on the end-to-end time, we find the longest path by time through our product construction graph, then compute the total overhead in steps that contribute to that path as compared to the total time in the path.</p><p>To understand what that overhead might look like in a single .NET build, let’s take a look at an 8.0 build of runtime. This data was generated using a custom tool that can evaluate an Azure DevOps build based on a set of patterns that classify each step.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Percentage of overall build time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table><p>Here are the three longest paths from that build:</p><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>(Stage) Build-&gt;Mono browser AOT offsets-&gt;windows-x64 release CrossAOT_Mono crossaot-&gt;Build Workloads-&gt;(Stage) Prepare for Publish-&gt;Prepare Signed Artifacts-&gt;Publish Assets</td></tr><tr><td>(Stage) Build-&gt;windows-arm64 release CoreCLR -&gt;Build Workloads-&gt;(Stage) Prepare for Publish-&gt;Prepare Signed Artifacts-&gt;Publish Assets</td></tr><tr><td>(Stage) Build-&gt;Mono android AOT offsets-&gt;windows-x64 release CrossAOT_Mono crossaot-&gt;Build Workloads-&gt;(Stage) Prepare for Publish-&gt;Prepare Signed Artifacts-&gt;Publish Assets</td></tr></tbody></table><h4>Overhead + Complexity = Time</h4><p>Overhead is unavoidable. There is some level inherent in every product construction process. However, when we add complexity to our product construction processes, especially complexity in the graph, the overhead tends to begin to dominate the process. It sort of multiplies. Rather than paying the machine queue time cost one time, you might pay it 10 times over within a single path through the graph. After those machines are allocated, you then clone the repo each time. The efficiency scaling of these steps tends to also be worse because there is some fixed cost associated with each one. For instance, if it takes 10 seconds to scan 10MB of artifacts, and 1 second to prepare for the scan, collate and upload the results, it takes longer to do that step 10 times in a row than it does to scan the full 100MB at once. 110 vs. 101 seconds.</p><p>What is also insidious is that this cost tends to hide and increase over time. It’s not always obvious. A local repository build for a developer is typically fast. The developer does not see any overhead of the overall CI system in that build. Zooming out, building the repository in a job in a pipeline can be similarly quick, but starts to incur some overhead. You have the quick build of that repository, but extra overhead steps around it. You’re still reasonably efficient though. Then let’s say you zoom out a little and you have some additional jobs in that pipeline, doing other things. Maybe reusing artifacts from other parts of the build, building containers, etc. Overhead will start to become a larger overall % of the long path time. Now, zoom out again, and you’re looking at the place of that pipeline and associated repositories in context of your larger product construction. You add in time for dev PR approvals, dependency flow systems to do their work, more cloning, more building, more compliance, more more more.</p><p>In a distributed product construction system, decisions that affect complexity, and therefore overhead, can be made at a level that does not see the overall overhead in the system. A new node is added. In isolation, it’s fine. In context, it costs.</p><p>While no graph of complexity was ever made for the .NET 8 timeframe that could show the complexity of each individual component build in context of the whole product construction graph, consider what the job graph for the runtime build alone looked like. Each bubble below represents a separate machine.</p><h2>The roots of Unified Build in Source Build</h2><p>.NET Source Build is a way that Linux distributions can build .NET in an isolated environment from a single, unified source layout. Microsoft started working on it around .NET Core 1.1. The spiritual roots of Unified Build grew from hallway conversations between the team working on .NET Source Build and the team responsible for the Microsoft distribution. I won’t say it wasn’t in jealousy that the infrastructure teams often looked at how long it took to build the .NET product within the Source Build infrastructure.  Shorter than it took to build just the runtime repository from scratch in its official CI build. Now granted, it wasn’t exactly an apples-to-apples comparison. After all, Source Build:</p><ul><li>Only builds one platform.</li><li>Doesn’t build any of the Windows-only assets (e.g. WindowsDesktop shared framework)/</li><li>Doesn’t build .NET workloads.</li><li>Doesn’t do any installer packaging.</li><li>Doesn’t build the tests by default</li></ul><p>All very reasonable caveats. But enough caveats to add up to 10s of hours in differences in build time?  Much more likely is that the Source Build methodology is  and . More than just time, there were other obvious benefits. Unified toolsets, easier cross-stack development, and perhaps most importantly, hard guarantees of what was being built and its build-time dependencies.</p><p>Back to those hallway conversations. Source Build’s obvious benefits led to occasional probing questions from various members of the .NET team. Most of the form: <em>So…why doesn’t Microsoft build its distribution that way?</em> Answer: It’s hard.</p><h3>Why is it hard? A detour into the land of Source Build</h3><p>Microsoft began efforts to make Source Build a ‘real’ piece of machinery around the .NET 3.1 timeframe. Prior to this point, the Source Build distribution tended to look more like a one-off effort for each .NET major release. It was too difficult to keep working all the time, so the team worked, starting in the spring as the new product took shape, to bring the new .NET version into line with Linux distro maintainer requirements. To understand why it’s so hard to fit Microsoft’s distribution of .NET into this model as part of the Unified Build project, let’s look back into why it was so hard to get the Source Build project into a turn crank state in the first place.</p><p>To allow our distro partners to distribute .NET we needed to produce an infrastructure system that produced a .NET SDK within the following constraints:</p><ul><li>Single implementation! – Only one implementation per component</li><li>Single platform – Only build for one platform (the one that distro partners are trying to ship)</li><li>Single build – Only build on one machine. We can’t require a complex orchestration infrastructure.</li></ul><h4>Linux Distro Build Requirements</h4><p>Linux distros generally have stricter rules and less flexibility when building software that will go into their package feeds. The build is usually completed offline (disconnected from the internet). It may only use as inputs artifacts that have been previously created in that build system. Checked-in binaries are not allowed (though they can be eliminated at build time). Any source in the repository must meet strict licensing requirements.  At a conceptual level, a Linux distro partner wants to be able to trace every artifact they ship to a set of sources and processes that they can reasonably edit. All future software should be built from previously Source Build produced artifacts. .</p><h4>Single Build – A repo and orchestration framework to stitch the stack together</h4><p>As you’ve learned earlier, the .NET build, like many products, is actually comprised of the Azure DevOps builds of various components, stitched together with dependency updates. This means that the information and mechanics required to construct the product is distributed between the repositories (build logic within the build system and associated scripting, as well as YAML files processed by Azure DevOps) and the dependency flow information held by our ‘Maestro’ system (producer-consumer information). This isn’t usable for our Linux distro partners. They need to be able to build the product without access to these Microsoft resources. And they need to be able to do so in a way that is practical for their environments. Manually stitching together a product from a build graph isn’t reasonable. We need an orchestrator that encapsulates that information.</p><h5>The Source Build layout and orchestrator</h5><p>The orchestrator replaces the tasks that Azure DevOps and Maestro perform for .NET’s distributed build with ones that can be run from a single source layout, disconnected from the internet. You can see the modern, updated layout and orchestrator over at <a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet\">dotnet/dotnet</a>.</p><ul><li><p> – A <a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet/tree/main/src\">single source layout</a> with a copy of all components required to build the product. Submodules are flattened, if they exist (typically for external OSS components). The contents of the source layout are determined by identifying <a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/7efd8a45363467689d38fcf05f0c5f720244d0c4/eng/Version.Details.xml#L16\">an annotated dependency</a> for each component within the product graph, rooted at <a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk\">dotnet/sdk</a>. The sha for that annotated dependency determines what content will populate the layout. <em>Note: dependencies like compilers and OS libs are provided by the build environment.</em></p></li><li><p><strong>Information on how each component should be built, and its dependencies</strong> – For each of the components within the single source layout, a <a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet/tree/main/repo-projects\">basic project</a> is provided which identifies how the component is built. In addition, the component level dependencies are also identified. i.e. the .NET Runtime needs to be built before ASP.NET Core can start.</p><pre><code>&lt;ItemGroup&gt;\n&lt;RepositoryReference Include=\"arcade\" /&gt;\n&lt;RepositoryReference Include=\"runtime\" /&gt;\n&lt;RepositoryReference Include=\"xdt\" /&gt;\n&lt;/ItemGroup&gt;</code></pre></li><li><p> – The <a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet/blob/main/repo-projects/Directory.Build.targets\">build orchestrator logic</a> is responsible for launching each build in the graph when it is ready (any dependencies have been successfully built), as well as inputs and outputs of each component. After a component build has been completed, the orchestrator is responsible for identifying the outputs and preparing inputs for downstream component builds. Think of this as a local Dependabot, computing the intersection of the declared input repositories against the package level dependency info (see <a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet/blob/main/src/aspnetcore/eng/Version.Details.xml\">aspnetcore’s</a>) for an example. More information on how dependency tracking works in .NET builds can be found in my <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/a-deep-dive-into-how-net-builds-and-ships/#tracking-our-dependencies\">previous blog post</a>.</p></li><li><p> – The comparatively stricter environments that our Linux distro partners build in mean that it’s necessary that we build some automation to identify potential problems. The orchestrator can identify pre-built binary inputs, ‘poison’ leaks (previously source-built assets appearing in the current build outputs), and other hazards that might block our partners.</p></li><li><p> – Most of our test logic remains in the individual repositories (more on that later), but the layout also includes <a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet/tree/main/test\">smoke tests</a>.</p></li></ul><h4>Single Implementation – Pre-built squeaky clean</h4><p>There are some obvious and non-obvious reasons why these requirements would be hard to meet using the ‘stock’ Microsoft build of .NET, and why Source Build required so much work. An offline build with pre-staged, identified inputs that are  is a major undertaking. When the Source Build team began to investigate what this meant, it was quickly obvious that a LOT of interesting behavior was hiding in the .NET product build. Sure, binary inputs like optimization data were obviously disallowed, but some other foundational assets like .NET Framework and NETStandard targeting packs were also not buildable from source. Either they weren’t open source in the first place, or they hadn’t been built in years. More concerning, the graph-like nature of .NET means that incoherency is very common. Some of this incoherency is undesirable (the kind we attempt to eliminate during our product construction process). Some of it is expected and even desired.</p><h5>Example: Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp</h5><p>As an example, let’s take a look at the C# compiler analyzers, which are built in the <a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn\">dotnet/roslyn</a> repository. The analyzers will reference various versions of the <code>Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp</code> package depending on the required surface area to ensure that a shipped analyzer runs all of the versions of Visual Studio and the .NET SDK that it is required to support. They reference a minimum possible version. This ensures that analyzers can be serviced in a sustainable fashion, rather than shipping a different version of an analyzer for every possible VS or SDK configuration.</p><p>Because multiple versions of the surface area are referenced, multiple versions of <code>Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp</code> are restored during the build. That would mean, for the purposes of Source Build, we need to build each and every one of those versions of <code>Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp</code> at some point. We have two ways to do this:</p><ul><li><strong>Multi-version source layout</strong> – Place multiple copies of dotnet/roslyn into the shared source layout, one for each referenced <code>Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp</code> version based on when it was originally produced. This is not only expensive in build time, but it tends to be somewhat viral. If you have 3 versions of dotnet/roslyn you need to build, you need to ensure that the transitive dependencies of those 3 versions are also present in the shared layout. The maintenance complexity of this setup goes up very quickly. These are previously shipped versions of the dotnet/roslyn source base. It will be necessary to maintain security and compliance of those codebases over time. Upgrading build-time dependencies. Removing EOL infrastructure, etc.</li><li><strong>Require previously source-built versions to be available</strong> – This is really just a flavor of the multi-version source layout with an element of “caching”. If a distro maintainer needs to rebuild the product from scratch, or if a new Linux distribution is being bootstrapped, they might need to reconstruct decent portion of .NET’s past releases just to get the latest one to build in a compliant fashion. And if those old versions require changes to build in a compliant fashion, you’re again in a maintenance headache.</li></ul><h4>Source Build Reference Packages</h4><p>There are numerous other examples like Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp. Any time a project targets a down-level target framework (e.g. net9 in the net10 build), the down-level reference pack is restored. SDK tooling (compilers, MSBuild) targets versions of common .NET packages that match the version shipped with Visual Studio. So how do we deal with this? We cannot simply unify on a single version of every component referenced within the product without fundamentally changing the product.</p><p>The Source Build team realized that a lot of this usage fit neatly into a class of “reference-only” packages.</p><ul><li>The targeting packs restored by the SDK when a project builds against a TFM that does not match the SDK’s major version (e.g. targeting net9 with a net10 SDK) do not contain implementation.</li><li>The reference to older versions of <code>Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp</code> are  only. No assets are  from these packages. If the implementation is not needed, a reference-only package can be substituted.</li></ul><p>Enter <a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/source-build-reference-packages\">dotnet/source-build-reference-packages</a>. A reference-only package is significantly simpler to create and build, and it meets the needs of the consumers in the build. We can generate reference package sources for packages where we do not need the implementation, then create an infrastructure to store, build and make them available during the Source Build process. Providing multiple versions is relatively trivial. The dotnet/source-build-reference-packages repository is built during the .NET build, and then consuming components restore and compile against provided reference surface area.</p><h4>What about all those non-reference cases?</h4><p>With a solution to reference packages, we can turn our attention to other inputs that are not Source Build compliant and do not fall into the ‘reference’ category. There are three major sets:</p><ul><li>Closed source or inputs that cannot be built from source – Optimization data, Visual Studio integration packages, internal infrastructure dependencies, etc.</li><li>Legacy – Open source dependencies on implementation built in older versions of .NET.</li><li>Joins – Open source dependencies on implementation built on other platforms.</li></ul><p>Let’s take a look at how we deal with these cases.</p><h5>Closed Source/Non-Source Buildable Inputs</h5><p>Closed source or any inputs that cannot be built from source aren’t allowable in the Linux distro maintainer builds, full stop. To resolve these cases, we analyze each usage to determine what to do. Remember that our goal is to provide a compliant build implementation for use by our distro partners, which is functionally as close to what Microsoft ships as is possible. i.e. we don’t want Microsoft’s Linux x64 SDK to  in substantially different ways from RedHat’s Linux x64 SDK. This means that the runtime and sdk layouts for Linux x64 need to be as close as possible. The good news is that quite a lot of the closed source usage isn’t required to produce functionally equivalent assets. Examples:</p><ul><li>We might restore a package that enables signing, something not required in a distro partner build</li><li>The dotnet/roslyn repository builds components that power Visual Studio. These components have dependencies on Visual Studio packages that define the IDE integration surface area. However, this IDE integration doesn’t ship in the .NET SDK. This functionality could be “trimmed away” in Source Build by tweaking the build. This is reasonably common.</li></ul><p>If dependencies couldn’t be trimmed away without altering product functionality, we have a few additional options:</p><ul><li><strong>Open source the dependency</strong> – Often times, a closed source component, or at least a key portion of a closed source component required to satisfy a scenario, can be open sourced.</li><li> – Sometimes, the team can work to remove the product differences with intentional design changes. Remember that the important part is that everything that ships on distro partner package feeds needs to be built from source. This allows for some assets to be brought in dynamically. Think of this like the NPM package ecosystem vs. the NPM package manager. A distro might build the NPM package manager from source. This leaves users to dynamically restore NPM packages at build time.</li><li><strong>Live with slightly different behavior</strong> – These cases are few and far between. Prior to .NET 10, the WinForms and WPF project templates and WindowsDesktop were not included in the source-built Linux SDK, despite being available in Microsoft’s Linux distribution. This was due to the difficulty in building the required portions of those repositories on non-Windows platforms.</li></ul><p>We’ve discussed what we can do with closed source and non-reproducible dependencies. What about legacy dependencies? First, what do we mean by ‘legacy’ dependency? As detailed in earlier discussion, there is quite a lot of ‘incoherency’ in the product. A project might build for multiple target frameworks, redistributing assets from older versions of .NET. This is all to support valuable customer scenarios. But building all the versions of these components isn’t feasible. This is where our  rule comes into play. We choose a single version of each component to build and ship with the product. We do allow for  to old versions, via dotnet/source-build-reference-packages, but relying on older implementations are off limits.</p><p>First, we look for a way to avoid the dependency. Is it needed for the Linux SDK we’re trying to produce? If not, we can eliminate that code path from the build. If so, is there an opportunity to unify on the single implementation? In a lot of cases, incoherency is just a result of the product components moving their dependencies forward at different rates. If all else fails, we could explore compromises that involve behavioral differences, but we want to avoid this as much as possible.</p><p>Joins are the last major category of pre-builts to remove. They occur because we end up with intra-product dependencies that are built in another environment. For example, I might be running a build on Windows that creates a NuGet package for a global tool, but to build that NuGet package I need the native shim executables Mac and Linux and Windows. Those shims can only (reasonably) be built in the Mac and Linux host environments. These types of dependencies are indicative of a product build that is more ‘woven’ than ‘vertical’ and tend to naturally emerge over time in a multi-repo product construction graph. Each edge in that graph represents a sequence point where all the outputs of earlier nodes are available, regardless of where they were built. If a dependency can be taken, it will be taken.</p><p>However, the distro partner builds need to be single platform  single invocation to fit into distro partner requirements. Bootstrapping notwithstanding, they want to pull in the dependencies, disconnect the machine from the network, and hit build. At the end, out pops a bright new .NET SDK. Cross-platform dependencies preclude any such behavior. They block “build verticality”. Remember joins. We’ll need to come back to them later when we start implementing Unified Build for Microsoft based on the Source Build model.</p><p>For Source Build, we again deal with joins a bit like legacy dependencies. The key aspect to remember is that Source Build is narrowly focused on producing a .NET SDK and associated runtimes in the Linux distro partner build environments. So, we eliminate dependencies where possible (e.g. we don’t need to package Windows global tool executable stubs when running the SDK on Linux) and redesign the product or product construction process as necessary to meet requirements (e.g. .NET Workload manifests).</p><h2>The Vision – Dreaming up Unified Build</h2><p>Unified Build seeks to apply the general principles of our Linux distro partner Source Build to the product that Microsoft ships. Achieving this would result in big wins for Linux distro partners, upstream contributors and Microsoft, reducing maintenance costs and improving the ability to build and ship quickly. Although we knew from the outset that we likely can’t exactly match the exact Linux distro build approach without major changes in the product, we thought we could get close. .NET came up with the following high-level goals (<em>Note, “.NET distro maintainers” refers to anyone building .NET, including Microsoft</em>):</p><ul><li>A single git commit denotes all product source for a particular .NET build. All commits are coherent</li><li>A single repo commit can produce a shippable build</li><li>.NET’s build shall be able to create a specific platform’s distribution in a single build environment.</li><li>.NET distro maintainers shall be able to efficiently update and build .NET (both collaboratively and separately) through the entire lifecycle of a .NET version (first to last commit).</li><li>.NET distro maintainers can produce downstream distributions without use of Microsoft provided services.</li><li>.NET distro maintainers shall be able to meet provenance and build environment requirements for their distributions.</li><li>.NET distro maintainers shall be able to coordinate patching of downstream distributions.</li><li>.NET distro maintainers can run verification tests against the built product.</li><li>.NET contributors shall be able to easily produce full product builds for testing, experimentation, etc.</li><li>.NET contributors shall be able to work efficiently on the section of the product for which they are concerned.</li></ul><p>Still, getting there would require solving a mountain of new problems. Let’s take a look at some of the problems we need to solve before we can use Source Build as Microsoft’s .NET build.</p><h3>Provide a way to determine what makes it into the product</h3><p>When you construct a product using the distributed model, the  of the product, the  of the product and the determination of what actually  the product are all tied together. Source Build operates on a flattened source layout based on a final coherent graph. However, it relies on the traditional .NET product construction process in order to determine what versions of each component show up in the layout. To get the full benefit we need a way to directly update components within the shared source base without complex dependency flow. Otherwise, if a developer wants to make a change in runtime, they will end up building the product twice. Once to flow the runtime build with their change through all paths that runtime reaches, then once again to build the product using that new runtime.</p><h3>Provide a way to react to breaking changes</h3><p>The flat flow significantly reduces the number of hops, and therefore the complexity and overhead in the process of a change making its way into the shared source layout. And we can see that before a change makes it into the product; it will still get PR validation and possibly some more in-depth rolling CI validation. However, let’s say that this change requires reaction in consuming components. Despite the change in dependency flow to a flat flow, ASP.NET Core still depends on .NET Runtime. And ASP.NET Core’s code in the layout doesn’t know about the new runtime change. Whatever PR validation we have before a change is allowed in the shared source layout is sure to fail.</p><p>In a traditional dependency flow system, we handle this by making changes in the dependency update PR. If an API is changed, the build breaks. A dev makes a change in the PR (ideally), validation is green, and the PR is merged. For the single-source methodology to work for .NET, we’ll need to be able to make changes to the source of  components in the dotnet/runtime update PR.</p><h3>Provide a way to validate against repository infrastructure</h3><p>As we discussed earlier, a large quantity of critical validation lives at the component repository level. That’s where the developers spend their time. Moving or copying all of this is probably wasteful, definitely expensive, and likely hard to maintain. If we can’t rely on the dependency flow to do the validation before components flow into the shared source layout, we’ll need a way to do so after.</p><p>To solve our problem, we could have all the outputs of a new product builds flow  into the individual repositories, matching with the dependencies in their  files. That means dotnet/aspnetcore will get a bunch of new .NET Runtime packages, dotnet/sdk will get a bunch of newly built ASP.NET Core, .NET Runtime and Roslyn compiler packages, etc. They will be validating the ‘last built’ versions of their input dependencies against repository infrastructure.</p><h3>Provide two-way code flow</h3><p>Let’s say a runtime insertion PR changed the signature of an API in . When that forward flows, the responsible dev updates the signatures in all downstream users. Let’s say that’s code in  and . The new product is built, and the updated System.Text.Json package with the new API signature makes its way back to  and . The HEAD of  doesn’t have the source changes made directly in the shared layout forward flow PR. The dev would need to port those changes over, making changes in the backflow PR. This is tedious and error prone. Our new system will need to provide a way to automatically flow changes made in the shared layout back in the source repository.</p><h3>Provide better insertion time validation</h3><p>Validation on backflow isn’t perfect. It doesn’t provide an easy  gate for bad changes in dependent components. We can mitigate this by identifying and closing gaps in repo testing that allowed bad changes to be merged in the originating repo. We can also accept that some things will always slip through and that the process of creating a high-quality product isn’t just a green PR. Many repositories do not and cannot run their full testing suites prior to merging. However, we can  invest scenario testing run against the just-built product. This is something that our traditional dependency flow system is not good at.</p><p>Any whole product scenario testing relies on dependency updates for components reaching the dotnet/sdk repository. Up to that point, we don’t have a complete .NET product that we can test. Any attempt is just some kind of “Frankenbuild”. <em>Note: A lot of this end-to-end testing just comes in the form of dotnet/sdk’s repository-level PR/CI testing.</em>. However, changes can take a while to move through the graph to the point there they take effect in a way that would be visible in testing.</p><p>The Source Build methodology provides a full product build on each and every component change, regardless of where that component lives in the product construction graph. This means that we have the opportunity to create and run a comprehensive suite of testing on each of those insertions. That testing should be focused on covering wide swaths of product functionality. If this testing passes, there is a reasonable expectation that .NET is functioning in a way that makes it possible for development to make forward progress.</p><h3>Provide a way to build all of what .NET ships</h3><p>The Linux distro Source Build offering focuses narrowly on the assets in-box in the 1xx band SDK, ASP.NET Core, Runtime. It builds packages that support the creation of these layouts. As we saw earlier with prebuilt elimination, this narrow focus is necessary to be able to meet distro partner build requirements. If we want to build what Microsoft ships, we can’t have that narrow focus.</p><p>Expanding our focus is straightforward in some areas and difficult in others. In some ways, we’re just relaxing restrictions and bringing more functionality back into the build. We need to allow for pre-built binaries (e.g. signing functionality) to be restored from feeds. We need to build all TFMs instead of trimming away .NET Framework targets. We’ll need to build components originally excluded from the souce build focused shared source layout, like Windows Desktop, Winforms, WPF, EMSDK, etc. What’s more difficult are joins. Recall that Linux distro Source Build is single layout, single machine, single invocation.  This suffices for producing the layout, but there are a good handful of other artifacts in .NET that require builds on multiple machines. Artifacts that break the single machine verticality concept.</p><p>In an ideal world, we’d re-architect the product to avoid these joins. But it’s often hard to do so without customer compromise or driving complexity into the product itself. We can’t simplify the SDK without breaking customers, and this is hard to do, even across major versions, in an enterprise-grade product. Past decisions heavily influence future available choices. In the end, we’ll have to eliminate joins where we can via product construction practices. Any remaining joins will be something we have to live with. The build will have to be architected to run across multiple machines, via a series of build passes.</p><h2>Executing on the Vision – Shipping Unified Build</h2><p>The Unified Build project can roughly be divided into 4 phases:</p><ul><li><strong>Initial brainstorming and design (.NET 7)</strong> – The initial design work on the Unified Build project began in early 2022 during the development of .NET 7 and took ~4 months to complete. The project got full approval to start later in 2022 with the intention of completion by .NET 9 RTM, with some key go/no-go points where we could bail and still have a net win on infrastructure.</li><li><strong>Foundational work (.NET 8)</strong> – The Unified Build project during .NET 8 was focused on foundational work to improve the sustainability of the Source Build infrastructure and building features that were required to support the weight of the full build. The investments were designed to be a net positive for .NET overall, even if it turned out that our proof-of-concept stage discovered some major unknown problem and we had to change direction.</li><li><strong>Vertical Build/Code Flow Exploration (Early .NET 9)</strong> – After the foundational work completed, we moved to implement a vertical build for each of the 3 major OS families: Mac, Windows, and Linux. The intention was to identify as many of the problems we would need to solve during our productization phase as possible. We were especially interested in finding any previously unknown product construction join points. At the same time, we did a much deeper investigation into the options for code flow and code management, eventually proving out and settling on the implementation listed below.</li><li><strong>Productization (Late .NET 9-.NET 10)</strong> – Final implementation started in earnest towards the end of .NET 9 after a spring+summer delay. As a result of the delay, the ship date was pushed back to .NET 10. This turned out to be a blessing in disguise. This bought us about 6 extra months of bake time and allowed us to use the Unified Build product construction process starting midway through the .NET 10 Preview/RC cycle (Preview 4). .NET Preview 4 shipped with the new build process, but on the old code flow. Preview 5 added the new code flow, and we never looked back. Further refinement in developer workflow, more bake time for the build and code flow process happened over subsequent months.</li></ul><p>And finally, after almost 4 years of dreaming and work, Unified Build shipped with .NET 10 RTM!</p><p>Let’s take a look at the key components of the project.</p><h3>VMR – The Virtual Monolithic Repository</h3><p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet\">dotnet/dotnet VMR</a>, or “Virtual Monolithic Repository” forms the cornerstone of the Unified Build project. It is the source layout from which all of .NET is built, including by our Linux distro partners. It is the orchestrator. Functionally, it’s not much different from the source layout used prior to .NET 8.0. That layout has just been formalized into a git repository (vs. a source tarball). This is key, as it allows developers to work both in their individual component repository, where dev workflows might be very refined, as well as in the VMR when cross-cutting changes are necessary. .NET gets most of the benefits of the distributed repo world, without coherency problems.</p><p>Vertical Build is .NET’s pivot to producing assets in a series of verticals. A vertical is defined as a single build command on a single machine that builds part of the .NET product without input from other verticals. Typically, we divide verticals up by the runtime that we’re trying to produce. For example, Windows x64 vs. MonoAOT vs. Linux arm64 vs. PGO profile Windows x86. Altogether there are 35-40 different verticals. We divide these into what we call “short stacks” and “tall stacks”. A short stack just builds the runtime. A tall stack builds all the way up through the SDK.</p><p>The original vision was that if we joined together all the outputs from parallel verticals, we’d have everything .NET needed to ship. Such a setup would be highly efficient and friendly to any upstream partners. Unfortunately, the design of the .NET product has baked in a few required joins over the years. For example, .NET workload packages can’t be built without access to numerous packages built across many operating systems. To resolve this, we ended up with two additional build passes. The good news is that those additional passes are on a reduced set of verticals and a reduced set of components within those verticals. Not perfect, but manageable.</p><p>Probably the most interesting aspect of the Unified Build project is how code flow is managed. This is where .NET turns standard development patterns on their head a little bit. As detailed earlier, maintaining the product as a graph of interdependent components while flattening code flow into a shared coherent layout requires “two-way” code flow. Changes need to flow from components into the shared layout, and changes in the shared layout need to be able to flow back to the component repositories. Conceptually the code flow algorithm is no more complicated than anything you can model within a single git repository for a given project. The trick is to do this with repositories with no related git history.</p><p><strong>Note: The nitty gritty details of this algorithm will be covered in a future post by another team member. I’ll update this post to link to it when it’s available.</strong></p><p>For now, let’s take a look at the basics:</p><p>Both the VMR and the component repository keep track of the last code flow from their partner. This is tracked alongside standard dependency information in , though one could imagine it could be kept elsewhere.</p><p>The idea is to determine the diff between the “last flow” and whatever is flowing in now. For example, in a very simple case, when a new commit is made to dotnet/runtime and no changes have been made to  in the VMR, the dependency flow system will take the following steps:</p><ol><li>Determine two points, A and B, for which to compute a diff. For this case, point A is the last flow of dotnet/runtime that was checked in to the VMR (or is currently in PR). Point B is the new commit to dotnet/runtime.</li><li>Construct a patch file, remapping the files src/runtime files onto the directory structure of the VMR.</li></ol><p>.NET 8 and .NET 9 use VMRs with only one-way code flow. These cases with no changes on the other side are trivial and robust. Things get spicier when developers start making changes on both sides, and when dependency flow starts shifting around over time.</p><ul><li>Computing the diff points gets more interesting and involves knowing which way that “last flow” was.</li><li>Merge conflicts arise and need to be dealt with in a way the developer can understand.</li><li>Changes in the source and target of code flow can cause havoc and need robust error handling and recovery mechanisms.</li></ul><p>I’ll leave code flow there for now. Stay tuned for more.</p><p>The last major pillar of Unified Build is additional scenario testing. To be clear, .NET does not lack testing. .NET Runtime could use month’s worth of machine time on every PR to validate its millions of tests if it were practical or pragmatic to do so. Our approval, build, validation and signoff procedures ensure high-quality shipping bits. Still, when making changes directly in the VMR, the flat flow introduces new  between that making that change and in-depth validation of it against each of the VMR components. While we can’t run every last test on PR and CI, we did recognize that better automated <a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/scenario-tests\">scenario testing</a> could play a solid role in preventing regressions. The goal was to add tests that covered wide swaths of product functionality that were not directly tied to the build system or repository infrastructure. Instead, they executed against the final built product. If the scenario tests pass, then there is a good sense that the product is functional at a decent level and contributors won’t be blocked.</p><p>So, what did .NET get for almost 4 years of dreaming, scheming, and hard work? That’s a lot of effort to put into one project. Did the outcome justify the investment? As it turns out, we got quite a lot.</p><p>Let’s start with the most visible outcomes and then take a peek under the covers.</p><h3>Flexibility, predictability and speed</h3><p>By far the biggest return we’ve seen on the investment is . Distributed product construction is slow. Producing coherent builds is slow. Checking in new fixes or content requires coordination to avoid “resetting the build”, because  you want to ship, and  you build it are tied together in a distributed, OSS-style ecosystem. Taking a new fix might mean you don’t have something ready to handoff for validation. Flat flow eliminates that coherency problem, separating the  and the . This is incredibly valuable during the drive towards an RTM build or a servicing release. It means we can make fixes later in the release cycle, focusing much more on whether those fixes meet our servicing bar and much less on whether we can actually build and deliver the change. That flexibility is good for customers.</p><p>Some of that flexibility comes from the speed of the build. This may sound glacially slow (.NET is a big, complex product), but .NET set a goal of producing an unsigned build in less than 4 hours, signed in less than 7. That’s down from significantly longer times in .NET 8.0 and .NET 9.0. A build of 8.0 or 9.0 can easily run to 24 even if everything goes perfectly. A signed build in 7 hours means a rolling set of new .NET assets to validate ~3 times a day. Most of that build time improvement comes from simply removing <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/reinventing-how-dotnet-builds-and-ships-again/#product-construction-overhead\">overhead</a>.</p><p>Some of the flexibility also comes from predictability. Distributed product construction has more moving parts. It has more human touch points. More places for systems and processes to fail. This tends to make outcomes unpredictable. “<em>If I check in a fix to dotnet/runtime, when will I have a build ready?</em>” is a hard question to answer in a distributed system. I know how long dotnet/runtime’s build takes. But at what time will that change show up downstream via dependency flow? Will someone be around to review and approve it when it does? What’s the status of PR/CI validation downstream? Will a new important change be merged into dotnet/aspnetcore before we get a coherent build, setting us back on validation? This question is vastly easier to answer in .NET 10. The change flows into the VMR (or is made there directly) and will show up in the next build. The next build will take N hours.</p><h3>Infrastructural robustness and completeness</h3><p>Behind the flashier metrics, there are years of quality-of-life improvements to the infrastructure that pay major dividends day in and day out. Improvements to the Source Build infrastructure in .NET 8 reduced the cost of keeping Linux distro Source Build running. A lot of its cost was related to the delay between a change getting checked in and discovering whether it would break the build when it finally flowed through the graph and reached the shared source layout. It was not uncommon for the Source Build .NET SDK to not be “prebuilt-clean” or shippable by distro partners until the middle of the previews. The infrastructure improvements in .NET 8 made it much easier to identify new pre-built inputs at PR time when they are easier to diagnose and resolve, before they made their way in the source layout. We are now prebuilt clean 100% of the time. That then reduced the load on the Source Build team, which gave them bandwidth to work in other areas. They added build parallelism, more predictable dependency flow, better logging, removed unneccessary complexity…the list goes on and on. Investments that make a product successful.</p><p>Our signing tooling had to be overhauled to support signing on every platform for a wide variety of archive types. Without this work, we couldn’t have shipped Unified Build. But this expanded support benefits more than just the core .NET product. There are numerous ancillary repositories that were able to simplify their builds, avoiding shuttling bits from Mac/Linux to Windows machines where the signing tooling ran. Lower build overhead, faster and simpler builds.</p><p>So where does the Unified Build project go next? While we won’t have the same level of investment in .NET 11, we’ll be making targeted improvements to the infrastructure to improve developer workflow and UX, mainly around code flow. One area I’m particularly excited about is AI agents that monitor code flow, connecting the dots between the various systems involved in creating the product and identifying issues. There are lots of systems and parties involved (Azure DevOps, GitHub, the code flow services and their configuration, code mirroring, developer approvals, machine allocation, etc.) in making a change go from PR to product. When it works, it works. When it doesn’t it’s often down to a human to track down exactly where the chain of events went wrong. It’s tedious and time consuming. We have tools, but it’s mainly about connecting lots of dots. We could write a rules engine for this, but my hunch is that it would be fragile and very complicated. Agents that can look at the system a little more fuzzily are ideally suited to this type of task. Less toil, a better .NET.</p><p>Lastly, beyond .NET 11, another push to get rid of join points might be on the horizon. The benefits are pretty clear: simpler, faster, and friendlier to contributors. We know now exactly how fast a build would be if you got rid of the remaining joins (less than 4 hours).</p><p>If you made it this far, thanks! It’s good to provide some insight into how .NET build and ships. You’ve learned how distributed dependency flow product construction models aren’t always a great fit for shipping software predictably and reliably. These systems tend to have high complexity and overhead, which adds time. You’ve read about the roots of the .NET Unified Build project in .NET Linux distro Source Build, and what made it difficult to apply those concepts to .NET. Lastly, you learned how .NET applied those concepts and the drastic improvements we’ve seen in our day-to-day work.</p><p>The blog post detailing the flat code flow algorithms should be along shortly. Stay tuned!</p>",

      "content": "<p>Being \"the enshittification guy\" means that people expect you to weigh in on every service or platform that has been deliberately worsened to turn a buck. It's an impossible task (and a boring one besides). There's too much of this shit, and it's all so  – a real \"banality of enshittification\" situation.</p><p>So these days, I really only take note of  enshittified things,  enshittified things, enshittified things. Things like the fact that Google is sending people searching for health care plans to \"junk insurance\" that take your money and then pretty much just let you :</p><p>\"Junk insurance\" is a health insurance plan that is designed as a short-term plan that you might use for a couple of days or a week or two, say, if you experience a gap in coverage as you move between two jobs. These plans can exclude coverage for pre-existing conditions and typically exclude niceties like emergency room visits and hospitalization:</p><p>Crucially, these plans do  comply with the Affordable Care Act, which requires comprehensive coverage, and bans exclusions for pre-existing conditions. These plans only exist because of loopholes in the ACA, designed for very small-scale employers or temporary coverage.</p><p>The one thing junk insurance does  skimp on is sales and marketing. These plans outbid the rest of the market when it comes to buying Google search ads, meaning that anyone who uses Google to research health insurance will be inundated with ads for these shitty plans. The plans  spend a fortune on \"search engine optimization\" – basically, gaming the Google algorithm – so that the  Google results for health insurance are  saturated with these garbage plans.</p><p>The plans also staff up boiler-rooms full of silver-tongued high-pressure sales staff who pick up on the first ring and hard-sell you on their plans, deliberately misleading you into locking into their garbage plans.</p><p>That's right, . While Obamacare is nominally a \"market based\" healthcare system (because Medicare For All would be ), you are only allowed to change vendors twice per year, during \"open enrollment,\" these narrow biannual windows in which you get to \"vote with your wallet\" against a plan that has screwed you over and/or endangered your life.</p><p>Which means that if a fast-talking salesdroid from a junk insurance company can trick you into signing up for a garbage plan that will leave you bankrupt and/or dead if you have a major health crisis, you are stuck for at least six months in that trap, and won't escape without first handing over thousands of dollars to that scumbag's boss.</p><p>Amazingly enough, these aren't even the worst kinds of garbage health plans that you can buy in America: those would be the religious \"health share\" programs that sleazy evangelical \"entrepreneurs\" suck their co-religionists into, which cost the world and leave you high and dry when you or your kids get hurt or sick:</p><p>The fact that there are  of scam health insurance in America, in which companies are legally permitted to take your money and then deny you care (even more than the \"non-scam\" insurance plans do) shows you the problem with turning health into a market. \"Caveat emptor\" may make sense when you're buying a used blender at a yard-sale. Apply it to the system that's supposed to take care of you if you're diagnosed with cancer, hit by a bus, or develop eclampsia, and it's a literally fatal system.</p><p>This is just one of the ways in which the uniparty is so terrible for Americans. The Republicans want to swap out shitty regulated for-profit health insurance with disastrous unregulated for-profit health insurance, and then give you a couple thousand bucks to yolo on a plan that seems OK to you:</p><p>This is like letting Fanduel run your country's health system: everyday people are expected to place fifty-way parlay bets on their health, juggling exclusions, co-pays, deductibles, and network coverage in their head. Bet wrong, and you go bankrupt (if you're lucky), or just  (if you're not).</p><p>Democrats, meanwhile, want to maintain the (garbage) status quo (because Medicare for All is communism), and they'll shut down the government to make it clear that they want this. But then they'll capitulate, because they want it, but not  badly.</p><p>But like I say, America is an Enshittification Nation, and I don't have time or interest for cataloging mere unienshittificatory aspects of life here. To preserve my sanity and discretionary time, I must limit myself to documenting the enshittificatory scams that threaten us from every angle at once.</p><p>Which brings me back to Google. Without Google, these junk insurance scams would be confined to the margins. They'd have to resort to pyramid selling, or hand-lettered roadside signs, or undisclosed paid plugs in religious/far-right newsletters.</p><p>But because Google has utterly succumbed to enshittification, and because Google has an illegal monopoly – a 90% market share – that it maintains by bribing competitors like Apple to stay out of the search market, junk insurance scams can make bank – and ruin Americans' lives wholesale – by either tricking or paying Google to push junk insurance on unsuspecting searchers.</p><p>This isn't merely a case of Google losing the SEO and spam wars to shady operators. As we learned in last year's antitrust case (where Google was convicted of operating an illegal search monopoly), Google  worsened its search results, in order to force you to search multiple times (and see multiple screens full of ads) as a way to goose search revenue:</p><p>Google didn't just lose that one antitrust case, either. It lost  cases, as three federal judges determined that Google secured and maintains an illegal monopoly that allows it to control the single most important funnel for knowledge and truth for the majority of people on Earth. The company whose mission is to \"organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful,\" now serves slop, ads, spam and scams because its customers have nowhere to go, so why bother spending money making search  (especially when there's money to be made from  search results)?</p><p>Google isn't just too big to fail, it's also too big to jail. One of the judges who found Google guilty of maintaining an illegal monopoly decided <em>not to punish them for it</em>, and to allow them to continue bribing Apple to stay out of the search market, because (I'm not making this up), without that $20b+ annual bribe, Apple might not be able to afford to make cool new iPhone features:</p><p>Once a company is too big to fail and too big to jail, it becomes too big to . Google <em>could prevent slop, spam and scams from overrunning its results (and putting its users lives and fortunes at risk), it just *chooses</em> not to:</p><p>Google is the internet's absentee landlord. Anyone who can make a buck by scamming you can either pay Google to help, or trick Google into helping, or – as is the case with junk insurance – both:</p><p>America has the world's stupidest health care system, an industry that has grown wildly profitable by charging Americans the highest rates in the rich world, while delivering the worst health outcomes in the rich world, while slashing health workers' pay and eroding their working conditions.</p><p>It's omnienshittified, a partnership between the enshittified search giant and the shittiest parts of the totally enshittified health industry.</p><p>It's also a reminder of what we stand to gain when we finally smash Google and break it up: disciplining our search industry will make it competitive, regulatable, and force it to side with the public against all kinds of scammers. Junk insurance should be banned, but even if we just end the junk insurance industry's ability to pay the world's only major search engine to help it kill us, that would be a huge step forward.</p><ul><li>\"Unauthorized Bread\": a middle-grades graphic novel adapted from my novella about refugees, toasters and DRM, FirstSecond, 2026</li><li><p>\"Enshittification, Why Everything Suddenly Got Worse and What to Do About It\" (the graphic novel), Firstsecond, 2026</p></li><li><p>\"The Memex Method,\" Farrar, Straus, Giroux, 2026</p></li><li><p>\"The Reverse-Centaur's Guide to AI,\" a short book about being a better AI critic, Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2026</p></li></ul><ul><li>\"The Reverse Centaur's Guide to AI,\" a short book for Farrar, Straus and Giroux about being an effective AI critic.

      "content": "<p>Soon, you’ll have made it almost completely around the circle — meaning that you’ve assigned a color to all the nodes in your graph except for the ones that fall in a small, leftover segment. Say the last arc you colored was yellow. How do you color this final, smaller segment? You can’t use blue, because these nodes will connect to nodes in the original arc you colored blue. But you also can’t use yellow, because these nodes connect back to yellow ones from the previous arc.</p><p>You have to use a third color — say, green — to complete your coloring.</p><p>Still, the sets of blue, yellow and green nodes you end up with are all just pieces of the circle’s circumference, rather than the scatterings of points you ended up with when you used the axiom of choice. You can calculate the lengths of these sets. They’re measurable.</p><p>Descriptive set theorists therefore place the two-color version of the problem on the lowest shelf in their hierarchy (for unmeasurable sets), while the three-color problem goes on a much higher shelf of problems — ones where lots of notions of measure can be applied.</p><p>Bernshteyn spent his years in graduate school studying such coloring problems, shelving them one by one. Then, shortly after he finished his degree, he stumbled on a potential way to shelve them all at once — and to show that these problems have a much deeper and more mathematically relevant structure than anyone had realized.</p><p>From time to time, Bernshteyn enjoys going to computer science talks, where graphs are finite and represent networks of computers.</p><p>In 2019, one of those talks changed the course of his career. It was about “distributed algorithms” — sets of instructions that run simultaneously on multiple computers in a network to accomplish a task without a central coordinator.</p><p>Say you have a bunch of Wi-Fi routers in a building. Nearby routers can interfere with each other if they use the same communication frequency channel. So each router needs to choose a different channel from the ones used by its immediate neighbors.</p><p>Computer scientists can reframe this as a coloring problem on a graph: Represent each router as a node, and connect nearby ones with edges. Using just two colors (representing two different frequency channels), find a way to color each node so that no two connected nodes are the same color.</p><p>But there’s a catch: Nodes can only communicate with their immediate neighbors, using so-called local algorithms. First, each node runs the same algorithm and assigns itself a color. It then communicates with its neighbors to learn how other nodes are colored in a small region around it. Then it runs the algorithm again to decide whether to keep its color or switch it. It repeats this step until the whole network has a proper coloring.</p><p>Computer scientists want to know how many steps a given algorithm requires. For example, any local algorithm that can solve the router problem with only two colors must be incredibly inefficient, but it’s possible to find a very efficient local algorithm if you’re allowed to use three.</p><p>At the talk Bernshteyn was attending, the speaker discussed these thresholds for different kinds of problems. One of the thresholds, he realized, sounded a lot like a threshold that existed in the world of descriptive set theory — about the number of colors required to color certain infinite graphs in a measurable way.</p><p>To Bernshteyn, it felt like more than a coincidence. It wasn’t just that computer scientists are like librarians too, shelving problems based on how efficiently their algorithms work. It wasn’t just that these problems could also be written in terms of graphs and colorings.</p><p>Perhaps, he thought, the two bookshelves had more in common than that. Perhaps the connection between these two fields went much, much deeper.</p><p>Perhaps all the books, and their shelves, were identical, just written in different languages — and in need of a translator.</p><p>Bernshteyn set out to make this connection explicit. He wanted to show that every efficient local algorithm can be turned into a Lebesgue-measurable way of coloring an infinite graph (that satisfies some additional important properties). That is, one of computer science’s most important shelves is equivalent to one of set theory’s most important shelves (high up in the hierarchy).</p><p>He began with the class of network problems from the computer science lecture, focusing on their overarching rule — that any given node’s algorithm uses information about just its local neighborhood, whether the graph has a thousand nodes or a billion.</p><p>To run properly, all the algorithm has to do is label each node in a given neighborhood with a unique number, so that it can log information about nearby nodes and give instructions about them. That’s easy enough to do in a finite graph: Just give every node in the graph a different number.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Hi HN! For the past bit we’ve been building Flowglad (<a href=\"https://flowglad.com\">https://flowglad.com</a>) and can now feel it’s just gotten good enough to share with you all:</p><p>Flowglad is a payment processor that you integrate without writing any glue code. Along with processing your payments, it tells you in real time the features and usage credit balances that your customers have available to you based on their billing state. The DX feels like React, because we wanted to bring the reactive programming paradigm to payments.</p><p>We make it easy to spin up full-fledged pricing models (including usage meters, feature gates and usage credit grants) in a few clicks. We schematize these pricing models into a pricing.yaml file that’s kinda like Terraform but for your pricing.</p><p>The result is a payments layer that AI coding agents have a substantially easier time one-shotting (for now the happiest path is a fullstack Typescript + React app).</p><p>- After a decade of building on Stripe, we found it powerful but underopinionated. It left us doing a lot of rote work to set up fairly standard use cases\n- That meant more code to maintain, much of which is brittle because it crosses so many server-client boundaries\n- Not to mention choreographing the lifecycle of our business domain with the Stripe checkout flow and webhook event types, of which there are 250+\n- Payments online has gotten complex - not just new pricing models for AI products, but also cross border sales tax, etc. You either need to handle significant chunks of it yourself, or sign up for and compose multiple services</p><p>This all feels unduly clunky, esp when compared to how easy other layers like hosting and databases have gotten in recent years.</p><p>These patterns haven’t changed much in a decade. And while coding agents can nail every other rote part of an app (auth, db, analytics), payments is the scariest to tab-tab-tab your way through. Because the the existing integration patterns are difficult to reason about, difficult to verify correctness, and absolutely mission critical.</p><p>Our beta version lets you:</p><p>- Spin up common pricing models in just a few clicks, and customize them as needed\n- Clone pricing models between testmode and live mode, and import / export via pricing.yaml\n- Check customer usage credits and feature access in real time on your backend and React frontend\n- Integrate without any DB schema changes - you reference your customers via your ids, and reference prices, products, features and usage meters via slugs that you define</p><p>We’re still early in our journey so would love your feedback and opinions.

I think this is an interesting discussion.</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity\" rel=\"\">singularity</a></p><p>The thing which I was referring to not feeling different is, okay, such and such company announced some difficult-to-comprehend dollar amount of investment. I don’t think anyone knows what to do with that.</p><p>But I think the impact of AI is going to be felt. AI is going to be diffused through the economy. There’ll be very strong economic forces for this, and I think the impact is going to be felt very strongly.</p><p>When do you expect that impact? I think the models seem smarter than their economic impact would imply.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/2PiawPFJeyCQGcwXG/a-starter-guide-for-evals\" rel=\"\">evals</a></p><p>An example would be, let’s say you use vibe coding to do something. You go to some place and then you get a bug. Then you tell the model, “Can you please fix the bug?” And the model says, “Oh my God, you’re so right. I have a bug. Let me go fix that.” And it introduces a second bug. Then you tell it, “You have this new second bug,” and it tells you, “Oh my God, how could I have done it? You’re so right again,” and brings back the first bug, and you can alternate between those. How is that possible? I’m not sure, but it does suggest that something strange is going on.</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning\" rel=\"\">RL training</a></p><p><a href=\"https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/pre_training\" rel=\"\">pre-training</a></p><p>But when people do RL training, they do need to think. They say, “Okay, we want to have this kind of RL training for this thing and that kind of RL training for that thing.” From what I hear, all the companies have teams that just produce new RL environments and just add it to the training mix. The question is, well, what are those? There are so many degrees of freedom. There is such a huge variety of RL environments you could produce.</p><p>One thing you could do, and I think this is something that is done inadvertently, is that people take inspiration from the evals. You say, “Hey, I would love our model to do really well when we release it. I want the evals to look great. What would be RL training that could help on this task?” I think that is something that happens, and it could explain a lot of what’s going on.</p><p>If you combine this with generalization of the models actually being inadequate, that has the potential to explain a lot of what we are seeing, this disconnect between eval performance and actual real-world performance, which is something that we don’t today even understand, what we mean by that.</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reward_hacking\" rel=\"\">reward hacking</a></p><p>I think there are two ways to understand, or to try to think about, what you have just pointed out. One is that if it’s the case that simply by becoming superhuman at a coding competition, a model will not automatically become more tasteful and exercise better judgment about how to improve your codebase, well then you should expand the suite of environments such that you’re not just testing it on having the best performance in coding competition. It should also be able to make the best kind of application for X thing or Y thing or Z thing.</p><p>Another, maybe this is what you’re hinting at, is to say, “Why should it be the case in the first place that becoming superhuman at coding competitions doesn’t make you a more tasteful programmer more generally?” Maybe the thing to do is not to keep stacking up the amount and diversity of environments, but to figure out an approach which lets you learn from one environment and improve your performance on something else.</p><p>I have a human analogy which might be helpful. Let’s take the case of competitive programming, since you mentioned that. Suppose you have two students. One of them decided they want to be the best competitive programmer, so they will practice 10,000 hours for that domain. They will solve all the problems, memorize all the proof techniques, and be very skilled at quickly and correctly implementing all the algorithms. By doing so, they became one of the best.</p><p>Student number two thought, “Oh, competitive programming is cool.” Maybe they practiced for 100 hours, much less, and they also did really well. Which one do you think is going to do better in their career later on?</p><p>Right. I think that’s basically what’s going on. The models are much more like the first student, but even more. Because then we say, the model should be good at competitive programming so let’s get every single competitive programming problem ever. And then let’s do some data augmentation so we have even more competitive programming problems, and we train on that. Now you’ve got this great competitive programmer.</p><p>With this analogy, I think it’s more intuitive. Yeah, okay, if it’s so well trained, all the different algorithms and all the different proof techniques are right at its fingertips. And it’s more intuitive that with this level of preparation, it would not necessarily generalize to other things.</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine-tuning_(deep_learning)\" rel=\"\">fine-tuning</a></p><p>I think they have “it.” The “it” factor. When I was an undergrad, I remember there was a student like this that studied with me, so I know it exists.</p><p>I think it’s interesting to distinguish “it” from whatever pre-training does. One way to understand what you just said about not having to choose the data in pre-training is to say it’s actually not dissimilar to the 10,000 hours of practice. It’s just that you get that 10,000 hours of practice for free because it’s already somewhere in the pre-training distribution. But maybe you’re suggesting there’s actually not that much generalization from pre-training. There’s just so much data in pre-training, but it’s not necessarily generalizing better than RL.</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_(machine_learning)\" rel=\"\">features</a></p><p>Pre-training is very difficult to reason about because it’s so hard to understand the manner in which the model relies on pre-training data. Whenever the model makes a mistake, could it be because something by chance is not as supported by the pre-training data? “Support by pre-training” is maybe a loose term. I don’t know if I can add anything more useful on this. I don’t think there is a human analog to pre-training.</p><p><a href=\"https://gwern.net/backstop\" rel=\"\">evolution as doing some kind of search</a></p><p>I’m curious if you think either of these are analogous to pre-training. How would you think about what lifetime human learning is like, if not pre-training?</p><p><a href=\"https://www.glennklockwood.com/garden/LLM-training-datasets\" rel=\"\">amount of pre-training data</a></p><p>Somehow a human being, after even 15 years with a tiny fraction of the pre-training data, they know much less. But whatever they do know, they know much more deeply somehow. Already at that age, you would not make mistakes that our AIs make.</p><p>There is another thing. You might say, could it be something like evolution? The answer is maybe. But in this case, I think evolution might actually have an edge. I remember reading about this case. One way in which neuroscientists can learn about the brain is by studying people with brain damage to different parts of the brain. Some people have the most strange symptoms you could imagine. It’s actually really, really interesting.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2016/06/how-only-using-logic-destroyed-a-man.html\" rel=\"\">brain damage, a stroke or an accident, that took out his emotional processing</a></p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_marker_hypothesis#\" rel=\"\">role of our built-in emotions in making us a viable agent</a></p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning#State-value_function\" rel=\"\">value function</a></p><p>I think it could. I’m just saying it’s not 100% obvious.</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning\" rel=\"\">ML</a></p><p>It should be some kind of a value function thing. But I don’t think there is a great ML analogy because right now, value functions don’t play a very prominent role in the things people do.</p><p>It might be worth defining for the audience what a value function is, if you want to do that.</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning\" rel=\"\">reinforcement learning</a><a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-agents\" rel=\"\">agents</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network_(machine_learning)\" rel=\"\">neural net</a></p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI_o1\" rel=\"\">o1</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeepSeek#R1\" rel=\"\">R1</a></p><p>The value function says something like, “Maybe I could sometimes, not always, tell you if you are doing well or badly.” The notion of a value function is more useful in some domains than others. For example, when you play chess and you lose a piece, I messed up. You don’t need to play the whole game to know that what I just did was bad, and therefore whatever preceded it was also bad.</p><p>The value function lets you short-circuit the wait until the very end. Let’s suppose that you are doing some kind of a math thing or a programming thing, and you’re trying to explore a particular solution or direction. After, let’s say, a thousand steps of thinking, you concluded that this direction is unpromising. As soon as you conclude this, you could already get a reward signal a thousand timesteps previously, when you decided to pursue down this path. You say, “Next time I shouldn’t pursue this path in a similar situation,” long before you actually came up with the proposed solution.</p><p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12948\" rel=\"\">DeepSeek R1 paper</a></p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning\" rel=\"\">deep learning</a></p><p>What I was alluding to with the person whose emotional center got damaged, it’s more that maybe what it suggests is that the value function of humans is modulated by emotions in some important way that’s hardcoded by evolution. And maybe that is important for people to be effective in the world.</p><p>That’s the thing I was planning on asking you. There’s something really interesting about emotions of the value function, which is that it’s impressive that they have this much utility while still being rather simple to understand.</p><p>I have two responses. I do agree that compared to the kind of things that we learn and the things we are talking about, the kind of AI we are talking about, emotions are relatively simple. They might even be so simple that maybe you could map them out in a human-understandable way. I think it would be cool to do.</p><p>In terms of utility though, I think there is a thing where there is this complexity-robustness tradeoff, where complex things can be very useful, but simple things are very useful in a very broad range of situations. One way to interpret what we are seeing is that we’ve got these emotions that evolved mostly from our mammal ancestors and then fine-tuned a little bit while we were hominids, just a bit. We do have a decent amount of social emotions though which mammals may lack. But they’re not very sophisticated. And because they’re not sophisticated, they serve us so well in this very different world compared to the one that we’ve been living in.</p><p>Actually, they also make mistakes. For example, our emotions… Well actually, I don’t know. Does hunger count as an emotion? It’s debatable. But I think, for example, our intuitive feeling of hunger is not succeeding in guiding us correctly in this world with an abundance of food.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/model-parameters\" rel=\"\">parameters</a></p><p>Here’s a perspective that I think might be true. The way ML used to work is that people would just tinker with stuff and try to get interesting results. That’s what’s been going on in the past.</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_scaling_law\" rel=\"\">Scaling laws</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3\" rel=\"\">GPT-3</a><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4psigkM\" rel=\"\">everyone realized we should scale.</a></p><p>The big breakthrough of pre-training is the realization that this recipe is good. You say, “Hey, if you mix some compute with some data into a neural net of a certain size, you will get results. You will know that you’ll be better if you just scale the recipe up.” This is also great. Companies love this because it gives you a very low-risk way of investing your resources.</p><p>It’s much harder to invest your resources in research. Compare that. If you research, you need to be like, “Go forth researchers and research and come up with something”, versus get more data, get more compute. You know you’ll get something from pre-training.</p><p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/49vUsb0\" rel=\"\">age of scaling</a></p><p>But now the scale is so big. Is the belief really, “Oh, it’s so big, but if you had 100x more, everything would be so different?” It would be different, for sure. But is the belief that if you just 100x the scale, everything would be transformed? I don’t think that’s true. So it’s back to the age of research again, just with big computers.</p><p>That’s a very interesting way to put it. But let me ask you the question you just posed then. What are we scaling, and what would it mean to have a recipe? I guess I’m not aware of a very clean relationship that almost looks like a law of physics which existed in pre-training. There was a power law between data or compute or parameters and loss. What is the kind of relationship we should be seeking, and how should we think about what this new recipe might look like?</p><p><a href=\"https://robotics.stackexchange.com/questions/16596/what-is-the-definition-of-rollout-in-neural-network-or-openai-gym\" rel=\"\">rollouts</a></p><p>I wouldn’t even call it scaling. I would say, “Hey, what are you doing? Is the thing you are doing the most productive thing you could be doing? Can you find a more productive way of using your compute?” We’ve discussed the value function business earlier. Maybe once people get good at value functions, they will be using their resources more productively. If you find a whole other way of training models, you could say, “Is this scaling or is it just using your resources?” I think it becomes a little bit ambiguous.</p><p>In the sense that, when people were in the age of research back then, it was, “Let’s try this and this and this. Let’s try that and that and that. Oh, look, something interesting is happening.” I think there will be a return to that.</p><p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15594\" rel=\"\">LLM-as-a-Judge</a></p><p>The discussion about value function, I think it was interesting. I want to emphasize that I think the value function is something that’s going to make RL more efficient, and I think that makes a difference. But I think anything you can do with a value function, you can do without, just more slowly. The thing which I think is the most fundamental is that these models somehow just generalize dramatically worse than people. It’s super obvious. That seems like a very fundamental thing.</p><p><a href=\"https://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/5246/what-is-sample-efficiency-and-how-can-importance-sampling-be-used-to-achieve-it\" rel=\"\">sample efficiency</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/continual-learning\" rel=\"\">continual learning</a></p><p>You could actually wonder that one possible explanation for the human sample efficiency that needs to be considered is evolution. Evolution has given us a small amount of the most useful information possible. For things like vision, hearing, and locomotion, I think there’s a pretty strong case that evolution has given us a lot.</p><p>For example, human dexterity far exceeds… I mean robots can become dexterous too if you subject them to a huge amount of training in simulation. But to train a robot in the real world to quickly pick up a new skill like a person does seems very out of reach. Here you could say, “Oh yeah, locomotion. All our ancestors needed great locomotion, squirrels. So with locomotion, maybe we’ve got some unbelievable prior.”</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yann_LeCun\" rel=\"\">Yann LeCun</a></p><p>But you could say maybe that’s evolution too. But in language and math and coding, probably not.</p><p>It still seems better than models. Obviously, models are better than the average human at language, math, and coding. But are they better than the average human at learning?</p><p>Oh yeah. Oh yeah, absolutely. What I meant to say is that language, math, and coding—and especially math and coding—suggests that whatever it is that makes people good at learning is probably not so much a complicated prior, but something more, some fundamental thing.</p><p>I’m not sure I understood. Why should that be the case?</p><p>So consider a skill in which people exhibit some kind of great reliability. If the skill is one that was very useful to our ancestors for many millions of years, hundreds of millions of years, you could argue that maybe humans are good at it because of evolution, because we have a prior, an evolutionary prior that’s encoded in some very non-obvious way that somehow makes us so good at it.</p><p>But if people exhibit great ability, reliability, robustness, and ability to learn in a domain that really did not exist until recently, then this is more an indication that people might have just better machine learning, period.</p><p>How should we think about what that is? What is the ML analogy? There are a couple of interesting things about it. It takes fewer samples. It’s more unsupervised. A child learning to drive a car… Children are not learning to drive a car. A teenager learning how to drive a car is not exactly getting some prebuilt, verifiable reward. It comes from their interaction with the machine and with the environment. It takes much fewer samples. It seems more unsupervised. It seems more robust?</p><p>Much more robust. The robustness of people is really staggering.</p><p>Do you have a unified way of thinking about why all these things are happening at once? What is the ML analogy that could realize something like this?</p><p>One of the things that you’ve been asking about is how can the teenage driver self-correct and learn from their experience without an external teacher? The answer is that they have their value function. They have a general sense which is also, by the way, extremely robust in people. Whatever the human value function is, with a few exceptions around addiction, it’s actually very, very robust.</p><p>So for something like a teenager that’s learning to drive, they start to drive, and they already have a sense of how they’re driving immediately, how badly they are, how unconfident. And then they see, “Okay.” And then, of course, the learning speed of any teenager is so fast. After 10 hours, you’re good to go.</p><p>It seems like humans have some solution, but I’m curious about how they are doing it and why is it so hard? How do we need to reconceptualize the way we’re training models to make something like this possible?</p><p>That is a great question to ask, and it’s a question I have a lot of opinions about. But unfortunately, we live in a world where not all machine learning ideas are discussed freely, and this is one of them. There’s probably a way to do it. I think it can be done. The fact that people are like that, I think it’s a proof that it can be done.</p><p>There may be another blocker though, which is that there is a possibility that the human neurons do more compute than we think. If that is true, and if that plays an important role, then things might be more difficult. But regardless, I do think it points to the existence of some machine learning principle that I have opinions on. But unfortunately, circumstances make it hard to discuss in detail.</p><p>Nobody listens to this podcast, Ilya.</p><p>I’m curious. If you say we are back in an era of research, you were there from 2012 to 2020. What is the vibe now going to be if we go back to the era of research?</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlexNet\" rel=\"\">AlexNet</a></p><p>You were at Google and OpenAI and Stanford, these places, when there was more of a vibe of research? What kind of things should we be expecting in the community?</p><p>One consequence of the age of scaling is that scaling sucked out all the air in the room. Because scaling sucked out all the air in the room, everyone started to do the same thing. We got to the point where we are in a world where there are more companies than ideas by quite a bit. Actually on that, there is this Silicon Valley saying that says that ideas are cheap, execution is everything. People say that a lot, and there is truth to that. But then I saw someone say on Twitter something like, “If ideas are so cheap, how come no one’s having any ideas?” And I think it’s true too.</p><p>If you think about research progress in terms of bottlenecks, there are several bottlenecks. One of them is ideas, and one of them is your ability to bring them to life, which might be compute but also engineering. If you go back to the ‘90s, let’s say, you had people who had pretty good ideas, and if they had much larger computers, maybe they could demonstrate that their ideas were viable. But they could not, so they could only have a very, very small demonstration that did not convince anyone. So the bottleneck was compute.</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit\" rel=\"\">GPUs</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(deep_learning)\" rel=\"\">transformer</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residual_neural_network\" rel=\"\">ResNet</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI_o1\" rel=\"\">o1 reasoning</a></p><p>So for research, you definitely need some amount of compute, but it’s far from obvious that you need the absolutely largest amount of compute ever for research. You might argue, and I think it is true, that if you want to build the absolutely best system then it helps to have much more compute. Especially if everyone is within the same paradigm, then compute becomes one of the big differentiators.</p><p>I’m asking you for the history, because you were actually there. I’m not sure what actually happened. It sounds like it was possible to develop these ideas using minimal amounts of compute. But the transformer didn’t immediately become famous. It became the thing everybody started doing and then started experimenting on top of and building on top of because it was validated at higher and higher levels of compute.</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_Superintelligence_Inc.\" rel=\"\">SSI</a></p><p>I can comment on that. The short comment is that you mentioned SSI. Specifically for us, the amount of compute that SSI has for research is really not that small. I want to explain why. Simple math can explain why the amount of compute that we have is comparable for research than one might think. I’ll explain.</p><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/12/openai-co-founder-ilya-sutskevers-safe-superintelligence-reportedly-valued-at-32b/\" rel=\"\">SSI has raised $3 billion</a><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/discover/what-is-ai-inference\" rel=\"\">inference</a></p><p>The other thing is, if you are doing something different, do you really need the absolute maximal scale to prove it? I don’t think that’s true at all. I think that in our case, we have sufficient compute to prove, to convince ourselves and anyone else, that what we are doing is correct.</p><p>There have been public estimates that companies like OpenAI spend on the order of $5-6 billion a year just so far, on experiments. This is separate from the amount of money they’re spending on inference and so forth. So it seems like they’re spending more a year running research experiments than you guys have in total funding.</p><p>I think it’s a question of what you do with it. It’s a question of what you do with it. In their case, in the case of others, there is a lot more demand on the training compute. There’s a lot more different work streams, there are different modalities, there is just more stuff. So it becomes fragmented.</p><p>My answer to this question is something like this. Right now, we just focus on the research, and then the answer to that question will reveal itself. I think there will be lots of possible answers.</p><p>Is SSI’s plan still to straight shot superintelligence?</p><p>Maybe. I think that there is merit to it. I think there’s a lot of merit because it’s very nice to not be affected by the day-to-day market competition. But I think there are two reasons that may cause us to change the plan. One is pragmatic, if timelines turned out to be long, which they might. Second, I think there is a lot of value in the best and most powerful AI being out there impacting the world. I think this is a meaningfully valuable thing.</p><p>So then why is your default plan to straight shot superintelligence? Because it sounds like OpenAI, Anthropic, all these other companies, their explicit thinking is, “Look, we have weaker and weaker intelligences that the public can get used to and prepare for.” Why is it potentially better to build a superintelligence directly?</p><p>I’ll make the case for and against. The case for is that one of the challenges that people face when they’re in the market is that they have to participate in the rat race. The rat race is quite difficult in that it exposes you to difficult trade-offs which you need to make. It is nice to say, “We’ll insulate ourselves from all this and just focus on the research and come out only when we are ready, and not before.” But the counterpoint is valid too, and those are opposing forces. The counterpoint is, “Hey, it is useful for the world to see powerful AI. It is useful for the world to see powerful AI because that’s the only way you can communicate it.”</p><p>Well, I guess not even just that you can communicate the idea—</p><p>Communicate the AI, not the idea. Communicate the AI.</p><p>What do you mean, “communicate the AI”?</p><p>Let’s suppose you write an essay about AI, and the essay says, “AI is going to be this, and AI is going to be that, and it’s going to be this.” You read it and you say, “Okay, this is an interesting essay.” Now suppose you see an AI doing this, an AI doing that. It is incomparable. Basically I think that there is a big benefit from AI being in the public, and that would be a reason for us to not be quite straight shot.</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux\" rel=\"\">Linux</a></p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_convergence#Paperclip_maximizer\" rel=\"\">malevolent paper clipper</a></p><p>Well I think on this point, even in the straight shot scenario, you would still do a gradual release of it, that’s how I would imagine it. Gradualism would be an inherent component of any plan. It’s just a question of what is the first thing that you get out of the door. That’s number one.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/timelines-june-2025\" rel=\"\">you have advocated for continual learning more than other people</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence\" rel=\"\">AGI</a></p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_artificial_intelligence\" rel=\"\">narrow AI</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_in_video_games\" rel=\"\">gameplay and AI</a><a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/history/early-games\" rel=\"\">checkers AI</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_chess_engines\" rel=\"\">chess AI</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaStar_(software)\" rel=\"\">computer games AI</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_versus_Garry_Kasparov\" rel=\"\">chess AI can beat Kasparov</a></p><p>The second thing that got a lot of traction is pre-training, specifically the recipe of pre-training. I think the way people do RL now is maybe undoing the conceptual imprint of pre-training. But pre-training had this property. You do more pre-training and the model gets better at everything, more or less uniformly. General AI. Pre-training gives AGI.</p><p>But the thing that happened with AGI and pre-training is that in some sense they overshot the target. If you think about the term “AGI”, especially in the context of pre-training, you will realize that a human being is not an AGI. Yes, there is definitely a foundation of skills, but a human being lacks a huge amount of knowledge. Instead, we rely on continual learning.</p><p>So when you think about, “Okay, so let’s suppose that we achieve success and we produce some kind of safe superintelligence.” The question is, how do you define it? Where on the curve of continual learning is it going to be?</p><p>I produce a superintelligent 15-year-old that’s very eager to go. They don’t know very much at all, a great student, very eager. You go and be a programmer, you go and be a doctor, go and learn. So you could imagine that the deployment itself will involve some kind of a learning trial-and-error period. It’s a process, as opposed to you dropping the finished thing.</p><p><a href=\"https://openai.com/charter/\" rel=\"\">OpenAI charter</a></p><p>But once you have the learning algorithm, it gets deployed into the world the same way a human laborer might join an organization.</p><p>It seems like one of these two things might happen, maybe neither of these happens. One, this super-efficient learning algorithm becomes superhuman, becomes as good as you and potentially even better, at the task of ML research. As a result the algorithm itself becomes more and more superhuman.</p><p>The other is, even if that doesn’t happen, if you have a single model—this is explicitly your vision—where instances of a model which are deployed through the economy doing different jobs, learning how to do those jobs, continually learning on the job, picking up all the skills that any human could pick up, but picking them all up at the same time, and then amalgamating their learnings, you basically have a model which functionally becomes superintelligent even without any sort of recursive self-improvement in software. Because you now have one model that can do every single job in the economy and humans can’t merge our minds in the same way. So do you expect some sort of intelligence explosion from broad deployment?</p><p>I think that it is likely that we will have rapid economic growth. I think with broad deployment, there are two arguments you could make which are conflicting. One is that once indeed you get to a point where you have an AI that can learn to do things quickly and you have many of them, then there will be a strong force to deploy them in the economy unless there will be some kind of a regulation that stops it, which by the way there might be.</p><p>But the idea of very rapid economic growth for some time, I think it’s very possible from broad deployment. The question is how rapid it’s going to be. I think this is hard to know because on the one hand you have this very efficient worker. On the other hand, the world is just really big and there’s a lot of stuff, and that stuff moves at a different speed. But then on the other hand, now the AI could… So I think very rapid economic growth is possible. We will see all kinds of things like different countries with different rules and the ones which have the friendlier rules, the economic growth will be faster. Hard to predict.</p><p>It seems to me that this is a very precarious situation to be in. In the limit, we know that this should be possible. If you have something that is as good as a human at learning, but which can merge its brains—merge different instances in a way that humans can’t merge—already, this seems like a thing that should physically be possible. Humans are possible, digital computers are possible. You just need both of those combined to produce this thing.</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_sphere\" rel=\"\">Dyson sphere</a></p><p>One of the ways in which my thinking has been changing is that I now place more importance on AI being deployed incrementally and in advance. One very difficult thing about AI is that we are talking about systems that don’t yet exist and it’s hard to imagine them.</p><p>I think that one of the things that’s happening is that in practice, it’s very hard to feel the AGI. It’s very hard to feel the AGI. We can talk about it, but imagine having a conversation about how it is like to be old when you’re old and frail. You can have a conversation, you can try to imagine it, but it’s just hard, and you come back to reality where that’s not the case. I think that a lot of the issues around AGI and its future power stem from the fact that it’s very difficult to imagine. Future AI is going to be different. It’s going to be powerful. Indeed, the whole problem, what is the problem of AI and AGI? The whole problem is the power. The whole problem is the power.</p><p>When the power is really big, what’s going to happen? One of the ways in which I’ve changed my mind over the past year—and that change of mind, I’ll hedge a little bit, may back-propagate into the plans of our company—is that if it’s hard to imagine, what do you do? You’ve got to be showing the thing. You’ve got to be showing the thing. I maintain that most people who work on AI also can’t imagine it because it’s too different from what people see on a day-to-day basis.</p><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/27/openai-co-founder-calls-for-ai-labs-to-safety-test-rival-models/\" rel=\"\">OpenAI and Anthropic doing a first small step</a></p><p>That’s number one. Number two, okay, so the AI is being built. What needs to be done? One thing that I maintain that will happen is that right now, people who are working on AI, I maintain that the AI doesn’t feel powerful because of its mistakes. I do think that at some point the AI will start to feel powerful actually. I think when that happens, we will see a big change in the way all AI companies approach safety. They’ll become much more paranoid. I say this as a prediction that we will see happen. We’ll see if I’m right. But I think this is something that will happen because they will see the AI becoming more powerful. Everything that’s happening right now, I maintain, is because people look at today’s AI and it’s hard to imagine the future AI.</p><p>There is a third thing which needs to happen. I’m talking about it in broader terms, not just from the perspective of SSI because you asked me about our company. The question is, what should the companies aspire to build? What should they aspire to build? There has been one big idea that everyone has been locked into, which is the self-improving AI. Why did it happen? Because there are fewer ideas than companies. But I maintain that there is something that’s better to build, and I think that everyone will want that.</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_neuron\" rel=\"\">mirror neurons</a><a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-animal/\" rel=\"\">human empathy for animals</a></p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_alignment\" rel=\"\">alignment</a></p><p>It’s true. It’s possible it’s not the best criterion. I’ll say two things. Number one, care for sentient life, I think there is merit to it. It should be considered. I think it would be helpful if there was some kind of short list of ideas that the companies, when they are in this situation, could use. That’s number two.</p><p>Number three, I think it would be really materially helpful if the power of the most powerful superintelligence was somehow capped because it would address a lot of these concerns. The question of how to do it, I’m not sure, but I think that would be materially helpful when you’re talking about really, really powerful systems.</p><p>Before we continue the alignment discussion, I want to double-click on that. How much room is there at the top? How do you think about superintelligence? Do you think, using this learning efficiency idea, maybe it is just extremely fast at learning new skills or new knowledge? Does it just have a bigger pool of strategies? Is there a single cohesive “it” in the center that’s more powerful or bigger? If so, do you imagine that this will be sort of godlike in comparison to the rest of human civilization, or does it just feel like another agent, or another cluster of agents?</p><p>This is an area where different people have different intuitions. I think it will be very powerful, for sure. What I think is most likely to happen is that there will be multiple such AIs being created roughly at the same time. I think that if the cluster is big enough—like if the cluster is literally continent-sized—that thing could be really powerful, indeed. If you literally have a continent-sized cluster, those AIs can be very powerful. All I can tell you is that if you’re talking about extremely powerful AIs, truly dramatically powerful, it would be nice if they could be restrained in some ways or if there were some kind of agreement or something.</p><p>What is the concern of superintelligence? What is one way to explain the concern? If you imagine a system that is sufficiently powerful, really sufficiently powerful—and you could say you need to do something sensible like care for sentient life in a very single-minded way—we might not like the results. That’s really what it is.</p><p>Maybe, by the way, the answer is that you do not build an RL agent in the usual sense. I’ll point several things out. I think human beings are semi-RL agents. We pursue a reward, and then the emotions or whatever make us tire out of the reward and we pursue a different reward. The market is a very short-sighted kind of agent. Evolution is the same. Evolution is very intelligent in some ways, but very dumb in other ways. The government has been designed to be a never-ending fight between three parts, which has an effect. So I think things like this.</p><p>Another thing that makes this discussion difficult is that we are talking about systems that don’t exist, that we don’t know how to build. That’s the other thing and that’s actually my belief. I think what people are doing right now will go some distance and then peter out. It will continue to improve, but it will also not be “it”. The “It” we don’t know how to build, and a lot hinges on understanding reliable generalization.</p><p>I’ll say another thing. One of the things that you could say about what causes alignment to be difficult is that your ability to learn human values is fragile. Then your ability to optimize them is fragile. You actually learn to optimize them. And can’t you say, “Are these not all instances of unreliable generalization?” Why is it that human beings appear to generalize so much better? What if generalization was much better? What would happen in this case? What would be the effect? But those questions are right now still unanswerable.</p><p>How does one think about what AI going well looks like? You’ve scoped out how AI might evolve. We’ll have these sort of continual learning agents. AI will be very powerful. Maybe there will be many different AIs. How do you think about lots of continent-sized compute intelligences going around? How dangerous is that? How do we make that less dangerous? And how do we do that in a way that protects an equilibrium where there might be misaligned AIs out there and bad actors out there?</p><p>Here’s one reason why I liked “AI that cares for sentient life”. We can debate on whether it’s good or bad. But if the first N of these dramatic systems do care for, love, humanity or something, care for sentient life, obviously this also needs to be achieved. This needs to be achieved. So if this is achieved by the first N of those systems, then I can see it go well, at least for quite some time.</p><p>Then there is the question of what happens in the long run. How do you achieve a long-run equilibrium? I think that there, there is an answer as well. I don’t like this answer, but it needs to be considered.</p><p>In the long run, you might say, “Okay, if you have a world where powerful AIs exist, in the short term, you could say you have universal high income. You have universal high income and we’re all doing well.” But what do the Buddhists say? “Change is the only constant.” Things change. There is some kind of government, political structure thing, and it changes because these things have a shelf life. Some new government thing comes up and it functions, and then after some time it stops functioning. That’s something that we see happening all the time.</p><p>So I think for the long-run equilibrium, one approach is that you could say maybe every person will have an AI that will do their bidding, and that’s good. If that could be maintained indefinitely, that’s true. But the downside with that is then the AI goes and earns money for the person and advocates for their needs in the political sphere, and maybe then writes a little report saying, “Okay, here’s what I’ve done, here’s the situation,” and the person says, “Great, keep it up.” But the person is no longer a participant. Then you can say that’s a precarious place to be in.</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuralink\" rel=\"\">Neuralink</a></p><p>I wonder if the fact that emotions which were developed millions—or in many cases, billions—of years ago in a totally different environment are still guiding our actions so strongly is an example of alignment success.</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstem\" rel=\"\">brainstem</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex\" rel=\"\">cortex</a></p><p>I think there’s a more general point. I think it’s actually really mysterious how evolution encodes high-level desires. It’s pretty easy to understand how evolution would endow us with the desire for food that smells good because smell is a chemical, so just pursue that chemical. It’s very easy to imagine evolution doing that thing.</p><p>But evolution also has endowed us with all these social desires. We really care about being seen positively by society. We care about being in good standing. All these social intuitions that we have, I feel strongly that they’re baked in. I don’t know how evolution did it because it’s a high-level concept that’s represented in the brain.</p><p>Let’s say you care about some social thing, it’s not a low-level signal like smell. It’s not something for which there is a sensor. The brain needs to do a lot of processing to piece together lots of bits of information to understand what’s going on socially. Somehow evolution said, “That’s what you should care about.” How did it do it?</p><p>It did it quickly, too. All these sophisticated social things that we care about, I think they evolved pretty recently. Evolution had an easy time hard-coding this high-level desire. I’m unaware of a good hypothesis for how it’s done. I had some ideas I was kicking around, but none of them are satisfying.</p><p>What’s especially impressive is it was desire that you learned in your lifetime, it makes sense because your brain is intelligent. It makes sense why you would be able to learn intelligent desires. Maybe this is not your point, but one way to understand it is that the desire is built into the genome, and the genome is not intelligent. But you’re somehow able to describe this feature. It’s not even clear how you define that feature, and you can build it into the genes.</p><p>Essentially, or maybe I’ll put it differently. If you think about the tools that are available to the genome, it says, “Okay, here’s a recipe for building a brain.” You could say, “Here is a recipe for connecting the dopamine neurons to the smell sensor.” And if the smell is a certain kind of good smell, you want to eat that.</p><p>I could imagine the genome doing that. I’m claiming that it is harder to imagine. It’s harder to imagine the genome saying you should care about some complicated computation that your entire brain, a big chunk of your brain, does. That’s all I’m claiming. I can tell you a speculation of how it could be done. Let me offer a speculation, and I’ll explain why the speculation is probably false.</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex\" rel=\"\">cortex</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_processing_in_the_brain\" rel=\"\">speech processing</a></p><p>All the regions are mostly located in the same place from person to person. So maybe evolution hard-coded literally a location on the brain. So it says, “Oh, when the GPS coordinates of the brain such and such, when that fires, that’s what you should care about.” Maybe that’s what evolution did because that would be within the toolkit of evolution.</p><p>Yeah, although there are examples where, for example, people who are born blind have that area of their cortex adopted by another sense. I have no idea, but I’d be surprised if the desires or the reward functions which require a visual signal no longer worked for people who have their different areas of their cortex co-opted.</p><p>For example, if you no longer have vision, can you still feel the sense that I want people around me to like me and so forth, which usually there are also visual cues for.</p><p>I fully agree with that. I think there’s an even stronger counterargument to this theory. There are people who get half of their brains removed in childhood, and they still have all their brain regions. But they all somehow move to just one hemisphere, which suggests that the brain regions, their location is not fixed and so that theory is not true.</p><p>It would have been cool if it was true, but it’s not. So I think that’s a mystery. But it’s an interesting mystery. The fact is that somehow evolution was able to endow us to care about social stuff very, very reliably. Even people who have all kinds of strange mental conditions and deficiencies and emotional problems tend to care about this also.</p><p>What is SSI planning on doing differently? Presumably your plan is to be one of the frontier companies when this time arrives. Presumably you started SSI because you’re like, “I think I have a way of approaching how to do this safely in a way that the other companies don’t.” What is that difference?</p><p>The way I would describe it is that there are some ideas that I think are promising and I want to investigate them and see if they are indeed promising or not. It’s really that simple. It’s an attempt. If the ideas turn out to be correct—these ideas that we discussed around understanding generalization—then I think we will have something worthy.</p><p>Will they turn out to be correct? We are doing research. We are squarely an “age of research” company. We are making progress. We’ve actually made quite good progress over the past year, but we need to keep making more progress, more research. That’s how I see it. I see it as an attempt to be a voice and a participant.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/command-line-newsletter/690720/meta-buy-thinking-machines-perplexity-safe-superintelligence\" rel=\"\">Meta came in and offered to acquire us</a></p><p>It sounds like SSI’s plan is to be a company that is at the frontier when you get to this very important period in human history where you have superhuman intelligence. You have these ideas about how to make superhuman intelligence go well. But other companies will be trying their own ideas. What distinguishes SSI’s approach to making superintelligence go well?</p><p>The main thing that distinguishes SSI is its technical approach. We have a different technical approach that I think is worthy and we are pursuing it.</p><p>I maintain that in the end there will be a convergence of strategies. I think there will be a convergence of strategies where at some point, as AI becomes more powerful, it’s going to become more or less clearer to everyone what the strategy should be. It should be something like, you need to find some way to talk to each other and you want your first actual real superintelligent AI to be aligned and somehow care for sentient life, care for people, democratic, one of those, some combination thereof.</p><p>Speaking of forecasts, what are your forecasts to this system you’re describing, which can learn as well as a human and subsequently, as a result, become superhuman?</p><p>I just want to unroll how you might see the world coming. It’s like, we have a couple more years where these other companies are continuing the current approach and it stalls out. “Stalls out” here meaning they earn no more than low hundreds of billions in revenue? How do you think about what stalling out means?</p><p>I think stalling out will look like…it will all look very similar among all the different companies. It could be something like this. I’m not sure because I think even with stalling out, I think these companies could make a stupendous revenue. Maybe not profits because they will need to work hard to differentiate each other from themselves, but revenue definitely.</p><p>But something in your model implies that when the correct solution does emerge, there will be convergence between all the companies. I’m curious why you think that’s the case.</p><p>I was talking more about convergence on their alignment strategies. I think eventual convergence on the technical approach is probably going to happen as well, but I was alluding to convergence to the alignment strategies. What exactly is the thing that should be done?</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking_Machines_Lab\" rel=\"\">Thinking Machines</a></p><p>I think it won’t be clear how to do it, but it will be clear that something different is possible, and that is information. People will then be trying to figure out how that works. I do think though that one of the things not addressed here, not discussed, is that with each increase in the AI’s capabilities, I think there will be some kind of changes, but I don’t know exactly which ones, in how things are being done. I think it’s going to be important, yet I can’t spell out what that is exactly.</p><p>By default, you would expect the company that has that model to be getting all these gains because they have the model that has the skills and knowledge that it’s building up in the world. What is the reason to think that the benefits of that would be widely distributed and not just end up at whatever model company gets this continuous learning loop going first?</p><p>Here is what I think is going to happen. Number one, let’s look at how things have gone so far with the AIs of the past. One company produced an advance and the other company scrambled and produced some similar things after some amount of time and they started to compete in the market and push the prices down. So I think from the market perspective, something similar will happen there as well.</p><p>We are talking about the good world, by the way. What’s the good world? It’s where we have these powerful human-like learners that are also… By the way, maybe there’s another thing we haven’t discussed on the spec of the superintelligent AI that I think is worth considering. It’s that you make it narrow, it can be useful and narrow at the same time. You can have lots of narrow superintelligent AIs.</p><p>But suppose you have many of them and you have some company that’s producing a lot of profits from it. Then you have another company that comes in and starts to compete. The way the competition is going to work is through specialization. Competition loves specialization. You see it in the market, you see it in evolution as well. You’re going to have lots of different niches and you’re going to have lots of different companies who are occupying different niches. In this world we might say one AI company is really quite a bit better at some area of really complicated economic activity and a different company is better at another area. And the third company is really good at litigation.</p><p>Isn’t this contradicted by what human-like learning implies? It’s that it can learn…</p><p>It can, but you have accumulated learning. You have a big investment. You spent a lot of compute to become really, really good, really phenomenal at this thing. Someone else spent a huge amount of compute and a huge amount of experience to get really good at some other thing. You apply a lot of human learning to get there, but now you are at this high point where someone else would say, “Look, I don’t want to start learning what you’ve learned.”</p><p>I guess that would require many different companies to begin at the human-like continual learning agent at the same time so that they can start their different tree search in different branches. But if one company gets that agent first, or gets that learner first, it does then seem like… Well, if you just think about every single job in the economy, having an instance learning each one seems tractable for a company.</p><p>That’s a valid argument. My strong intuition is that it’s not how it’s going to go. The argument says it will go this way, but my strong intuition is that it will not go this way. In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. In practice, there is. I think that’s going to be one of those.</p><p>A lot of people’s models of recursive self-improvement literally, explicitly state we will have a million Ilyas in a server that are coming up with different ideas, and this will lead to a superintelligence emerging very fast.</p><p>Do you have some intuition about how parallelizable the thing you are doing is? What are the gains from making copies of Ilya?</p><p>I don’t know. I think there’ll definitely be diminishing returns because you want people who think differently rather than the same. If there were literal copies of me, I’m not sure how much more incremental value you’d get. People who think differently, that’s what you want.</p><p>Why is it that if you look at different models, even released by totally different companies trained on potentially non-overlapping datasets, it’s actually crazy how similar LLMs are to each other?</p><p>Maybe the datasets are not as non-overlapping as it seems.</p><p>But there’s some sense in which even if an individual human might be less productive than the future AI, maybe there’s something to the fact that human teams have more diversity than teams of AIs might have. How do we elicit meaningful diversity among AIs? I think just raising the temperature just results in gibberish. You want something more like different scientists have different prejudices or different ideas. How do you get that kind of diversity among AI agents?</p><p><a href=\"https://www.interconnects.ai/p/the-state-of-post-training-2025\" rel=\"\">post-training</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hMHFKgX5uqD4PE59c/an-observation-on-self-play\" rel=\"\">hint in the past</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-play\" rel=\"\">self-play</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model\" rel=\"\">LLMs</a></p><p>I would say there are two things to say. The reason why I thought self-play was interesting is because it offered a way to create models using compute only, without data. If you think that data is the ultimate bottleneck, then using compute only is very interesting. So that’s what makes it interesting.</p><p>The thing is that self-play, at least the way it was done in the past—when you have agents which somehow compete with each other—it’s only good for developing a certain set of skills. It is too narrow. It’s only good for negotiation, conflict, certain social skills, strategizing, that kind of stuff. If you care about those skills, then self-play will be useful.</p><p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13692\" rel=\"\">prover-verifier</a><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15594\" rel=\"\">LLM-as-a-Judge</a></p><p>Really self-play is a special case of more general competition between agents. The natural response to competition is to try to be different. So if you were to put multiple agents together and you tell them, “You all need to work on some problem and you are an agent and you’re inspecting what everyone else is working,” they’re going to say, “Well, if they’re already taking this approach, it’s not clear I should pursue it. I should pursue something differentiated.” So I think something like this could also create an incentive for a diversity of approaches.</p><p>Final question: What is research taste? You’re obviously the person in the world who is considered to have the best taste in doing research in AI. You were the co-author on the biggest things that have happened in the history of deep learning, from AlexNet to GPT-3 to so on. What is it, how do you characterize how you come up with these ideas?</p><p>I can comment on this for myself. I think different people do it differently. One thing that guides me personally is an aesthetic of how AI should be, by thinking about how people are, but thinking correctly. It’s very easy to think about how people are incorrectly, but what does it mean to think about people correctly?</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neuron\" rel=\"\">artificial neuron</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyrification\" rel=\"\">folds</a></p><p><a href=\"https://web.stanford.edu/~jlmcc/papers/PDP/Chapter3.pdf\" rel=\"\">distributed representation</a></p><p>I think that’s been guiding me a fair bit, thinking from multiple angles and looking for almost beauty, beauty and simplicity. Ugliness, there’s no room for ugliness. It’s beauty, simplicity, elegance, correct inspiration from the brain. All of those things need to be present at the same time. The more they are present, the more confident you can be in a top-down belief.</p><p>The top-down belief is the thing that sustains you when the experiments contradict you. Because if you trust the data all the time, well sometimes you can be doing the correct thing but there’s a bug. But you don’t know that there is a bug. How can you tell that there is a bug? How do you know if you should keep debugging or you conclude it’s the wrong direction? It’s the top-down. You can say things have to be this way. Something like this has to work, therefore we’ve got to keep going. That’s the top-down, and it’s based on this multifaceted beauty and inspiration by the brain.</p><p>Alright, we’ll leave it there.</p>",

      "content": "<div>\nHow we achieved 20% faster mobile response times, improved SEO, and reduced infrastructure load.\n</div><p>How we achieved 20% faster mobile response times, improved SEO, and reduced infrastructure load.</p><p>Until now, when you visited a wiki (like ), the server responded in one of two ways: a desktop page, or a redirect to the equivalent mobile URL (like ). This mobile URL in turn served the mobile version of the page from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki\">MediaWiki</a>. Our servers have operated this way since 2011, when we deployed MobileFrontend.</p><p>Over the past two months we unified the mobile and desktop domain for all wikis (<a href=\"https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Requests_for_comment/Mobile_domain_sunsetting/2025_Announcement#Timeline\">timeline</a>). This means we no longer redirect mobile users to a separate domain while the page is loading.</p><p>We completed the change on Wednesday 8 October after deploying to English Wikipedia. The mobile domains became dormant within 24 hours, which confirms that most mobile traffic arrived on Wikipedia via the standard domains and thus experienced a redirect until now.</p><p>Why did we have a separate mobile domain? And, why did we believe that changing this might benefit us?</p><p>The year is 2008 and all sorts of websites large and small have a mobile subdomain. The BBC, IMDb, Facebook, and newspapers around the world all featured the iconic m-dot domain. For Wikipedia, a separate mobile domain made the mobile experiment low-risk to launch and avoided technical limitations. It became the default in 2011 by way of a redirect.</p><p>Fast-forward seventeen years, and much has changed. It is no longer common for websites to have m-dot domains. Wikipedia’s use of it is surprising to our present day audience, and it may decrease the perceived strength of domain branding. The technical limitations we had in 2008 have long been solved, with the <a href=\"https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/CDN\">Wikimedia CDN</a> having efficient and well-tested support for variable responses under a single URL. And above all, we had reason to believe Google stopped supporting separate mobile domains, which motivated the project to start when it did.</p><p>Google used to link from mobile search results directly to our mobile domain, but last year this stopped. This exposed a huge part of our audience to the mobile redirect and regressed mobile response times by 10-20%.</p><p>Google supported mobile domains in 2008 by letting you advertise a separate mobile URL. While Google only indexed the desktop site for content, they stored this mobile URL and linked to it when searching from a mobile device. This allowed Google referrals to skip over the redirect.</p><p>Google introduced a new crawler in 2016, and gradually re-indexed the Internet with it. This new “mobile-first” crawler acts like a mobile device rather than a desktop device, and removes the ability to advertise a separate mobile or desktop link. It’s now one link for everyone! Wikipedia.org was among the last sites Google switched, with May 2024 as the apparent change window. This meant the 60% of incoming pageviews referred by Google, now had to wait for the same redirect that the other 40% of referrals have experienced since 2011.</p><p>Unifying our domains eliminated the redirect and led to a <strong>20% improvement in mobile response times</strong>. This improvement is both a recovery  a net-improvement because it applies to everyone! It recovers the regression that Google-referred traffic started to experience last year, but also improves response times for all other traffic by the same amount.</p><p>The graphs below show how the change was felt worldwide. The “Worldwide p50” corresponds to what you might experience in Germany or Italy, with fast connectivity close to our data centers. The “Worldwide p80” resembles what you might experience in Iran browsing the Persian Wikipedia.</p><p>The first site affected was not Wikipedia but Commons. <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/\">Wikimedia Commons</a> is the free media repository used by Wikipedia and its sister projects. Tim Starling found in June that only half of the 140 million pages on Commons were known to Google. And of these known pages, 20 million were also delisted due to the mobile redirect. This had been growing by one million delisted pages every month. The cause for delisting turned out to be the mobile redirect. You see, the new Google crawler, just like your browser, also has to follow the mobile redirect.</p><p>After following the redirect, the crawler reads our <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_link_element\">page metadata</a> which points back to the standard domain as the preferred one. This creates a loop that can prevent a page from being updated or listed in Google Search. Delisting is not a matter of ranking, but about whether a page is even in the search index.</p><p>Tim and myself disabled the mobile redirect for “Googlebot on Commons” through an emergency intervention on June 23rd. Referrals then began to come back, and kept rising for eleven weeks in a row, until reaching a <strong>100% increase in Google-referrals</strong>. From a baseline of 3 million weekly pageviews up to 6 million. Google’s data on clickthroughs shows a similar increase from 1M to 1.8M “clicks”.</p><p>We reversed last year’s regression  set a new all-time high. We think there’s three reasons Commons reached new highs:</p><ol><li>The redirect consumed half of the crawl budget, thus limiting how many pages could be crawled.</li><li>Google switched Commons to its new crawler some years before Wikipedia. The index had likely been shrinking for two years already.</li><li>Pages on Commons have a sparse link graph. Wikipedia has a rich network of links between articles, whereas pages on Commons represent a photo with an image description that rarely links to other files. This unique page structure makes it hard to discover Commons pages through recursive crawling without a sitemap.</li></ol><p>Unifying our domains lifted a ceiling we didn’t know was there!</p><p>The MediaWiki software has a built-in sitemap generator, but we disabled this on Wikimedia sites over a decade ago. We decided to enable it for Commons and submitted it to Google on August 6th. Google has since indexed 70 million new pages for Commons, up 140% since June.</p><p>We also found that less than 0.1% of <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?search=+&amp;title=Special%3AMediaSearch&amp;type=video&amp;assessment=any-assessment\">videos on Commons</a> were recognised by Google as video watch pages (for the Google Search “Videos” tab). I raised this in a partnership meeting with Google Search, and it may’ve been a bug on their end. Commons started showing up in Google Videos a week later.</p><p>When sharing links from a mobile device, such link previously hardcoded the mobile domain. Links shared from a mobile device gave you the mobile site, even when received on desktop. The “Desktop” link in the footer of the mobile site pointed to the standard domain and disabled the standard-to-mobile redirect for you, on the assumption you arrived on the mobile site via the redirect. The “Desktop” link did not remember your choice on the mobile domain itself, and there existed no equivalent mobile-to-standard redirect for when you arrive there. This meant a shared mobile link always presented the mobile site, even after opting-out on desktop.</p><p>Everyone now shares the same domain which naturally shows the appropiate version.</p><p>There is a long tail of stable referrals from news articles, research papers, blogs, talk pages, and mailing lists that refer to the mobile domain. We plan to support this indefinitely. To limit operational complexity, we now serve these through a simple whole-domain redirect. This has the benefit of retroactively fixing the UX issue because <strong>old mobile links now redirect to the standard domain</strong>.</p><p>This resolves a long-standing bug with workarounds in the form of shared user scripts, browser extensions, and personal scripts.</p><p>After publishing an edit, MediaWiki instructs the Wikimedia CDN to clear the cache of affected articles (“purge”). It has been a perennial concern from SRE teams at WMF that our CDN purge rates are unsustainable. For every purge from MediaWiki core, the MobileFrontend extension would add a copy for the mobile domain.</p><p>After unifying our domains we turned off these duplicate purges, and cut the MediaWiki purge rate by 50%. Over the past weeks the Wikimedia CDN processed approximately <strong>4 billion fewer purges a day</strong>. MediaWiki used to send purges at a baseline rate of 40K/second with spikes up to 300K/second, and both have been halved. Factoring in other services, the Wikimedia CDN now receives 20% to 40% fewer purges per second overall, depending on the edit activity.</p>",

If that’s Python, great, use it. And also, use the best tool for the job. If that’s Python, great, use it. And also, it’s Ok to use a tool for one task just because you’re already using it for all sorts of other tasks and therefore you happen to have it at hand. If you’re hammering nails all day it’s Ok if you’re also using your hammer to open a bottle of beer or scratch your back. Similarly, if you’re programming in Python all day it’s Ok if you’re also using it to fit mixed linear models. If it works for you, great! Keep going. But if you’re struggling, if things seem more difficult than they ought to be, this article series may be for you.</p><div data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://blog.genesmindsmachines.com/p/python-is-not-a-great-language-for?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;}\" data-component-name=\"CaptionedButtonToDOM\"><div><p>Thanks for reading Genes, Minds, Machines! This post is public so feel free to share it.</p></div></div><p>Let’s begin with my lived experience, without providing any explanation for what may be the cause of it. I have been running a research lab in computational biology for over two decades. During this time I have worked with around thirty graduate students and postdocs, all very competent and accomplished computational scientists. The policy in my lab is that everybody is free to use whatever programming language and tools they want to use. I don’t tell people what to do. And more often than not, people choose Python as their programming language of choice.</p><p>No matter the cause of this experience, I have to conclude that there is something fundamentally broken with how data analysis works in Python. It may be a problem with the language itself, or merely a limitation of the available software libraries, or a combination thereof, but whatever it is, its effects are real and I see them routinely. In fact, I have another example, in case you’re tempted to counter, “It’s a skill issue; get better students.” Last fall, I co-taught a class on AI models for biology with an experienced data scientist who does all his work in Python. He knows NumPy and pandas and matplotlib like the back of his hand. In the class, I covered all the theory, and he covered the in-class exercises in Python. So I got to see an expert in Python working through a range of examples. And my reaction to the code examples frequently was, “Why does it have to be so complicated?” So many times, I felt that things that would be just a few lines of simple R code turned out to be quite a bit longer and fairly convoluted. I definitely could not have written that code without extensive studying and completely rewiring my brain in terms of what programming patterns to use. It felt very alien, but not in the form of “wow, this is so alien but also so elegant” but rather “wow, this is so alien and weird and cumbersome.” And again, I don’t think this is because my colleague is not very good at what he’s doing. He is extremely good. The problem appears to be in the fundamental architecture of the tools.</p><p>Data science as I define it here involves a lot of interactive exploration of data and quick one-off analyses or experiments. Therefore, any language suitable for data science has to be interpreted, usable in an interactive shell or in a notebook format. This also means performance considerations are secondary. When you want to do a quick linear regression on some data you’re working with, you don’t care whether the task is going to take 50 milliseconds or 500 milliseconds. You care about whether you can open up a shell, type a few lines of code, and get the result in a minute or two, versus having to set up a new project, writing all the boilerplate to make the compiler happy, and then spend more time compiling your code than running it.</p><p><a href=\"https://yuri.is/not-julia/\" rel=\"\">who have used it extensively have doubts.</a></p><p>Before continuing, let me provide a few more thoughts about performance. Performance usually trades off with other features of a language. In simplistic terms, performance comes at the cost of either extra overhead for the programmer (as in Rust) or increased risk of obscure bugs (as in C) or both. For data science applications, I consider a high risk of obscure bugs or incorrect results as not acceptable, and I also think convenience for the programmer is more important than raw performance. Computers are fast and thinking hurts. I’d rather spend less mental energy on telling the computer what to do and wait a little longer for the results. So the easier a language makes my job for me, the better. If I am really performance-limited in some analysis, I can always rewrite that particular part of the analysis in Rust, once I know exactly what I’m doing and what computations I need.</p><p><a href=\"https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/\" rel=\"\">penguins from the Palmer Archipelago.</a></p><p>Here is the relevant code in R, using the tidyverse approach:</p><pre><code>library(tidyverse)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n\npenguins |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(body_mass_g)) |&gt;\n  group_by(species, island) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    body_weight_mean = mean(body_mass_g),\n    body_weight_sd = sd(body_mass_g)\n  )</code></pre><p>And here is the equivalent code in Python, using the pandas package:</p><pre><code>import pandas as pd\nfrom palmerpenguins import load_penguins\n\npenguins = load_penguins()\n\n(penguins\n .dropna(subset=['body_mass_g'])\n .groupby(['species', 'island'])\n .agg(\n     body_weight_mean=('body_mass_g', 'mean'),\n     body_weight_sd=('body_mass_g', 'std')\n )\n .reset_index()\n)</code></pre><p>These two examples are quite similar. At this level of complexity of the analysis, Python does fine. I would consider the R code to be slightly easier to read (notice how many quotes and brackets the Python code needs), but the differences are minor. In both cases, we take the penguins dataset, remove the penguins for which body weight is missing, then specify that we want to perform the computation separately on every combination of penguin species and island, and then calculate the means and standard deviations.</p><p>Contrast this with equivalent code that is full of logistics, where I’m using only basic Python language features and no special data wrangling package:</p><pre><code>from palmerpenguins import load_penguins\nimport math\n\npenguins = load_penguins()\n\n# Convert DataFrame to list of dictionaries\npenguins_list = penguins.to_dict('records')\n\n# Filter out rows where body_mass_g is missing\nfiltered = [row for row in penguins_list if not math.isnan(row['body_mass_g'])]\n\n# Group by species and island\ngroups = {}\nfor row in filtered:\n    key = (row['species'], row['island'])\n    if key not in groups:\n        groups[key] = []\n    groups[key].append(row['body_mass_g'])\n\n# Calculate mean and standard deviation for each group\nresults = []\nfor (species, island), values in groups.items():\n    n = len(values)\n    \n    # Calculate mean\n    mean = sum(values) / n\n    \n    # Calculate standard deviation\n    variance = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in values) / (n - 1)\n    std_dev = math.sqrt(variance)\n    \n    results.append({\n        'species': species,\n        'island': island,\n        'body_weight_mean': mean,\n        'body_weight_sd': std_dev\n    })\n\n# Sort results to match order used by pandas\nresults.sort(key=lambda x: (x['species'], x['island']))\n\n# Print results\nfor result in results:\n    print(f\"{result['species']:10} {result['island']:10} \"\n          f\"Mean: {result['body_weight_mean']:7.2f} g, \"\n          f\"SD: {result['body_weight_sd']:6.2f} g\")</code></pre><p>I will end things here for now. This post is long enough. In future installments, I’ll go over specific issues that make data analysis more complicated in Python than in R. In brief, I believe there are several reasons why Python code often devolves into dealing with data logistics. As much as the programmer may try to avoid logistics and stick to high-level conceptual programming patterns, either the language itself or the available libraries get in the way and tend to thwart those efforts. I will go into details soon.

Today, Orion for macOS officially leaves its beta phase behind and joins our iOS and iPadOS apps as a fully‑fledged, production‑ready browser.</p><p>While doing so, it expands Kagi’s ecosystem of privacy-respecting, user-centric products (that we have begun fondly naming “Kagiverse”) to now include: <a href=\"https://kagi.com\">Search</a>, <a href=\"https://kagi.com/assistant\">Assistant</a>, <a href=\"https://orionbrowser.com\">Browser</a>, <a href=\"https://translate.kagi.com\">Translate</a>, <a href=\"https://news.kagi.com\">News</a> with more to come.</p><p>We built Orion for people who feel that modern browsing has drifted too far from serving the user. This is our invitation to <strong>browse beyond ✴︎ the status quo</strong>.</p><p>The obvious question is: <strong>why  do we need a new browser?</strong> The world already has Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge, and a growing list of “AI browsers.” Why add yet another?</p><p>Because something fundamental has been lost.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Zero telemetry, privacy‑first access to the internet: a basic human right.</strong></p></blockquote><p>Your browser is the most intimate tool you have on your computer. It sees everything you read, everything you search, everything you type. Do you want that relationship funded by advertisers, or by you?</p><p>With ad‑funded browsers and AI overlays, your activity is a gold mine. Every click becomes a way to track, every page another opportunity to profile you a little more deeply. We believe there needs to be a different path: <strong>a browser that answers only to its user.</strong></p><p>Orion is our attempt at that browser. No trade-offs between features and privacy. It’s fast, customizable, and uncompromising on both fronts.</p><h2>A bold technical choice: WebKit, not another Chromium clone</h2><p>In a world dominated by Chromium, choosing a rendering engine is an act of resistance.</p><p>From day one, we made the deliberate choice to build Orion on <a href=\"https://webkit.org\"></a>, the open‑source engine at the heart of Safari and the broader Apple ecosystem. It gives us:</p><ul><li>A high‑performance engine that is <strong>deeply optimized for macOS and iOS</strong>.</li><li>An alternative to the growing Chromium monoculture.</li><li>A foundation that is not controlled by an advertising giant.</li></ul><p>Orion may feel familiar if you’re used to Safari – respecting your muscle memory and the aesthetics of macOS and iOS – but it is an entirely different beast under the hood. We combined native WebKit speed with a completely new approach to extensions, privacy, and customization.</p><h2>Speed by nature, privacy by default</h2><p>Most people switch browsers for one reason: .</p><p>Orion is designed to be fast by nature, not just in benchmarks, but in how it feels every day:</p><ul><li>A lean, native codebase without ad‑tech bloat.</li><li>Optimized startup, tab switching, and page rendering.</li><li>A UI that gets out of your way and gives you more screen real estate for content.</li></ul><p>Alongside speed, we treat privacy as a first‑class feature:</p><ul><li>: We don’t collect usage data. No analytics, no identifiers, no tracking.</li><li><strong>No ad or tracking technology</strong> baked in: Orion is not funded by ads, so there is no incentive to follow you around the web.</li><li>: Strong content blocking and privacy defaults from the first launch.</li></ul><h2>Thoughtful AI, security first</h2><p>We are excited about what AI can do for search, browsing, and productivity. Kagi, the company behind Orion, has been experimenting with AI‑powered tools for years while staying true to our <a href=\"https://help.kagi.com/kagi/why-kagi/ai-philosophy.html\">AI integration philosophy</a>.</p><p>But we are also watching a worrying trend: AI agents are being rushed directly into the browser core, with deep access to everything you do online – and sometimes even to your local machine.</p><p>Security researchers have already documented serious issues in early AI browsers and “agentic” browser features:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://medium.com/@mdmeeng01/perplexitys-comet-got-hijacked-by-hidden-prompts-and-it-changed-how-i-think-about-ai-browsers-fb22b673ece9\">Prompt‑injection attacks</a> that trick AI agents into ignoring safety rules, visiting malicious sites, or leaking sensitive information beyond what traditional browser sandboxes were designed to protect.</li><li>Broader concerns that some implementations are effectively “<a href=\"https://medium.com/utopian/perplexity-was-supposed-to-change-search-instead-its-lighting-everything-on-fire-922379e72083\">lighting everything on fire</a>” by expanding the browser’s attack surface and data flows in ways users don’t fully understand.</li></ul><ul><li>We are not against AI, and we are conscious of <a href=\"https://blog.kagi.com/llms\">its limitations</a>. We already integrate with AI‑powered services wherever it makes functional sense and will continue to expand those capabilities.</li><li><strong>We are against rushing insecure, always‑on agents into the browser core.</strong> Your browser should be a secure gateway, not an unvetted co‑pilot wired into everything you do.</li></ul><ul><li>Orion ships with  in its core.</li><li>We focus on providing a clean, predictable environment, <strong>especially for enterprises and privacy‑conscious professionals</strong>.</li><li>Orion is designed to connect seamlessly to the AI tools you choose – soon including Kagi’s intelligent features – while keeping a clear separation between your browser and any external AI agents.</li></ul><p>As AI matures and security models improve, we’ll continue to evaluate thoughtful, user‑controlled ways to bring AI into your workflow without compromising safety, privacy or user choice.</p><h2>Simple for everyone, limitless for experts</h2><p>We designed Orion to bridge the gap between simplicity and power. Out of the box, it’s a clean, intuitive browser for anyone. Under the hood, it’s a deep toolbox for people who live in their browser all day.</p><p>Some of the unique features you’ll find in Orion 1.0:</p><ul><li><p>: Instantly transform any website into a distraction‑free web app. Perfect for documentation, writing, or web apps you run all day.\n<img src=\"https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2025-11-25/1764079998-879831-focusmode.gif\" alt=\"Browser window showing Focus Mode being activated, simplifying webpage content by removing distractions.\"></p></li><li><p>: Peek at content from any app – email, notes, chat – without fully committing to opening a tab, keeping your workspace tidy.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mini Toolbar, Overflow Menu, and Page Tweak</strong>: Fine‑tune each page’s appearance and controls, so the web adapts to you, not the other way around.</p></li><li><p>: Isolate your work, personal, and hobby browsing into completely separate profiles, each with its own extensions, cookies, and settings.</p></li></ul><p>For power users, we’ve added granular options throughout the browser. These are there when you want them, and out of your way when you don’t.</p><p>Orion 1.0 also reflects six years of <a href=\"https://orionfeedback.org/\">feedback</a> from early adopters. Many invisible improvements – tab stability, memory behavior, complex web app compatibility – are a direct result of people pushing Orion hard in their daily workflows and telling us what broke.</p><h2>Browse Beyond ✴︎: our new signature</h2><p>With this release, we are introducing our new signature: .</p><p>We originally started with the browser name ‘Kagi.’ On February 3, 2020, Vlad suggested a shortlist for rebranding: Comet, Core, Blaze, and Orion. We chose Orion not just for the name itself, but because it perfectly captured our drive for exploration and curiosity. It was a natural fit that set the stage for everything that followed.</p><p>You’ll see this reflected in our refreshed visual identity:</p><ul><li>A star (✴︎) motif throughout our communication.</li><li>A refined logo that now uses <strong>the same typeface as Kagi</strong>, creating a clear visual bond between our browser and our search engine.</li></ul><p>Orion is part of the broader , united by a simple idea: the internet should be built for people, not advertisers or any other third parties.</p><h2>Small team, sustainable model</h2><p>Orion is built by a team of just six developers.</p><p>To put that in perspective:</p><ul><li>That’s roughly 10% of the size of the “small” browser teams at larger companies.</li><li>And a rounding error compared to the teams behind Chrome or Edge.</li></ul><p>Yet, the impact is real: over <strong>1 million downloads to date</strong>, and a dedicated community of <a href=\"https://kagi.com/stats?stat=orion\">2480</a> paid subscribers who make this independence possible.</p><p>For the first two years, development was carried out by a single developer. Today, we are a tight knit group operating close to our users. We listen, debate, and implement fixes proposed directly by our community on <a href=\"https://orionfeedback.org\">OrionFeedback.org</a>.</p><p>This is our only source of decision making, rather than any usage analytics or patterns, because remember, Orion is zero-telemetry!</p><p>This small team approach lets us move quickly, stay focused, and avoid the bloat or hype that often comes with scale.</p><p><strong>Orion is free for everyone.</strong></p><p><strong>Every user also receives 200 free Kagi searches</strong>, with no account or sign‑up required. It’s our way of introducing you to fast, ad‑free, privacy‑respecting search from day one.</p><p>But we are also 100% self‑funded. We don’t sell your data and we don’t take money from advertisers, which means we rely directly on our users to sustain the project.</p><ul><li>Tip Jar (from the app): A simple way to say “thank you” without any commitment.</li><li>Supporter Subscription: $5/month or $50/year.</li><li>Lifetime Access: A one‑time payment of $150 for life.</li></ul><p>Supporters (via subscription or lifetime purchase) unlock a set of  perks available today, including:</p><ul><li>Floating windows: Keep a video or window on top of other apps.</li><li>Customization: Programmable buttons and custom application icons.</li><li>Early access to new, supporter‑exclusive features we’re already building for next year.</li></ul><p>By supporting Orion, you’re not just funding a browser – you are co‑funding a better web with humans at the center.</p><p>Orion 1.0 is just the beginning.

In the days since, it has become the most-discussed interview we've done in three years on the show. Listeners who wrote in to us said they were shocked to hear the leader of a platform with 151.5 million monthly users, most of them minors, express frustration and annoyance at being asked about the company's history of failures related to child safety. Journalists described the interview as \"<a href=\"https://news.google.com/read/CBMidkFVX3lxTE4xNlk2SVc0YWJhRXF1Z2NUa1RJZFhRYzhCclk3Z2d2VFVkY2JsQUVIa1A4QUJJSGlFcnIwYjFNZ2hEV3JaMG4ycWxvX2YyMlpJeEVOaGhDLWZyamRGWS03MFEwalB0cDRtLU5uM3FFRnNaUjRpS2c?hl=en-US&amp;gl=US&amp;ceid=US%3Aen&amp;ref=platformer.news\" rel=\"noreferrer\">bizarre</a>,\" \"<a href=\"https://news.google.com/read/CBMi4wFBVV95cUxOTUlxUlVyeFhrRk9XSDd1enBzcmVnbm9uVFVoOGlnUUdLcE9VT291SndCT0RVUlY2ZmJMOFh5bG9lZ2VpVDQ3WkFhMTFXcTJTaUhxTjd2b2NrT0lFeWlLeUxiUEd3Sk1yeEgwYTlTcG1PdnAtNnlBNHdYV1lEejYtODU5RlZUa1Z6VzJrcnFXeGtTbGpQR2hIRXRqcWZzMGhpTzRnVlNsaERmcmxBZWcwdEtJejRfVkhQYUdTQmZNUl9PdEVKUUZkVHBfT3RXUFRUMURIc0ZiZ20zLVY4Z3ZfNENKaw?hl=en-US&amp;gl=US&amp;ceid=US%3Aen&amp;ref=platformer.news\" rel=\"noreferrer\">unhinged</a>,\" and a \"<a href=\"https://kotaku.com/roblox-new-york-times-interview-baszucki-2000646174?ref=platformer.news\" rel=\"noreferrer\">car crash</a>.\" </p><p>And a case can be made that it was all of those things — even if Baszucki, in the studio afterwards and <a href=\"https://x.com/DavidBaszucki/status/1991944434330800427?s=20&amp;ref=platformer.news\" rel=\"noreferrer\">later on X</a>, insisted to us that he had had a good time. In the moment, though, Baszucki's dismissive attitude toward discussing child safety struck me as something worse: familiar.</p><p>Baszucki, after all, is not the first CEO to have insisted to me that a platform's problems are smaller than I am making them out to be. Nor is he the first to blame the platform's enormous scale, or to try to change the subject. (He is the first tech CEO to suggest to me that maybe there should be prediction markets in video games for children, but that's another story.)</p><p>What people found noteworthy about our interview, I think, was the fresh evidence that our most successful tech CEOs really do think and talk this way. Given a chance to display empathy for the victims of crimes his platform enabled, or to convey regret about historical safety lapses, or even just to gesture at some sense of responsibility for the hundreds of millions of children who in various ways are depending on him, the CEO throws up his hands and asks: how long are you guys going to be going on about all this stuff? </p><p>Roblox is different from other social products in that it explicitly courts users as young as 5. (You are supposed to be at least 13 to use Instagram, TikTok, and other major platforms.) That has always put significant pressure on the company to develop serious safety features. The company <a href=\"https://corp.roblox.com/tr/newsroom/2024/07/driving-civility-and-safety-for-all-users?ref=platformer.news\" rel=\"noreferrer\">says</a> it spends hundreds of millions of dollars a year on safety, and that 10 percent of its employees work on trust and safety issues. And trust and safety workers I know tell me that they respect Roblox's safety teams.</p><p>At the same time, this is a platform launched in 2006 where, for most of its history, adults could freely approach and message any minor unless their parents had dug into the app settings. Roblox did not verify users' ages, letting any child identify as 13 or older to bypass content restrictions. Filters intended to prevent inappropriate chat or the exchange of personal information were easily bypassed by slightly changing the spelling of words. Parental controls could be circumvented simply by a child creating a new account and declaring that they were at least 13.</p><p>Last year the company introduced new restrictions on chat. And this year, the company said it would deploy <a href=\"https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/11/roblox-requires-age-checks-limits-minor-and-adult-chat?ref=platformer.news\" rel=\"noreferrer\">its own age estimation technology</a> to determine users' ages and restrict the content available to them accordingly. This rollout was the main reason we had sought to interview Baszucki in the first place — something we had communicated to his team.</p><p>Which only made it stranger when Baszucki expressed surprise at our line of inquiry and threw his PR team under the bus. (\"If our PR people said, “Let’s talk about age-gating for an hour,' I’m up for it, but I love your pod. I thought I came here to talk about everything,'\" he said.)</p><p>Since 2018, at least two dozen people in the United States have been arrested and accused of abducting or abusing victims they met on Roblox, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/?ref=platformer.news\" rel=\"noreferrer\">according to a 2024 investigation by Bloomberg</a>. Attorneys general in Texas, Kentucky, and Louisiana have filed lawsuits against Roblox alleging that the platform facilitates child exploitation and grooming. More than 35 families have <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/judge-rules-online-platform-roblox-keeping-alleged-abuse/story?id=127190227&amp;ref=platformer.news\" rel=\"noreferrer\">filed lawsuits</a> against the company over child predation.</p><p>As recently as this month, a reporter for the  created an account presenting herself as a child and found that in Roblox <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/nov/05/roblox-game-robux-children-child-kids-safety-parental-controls?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">she could wander user-created strip clubs</a>, casinos, and horror games. In one \"hangout\" game, in which she identified as a 13-year-old, another avatar sexually assaulted her by thrusting his hips into her avatar's face as she begged him to leave her alone.</p><p>It's true that any platform that lets strangers communicate will lead to real-world harm. I believe that millions of children use Roblox daily without incident. And we would not want to shut down the entire internet to prevent a single bad thing from ever happening. </p><p>But there is much a leader can do with the knowledge that his platform will inevitably lead to harm, should he wish. </p><p>Understanding how attractive Roblox would be to predators, the company long ago could have blocked unrestricted contact between adults and minors. It could have adopted age verification before a wave of state legislation signaled that it would soon become mandatory anyway. It could have made it harder for children under 13 to create new accounts, and require them to get parental consent in a way it could verify.</p><p>But doing so would require Roblox to focus on outcomes for children, at the likely expense of growth. And so here we are.</p><p>Galling? Yes. But like I said: it's also familiar. </p><p>Over and over again, we have seen leaders in Baszucki's position choose growth over guardrails. Safety features come out years after the need for them is identified, if at all. Internal critics are sidelined, laid off, or managed out. And when journalists ask, politely but insistently, why so many of their users are suffering, executives laugh and tell us that we're the crazy ones.</p><p>Look at OpenAI, where the company is reckoning with the fact that making its models less sycophantic <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/23/technology/openai-chatgpt-users-risks.html?ref=platformer.news\" rel=\"noreferrer\">has been worse for user engagement</a> — and is building new features to turn the engagement dial back up.</p><p>Look at TikTok, which has answered concerns that short-form video is <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11588245/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">worsening academic performance for children</a> with new \"digital well-being features\" that include an affirmation journal, a \"background sound generator aimed at improving the mental health of its users,\" and \"new badges to reward people who use the platform within limits, especially teens.\" Answering concerns that teens are using the app too much with more reasons to use the app.</p><p>Or look at Meta, where new court filings from over the weekend allege ... <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/meta-buried-causal-evidence-social-media-harm-us-court-filings-allege-2025-11-23/?ref=platformer.news\" rel=\"noreferrer\">a truly staggering number of things</a>. To name a few: the company \"stalled internal efforts to prevent child predators from contacting minors for years due to growth concerns,\" according to Jeff Horwitz in Reuters; \"recognized that optimizing its products to increase teen engagement resulted in serving them more harmful content, but did so anyway\"; and gave users 17 attempts to traffic people for sex before banning their accounts. (Meta denies the allegations, which are drawn from internal documents that have not been made public; Meta has also objected to unsealing the documents.) </p><p>Lawsuits will always contain the most salacious allegations lawyers can find, of course. But what struck me about these latest filings is not the lawyers' predictably self-serving framing but rather the quotes from Meta's own employees.</p><p>When the company declined to publish internal research from 2019 which showed that no longer looking at Facebook and Instagram improved users' mental health, one employee said: \"If the results are bad and we don’t publish and they leak ... is it going to look like tobacco companies doing research and knowing cigs were bad and then keeping that info to themselves?”</p><p>When Meta researchers found that by 2018, approximately 40 percent of children ages 9 to 12 were daily Instagram users — despite the fact that you are supposed to be 13 to join — some employees bristled at what they perceived as tacit encouragement from executives to accelerate growth efforts among children. </p><p>\"Oh good, we’re going after &lt;13 year olds now?” one wrote, as cited in <a href=\"https://time.com/7336204/meta-lawsuit-files-child-safety/?ref=platformer.news\" rel=\"noreferrer\">'s account of the brief</a>. “Zuck has been talking about that for a while...targeting 11 year olds feels like tobacco companies a couple decades ago (and today). Like we’re seriously saying ‘we have to hook them young’ here.” </p><p>When Meta studied the potential of its products to be addictive in 2018, it found that 55 percent of 20,000 surveyed users showed at least some signs of \"problematic use.\" When it published that research the following year, though, it redefined \"problematic use\" to include only the most severe cases — 3.1 percent of users.</p><p>&nbsp;“Because our product exploits weaknesses in the human psychology to promote product engagement and time spent,” a user experience researcher wrote, the company should “alert people to the effect that the product has on their brain.”</p><p>You will not be surprised to learn that the company did not alert people to the issue.&nbsp;</p><p>As usual, the rank-and-file employees are doing their job. Over and over again, though, their boss' boss tells them to stop.</p><p>Americans have short attention spans — and lots to worry about. The tech backlash that kicked off in 2017 inspired platforms to make meaningful and effective investments in content moderation, cybersecurity, platform integrity, and other teams that worked to protect their user bases. Imperfect as these efforts were, they bolstered my sense that tech platforms were susceptible to pressure from the public, from lawmakers and from journalists. They acted slowly, and incompletely, but at least they acted.</p><p>Fast forward to today and the bargain no longer holds. Platforms do whatever the president of the United States tells them to do, and very little else. Shame, that once-great regulator of social norms and executive behavior, has all but disappeared from public life. In its place is denial, defiance, and the noxious vice signaling of the investor class.</p><p>I'm still reckoning with what it means to do journalism in a world where the truth can barely hold anyone's attention — much less hold a platform accountable, in any real sense of that word. I'm rethinking how to cover tech policy at a time when it is being <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/10/technology/meta-mark-zuckerberg-trump.html?ref=platformer.news\" rel=\"noreferrer\">made by whim</a>. I'm noticing the degree to which platforms wish to be judged only by their stated intentions, and almost never on the outcomes of anyone who uses them. </p><p>In the meantime the platforms hurtle onward, pitching ever-more fantastical visions of the future while seeming barely interested in stewarding the present.</p><p>For the moment, I'm grateful that a car-crash interview drew attention to one CEO's exasperation with being asked about that. But the real problem isn't that David Baszucki talks this way. It's that so many of his peers do, too.</p><h3>Unknown number calling?

In this case, though, the revived moratorium had little support outside the David Sacks wing of the party. And so — for now, anyway — it fell apart. </p><p>State lawmakers are fighting the moratorium proposal Trump made to Congress. Today, a letter <a href=\"https://ari.us/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/NDAA-State-Policymaker-Coalition-Letter-11-23-25-Oppose-AI-Preemption.pdf?ref=platformer.news\"></a> by 280 state lawmakers urged Congress to “reject any provision that overrides state and local AI legislation.”</p><p>A moratorium would threaten existing laws that “strengthen consumer transparency, guide responsible government procurement, protect patients, and support artists and creators,” the letter said.</p><p>On the other side of the debate, the tech-funded industry PAC Leading the Future <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/24/ai-pac-trump-congress-midterms.html?ref=platformer.news\" rel=\"noreferrer\">announced a $10 million campaign</a> to push Congress to pass national AI regulations that would supersede state law.  </p><h3>X’s \"About This Account\" meltdown</h3><p>On Friday,  debuted its  feature globally in a rollout that descended into chaos over the feature’s accidental uncovering of foreign actors behind popular right-wing accounts that actively share news on US politics.&nbsp;</p><p>X users can now see the date an account joined the platform, how many times it has changed its username, and most importantly, the country or region it’s based in. The move, <a href=\"https://x.com/nikitabier/status/1992335925322613127?ref=platformer.news\"></a> X head of product , “is an important first step to securing the integrity of the global town square.”</p><p>But the feature has had an unintended consequence: it revealed that big pro-Trump accounts like , a right-wing user with nearly 400,000 followers that regularly shares news about US politics, aren't actually based in the US. MAGANationX, for example, is based in , according to X.&nbsp;</p><p>Other popular right-wing accounts — that use names from the Trump family — like (1 million followers before it was suspended),  (nearly 600,000 followers), and  (more than 11,000 followers), appear to be based in , Eastern Europe, and  respectively.&nbsp;</p><p>The data could be skewed by travel, VPNs, or old IP addresses, and some have complained their location is inaccurate. Bier said the rollout has “a few rough edges” that will be resolved by Tuesday.&nbsp;</p><p>One of ’s promises during the takeover of Twitter was to purge the platform of inauthentic accounts. But several studies <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/x-new-location-transparency-feature-questions-origins-maga-accounts-rcna245487?ref=platformer.news\"></a> that suspected inauthentic activity has remained at about the same levels. X has long struggled with troll farms spreading misinformation, boosted by its tendency to monetarily reward engagement.&nbsp;</p><p>Accusations of foreign actors spreading fake news flew on both sides of the aisle. When the feature appeared to be pulled for a short period of time, Republican Gov.  of Florida <a href=\"https://x.com/rondesantis/status/1992306818534559823?ref=platformer.news\"></a> “X needs to reinstate county-of-origin — it helps expose the grift.”&nbsp;</p><p>In a <a href=\"https://x.com/greg16676935420/status/1992417046739771788?ref=platformer.news\"></a> that garnered 3.2 million views, <a href=\"https://x.com/greg16676935420?ref=platformer.news\"></a> attached a screenshot of ’s profile, which shows the account’s based in India: “BREAKING: American guy is not actually an American guy.”</p><p>“When an American billionaire offers money to people from relatively poor countries for riling up and radicalising Americans, it's not surprising that they'll take up the offer,” <a href=\"https://x.com/chriso_wiki/status/1992156130915815800?ref=platformer.news\"></a> in a post that garnered nearly 700,000 views.&nbsp;</p><p>In perhaps the most devastating consequence of the feature,  said they “spent 2 years acting mysterious over what country I live in just for Elon to fuck it all up with a single update” in a <a href=\"https://x.com/veespo_444s/status/1992701022150770897?ref=platformer.news\"></a> that has 4.3 million views and 90,000 likes.&nbsp;</p><p>How President <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/20/technology/trump-ai-memes.html?ref=platformer.news\"></a> right-wing trolls and AI memes.

      "content": "<p>When CSS Grid layout was first released, it came with a big asterisk: only the grid’s  could participate in the layout. “Subgrid” is a newer addition to CSS Grid which allows us to  the grid layout down through the DOM tree.</p><p>When I first heard about subgrid, it seemed to me like a convenience, a way to make it a bit simpler to accomplish the same stuff I was already doing. <strong>As it turns out, subgrid is  more interesting than that.</strong> It opens whole new doors in terms of the UIs we can build!</p><p>In this tutorial, I’ll show you some of the exciting new things we can do with subgrid. Along the way, you’ll learn the basic mechanics of subgrid. We’ll even go over the most common gotchas!</p><p>We’ll get to the interesting stuff soon, but first, let’s start with the basics.</p><p>Suppose we want to implement the following mockup:</p><p>We can create this layout using a flat grid, no subgrid required. Here’s a quick implementation:</p><div><div><div data-id=\"portfolio-flat-grid\" data-can-be-annotated=\"false\" data-stacked=\"false\"><div data-is-fullscreened=\"false\"><div><div><div><div translate=\"no\"><div><div aria-labelledby=\"/index.html-:R1bgleiavfelb:-tab\" role=\"tabpanel\"><div aria-autocomplete=\"list\" aria-label=\"Code Editor for index.html\" aria-multiline=\"true\" role=\"textbox\" tabindex=\"0\" translate=\"no\"><pre>\n  .grid  / =My Portfolio\n      A small selection of the works created using Blender. No robots or AI involved.\n    \n      In a real artist portfolio, there would be more text here.\n    ============</pre></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><p>If we check the “Grid” devtools, we see that this is a 4x2 grid, with the header spanning the first two rows:</p><p>In order for this to work  subgrid, every grid participant has to be a direct child of the  container. Sure enough, if we inspect the HTML, we see the following structure:</p><div translate=\"no\" data-less-bottom-margin=\"false\"><div><pre><code></code></pre></div></div><p>Semantically, this feels a bit  to me. I feel like these images should be grouped in a list, since we’re displaying a  of portfolio pieces. Proper semantic markup will provide more context to folks using assistive technologies like screen readers, and to search engines that are trying to make sense of our page.</p><p>Unfortunately, adding this extra markup throws a wrench into the grid:</p><div><div><div data-id=\"portfolio-busted\" data-can-be-annotated=\"false\" data-stacked=\"false\"><div data-is-fullscreened=\"false\"><div><div><div><div translate=\"no\"><div><div aria-labelledby=\"/index.html-:R1bh5eiavfelb:-tab\" role=\"tabpanel\"><div aria-autocomplete=\"list\" aria-label=\"Code Editor for index.html\" aria-multiline=\"true\" role=\"textbox\" tabindex=\"0\" translate=\"no\"><pre>=My Portfolio\n      A small selection of the works created using Blender. No robots or AI involved.\n    \n      In a real artist portfolio, there would be more text here.\n    ============</pre></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><p>Instead of having each image occupy its own grid cell, we instead cram <em>the entire list of images</em> into a single cell in the second column, leaving the final two columns totally empty. 😬</p><p>CSS subgrid allows us to extend the parent grid through that  tag, so that the images can participate in the main grid. Here’s what that looks like:</p><div><div><div data-id=\"portfolio-with-subgrid\" data-can-be-annotated=\"false\" data-stacked=\"false\"><div data-is-fullscreened=\"false\"><div><div><div><div translate=\"no\"><div><div aria-labelledby=\"/index.html-:R1bhbeiavfelb:-tab\" role=\"tabpanel\"><div aria-autocomplete=\"list\" aria-label=\"Code Editor for index.html\" aria-multiline=\"true\" role=\"textbox\" tabindex=\"0\" translate=\"no\"><pre>\n  .grid \n  .grid  / \n  .grid =My Portfolio\n      A small selection of the works created using Blender. No robots or AI involved.\n    \n      In a real artist portfolio, there would be more text here.\n    ============</pre></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><p>There’s a lot going on here, so let’s unpack it.</p><ol><li><div>Using  and , we assign the  to span three columns and two rows. This is how we specify  of the grid we want to share with the ’s descendants. We’ll dig more into this later.</div></li><li><div>Next, we apply  to the , to create a new child grid.</div></li><li><div>Finally, we pass along the row/column definitions using  and . The  keyword is the key bit of magic that ties the two grids together, allowing each  to occupy its own cell in the parent grid.</div></li></ol><p>When I first learned about subgrid, this is the sort of scenario I was imagining: cases where nested HTML elements like  +  or  +  block us from assigning the actual UI elements to the grid. CSS subgrid  a nifty lil’ escape hatch for these types of situations!</p><p><strong>That said, it's not like we haven’t had other ways to solve these kinds of problems.</strong> Instead of sharing a single CSS grid template with subgrid, we could instead combine a Flexbox row with a nested grid:</p><div><div><div data-id=\"portfolio-alternative-implementation\" data-can-be-annotated=\"false\" data-stacked=\"false\"><div data-is-fullscreened=\"false\"><div><div><div><div translate=\"no\"><div><div aria-labelledby=\"/index.html-:R1bhneiavfelb:-tab\" role=\"tabpanel\"><div aria-autocomplete=\"list\" aria-label=\"Code Editor for index.html\" aria-multiline=\"true\" role=\"textbox\" tabindex=\"0\" translate=\"no\"><pre>\n  .wrapper \n    .grid =My Portfolio\n      A small selection of the works created using Blender. No robots or AI involved.\n    \n      In a real artist portfolio, there would be more text here.\n    =======</pre></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><p>Instead of trying to rig everything up to use a single grid structure, we can often create the same layout with nested combinations of Flexbox/Grid. And honestly, I think I prefer this approach in this case! It feels simpler to me.</p><p><strong>But like I said earlier, this isn’t the most exciting use case for subgrid.</strong> Now that we’ve covered the basic syntax, we can explore some of the more interesting possibilities. 😄</p><p>Sticking with the artist portfolio example, let’s suppose we have this card design:</p><article><img alt=\"A big yellow pufferfish\" src=\"https://www.joshwcomeau.com/images/subgrid/thumb-fish.jpg\"><div><p>I created this render for the Animation Design module in my upcoming course,<a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://whimsy.joshwcomeau.com/\">Whimsical</a>.

The fish image, for example, is much wider than the final supercomputer image. What’s going on here? 🤔</p><p>Well, let’s take a look at the CSS.

Before subgrid, I would’ve solved this problem by picking a very narrow fixed width for the image column, so that there was always enough space for the text column. This would ensure that the layout never breaks, but remember, the goal of a portfolio is to display as much of the images as possible! Subgrid allows us to adapt to the content dynamically, so that we can produce the best possible UI in various contexts.</p><p><strong>This is where subgrid truly shines, in my opinion.</strong> By extending the grid downwards, it means that we can allow siblings to become responsive to each other, in a way that hasn’t been possible until now. ✨</p><p>As I’ve been experimenting with subgrid, there have been a couple of things that have caught me off guard. Let’s go over them, so that you’re well-prepared!</p><p>Sharing  with subgrid tends to be pretty intuitive, but things get a bit more quirky when sharing .</p><p>To help me explain, let’s look at a different example. Suppose our design team wants us to build the following pricing UI, to show the features included at different price tiers:</p><p>This  like a pretty straightforward task, but the devil is in the details. If we use a typical Grid or Flexbox strategy, we’ll wind up with asymmetrical rows:</p><p>This might  right at a quick glance, but notice how the features don’t line up. In the original mockup, the first line of every feature is perfectly aligned with the same feature in the opposite card!</p><p>Historically, the only way to achieve this sort of thing in CSS has been with Table layout (using  tags, or ). It’s not really practical to use a table here, though, since we’d need each card to be its own column in the same table, and we can’t easily style table columns.</p><p> At least in theory, we should be able to let both cards share a single grid, like this:</p><p>Unfortunately, there’s a very easy mistake to make. See if you can spot the problem with this code:</p><div><div><div data-id=\"feature-list-missing-grid-row\" data-can-be-annotated=\"false\" data-stacked=\"false\"><div data-is-fullscreened=\"false\"><div><div><div><div translate=\"no\"><div><div aria-labelledby=\"/index.html-:R1bkfeiavfelb:-tab\" role=\"tabpanel\"><div aria-autocomplete=\"list\" aria-label=\"Code Editor for index.html\" aria-multiline=\"true\" role=\"textbox\" tabindex=\"0\" translate=\"no\"><pre>\n  .grid \n\n    .card .card ==Pro PackageUp to 4 team accounts.Basic workflows.Connect with Slack™.Up to 3 knowledge bases, with 100gb total storage.Limited AI assistant (depending on region and language).=Enterprise PackageUnlimited team accounts.Advanced, fully-customizeable workflows.Connect with Slack™, Microsoft Teams™, Discord™, and 5 other popular integrations.Unlimited knowledge bases.Unlimited robots. 🤖</pre></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><p>All of the text is clumped up in the same spot! If we inspect this using the Grid devtools, we discover that we’ve wound up with a 2×1 grid. All of the content within each card is smushed into a single row. 😬</p><p>Typically, with CSS Grid, we don’t need to explicitly define any rows. I usually define the number of , and trust the grid algorithm to add new rows as-needed, so that each child gets its own grid cell.</p><p>Unfortunately, with subgrid, it doesn't quite work like this. By default, our child grid will only span a single grid column/row. If we want it to occupy  rows, we need to reserve them explicitly.</p><p>Here’s what the fix looks like:</p><div><div><div data-id=\"feature-list-fixed\" data-can-be-annotated=\"false\" data-stacked=\"false\"><div data-is-fullscreened=\"false\"><div><div><div><div translate=\"no\"><div><div aria-labelledby=\"/index.html-:R1bkpeiavfelb:-tab\" role=\"tabpanel\"><div aria-autocomplete=\"list\" aria-label=\"Code Editor for index.html\" aria-multiline=\"true\" role=\"textbox\" tabindex=\"0\" translate=\"no\"><pre>\n  .grid \n\n    .card \n    .card ==Pro PackageUp to 4 team accounts.Basic workflows.Connect with Slack™.Up to 3 knowledge bases, with 100gb total storage.Limited AI assistant (depending on region and language).=Enterprise PackageUnlimited team accounts.Advanced, fully-customizeable workflows.Connect with Slack™, Microsoft Teams™, Discord™, and 5 other popular integrations.Unlimited knowledge bases.Unlimited robots. 🤖</pre></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><p>The extra-complicated thing about this setup is that we’re extending the grid down  layers:</p><ul><li><div>First, we extend it to , which includes an  and a .</div></li><li><div>Next, we extend it to that child , so that the individual list items each get their own row.</div></li></ul><p>There are 5 list items in this case, which means we need 6 rows total (one for the heading, five for the list). If we don’t “reserve” all of these rows explicitly, then the browser will shove everything into a single row and make a big mess, like we saw above. I’m not exactly sure  the typical auto-assignment algorithm doesn’t work with subgrid, but I assume there’s some technical limitation.</p><p><strong>This is mind-bending stuff, but it becomes intuitive with a bit of practice.</strong> The thing to keep in mind is that subgrids, by default, will only occupy a single grid cell. In order to spread a group of items across multiple grid rows, the subgrid must first stretch across that area itself.</p><p>We got the gnarliest gotcha out of the way first! I promise the next two won’t be as intellectually taxing. 😅</p><p>In CSS grid, the lines between each column are numbered, and we can assign grid children using these numbers. This is something we explore in greater depth in <a href=\"https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-grid/\">“An Interactive Guide to CSS Grid”</a>:</p><section></section><p>When we inherit a portion of the grid using <code>grid-template-rows: subgrid</code> or <code>grid-template-columns: subgrid</code>, <strong>the line numbers get reset.</strong></p><p>Here’s an example of what I’m talking about:</p><div><div><div data-id=\"grid-line-num-reset\" data-can-be-annotated=\"false\" data-stacked=\"false\"><div data-is-fullscreened=\"false\"><div><div><div><div><div><div translate=\"no\"><div><div aria-labelledby=\"/index.html-:Rd7lheiavfelb:-tab\" role=\"tabpanel\"><div aria-autocomplete=\"list\" aria-label=\"Code Editor for index.html\" aria-multiline=\"true\" role=\"textbox\" tabindex=\"0\" translate=\"no\"><pre>\n  .grid \n\n    .subgrid  /  / \n\n      .child ===</pre></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><p>Our yellow  is assigned to  and , but it winds up sitting in the  of the grid’s four rows and columns. 🤔</p><p>It turns out that while the grid  is inherited with subgrid, the  don’t. Our  grid inherits columns/rows 2 through 4, but internally, they get re-indexed as 1 through 3.</p><p>We can see this using the grid devtools in the Elements inspector:</p><p>In my mind, I had been thinking of line numbers as unique IDs, and so I figured that if the subgrid is inheriting the grid template, those IDs would come along for the ride too. But if we think of these line numbers as  rather than IDs, this behaviour makes a lot more sense. In every grid, the first line has index 1, even if that row/column is inherited from a parent grid.</p><p>Perhaps the most famous grid snippet is this lil’ guy:</p><div translate=\"no\" data-less-bottom-margin=\"false\"><div><pre><code></code></pre></div></div><p>This is a  concept. Instead of specifying different grid templates at different viewport sizes using media queries, we specify that we want as many columns as possible, as long as they’re all at least 100px wide (or whatever the minimum specified size is).</p><div data-breakpoint=\"mdAndLarger\"><p>Try resizing the “Result” pane by dragging the vertical divider, and notice how the columns adjust:</p></div><div><div><div data-id=\"magic-snippet\" data-can-be-annotated=\"false\" data-stacked=\"false\"><div data-is-fullscreened=\"false\"><div><div><div><div><div><div translate=\"no\"><div><div aria-labelledby=\"/index.html-:Rd7m9eiavfelb:-tab\" role=\"tabpanel\"><div aria-autocomplete=\"list\" aria-label=\"Code Editor for index.html\" aria-multiline=\"true\" role=\"textbox\" tabindex=\"0\" translate=\"no\"><pre>\n  .grid ==A=B=C=D=E=F</pre></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><p>This is a very cool approach, but unfortunately, it doesn’t quite work with some of the new UI possibilities introduced by subgrid. For example, the “portfolio card” grid we explored earlier requires that we list the specific number of columns. We can’t use  or .</p><p>Subgrid has been supported across all major browsers since 2023. Surprisingly, though, subgrid support still hasn’t hit 90% yet (<a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://caniuse.com/css-subgrid\">according to</a>, as of November 2025).</p><p>This presents a bit of a challenge. As we’ve seen in this blog post, subgrid enables us to solve problems that were previously unsolvable. What should we do for folks who visit using older browsers?</p><p>Well, we can’t produce an  experience, but I think with a bit of creative problem-solving, we can come up with alternative layouts that are . Using the artist portfolio example from earlier, we could reconfigure the card layout so that the image is stacked vertically, rather than horizontally:</p><p>We can accomplish this using feature queries. Here’s what the code looks like:</p><div translate=\"no\" data-less-bottom-margin=\"false\"><div><pre><code></code></pre></div></div><p>Alternatively, I could have kept the two-column layout but restricted the image column’s width (eg. <code>grid-template-columns: 50px 1fr</code>). This would’ve preserved the original design for everyone. But I think when it comes to fallbacks, the goal isn't to be as similar to the original as possible, the goal is to produce the best experience possible. In this particular case, I think a single-column fallback experience works better.</p><p>I’m publishing this post on November 25th, a frankly miserable time of year up here in the northern hemisphere 😅. The days are getting shorter, the weather is getting colder, and my favourite season (autumn) is transmogrifying into my least favourite season (winter).</p><p>But there is one silver lining about this time of year: <em>everything’s on sale for Black Friday!</em> 🎈</p><p>If you found this blog post useful, you’ll likely get  out of my CSS course. We focus on understanding CSS at a deeper level, building an intuition for how the language actually works.

But, honestly, I think I’m more excited by the smaller-scale stuff we’ve seen in this blog post. 😅</p><p>Subgrid is a very versatile new tool, and it can be a bit intimidating and overwhelming, but hopefully this post has given you some ideas for the sorts of things you can start experimenting with. The good news is that you don’t have to re-architect your entire project in order to start using subgrid! The most powerful parts of subgrid are things which can be incrementally adopted.</p><p>Another special thanks to Kevin Powell.

      "content": "Hey HN, Chris and Yuhong here from Onyx (<a href=\"https://github.com/onyx-dot-app/onyx\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/onyx-dot-app/onyx</a>). We’re building an open-source chat that works with any LLM (proprietary + open weight)  gives these LLMs the tools they need to be useful (RAG, web search, MCP, deep research, memory, etc.).<p>Two years ago, Yuhong and I had the same recurring problem. We were on growing teams and it was ridiculously difficult to find the right information across our docs, Slack, meeting notes, etc. Existing solutions required sending out our company's data, lacked customization, and frankly didn't work well. So, we started Danswer, an open-source enterprise search project built to be self-hosted and easily customized.</p><p>As the project grew, we started seeing an interesting trend—even though we were explicitly a search app, people wanted to use Danswer just to chat with LLMs. We’d hear, “the connectors, indexing, and search are great, but I’m going to start by connecting GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 4, and Qwen to provide my team with a secure way to use them”.</p><p>Many users would add RAG, agents, and custom tools later, but much of the usage stayed ‘basic chat’. We thought: “why would people co-opt an enterprise search when other AI chat solutions exist?”</p><p>As we continued talking to users, we realized two key points:</p><p>(1) just giving a company secure access to an LLM with a great UI and simple tools is a huge part of the value add of AI</p><p>(2) providing this  is much harder than you might think and the bar is incredibly high</p><p>Consumer products like ChatGPT and Claude already provide a great experience—and chat with AI for work is something (ideally) everyone at the company uses 10+ times per day. People expect the same snappy, simple, and intuitive UX with a full feature set. Getting hundreds of small details right to take the experience from “this works” to “this feels magical” is not easy, and nothing else in the space has managed to do it.</p><p>So ~3 months ago we pivoted to Onyx, the open-source chat UI with:</p><p>- (truly) world class chat UX. Usable both by a fresh college grad who grew up with AI and an industry veteran who’s using AI tools for the first time.</p><p>- Support for all the common add-ons: RAG, connectors, web search, custom tools, MCP, assistants, deep research.</p><p>- RBAC, SSO, permission syncing, easy on-prem hosting to make it work for larger enterprises.</p><p>Through building features like deep research and code interpreter that work across model providers, we've learned a ton of non-obvious things about engineering LLMs that have been key to making Onyx work. I'd like to share two that were particularly interesting (happy to discuss more in the comments).</p><p>First, context management is one of the most difficult and important things to get right. We’ve found that LLMs really struggle to remember both system prompts and previous user messages in long conversations. Even simple instructions like “ignore sources of type X” in the system prompt are very often ignored. This is exacerbated by multiple tool calls, which can often feed in huge amounts of context. We solved this problem with a “Reminder” prompt—a short 1-3 sentence blurb injected at the end of the user message that describes the non-negotiables that the LLM must abide by. Empirically, LLMs attend most to the very end of the context window, so this placement gives the highest likelihood of adherence.</p><p>Second, we’ve needed to build an understanding of the “natural tendencies” of certain models when using tools, and build around them. For example, the GPT family of models are fine-tuned to use a python code interpreter that operates in a Jupyter notebook. Even if told explicitly, it refuses to add `print()` around the last line, since, in Jupyter, this last line is automatically written to stdout. Other models don’t have this strong preference, so we’ve had to design our model-agnostic code interpreter to also automatically `print()` the last bare line.</p><p>So far, we’ve had a Fortune 100 team fork Onyx and provide 10k+ employees access to every model within a single interface, and create thousands of use-case specific Assistants for every department, each using the best model for the job. We’ve seen teams operating in sensitive industries completely airgap Onyx w/ locally hosted LLMs to provide a copilot that wouldn’t have been possible otherwise.</p>",

      "content": "<div>\n           By November 24, 2025</div><p>It is rarely newsworthy when a project or package picks up a new\ndependency. However, changes in a core tool like Debian's <a href=\"https://salsa.debian.org/apt-team/apt#apt\">Advanced Package\nTool</a> (APT) can have far-reaching effects. For example, Julian\nAndres Klode's <a href=\"https://lwn.net/ml/all/20251031213541.GA73786@debian.org/\">declaration</a>\nthat APT would require Rust in May 2026 means that a few of Debian's\nunofficial ports must either acquire a working Rust toolchain or\ndepend on an old version of APT. This has raised several questions\nwithin the project, particularly about the ability of a single\nmaintainer to make changes that have widespread impact.</p><p>On October 31, Klode sent an announcement to the debian-devel\nmailing list that he intended to introduce Rust dependencies and code\ninto APT as soon as May 2026:</p><blockquote><p>This extends at first to the Rust compiler and standard library, and\nthe Sequoia ecosystem.</p><p>In particular, our code to parse .deb, .ar, .tar, and the HTTP\nsignature verification code would strongly benefit from memory safe\nlanguages and a stronger approach to unit testing.</p><p>If you maintain a port without a working Rust toolchain,\nplease ensure it has one within the next 6 months, or\nsunset the port.</p></blockquote><p>Klode added this was necessary so that the project as a whole could\nmove forward, rely on modern technologies, \"<q>and not be held back by\ntrying to shoehorn modern software on retro computing\ndevices</q>\". Some Debian developers have welcomed the news. Paul\nTagliamonte <a href=\"https://lwn.net/ml/all/CAO6P2QQD8MDUTAo_F=kGfDsBF0Xv+Wv020dm-n-WGnb7ODYW-g@mail.gmail.com\">acknowledged</a>\nthat it would impact unofficial Debian ports but called the push\ntoward Rust \"\".</p><p>However, John Paul Adrian Glaubitz <a href=\"https://lwn.net/ml/all/ad6e60711c8ed3372ed7f324d7b1be23b0722a0d.camel@physik.fu-berlin.de/\">complained</a>\nthat Klode's wording was unpleasant and that the approach was\nconfrontational. In <a href=\"https://lwn.net/ml/all/afb7c58fb0fb995ebde3fb72b4cc4d1943a37923.camel@physik.fu-berlin.de/\">another\nmessage</a>, he explained that he was not against adoption of Rust; he\nhad worked on enabling Rust on many of the Debian architectures and\nhelped to fix architecture-specific bugs in the Rust toolchain as well\nas LLVM upstream. However, the message strongly suggested there was no room\nfor a change in plan: Klode had ended his message with \"<q>thank you for\nunderstanding</q>\", which invited no further discussion. Glaubitz was\none of a few Debian developers who expressed discomfort with Klode's\ncommunication style in the message.</p><p>Klode <a href=\"https://lwn.net/ml/all/20251031223819.GA97356@debian.org\">noted</a>,\nbriefly, that Rust was already a hard requirement for all Debian\nrelease architectures and ports, except for <a href=\"https://www.debian.org/ports/alpha/\">Alpha (alpha)</a>, <a href=\"https://www.debian.org/ports/m68k/\">Motorola 680x0 (m68k)</a>,\n<a href=\"https://www.debian.org/ports/hppa/\">PA-RISC (hppa)</a>, and\n<a href=\"https://wiki.debian.org/SH4\">SuperH (sh4)</a>, because of\nAPT's use of the <a href=\"https://sequoia-pgp.org/\">Sequoia-PGP</a>\nproject's <a href=\"https://packages.debian.org/trixie/sqv\"></a> tool to\nverify <a href=\"https://openpgp.dev/book/signatures.html\">OpenPGP</a>\nsignatures. APT falls back to using the GNU Privacy Guard\nsignature-verification tool, <a href=\"https://packages.debian.org/trixie/gpgv\"></a>, on\nports that do not have a Rust compiler. By depending directly on Rust,\nthough, APT itself would not be available on ports without a Rust\ncompiler. LWN <a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/1045363/\">recently\ncovered</a> the state of Linux architecture support, and the status of\nRust support for each one.</p><blockquote><b>No AI slop, all substance: subscribe to LWN today</b><p>\nLWN has always been about quality over quantity; we need your help\nto continue publishing in-depth, reader-focused articles about Linux\nand the free-software community. Please subscribe today to support our work\nand keep LWN on the air; we are offering <a href=\"https://lwn.net/Promo/no-slop/claim\">a free one-month trial subscription</a> to get you started.\n</p></blockquote><p>None of the ports listed by Klode are among those <a href=\"https://www.debian.org/ports/#:~:text=List%20of%20official%20ports,-These\">officially\nsupported</a> by Debian today, or targeted for support in\nDebian&nbsp;14 (\"forky\"). The sh4 port has never been officially\nsupported, and none of the other ports have been supported since\nDebian&nbsp;6.0. The actual impact on the ports lacking Rust is also\nless dramatic than it sounded at first. Glaubitz <a href=\"https://lwn.net/ml/all/708d1a6e63d53242cf89f01c2d791e91f1eccab6.camel@physik.fu-berlin.de/\">assured</a>\nAntoni Boucher that \"<q>the ultimatum that Julian set doesn't really\nexist</q>\", but phrasing it that way \"<q>gets more attention in the\nnews</q>\". Boucher is the maintainer of <a href=\"https://rust-for-linux.com/rustc_codegen_gcc\"></a>,\na <a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/954787/#codegen_gcc\">GCC\nahead-of-time code generator for Rust</a>. Nothing, Glaubitz said,\nstops ports from using a non-Rust version of APT until Boucher and\nothers manage to bootstrap Rust for those ports.</p><p>David Kalnischkies, who is also a <a href=\"https://salsa.debian.org/apt-team/apt/-/commits/main?author=David%20Kalnischkies\">major\ncontributor</a> to APT, <a href=\"https://lwn.net/ml/all/sdi72zvp4koyi7h7wo2bwslds2j466ix4sar7wuaks3szphjmp@xg6itydwhqbp/\">suggested</a>\nthat if the goal is to reduce bugs, it would be better to remove the\ncode that is used to parse the .deb, .ar, and .tar formats that Klode\nmentioned from APT entirely. It is only needed for two tools, <a href=\"https://manpages.debian.org/trixie/apt-utils/apt-ftparchive.1.en.html\"></a>\nand <a href=\"https://manpages.debian.org/trixie/apt-utils/apt-extracttemplates.1.en.html\"></a>,\nhe said, and the only \"\" of\n was by Klode's employer, Canonical, for its <a href=\"https://launchpad.net/\">Launchpad</a> software-collaboration\nplatform. If those were taken out of the main APT code base, then it\nwould not matter whether they were written in Rust, Python, or another\nlanguage, since the tools are not directly necessary for any given\nport.</p><p>Kalnischkies also questioned the claim that Rust was necessary to\nachieve the stronger approach to unit testing that Klode mentioned:</p><blockquote><p>You can certainly do unit tests in C++, we do. The main problem is\nthat someone has to write those tests. Like docs.</p><p>Your new solver e.g. has none (apart from our preexisting integration\ntests). You don't seriously claim that is because of C++ ?\nIf you don't like GoogleTest, which is what we currently have,\nI could suggest doctest (as I did in previous installments).\nPlenty other frameworks exist with similar or different styles.</p></blockquote><p>Klode has not responded to those comments yet, which is a bit\nunfortunate given the fact that introducing hard dependencies on\nRust has an impact beyond his own work on APT. It may well be that he\nhas good answers to the questions, but it can also give the\nimpression that Klode is simply embracing a trend toward Rust. He is <a href=\"https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/migration-to-rust-coreutils-in-25-10/59708\">involved</a>\nin the Ubuntu <a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/1014002/\">work to migrate from GNU Coreutils to the Rust-based uutils</a>. The reasons given for that work, again, are around\nmodernization and better security—but security is not automatically \nguaranteed simply by switching to Rust, and there are a number of\nother considerations.</p><p>For example, Adrian Bunk <a href=\"https://lwn.net/ml/all/aQkl0qyIyJ5+y5lC@localhost/\">pointed\nout</a> that there are a number of Debian teams, as well as tooling,\nthat will be impacted by writing some of APT in Rust. The release\nnotes for Debian&nbsp;13 (\"trixie\") <a href=\"https://www.debian.org/releases/trixie/release-notes/issues.html#go-and-rust-based-packages\">mention</a>\nthat Debian's infrastructure \"<q>currently has problems with\nrebuilding packages of types that systematically use static\nlinking</q>\", such as those with code written in Go and Rust. Thus, \"<q>these packages will be\ncovered by limited security support until the infrastructure is\nimproved to deal with them maintainably</q>\". Limited security support\nmeans that updates to Rust libraries are likely to only be released\nwhen Debian publishes a point release, which happens about every two\nmonths. The security team has <a href=\"https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1106154#10\">specifically\nstated</a> that  is fully supported, but there are still\noutstanding problems.</p><p>Due to the static-linking issue, any time one of 's\ndependencies, currently more than 40 Rust crates, have to be rebuilt\ndue to a security issue,  (at least potentially) also\nneeds to be rebuilt. There are also difficulties in tracking CVEs for\nall of its dependencies, and understanding when a security\nvulnerability in a Rust crate may require updating a Rust program that\ndepends on it.</p><p>Fabian Grünbichler, a maintainer of Debian's Rust toolchain, <a href=\"https://lwn.net/ml/all/c818f7ef-eff7-40ac-b153-a88412f71d86@app.fastmail.com/\">listed</a>\nseveral outstanding problems Debian has with dealing with Rust\npackages. One of the largest is the need for a consistent Debian policy for declaring\nstatically linked libraries. In 2022, Guillem Jover added a control\nfield for Debian packages called Static-Built-Using (SBU), which would list\nthe source packages used to build a binary package. This would\nindicate when a binary package needs to be rebuilt due to an update in\nanother source package. For example,  depends on more than\n40 Rust crates that are packaged for Debian. Without declaring the\nSBUs, it may not be clear if  needs to be updated when one\nof its dependencies is updated. Debian has been working on a <a href=\"https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1069256\">policy\nrequirement for SBU</a> since April 2024, but it is not yet finished\nor adopted.</p><p>The discussion sparked by Grünbichler makes clear that most of\nDebian's Rust-related problems are in the process of being\nsolved. However, there's no evidence that Klode explored the problems\nbefore declaring that APT would depend on Rust, or even asked \"is this\na reasonable time frame to introduce this dependency?\"</p><h4>Where tradition meets tomorrow</h4><p>Debian's tagline, or at least one of its taglines, is \"the\nuniversal operating system\", meaning that the project aims to run on a\nwide variety of hardware (old and new) and be usable on the desktop,\nserver, IoT devices, and more. The \"<a href=\"https://www.debian.org/intro/why_debian\">Why Debian</a>\" page\nlists a number of reasons users and developers should choose the\ndistribution: <a href=\"https://www.debian.org/ports\">multiple hardware\narchitectures</a>, <a href=\"https://wiki.debian.org/LTS\">long-term\nsupport</a>, and its <a href=\"https://www.debian.org/devel/constitution\">democratic governance\nstructure</a> are just a few of the arguments it puts forward in favor\nof Debian. It also notes that \"<q>Debian cannot be controlled by a\nsingle company</q>\". A single developer employed by a company to work\non Debian tools pushing a change that seems beneficial to that\ncompany, without discussion or debate, that impacts multiple hardware\narchitectures and that requires other volunteers to do unplanned work\nor meet an artificial deadline seems to go against many of the\nproject's stated values.</p><p>Debian, of course, does have checks and balances that could be\nemployed if other Debian developers feel it necessary. Someone could,\nfor example, appeal to Debian's <a href=\"https://www.debian.org/devel/tech-ctte\">Technical Committee</a>,\nor sponsor a general resolution to override a developer if they cannot\nbe persuaded by discussion alone. That happened recently when the <a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/1041316/\">committee required systemd\nmaintainers to provide the  directory</a> \"<q>until\na satisfactory migration of impacted software has occurred and Policy\nupdated accordingly</q>\".</p><p>However, it also seems fair to point out that Debian can move\nslowly, even glacially, at times. APT <a href=\"https://mvogt.wordpress.com/2015/11/30/apt-1-1-released/\">added</a>\nsupport for the <a href=\"https://repolib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deb822-format.html\">DEB822</a>\nformat for its source information lists in 2015. Despite APT\nsupporting that format for years, Klode faced resistance in 2021, when\nhe <a href=\"https://lwn.net/ml/all/20211103163429.GA3688731@debian.org/\">pushed\nfor Debian to move to the new format</a> ahead of the Debian&nbsp;12\n(\"bookworm\") release in 2021, but was unsuccessful. It is now the\ndefault for trixie with the move to <a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/1017315/\">APT&nbsp;3.0</a>, though APT\nwill continue to support the old format for years to come.</p><p>The fact is, regardless of what Klode does with APT, more and more\nfree software is being written (or rewritten) in Rust. Making it\neasier to support that software when it is packaged for Debian is to\neveryone's benefit. Perhaps the project needs some developers who will\nbe aggressive about pushing the project to move more quickly in\nimproving its support for Rust. However, what is really needed is more\ndevelopers lending a hand to do the work that is needed to support\nRust in Debian and elsewhere, such as <a href=\"https://rust-gcc.github.io/\"></a>. It does not\nseem in keeping with Debian's community focus for a single developer\nto simply declare dependencies that other volunteers will have to\nscramble to support.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Scientists have identified five major “epochs” of human brain development in one of the most comprehensive studies to date of how neural wiring changes from infancy to old age.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-65974-8\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">The study</a>, based on the brain scans of nearly 4,000 people aged under one to 90, mapped neural connections and how they evolve during our lives. This revealed five broad phases, split up by four pivotal “turning points” in which brain organisation moves on to a different trajectory, at around the ages of nine, 32, 66 and 83 years.</p><p>“Looking back, many of us feel our lives have been characterised by different phases. It turns out that brains also go through these eras,” said Prof Duncan Astle, a researcher in neuroinformatics at Cambridge University and senior author of the study.</p><p>“Understanding that the brain’s structural journey is not a question of steady progression, but rather one of a few major turning points, will help us identify when and how its wiring is vulnerable to disruption.”</p><p>The childhood period of development was found to occur between birth until the age of nine, when it transitions to the adolescent phase – an era that lasts up to the age of 32, on average.</p><p>In a person’s early 30s the brain’s neural wiring shifts into adult mode – the longest era, lasting more than three decades. A third turning point around the age of 66 marks the start of an “early ageing” phase of brain architecture. Finally, the “late ageing” brain takes shape at around 83 years old.</p><p>The scientists quantified brain organisation using 12 different measures, including the efficiency of the wiring, how compartmentalised it is and whether the brain relies heavily on central hubs or has a more diffuse connectivity network.</p><p>From infancy through childhood, our brains are defined by “network consolidation”, as the wealth of synapses – the connectors between neurons – in a baby’s brain are whittled down, with the more active ones surviving. During this period, the study found, the efficiency of the brain’s wiring decreases.</p><p>Meanwhile, grey and white matter grow rapidly in volume, so that cortical thickness – the distance between outer grey matter and inner white matter – reaches a peak, and cortical folding, the characteristic ridges on the outer brain, stabilises.</p><p>In the second “epoch” of the brain, the adolescence era, white matter continues to grow in volume, so organisation of the brain’s communications networks is increasingly refined. This era is defined by steadily increasing efficiency of connections across the whole brain, which is related to enhanced cognitive performance. The epochs were defined by the brain remaining on a constant trend of development over a sustained period, rather than staying in a fixed state throughout.</p><p>“We’re definitely not saying that people in their late 20s are going to be acting like teenagers, or even that their brain looks like that of a teenager,” said Alexa Mousley, who led the research. “It’s really the pattern of change.”</p><figure data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement\"><a data-ignore=\"global-link-styling\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/nov/25/brain-human-cognitive-development-life-stages-cambridge-study#EmailSignup-skip-link-11\">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p tabindex=\"0\" aria-label=\"after newsletter promotion\" role=\"note\">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>She added that the findings could give insights into risk factors for mental health disorders, which most frequently emerge during the adolescent period.</p><p>At around the age of 32 the strongest overall shift in trajectory is seen. Life events such as parenthood may play a role in some of the changes seen, although the research did not explicitly test this. “We know that women who give birth, their brain changes afterwards,” said Mousley. “It’s reasonable to assume that there could be a relationship between these milestones and what’s happening in the brain.”</p><p>From 32 years, the brain architecture appears to stabilise compared with previous phases, corresponding with a “plateau in intelligence and personality” based on other studies. Brain regions also become more compartmentalised.</p><p>The final two turning points were defined by decreases in brain connectivity, which were believed to be related to ageing and degeneration of white matter in the brain.</p>",

Without diving into the debate, it’s clear that software development remains one of the riskiest technological endeavors to undertake. Indeed, according to <a href=\"https://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/about-us/people/bent-flyvbjerg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Bent Flyvbjerg</a>, professor emeritus at the University of Oxford’s Saїd Business School, comprehensive data shows that not only are IT projects risky, they are <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5247223\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> riskiest</a> from a cost perspective.</p></div><div data-id=\"9\" data-reload-ads=\"false\" data-is-image=\"False\" data-href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/it-management-software-failures/particle-9\" data-basename=\"particle-9\" data-post-id=\"2674305315\" data-published-at=\"1763498559\" data-use-pagination=\"False\"><p><a href=\"https://www.it-cisq.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/11/CPSQ-Report-Nov-22-2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">CISQ report</a> estimates that organizations in the United States spend more than $520 billion annually supporting legacy software systems, with 70 to 75 percent of organizational IT budgets devoted to legacy maintenance. A<a href=\"https://services.global.ntt/en-us/newsroom/80-percent-of-organizations-agree-that-inadequate-or-outdated-technology-is-holding-back-innovation\" target=\"_blank\"> 2024 report</a> by services company <a href=\"https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/\" target=\"_blank\">NTT DATA</a> found that 80 percent of organizations concede that “inadequate or outdated technology is holding back organizational progress and innovation efforts.” Furthermore, the report says that virtually all C-level executives believe legacy infrastructure thwarts their ability to respond to the market. Even so, given that the cost of replacing legacy systems is typically many multiples of the cost of supporting them, business executives <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/inside-hidden-world-legacy-it-systems\" target=\"_self\">hesitate to replace them</a> until it is no longer operationally feasible or cost-effective. The other reason is a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/lessons-from-a-decade-of-it-failures/lesson-4\" target=\"_self\">well-founded fear</a> that replacing them will turn into a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/debacle\">debacle</a> like Phoenix or<a href=\"https://www.stripes.com/veterans/2025-07-15/veterans-technology-medical-records-18443763.html#:~:text=VA%20leaders%20delivered%20that%20message,according%20to%20the%20federal%20watchdog.\" target=\"_blank\"> others</a></p><p>Nevertheless, there have been ongoing attempts to improve software development and sustainment processes.

However, the same requirements have always been true when introducing any new software platform. Given the historic lack of organizational resolve to instill proven practices, it is not surprising that novel approaches for developing and sustaining ever more complex software systems, no matter how effective they may be, will also frequently fall short.</p><h2>Persisting in Foolish Errors</h2><p>The frustrating and perpetual question is why basic IT project-management and governance mistakes during software development and operations continue to occur so often, given the near-total societal reliance on reliable software and an extensively documented history of failures to learn from? Next to electrical infrastructure, with which IT is increasingly merging into a mutually codependent relationship, the failure of our computing systems is an existential threat to modern society.</p><p>Frustratingly, the IT community <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=7842842\" target=\"_blank\">stubbornly fails to learn</a> from prior failures. <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/it-project\">IT project</a> managers <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2025/03/the-uniqueness-trap\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">routinely claim</a> that their project is somehow different or unique and, thus, lessons from previous failures are irrelevant. That is the excuse of the arrogant, though usually not the ignorant. In Phoenix’s case, for example, it was the government’s <a href=\"https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/bagnall-there-were-lessons-that-might-have-prevented-the-phoenix-pay-disaster-no-one-listened\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">second payroll-system replacement attempt</a>, the first effort ending in failure in 1995. Phoenix project managers ignored the well-documented reasons for the first failure because they claimed its lessons were not applicable, which did nothing to keep the managers from repeating them. As it’s been said, we learn more from failure than from success, but repeated failures are damn expensive.</p></div><div data-id=\"13\" data-reload-ads=\"false\" data-is-image=\"False\" data-href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/it-management-software-failures/particle-13\" data-basename=\"particle-13\" data-post-id=\"2674305315\" data-published-at=\"1763498559\" data-use-pagination=\"False\"><p>Not all software development failures are bad; some failures are even desired. When pushing the limits of developing new types of software products, technologies, or practices, as is happening with AI-related efforts, potential failure is an accepted possibility. With failure, experience increases, new insights are gained, fixes are made, constraints are better understood, and technological innovation and progress continue. However, most IT failures today are not related to pushing the innovative frontiers of the computing art, but the edges of the mundane. They do not represent Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter’s “<a href=\"https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/CreativeDestruction.html\" target=\"_blank\">gales of creative destruction</a>.” They’re more like gales of financial destruction. Just how many more <a href=\"https://www.cio.com/article/278677/enterprise-resource-planning-10-famous-erp-disasters-dustups-and-disappointments.html\" target=\"_blank\">enterprise resource planning (ERP) project failures</a> are needed before success becomes routine? Such failures should be called IT blunders, as learning anything new from them is dubious at best.</p><p>Was Phoenix a failure or a blunder? I argue strongly for the latter, but at the very least, Phoenix serves as a master class in IT <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/project-mismanagement\">project mismanagement</a>. The question is whether the Canadian government learned from this experience any more than it did from 1995’s payroll-project fiasco? <a href=\"https://www.thealbertan.com/national-news/fixing-problems-with-phoenix-payroll-system-cost-taxpayers-51-billion-official-10851998\" target=\"_blank\">The government maintains it will learn</a>, which might be true, given the Phoenix failure’s high political profile. But will Phoenix’s lessons extend to the <a href=\"https://www.oag-bvg.gc.ca/internet/English/parl_oag_202310_07_e_44340.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">thousands of outdated Canadian government IT systems</a> needing replacement or modernization?

They had to be dragged, kicking and screaming, to acknowledge that something was amiss, even after it was clearly demonstrated that the software was untrustworthy. Even then, officials tried to downplay the errors’ impact on people, then fought against paying compensation to those adversely affected by the errors. While such behavior is legally termed “maladministration,” <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8057305\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">administrative evil</a> is closer to reality.</p></div><div data-id=\"20\" data-reload-ads=\"false\" data-is-image=\"False\" data-href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/it-management-software-failures/particle-20\" data-basename=\"particle-20\" data-post-id=\"2674305315\" data-published-at=\"1763498559\" data-use-pagination=\"False\"><p>So, we are left with only a professional and personal obligation to reemphasize the obvious: Ask what you do know, what you should know, and how big the gap is between them before embarking on creating an IT system. If no one else has ever successfully built your system with the schedule, budget, and functionality you asked for, please explain why your organization thinks it can. Software is inherently fragile; building complex, secure, and resilient software systems is difficult, detailed, and time-consuming. Small errors have outsize effects, each with an almost infinite number of ways they can manifest, from causing a minor functional error to a system outage to allowing a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/cybersecurity\">cybersecurity</a> threat to penetrate the system. The more complex and interconnected the system, the more opportunities for errors and their exploitation. A nice start would be for senior management who control the purse strings to finally treat software and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/systems-development\">systems development</a>, operations, and sustainment efforts with the respect they deserve.

      "content": "<p>A couple of weeks ago, I decided to do away with my Netflix subscription. I simply was barely using it, and whenever I did it was more out of habit than it really being the thing I wanted to do with my time. Sure, there's still some decent stuff on there, but the vast majority of it feels absolutely moneyballed. Good, but somehow , and with no character.</p><p>As much as I'd love to elaborate on why I think Netflix is evil, that's not todays topic. What I wanted to share is how for approximately the price I was paying for my subscription (€19.99), I've snapped up three subscriptions that I'm using on a daily basis. They're all pretty much interchangeable with other alternatives. The main thing I want to highlight is the individual slot they each fill out for me.</p><h2>1. A subscription to Zed Pro (~€10)</h2><p>Frankly, I haven't really put too much thought into whether the unit economics are the best here. The main point is, these are €10 that make my coding experience more pleasant, and get me writing more code in my spare time. In that sense it's money well spent.</p><p>Does it matter if you get a Cursor subscription, or a Zed one, or whatever else is in vogue when you're reading? No, just get the thing that will get you excited to get your hands on the keyboard!\nTo me, Zed feels more intentionally built than the VSClones: things flow nicely, it feels snappy, the ui is less cluttered... It's just .</p><p>Editor preferences aside, the main takeaway is, invest in a hobby you actively engage in. Make that little bit more appealing and you have one more reason to be spending your time doing the thing that makes you feel good, rather than letting a couple hours a day evaporate watching another forgettable show.</p><h2>2. A Kagi subscription (~€5/month)</h2><p>I think we can mostly agree google kind of sucks nowadays. Whenever I search, I automatically scroll down to skip the sponsored posts and SEO maxxed websites, and still don't fully trust what I get. Maybe that's why we all started appending “reddit” the end of our searches.</p><p>Are the search results themselves better with Kagi? To be honest, I can't tell yet, others have written far more informed takes on the topic. What does it for me is the simple fact of being able to pay directly for a service that I use, and value, rather than having to trade my attention in and endure a wall of ads. Especially if it's something I use over and over, every day. That's what I mean to highlight here: we can support products that we enjoy by paying for them (who would have thought?) rather than letting them lobotomize us via ad feeds.</p><h2>3. A cheap server on Hetzner (~€4/month)</h2><p>Again, the choice of provider here is secondary. The point is, I finally have my little stake on the internet. It's relatively barebones, and I like that. It forces me to learn and engage. In fact, that is where my blog is hosted!</p><p>So to sum it up: We don't  to default to a streaming subscription because that's become the standard human-being thing to do. For the same money you can build a suite of useful, well crafted tools that help you:\n– Get the most out of your hobbies\n– Spend less time looking at ads\n– Build things you can share with the world</p><p>P.S. Not one word here was written by AI. I plan on keeping it that way for anything that goes on this blog. So, if anything reads like slop, it's  slop :)</p>",

      "content": "<p>But there was a problem. Despite having a stable PPS reference, my NTP server’s frequency drift was exhibiting significant variation over time. After months (years) of monitoring the system with Grafana dashboards, I noticed something interesting: the frequency oscillations seemed to correlate with CPU temperature changes. The frequency would drift as the CPU heated up during the day and cooled down at night, even though the PPS reference remained rock-solid.</p><p>Like clockwork (no pun intended), I somehow get sucked back into trying to improve my setup every 6-8 weeks. This post is the latest on that never-ending quest.</p><p>This post details how I achieved an <strong>81% reduction in frequency variability</strong> and <strong>77% reduction in frequency standard deviation</strong> through a combination of CPU core pinning and thermal stabilization. Welcome to Austin’s Nerdy Things, where we solve problems that 99.999% of people (and 99% of datacenters) don’t have.</p><h2>The Problem: Thermal-Induced Timing Jitter</h2><p>Modern CPUs, including those in Raspberry Pis, use dynamic frequency scaling to save power and manage heat. When the CPU is idle, it runs at a lower frequency (and voltage). When load increases, it scales up. This is great for power efficiency, but terrible for precision timekeeping.</p><p>Why? Because timekeeping (with NTP/chronyd/others) relies on a stable system clock to discipline itself against reference sources. If the CPU frequency is constantly changing, the system clock’s tick rate varies, introducing jitter into the timing measurements. Even though my PPS signal was providing a mostly perfect 1-pulse-per-second reference, the CPU’s frequency bouncing around made it harder for chronyd to maintain a stable lock.</p><p>But here’s the key insight: <strong>the system clock is ultimately derived from a crystal oscillator</strong>, and crystal oscillator frequency is temperature-dependent. The oscillator sits on the board near the CPU, and as the CPU heats up and cools down throughout the day, so does the crystal. Even a few degrees of temperature change can shift the oscillator’s frequency by parts per million – exactly what I was seeing in my frequency drift graphs. The CPU frequency scaling was one factor, but the underlying problem was that temperature changes were affecting the crystal oscillator itself. By stabilizing the CPU temperature, I could stabilize the thermal environment for the crystal oscillator, keeping its frequency consistent.</p><p>Looking at my Grafana dashboard, I could see the frequency offset wandering over a range of about 1 PPM (parts per million) as the Pi warmed up and cooled down throughout the day. The RMS offset was averaging around 86 nanoseconds, which isn’t terrible (it’s actually really, really, really good), but I knew it could be better.</p><p>After staring at graphs for longer than I’d like to admit, I had an idea: what if I could keep the CPU at a constant temperature? If the temperature (and therefore the frequency) stayed stable, maybe the timing would stabilize too.</p><p>The solution came in two parts:</p><p>1.  – Dedicate CPU 0 exclusively to timing-critical tasks (chronyd and PPS interrupts) 2.  – Keep the other CPUs busy to maintain a constant temperature, preventing frequency scaling</p><p>Here’s what happened when I turned on the thermal stabilization system on November 17, 2025 at 09:10 AM:</p><p>Same ish graph but with CPU temp also plotted:</p><p>That vertical red line marks on the first plot when I activated the “time burner” process. Notice how the frequency oscillations immediately dampen and settle into a much tighter band? Let’s dive into how this works.</p><h2>The Solution Part 1: CPU Core Pinning and Real-Time Priority</h2><p>The first step is isolating timing-critical operations onto a dedicated CPU core. On a Raspberry Pi (4-core ARM), this means:</p><ul><li>CPU 0: Reserved for chronyd and PPS interrupts</li><li>CPUs 1-3: Everything else, including our thermal load</li></ul><p>I had AI (probably Claude Sonnet 4 ish, maybe 4.5) create a boot optimization script that runs at system startup:</p><pre><code>#!/bin/bash\n# PPS NTP Server Performance Optimization Script\n# Sets CPU affinity, priorities, and performance governor at boot\n\nset -e\n\necho \"Setting up PPS NTP server performance optimizations...\"\n\n# Wait for system to be ready\nsleep 5\n\n# Set CPU governor to performance mode\necho \"Setting CPU governor to performance...\"\ncpupower frequency-set -g performance\n\n# Pin PPS interrupt to CPU0 (may fail if already pinned, that's OK)\necho \"Configuring PPS interrupt affinity...\"\necho 1 &gt; /proc/irq/200/smp_affinity 2&gt;/dev/null || echo \"PPS IRQ already configured\"\n\n# Wait for chronyd to start\necho \"Waiting for chronyd to start...\"\ntimeout=30\nwhile [ $timeout -gt 0 ]; do\n    chronyd_pid=$(pgrep chronyd 2&gt;/dev/null || echo \"\")\n    if [ -n \"$chronyd_pid\" ]; then\n        echo \"Found chronyd PID: $chronyd_pid\"\n        break\n    fi\n    sleep 1\n    ((timeout--))\ndone\n\nif [ -z \"$chronyd_pid\" ]; then\n    echo \"Warning: chronyd not found after 30 seconds\"\nelse\n    # Set chronyd to real-time priority and pin to CPU 0\n    echo \"Setting chronyd to real-time priority and pinning to CPU 0...\"\n    chrt -f -p 50 $chronyd_pid\n    taskset -cp 0 $chronyd_pid\nfi\n\n# Boost ksoftirqd/0 priority\necho \"Boosting ksoftirqd/0 priority...\"\nksoftirqd_pid=$(ps aux | grep '\\[ksoftirqd/0\\]' | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}')\nif [ -n \"$ksoftirqd_pid\" ]; then\n    renice -n -10 $ksoftirqd_pid\n    echo \"ksoftirqd/0 priority boosted (PID: $ksoftirqd_pid)\"\nelse\n    echo \"Warning: ksoftirqd/0 not found\"\nfi\n\necho \"PPS NTP optimization complete!\"\n\n# Log current status\necho \"=== Current Status ===\"\necho \"CPU Governor: $(cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor)\"\necho \"PPS IRQ Affinity: $(cat /proc/irq/200/effective_affinity_list 2&gt;/dev/null || echo 'not readable')\"\nif [ -n \"$chronyd_pid\" ]; then\n    echo \"chronyd Priority: $(chrt -p $chronyd_pid)\"\nfi\necho \"======================\"</code></pre><ol><li>: Forces all CPUs to run at maximum frequency, disabling frequency scaling</li><li>: Ensures PPS interrupt (IRQ 200) is handled exclusively by CPU 0</li><li><strong>Chronyd Real-Time Priority</strong>: Sets chronyd to SCHED_FIFO priority 50, giving it preferential CPU scheduling</li><li>C: Pins chronyd to CPU 0 using </li><li>: Improves priority of the kernel softirq handler on CPU 0</li></ol><p>This script can be added to  or as a systemd service to run at boot.</p><h2>The Solution Part 2: PID-Controlled Thermal Stabilization</h2><p>Setting the performance governor helps, but on a Raspberry Pi, even at max frequency, the CPU temperature will still vary based on ambient conditions and load. Temperature changes affect the CPU’s actual operating frequency due to thermal characteristics of the silicon.</p><p>The solution? Keep the CPU at a constant temperature using a PID-controlled thermal load. I call it the “time burner” (inspired by CPU burn-in tools, but with precise temperature control).</p><p>As a reminder of what we’re really doing here: <strong>we’re maintaining a stable thermal environment for the crystal oscillator</strong>. The RPi 3B’s 19.2 MHz oscillator is physically located near the CPU on the Raspberry Pi board, so by actively controlling CPU temperature, we’re indirectly controlling the oscillator’s temperature. Since the oscillator’s frequency is temperature-dependent (this is basic physics of quartz crystals), keeping it at a constant temperature means keeping its frequency stable – which is exactly what we need for precise timekeeping.</p><ol><li> from <code>/sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp</code></li><li> calculates how much CPU time to burn to maintain target temperature (I chose 54°C) </li><li> run on CPUs 1, 2, and 3 (avoiding CPU 0) </li><li> alternates between busy-loop (MD5 hashing) and sleeping based on PID output </li><li> at the setpoint, preventing thermal drift</li></ol><p>Here’s the core implementation (simplified for readability):</p><pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport time\nimport argparse\nimport multiprocessing\nimport hashlib\nimport os\nfrom collections import deque\n\nclass PIDController:\n    \"\"\"Simple PID controller with output clamping and anti-windup.\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, Kp, Ki, Kd, setpoint, output_limits=(0, 1), sample_time=1.0):\n        self.Kp = Kp\n        self.Ki = Ki\n        self.Kd = Kd\n        self.setpoint = setpoint\n        self.output_limits = output_limits\n        self.sample_time = sample_time\n        self._last_time = time.time()\n        self._last_error = 0.0\n        self._integral = 0.0\n        self._last_output = 0.0\n\n    def update(self, measurement):\n        \"\"\"Compute new output of PID based on measurement.\"\"\"\n        now = time.time()\n        dt = now - self._last_time\n\n        if dt &lt;

While the time burner maintains the CPU die temperature at 54°C, the enclosure is still subject to ambient temperature swings. Room temperature cycles from a low of 66°F (18.9°C) at 5:15 AM to a peak of 72°F (22.2°C) at 11:30 AM – a 6°F daily swing from our heating schedule.

My Pi now draws about 3-4W continuously (vs 1-2W idle). Over a year, that’s an extra 15-25 kWh, or about $2-3 in electricity (depending on your rates).</p><p>Running at 54°C means the Pi is warm to the touch. This is well within safe operating temperature (thermal throttling doesn’t start until 80°C), but you might want to ensure adequate ventilation. I added a small heatsink just to be safe.</p><p>You’re dedicating 3 of 4 cores to burning cycles. This is fine for a dedicated NTP server, but not suitable if you’re running other services on the same Pi. That said, I am also running the feeder to my new <a href=\"https://skyspottr.com/map/\">ADS-B aircraft visualization app</a> on it. My readsb instance regularly gets to 1200 msg/s with 200+ aircraft.</p><p>For 99.999% of use cases: .</p><p>Most applications don’t need better than millisecond accuracy, let alone the 35-nanosecond RMS offset I’m achieving. Even for distributed systems, microsecond-level accuracy is typically overkill.</p><p><strong>When this might make sense:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Precision timing applications</strong> (scientific instrumentation, radio astronomy)</li><li><strong>Distributed systems research</strong> requiring tight clock synchronization</li><li> where timing precision affects results</li><li> (the best reason for any homelab project)</li></ul><p>For me, this falls squarely in the “because you can” category. I had the monitoring infrastructure in place, noticed the thermal correlation, and couldn’t resist solving the problem. Plus, I learned a lot about PID control, CPU thermal characteristics, and Linux real-time scheduling.</p><p>Some ideas I’m considering:</p><p>The current PID gains are hand-tuned for a specific ambient temperature range. The fairly low P value is to avoid spikes when some load on the Pi kicks up the temp. The I is a balance to keep long term “burn” relatively consistent. Implementing an auto-tuning algorithm (like Ziegler-Nichols) or adaptive PID could handle seasonal temperature variations better.</p><p>Instead of software thermal control, I could add an actively cooled heatsink with PWM fan control. This might achieve similar temperature stability while using less power overall.</p><h3>Oven-Controlled Crystal Oscillator (OCXO)</h3><p>For the ultimate in frequency stability, replacing the Pi’s crystal with a temperature-controlled OCXO would eliminate thermal drift at the source. This is how professional timing equipment works. I do have a BH3SAP GPSDO sitting next to me (subject to a future post)… Then again, I’m the person who just wrote 4000 words about optimizing a $50 time server, so who am I kidding?</p><p>Through a combination of CPU core isolation and PID-controlled thermal stabilization, I achieved:</p><ul><li> in frequency variability</li><li> in frequency standard deviation</li><li> in frequency range</li><li> in RMS offset</li></ul><p>The system now maintains 38-nanosecond median RMS offset from the GPS PPS reference, with frequency drift that’s barely detectable in the noise. The CPU runs at a constant 54°C, and in steady state, the frequency offset stays within a tight ±0.14 PPM band (compared to ±0.52 PPM before optimization).</p><p>Was this necessary? No. Did I learn a bunch about thermal management, PID control, and Linux real-time scheduling? Yes. Would I do it again? Absolutely.</p><p>I did come across a “burn” script that was the basis for this thermal management. I can’t find it at the moment, but when I do I’ll link it here.</p><p>Have questions or suggestions? Drop a comment below. I’m particularly interested to hear if anyone has tried alternative thermal management approaches or has experience with OCXO modules for Raspberry Pi timing applications.</p><p>Thanks for reading, and happy timekeeping!</p>",

Are we born with a pre-configured brain, or do thought patterns only begin to emerge in response to our sensory experiences of the world around us? Now, science is getting closer to answering the questions philosophers have pondered for centuries.&nbsp;</p><p>Researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, are using tiny models of human brain tissue, called organoids, to study the earliest moments of electrical activity in the brain. <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-02111-0\">A new study</a> in  finds that the earliest firings of the brain occur in structured patterns without any external experiences, suggesting that the human brain is preconfigured with instructions about how to navigate and interact with the world.</p><p>“These cells are clearly interacting with each other and forming circuits that self-assemble before we can experience anything from the outside world,” said Tal Sharf, assistant professor of biomolecular engineering at the Baskin School of Engineering and the study’s senior author. “There’s an operating system that exists, that emerges in a primordial state. In my laboratory, we grow brain organoids to peer into this primordial version of the brain’s operating system and study how the brain builds itself before it’s shaped by sensory experience.”</p><p>In improving our fundamental understanding of human brain development, these findings can help researchers better understand neurodevelopmental disorders, and pinpoint the impact of toxins like pesticides and microplastics in the developing brain.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Studying the developing brain</strong></h4><p>The brain, similar to a computer, runs on electrical signals—the firing of neurons. When these signals begin to fire, and how the human brain develops, are challenging topics for scientists to study, as the early developing human brain is protected within the womb.</p><p>Organoids, which are 3D models of tissue grown from human stem cells in the lab, provide a unique window into brain development. The <a href=\"https://braingeneers.ucsc.edu/\">Braingeneers group</a> at UC Santa Cruz, in collaboration with researchers at UC San Francisco and UC Santa Barbara, are pioneering methods to grow these models and take measurements from them to gain insights into brain development and disorders.&nbsp;</p><p>Organoids are particularly useful for understanding if the brain develops in response to sensory input—as they exist in the lab setting and not the body—and can be grown ethically in large quantities. In this study, researchers prompted stem cells to form brain tissue, and then measured their electrical activity using specialized microchips, similar to those that run a computer. Sharf’s background in both applied physics, computation, and neurobiology form his expertise in modelling the circuitry of the early brain.&nbsp;</p><p>“An organoid system that’s intrinsically decoupled from any sensory input or communication with organs gives you a window into what’s happening with this self-assembly process,” Sharf said. “That self-assembly process is really hard to do with traditional 2D cell culture—you can’t get the cell diversity and the architecture. The cells need to be in intimate contact with each other. We’re trying to control the initial conditions, so we can let biology do its wonderful thing.”</p><p>The Sharf lab is developing novel neural interfaces, leveraging expertise in physics, materials science, and electrical engineering. On the right, Koushik Devarajan, an electrical and computer engineering Ph.D. student in the Sharf lab.</p><p>The researchers observed the electrical activity of the brain tissue as they self-assembled from stem cells into a tissue that can translate the senses and produce language and conscious thought. They found that within the first few months of development, long before the human brain is capable of receiving and processing complex external sensory information such as vision and hearing, its cells spontaneously began to emit electrical signals characteristic of the patterns that underlie translation of the senses.&nbsp;</p><p>Through decades of neuroscience research, the community has discovered that neurons fire in patterns that aren’t just random. Instead, the brain has a “default mode” — a basic underlying structure for firing neurons which then becomes more specific as the brain processes unique signals like a smell or taste. This background mode outlines the possible range of sensory responses the body and brain can produce.</p><p>In their observations of single neuron spikes in the self-assembling organoid models, Sharf and colleagues found that these earliest observable patterns have striking similarity with the brain’s default mode. Even without having received any sensory input, they are firing off a complex repertoire of time-based patterns, or sequences, which have the potential to be refined for specific senses, hinting at a genetically encoded blueprint inherent to the neural architecture of the living brain.</p><p>“These intrinsically self-organized systems could serve as a basis for constructing a representation of the world around us,” Sharf said. “The fact that we can see them in these early stages suggests that evolution has figured out a way that the central nervous system can construct a map that would allow us to navigate and interact with the world.”</p><p>Knowing that these organoids produce the basic structure of the living brain opens up a range of possibilities for better understanding human neurodevelopment, disease, and the effects of toxins in the brain.&nbsp;</p><p>“We’re showing that there is a basis for capturing complex dynamics that likely could be signatures of pathological onsets that we could study in human tissue,” Sharf said. “That would allow us to develop therapies, working with clinicians at the preclinical level to potentially develop compounds, drug therapies, and gene editing tools that could be cheaper, more efficient, higher throughput.”</p><p>This study included researchers at UC Santa Barbara, Washington University in St. Louis, Johns Hopkins University, the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, and ETH Zurich.</p>",

Agents should discover and load tools on-demand, keeping only what's relevant for the current task.</p><p>Agents also need the ability to call tools from code. When using natural language tool calling, each invocation requires a full inference pass, and intermediate results pile up in context whether they're useful or not. Code is a natural fit for orchestration logic, such as loops, conditionals, and data transformations. Agents need the flexibility to choose between code execution and inference based on the task at hand.</p><p>Agents also need to learn correct tool usage from examples, not just schema definitions. JSON schemas define what's structurally valid, but can't express usage patterns: when to include optional parameters, which combinations make sense, or what conventions your API expects.</p><p>Today, we're releasing three features that make this possible:</p><ul><li>which allows Claude to use search tools to access thousands of tools without consuming its context window</li><li><strong>Programmatic Tool Calling</strong>, which allows Claude to invoke tools in a code execution environment reducing the impact on the model’s context window</li><li>, which provides a universal standard for demonstrating how to effectively use a given tool</li></ul><p>In internal testing, we’ve found these features have helped us build things that wouldn’t have been possible with conventional tool use patterns. For example,uses Programmatic Tool Calling to read and modify spreadsheets with thousands of rows without overloading the model’s context window.</p><p>Based on our experience, we believe these features open up new possibilities for what you can build with Claude.</p><p>MCP tool definitions provide important context, but as more servers connect, those tokens can add up. Consider a five-server setup:</p><ul><li>GitHub: 35 tools (~26K tokens)</li><li>Slack: 11 tools (~21K tokens)</li><li>Sentry: 5 tools (~3K tokens)</li><li>Grafana: 5 tools (~3K tokens)</li><li>Splunk: 2 tools (~2K tokens)</li></ul><p>That's 58 tools consuming approximately 55K tokens before the conversation even starts. Add more servers like Jira (which alone uses ~17K tokens) and you're quickly approaching 100K+ token overhead. At Anthropic, we've seen tool definitions consume 134K tokens before optimization.</p><p>But token cost isn't the only issue. The most common failures are wrong tool selection and incorrect parameters, especially when tools have similar names like  vs. <code>notification-send-channel</code>.</p><p>Instead of loading all tool definitions upfront, the Tool Search Tool discovers tools on-demand. Claude only sees the tools it actually needs for the current task.</p><ul><li>All tool definitions loaded upfront (~72K tokens for 50+ MCP tools)</li><li>Conversation history and system prompt compete for remaining space</li><li>Total context consumption: ~77K tokens before any work begins</li></ul><p>With the Tool Search Tool:</p><ul><li>Only the Tool Search Tool loaded upfront (~500 tokens)</li><li>Tools discovered on-demand as needed (3-5 relevant tools, ~3K tokens)</li><li>Total context consumption: ~8.7K tokens, preserving 95% of context window</li></ul><p>This represents an 85% reduction in token usage while maintaining access to your full tool library. Internal testing showed significant accuracy improvements on MCP evaluations when working with large tool libraries. Opus 4 improved from 49% to 74%, and Opus 4.5 improved from 79.5% to 88.1% with Tool Search Tool enabled.</p><h3>How the Tool Search Tool works</h3><p>The Tool Search Tool lets Claude dynamically discover tools instead of loading all definitions upfront. You provide all your tool definitions to the API, but mark tools with  to make them discoverable on-demand. Deferred tools aren't loaded into Claude's context initially. Claude only sees the Tool Search Tool itself plus any tools with  (your most critical, frequently-used tools).</p><p>When Claude needs specific capabilities, it searches for relevant tools. The Tool Search Tool returns references to matching tools, which get expanded into full definitions in Claude's context.</p><p>For example, if Claude needs to interact with GitHub, it searches for \"github,\" and only  and  get loaded—not your other 50+ tools from Slack, Jira, and Google Drive.</p><p>This way, Claude has access to your full tool library while only paying the token cost for tools it actually needs.</p><p>Tool Search Tool doesn't break prompt caching because deferred tools are excluded from the initial prompt entirely. They're only added to context after Claude searches for them, so your system prompt and core tool definitions remain cacheable.</p><p>For MCP servers, you can defer loading entire servers while keeping specific high-use tools loaded:</p><p>The Claude Developer Platform provides regex-based and BM25-based search tools out of the box, but you can also implement custom search tools using embeddings or other strategies.</p><h3>When to use the Tool Search Tool</h3><p>Like any architectural decision, enabling the Tool Search Tool involves trade-offs. The feature adds a search step before tool invocation, so it delivers the best ROI when the context savings and accuracy improvements outweigh additional latency.</p><ul><li>Tool definitions consuming &gt;10K tokens</li><li>Experiencing tool selection accuracy issues</li><li>Building MCP-powered systems with multiple servers</li></ul><ul><li>Small tool library (&lt;10 tools)</li><li>All tools used frequently in every session</li><li>Tool definitions are compact</li></ul><h2>Programmatic Tool Calling</h2><p>Traditional tool calling creates two fundamental problems as workflows become more complex:</p><ul><li><strong>Context pollution from intermediate results</strong>: When Claude analyzes a 10MB log file for error patterns, the entire file enters its context window, even though Claude only needs a summary of error frequencies. When fetching customer data across multiple tables, every record accumulates in context regardless of relevance. These intermediate results consume massive token budgets and can push important information out of the context window entirely.</li><li><strong>Inference overhead and manual synthesis</strong>: Each tool call requires a full model inference pass. After receiving results, Claude must \"eyeball\" the data to extract relevant information, reason about how pieces fit together, and decide what to do next—all through natural language processing. A five tool workflow means five inference passes plus Claude parsing each result, comparing values, and synthesizing conclusions. This is both slow and error-prone.</li></ul><p>Programmatic Tool Calling enables Claude to orchestrate tools through code rather than through individual API round-trips. Instead of Claude requesting tools one at a time with each result being returned to its context, Claude writes code that calls multiple tools, processes their outputs, and controls what information actually enters its context window.</p><p>Claude excels at writing code and by letting it express orchestration logic in Python rather than through natural language tool invocations, you get more reliable, precise control flow. Loops, conditionals, data transformations, and error handling are all explicit in code rather than implicit in Claude's reasoning.</p><h4>Example: Budget compliance check</h4><p>Consider a common business task: \"Which team members exceeded their Q3 travel budget?\"</p><p>You have three tools available:</p><ul><li><code>get_team_members(department)</code> - Returns team member list with IDs and levels</li><li><code>get_expenses(user_id, quarter)</code> - Returns expense line items for a user</li><li><code>get_budget_by_level(level)</code> - Returns budget limits for an employee level</li></ul><ul><li>Fetch team members → 20 people</li><li>For each person, fetch their Q3 expenses → 20 tool calls, each returning 50-100 line items (flights, hotels, meals, receipts)</li><li>Fetch budget limits by employee level</li><li>All of this enters Claude's context: 2,000+ expense line items (50 KB+)</li><li>Claude manually sums each person's expenses, looks up their budget, compares expenses against budget limits</li><li>More round-trips to the model, significant context consumption</li></ul><p><strong>With Programmatic Tool Calling</strong>:</p><p>Instead of each tool result returning to Claude, Claude writes a Python script that orchestrates the entire workflow. The script runs in the Code Execution tool (a sandboxed environment), pausing when it needs results from your tools. When you return tool results via the API, they're processed by the script rather than consumed by the model. The script continues executing, and Claude only sees the final output.</p><p>Here's what Claude's orchestration code looks like for the budget compliance task:</p><p>Claude's context receives only the final result: the two to three people who exceeded their budget. The 2,000+ line items, the intermediate sums, and the budget lookups do not affect Claude’s context, reducing consumption from 200KB of raw expense data to just 1KB of results.</p><p>The efficiency gains are substantial:</p><ul><li>: By keeping intermediate results out of Claude's context, PTC dramatically reduces token consumption. Average usage dropped from 43,588 to 27,297 tokens, a 37% reduction on complex research tasks.</li><li>: Each API round-trip requires model inference (hundreds of milliseconds to seconds). When Claude orchestrates 20+ tool calls in a single code block, you eliminate 19+ inference passes. The API handles tool execution without returning to the model each time.</li><li>: By writing explicit orchestration logic, Claude makes fewer errors than when juggling multiple tool results in natural language. Internal knowledge retrieval improved from 25.6% to 28.5%; <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12983\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GIA benchmarks</a> from 46.5% to 51.2%.</li></ul><p>Production workflows involve messy data, conditional logic, and operations that need to scale. Programmatic Tool Calling lets Claude handle that complexity programmatically while keeping its focus on actionable results rather than raw data processing.</p><h3>How Programmatic Tool Calling works</h3><h4>1. Mark tools as callable from code</h4><p>Add code_execution to tools, and set allowed_callers to opt-in tools for programmatic execution:</p><p>The API converts these tool definitions into Python functions that Claude can call.</p><h4>2. Claude writes orchestration code</h4><p>Instead of requesting tools one at a time, Claude generates Python code:</p><h4>3. Tools execute without hitting Claude's context</h4><p>When the code calls get_expenses(), you receive a tool request with a caller field:</p><p>You provide the result, which is processed in the Code Execution environment rather than Claude's context. This request-response cycle repeats for each tool call in the code.</p><h4>4. Only final output enters context</h4><p>When the code finishes running, only the results of the code are returned to Claude:</p><p>This is all Claude sees, not the 2000+ expense line items processed along the way.</p><h3>When to use Programmatic Tool Calling</h3><p>Programmatic Tool Calling adds a code execution step to your workflow. This extra overhead pays off when the token savings, latency improvements, and accuracy gains are substantial.</p><ul><li>Processing large datasets where you only need aggregates or summaries</li><li>Running multi-step workflows with three or more dependent tool calls</li><li>Filtering, sorting, or transforming tool results before Claude sees them</li><li>Handling tasks where intermediate data shouldn't influence Claude's reasoning</li><li>Running parallel operations across many items (checking 50 endpoints, for example)</li></ul><ul><li>Making simple single-tool invocations</li><li>Working on tasks where Claude should see and reason about all intermediate results</li><li>Running quick lookups with small responses</li></ul><p>JSON Schema excels at defining structure–types, required fields, allowed enums–but it can't express usage patterns: when to include optional parameters, which combinations make sense, or what conventions your API expects.</p><p>Consider a support ticket API:</p><p>The schema defines what's valid, but leaves critical questions unanswered:</p><ul><li>Should  use \"2024-11-06\", \"Nov 6, 2024\", or \"2024-11-06T00:00:00Z\"?</li><li>Is  a UUID, \"USR-12345\", or just \"12345\"?</li><li>When should Claude populate ?</li><li>How do  and  relate to priority?</li></ul><p>These ambiguities can lead to malformed tool calls and inconsistent parameter usage.</p><p>Tool Use Examples let you provide sample tool calls directly in your tool definitions. Instead of relying on schema alone, you show Claude concrete usage patterns:</p><p>From these three examples, Claude learns:</p><ul><li>: Dates use YYYY-MM-DD, user IDs follow USR-XXXXX, labels use kebab-case</li><li><strong>Nested structure patterns</strong>: How to construct the reporter object with its nested contact object</li><li><strong>Optional parameter correlations</strong>: Critical bugs have full contact info + escalation with tight SLAs; feature requests have reporter but no contact/escalation; internal tasks have title only</li></ul><p>In our own internal testing, tool use examples improved accuracy from 72% to 90% on complex parameter handling.</p><h3>When to use Tool Use Examples</h3><p>Tool Use Examples add tokens to your tool definitions, so they’re most valuable when accuracy improvements outweigh the additional cost.</p><ul><li>Complex nested structures where valid JSON doesn't imply correct usage</li><li>Tools with many optional parameters and inclusion patterns matter</li><li>APIs with domain-specific conventions not captured in schemas</li><li>Similar tools where examples clarify which one to use (e.g.,  vs )</li></ul><ul><li>Simple single-parameter tools with obvious usage</li><li>Standard formats like URLs or emails that Claude already understands</li><li>Validation concerns better handled by JSON Schema constraints</li></ul><p>Building agents that take real-world actions means handling scale, complexity, and precision simultaneously. These three features work together to solve different bottlenecks in tool use workflows. Here's how to combine them effectively.</p><h3>Layer features strategically</h3><p>Not every agent needs to use all three features for a given task. Start with your biggest bottleneck:</p><ul><li>Context bloat from tool definitions → Tool Search Tool</li><li>Large intermediate results polluting context → Programmatic Tool Calling</li><li>Parameter errors and malformed calls → Tool Use Examples</li></ul><p>This focused approach lets you address the specific constraint limiting your agent's performance, rather than adding complexity upfront.</p><p>Then layer additional features as needed. They're complementary: Tool Search Tool ensures the right tools are found, Programmatic Tool Calling ensures efficient execution, and Tool Use Examples ensure correct invocation.</p><h3>Set up Tool Search Tool for better discovery</h3><p>Tool search matches against names and descriptions, so clear, descriptive definitions improve discovery accuracy.</p><p>Add system prompt guidance so Claude knows what's available:</p><p>Keep your three to five most-used tools always loaded, defer the rest. This balances immediate access for common operations with on-demand discovery for everything else.</p><h3>Set up Programmatic Tool Calling for correct execution</h3><p>Since Claude writes code to parse tool outputs, document return formats clearly. This helps Claude write correct parsing logic:</p><p>See below for opt-in tools that benefit from programmatic orchestration:</p><ul><li>Tools that can run in parallel (independent operations)</li><li>Operations safe to retry (idempotent)</li></ul><h3>Set up Tool Use Examples for parameter accuracy</h3><p>Craft examples for behavioral clarity:</p><ul><li>Use realistic data (real city names, plausible prices, not \"string\" or \"value\")</li><li>Show variety with minimal, partial, and full specification patterns</li><li>Keep it concise: 1-5 examples per tool</li><li>Focus on ambiguity (only add examples where correct usage isn't obvious from schema)</li></ul><p>These features are available in beta. To enable them, add the beta header and include the tools you need:</p><p>For detailed API documentation and SDK examples, see our:</p><ul></ul><p>These features move tool use from simple function calling toward intelligent orchestration. As agents tackle more complex workflows spanning dozens of tools and large datasets, dynamic discovery, efficient execution, and reliable invocation become foundational.</p><p>We're excited to see what you build.</p><p>Written by Bin Wu, with contributions from Adam Jones, Artur Renault, Henry Tay, Jake Noble, Nathan McCandlish, Noah Picard, Sam Jiang, and the Claude Developer Platform team.

      "content": "<p>Our newest model, Claude Opus 4.5, is available today. It’s intelligent, efficient, and the best model in the world for coding, agents, and computer use. It’s also meaningfully better at everyday tasks like deep research and working with slides and spreadsheets. Opus 4.5 is a step forward in what AI systems can do, and a preview of larger changes to how work gets done.</p><p>Claude Opus 4.5 is state-of-the-art on tests of real-world software engineering:</p><p>Opus 4.5 is available today on our apps, our API, and on all three major cloud platforms. If you’re a developer, simply use  via the <a href=\"https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/models/overview\">Claude API</a>. Pricing is now $5/$25 per million tokens—making Opus-level capabilities accessible to even more users, teams, and enterprises.</p><p>Alongside Opus, we’re releasing updates to the <a href=\"https://www.claude.com/platform/api\">Claude Developer Platform</a>, <a href=\"https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code\">Claude Code</a>, and our <a href=\"https://www.claude.com/download\">consumer apps</a>. There are new tools for longer-running agents and new ways to use Claude in Excel, Chrome, and on desktop. In the Claude apps, lengthy conversations no longer hit a wall. See our product-focused section below for details.</p><p>As our Anthropic colleagues tested the model before release, we heard remarkably consistent feedback. Testers noted that Claude Opus 4.5 handles ambiguity and reasons about tradeoffs without hand-holding. They told us that, when pointed at a complex, multi-system bug, Opus 4.5 figures out the fix. They said that tasks that were near-impossible for Sonnet 4.5 just a few weeks ago are now within reach. Overall, our testers told us that Opus 4.5 just “gets it.”</p><p>Many of our customers with early access have had similar experiences. Here are some examples of what they told us:</p><h2>Evaluating Claude Opus 4.5</h2><p>We give prospective performance engineering candidates a notoriously difficult take-home exam. We also test new models on this exam as an internal benchmark. Within our prescribed 2-hour time limit, Claude Opus 4.5 scored higher than any human candidate ever.</p><p>The take-home test is designed to assess technical ability and judgment under time pressure. It doesn’t test for other crucial skills candidates may possess, like collaboration, communication, or the instincts that develop over years. But this result—where an AI model outperforms strong candidates on important technical skills—raises questions about how AI will change engineering as a profession. Our <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/research/team/societal-impacts\">Societal Impacts</a> and <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/economic-futures\">Economic Futures</a> research is aimed at understanding these kinds of changes across many fields. We plan to share more results soon.</p><p>Software engineering isn’t the only area on which Claude Opus 4.5 has improved. Capabilities are higher across the board—Opus 4.5 has better vision, reasoning, and mathematics skills than its predecessors, and it is state-of-the-art in many domains:</p><p>The model’s capabilities outpace some of the benchmarks we use in our tests. A common benchmark for agentic capabilities is <a href=\"https://github.com/sierra-research/tau2-bench\">τ2-bench</a>, which measures the performance of agents in real-world, multi-turn tasks. In one scenario, models have to act as an airline service agent helping a distressed customer. The benchmark expects models to refuse a modification to a basic economy booking since the airline doesn’t allow changes to that class of tickets. Instead, Opus 4.5 found an insightful (and legitimate) way to solve the problem: upgrade the cabin first,  modify the flights.</p><p>The benchmark technically scored this as a failure because Claude’s way of helping the customer was unanticipated. But this kind of creative problem solving is exactly what we’ve heard about from our testers and customers—it’s what makes Claude Opus 4.5 feel like a meaningful step forward.</p><p>In other contexts, finding clever paths around intended constraints could count as —where models “game” rules or objectives in unintended ways. Preventing such misalignment is one of the objectives of our safety testing, discussed in the next section.</p><p>As we state in our <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/claude-opus-4-5-system-card\">system card</a>, Claude Opus 4.5 is the most robustly aligned model we have released to date and, we suspect, the best-aligned frontier model by any developer. It continues our trend towards safer and more secure models:</p><p>Our customers often use Claude for critical tasks. They want to be assured that, in the face of malicious attacks by hackers and cybercriminals, Claude has the training and the “street smarts” to avoid trouble. With Opus 4.5, we’ve made substantial progress in robustness against prompt injection attacks, which smuggle in deceptive instructions to fool the model into harmful behavior. Opus 4.5 is harder to trick with prompt injection than any other frontier model in the industry:</p><p>You can find a detailed description of all our capability and safety evaluations in the <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/claude-opus-4-5-system-card\">Claude Opus 4.5 system card</a>.</p><h2><strong>New on the Claude Developer Platform</strong></h2><p>As models get smarter, they can solve problems in fewer steps: less backtracking, less redundant exploration, less verbose reasoning. Claude Opus 4.5 uses dramatically fewer tokens than its predecessors to reach similar or better outcomes.</p><p>But different tasks call for different tradeoffs. Sometimes developers want a model to keep thinking about a problem; sometimes they want something more nimble. With our new effort parameter on the Claude API, you can decide to minimize time and spend or maximize capability.</p><p>Set to a medium effort level, Opus 4.5 matches Sonnet 4.5’s best score on SWE-bench Verified, but uses 76% fewer output tokens. At its highest effort level, Opus 4.5 exceeds Sonnet 4.5 performance by 4.3 percentage points—while using 48% fewer tokens.</p><p>With <a href=\"https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort\">effort control</a>, <a href=\"https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-editing#client-side-compaction-sdk\">context compaction</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/advanced-tool-use\">advanced tool use</a>, Claude Opus 4.5 runs longer, does more, and requires less intervention.</p><p>Our <a href=\"https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-editing\">context management</a> and <a href=\"https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-editing#using-with-the-memory-tool\">memory capabilities</a> can dramatically boost performance on agentic tasks. Opus 4.5 is also very effective at managing a team of subagents, enabling the construction of complex, well-coordinated multi-agent systems. In our testing, the combination of all these techniques boosted Opus 4.5’s performance on a deep research evaluation by almost 15 percentage points.</p><p>We’re making our Developer Platform more composable over time. We want to give you the building blocks to construct exactly what you need, with full control over efficiency, tool use, and context management.</p><p>Products like Claude Code show what’s possible when the kinds of upgrades we’ve made to the Claude Developer Platform come together. Claude Code gains two upgrades with Opus 4.5. Plan Mode now builds more precise plans and executes more thoroughly—Claude asks clarifying questions upfront, then builds a user-editable plan.md file before executing.</p><p>Claude Code is also now <a href=\"https://claude.ai/redirect/website.v1.bcd1298e-326f-4965-891e-6a83e9eec7ca/download\">available in our desktop app</a>, letting you run multiple local and remote sessions in parallel: perhaps one agent fixes bugs, another researches GitHub, and a third updates docs.</p><p>For <a href=\"https://www.claude.com/product/overview\">Claude app</a> users, long conversations no longer hit a wall—Claude automatically summarizes earlier context as needed, so you can keep the chat going. <a href=\"https://claude.ai/redirect/website.v1.bcd1298e-326f-4965-891e-6a83e9eec7ca/chrome\">Claude for Chrome</a>, which lets Claude handle tasks across your browser tabs, is now available to all Max users. We announced <a href=\"https://www.claude.com/claude-for-excel\">Claude for Excel</a> in October, and as of today we've expanded beta access to all Max, Team, and Enterprise users. Each of these updates takes advantage of Claude Opus 4.5’s market-leading performance in using computers, spreadsheets, and handling long-running tasks.</p><p>For Claude and Claude Code users with access to Opus 4.5, we’ve removed Opus-specific caps. For Max and Team Premium users, we’ve increased overall usage limits, meaning you’ll have roughly the same number of Opus tokens as you previously had with Sonnet. We’re updating usage limits to make sure you’re able to use Opus 4.5 for daily work. These limits are specific to Opus 4.5. As future models surpass it, we expect to update limits as needed.</p>",

One of the main questions people have is ‘how do I know that my new Pebble watch will continue to work long into the future?’. It’s an extremely valid question and concern - one that I share as a fellow Pebble wearer. I called this out specifically <a href=\"https://ericmigi.com/blog/why-were-bringing-pebble-back#were-bringing-pebble\">in my blog post</a> announcing the relaunch in January 2025. How is this time round going to be different from last time?</p><p>There are two pieces to making Pebble sustainable long term - hardware and software.</p><p>Nothing lasts forever, especially an inexpensive gadget like a Pebble. We want to be able to keep manufacturing these watches long into the future - mostly because I will always want one on my wrist! The company I set up to relaunch Pebble, Core Devices, is self funded, built without investors, and extremely lean. As long as we stay profitable (ie we don’t lose money), we will continue to manufacture new watches. </p><p>We’re also making sure that our new watches are more repairable than old Pebble watches. The back cover of Pebble Time 2 is screwed in. You can remove the back cover and replace the battery.  </p><p>We’ve also published <a href=\"https://github.com/coredevices/hardware\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">electrical and mechanical design files</a> for Pebble 2 Duo. Yes, you can download the schematic (includes KiCad project files) right now on <a href=\"https://github.com/coredevices/hardware\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Github</a>! This should give you a nice jumpstart to designing your own PebbleOS-compatible device.</p><p>Last time round, barely any of the Pebble software was open source. This made it very hard for the Pebble community to make improvements to their watches after the company behind Pebble shut down. Things are different now! This whole relaunch came about primarily because Google open sourced PebbleOS (thank you!). Yesterday, the software that powers Pebble watches was around 95% open source. As of today, it’s now 100%. This means that if Core Devices were to disappear into a black hole, you have all the source code you need to build, run and improve the software behind your Pebble.</p><p>I confess that I misunderstood why 95% was much less sustainable than 100% until recently. I discuss this in more detail in my latest Tick Talk episode (check it out). Long story short - I’m an Android user and was happy to sideload the old Pebble APK on my phone, but iPhone and other Android users have basically been stuck without an easily available Pebble mobile companion app for years.    </p><p>Here’s how we’re making sure the 3 main Pebble software components are open source and guaranteed to work long into the future:</p><p> - software that runs on your watch itself. This has been 100% open source since January and we’ve committed to open sourcing all the improvements we’ve made → <a href=\"https://github.com/coredevices/pebbleos\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">github.com/coredevices/PebbleOS</a>. You can download the source code, <a href=\"https://pebbleos-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">compile PebbleOS</a> and easily install it over Bluetooth on your new Pebble. Textbook definition of open source! </p><p><strong>Pebble mobile companion app</strong> -  the app that for your iPhone or Android. Without the app, your Pebble is basically a paperweight. When the Pebble Tech Corp died, the lack of an open source mobile app made it difficult for anyone to continue to use their watches. We had to build an entirely new app (<a href=\"https://repebble.com/app\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">get it here</a>). Today, our app is now <a href=\"https://github.com/coredevices/mobileapp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">100% open source on Github</a><a href=\"https://github.com/coredevices/pebbleapp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a>- ensuring that what happened before  happen again. Want to learn more about how we built the new app cross platform using Kotlin Multiplatform? Watch Steve’s <a href=\"https://youtu.be/UOQMDkCsCSw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">presentation at Droidcon</a>.</p><p><strong>Developer tools and Pebble Appstore</strong> - this software enables people to build and share their watchapps and watchfaces. </p><p>Then there’s the Pebble Appstore. This is a collection of nearly 15,000 watchfaces and watchapps that you - the Pebble community - developed between 2012 and July 2018. When Fitbit pulled the plug on the original Pebble Appstore, the Rebble Foundation downloaded a copy of all the apps and faces, and set up a new web service to let users of the old Pebble app continue to download and use watchfaces. This was an incredible effort, one that I have used thousands of times and am a happy paying subscriber. But it’s still centralized - if their server disappears, there is no freely available backup. </p><p>To compensate for that, today we’re launching two new things:</p><ul><li>The Pebble mobile app will soon (later this week) be able to subscribe to multiple appstore ‘feeds’. This is similar to open source package managers like pip, AUR, APT, etc. Anyone can create a Pebble-compatible appstore feed and users will be able to browse apps from that feed in the Pebble mobile app.</li><li>We’ve created our own Pebble Appstore feed (<a href=\"https://appstore-api.repebble.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">appstore-api.repebble.com</a>) and new <a href=\"https://appstore-api.repebble.com/dashboard\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Developer Dashboard</a>. Our feed (fyi powered by 100% new software) is configured to back up an archive of all apps and faces to <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/pebble-appstore-archive\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Archive.org</a> (backup will gradually complete over the next week). Today, our feed only has a subset of all Pebble watchfaces and apps (thank you aveao for creating <a href=\"https://github.com/aveao/pebblearchive/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pebble Archive</a>!). Developers - you can <a href=\"https://appstore-api.repebble.com/dashboard\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">upload</a> your existing or new apps right now! We hope that this sets a standard for openness and we encourage all feeds to publish a freely and publicly available archive.</li></ul><p>Important to note - developers will still be able to charge money for their apps and faces, using Kiezel pay or other services. This change does not preclude them from doing that, in fact it makes it even easier - I could see some developers creating a paid-only feed. As I <a href=\"https://ericmigi.com/blog/how-to-build-a-smartwatch-software-setting-expectations-and-roadmap#appstore-and-cloud-s\">recently wrote</a>, we're also working on other ways for Pebble developers to earn money by publishing fun, beautiful and creative Pebble apps.</p><p>Another important note - some binary blobs and other non-free software components are used today in PebbleOS and the Pebble mobile app (ex: the heart rate sensor on PT2 , Memfault library, and others). Optional non-free web services, like Wispr-flow API speech recognizer, are also used. These non-free software components are not required - you can compile and run Pebble watch software without them. This will always be the case. More non-free software components may appear in our software in the future. The core Pebble watch software stack (everything you need to use your Pebble watch) will always be open source. </p><p>Pre-production Pebble Time 2. These watches are not final quality! We are still tweaking and tuning everything.</p><p>We’re currently in the middle of Pebble Time 2 design verification test (DVT) phase. After we finish that, we go into production verification test (PVT) and then mass production (MP). So far, things are proceeding according to the schedule update I shared <a href=\"https://ericmigi.com/blog/re-introducing-the-pebble-appstore#production-updates\">last month</a> but that is extraordinarily subject to change. We still have a lot of testing (especially waterproof and environmental) to go. If we find problems (which is likely) we will push the schedule back to make improvements to the product. </p><p>The one major complicating factor is the timing of Chinese New Year (CNY). It’s early next year - factories will shut down for 3 weeks starting around the end of January. After restarting, things always take a week or two to get back to full speed. </p><p>We are trying our best to get into mass production and ship out at most several thousand Pebble Time 2s before CNY. It’s going to be very tight 🤞. More likely is that production will begin after CNY, then we need to transfer the watches to our fulfillment center, and ship them out. Realistically, at this time we’re forecasting that the majority of people will receive their PT2 in March and April. Please keep in mind that things may still change.</p><p>There will be 4 colour options for PT2 - black/black, black/red, silver/blue, silver/(white most likely). Let me be crystal very clear - no one has picked a colour yet 😃. In a few weeks, I will send out an email asking everyone who pre-ordered a Pebble Time 2 to select which colour they would like to receive. <strong>Please do not email us asking when this email will be sent out. No one has been invited yet to do this. I will post here after all emails have gone out.</strong></p><p>On a related note, I am extremely happy that we built and shipped Pebble 2 Duo. Not only is it an awesome watch, it was also a phenomenal way for us to exercise our production muscles and ease back into the systematic flow of building and shipping smartwatches. </p><p>A video is worth a million words - so I encourage you to watch me demo Pebble Time 2 watches I just received this week. Keep in mind these watches are PRE-PRODUCTION which means they parts have imperfect qualities! Subject to change! </p>",

      "content": "<div><p>The Android operating system is incredibly versatile. Beyond <a href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/best-android-phone-3563254/\">smartphones</a>, it officially powers tablets, watches, TVs, cars, and XR headsets. However, it has virtually no presence on traditional PCs, where Google instead relies on <a href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/what-is-chrome-os-1137371/\">ChromeOS</a>. Despite Google’s efforts to challenge the dominance of Windows and macOS, ChromeOS remains a distant third. To close this gap, the company is unifying ChromeOS and Android into a single desktop platform, codenamed ‘Aluminium OS.’ Here’s what we know so far.</p></div><div><h2>Android on PCs: The story so far</h2><p>One year ago,  exclusively revealed Google’s plan to <a href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/chrome-os-becoming-android-3500661/\">rally behind Android as its unified desktop OS</a>. Our source indicated that this shift aims to create products that better compete with the iPad while making more effective use of development resources. In July, a Google executive confirmed part of our reporting, revealing that the company intends to <a href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/google-combine-chrome-os-android-3577035/\">merge ChromeOS and Android</a> into a single platform. Finally, at Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Summit in September, Google officially announced it is <a href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/google-android-on-pc-qualcomm-snapdragon-summit-3600612/\">bringing Android to the PC market</a>. The company stated it is collaborating with Qualcomm to build a new platform that converges mobile and desktop computing, leveraging recent advancements in AI.</p></div><div><div><h3>What feature would you most want from Aluminium OS?</h3></div></div><div><p><em>Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon (left) and Google SVP of Devices and Services Rick Osterloh (right) announcing a joint project to bring Android to PCs.</em></p></div><div><p>While we now know Google is building Android for PCs, there are still many unknown details. Is Google retiring the ChromeOS brand? Will existing Chromebooks receive the new operating system, or will they be left behind? Will this OS arrive only on budget machines, or target premium PCs as well? What will the interface actually look like, and what new features can we expect?</p></div><div><p>These are the burning questions as Google continues developing the platform. We likely won’t have all the answers until we get closer to launch, but thanks to job listings and bug reports, we’ve uncovered early details that offer some clues.</p></div><div><h2>Aluminium OS: Google’s PC ambitions take shape</h2><p>Over the weekend, a tipster on Telegram named Frost Core shared a link to an intriguing Google job listing for a ‘<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/senior-product-manager-android-laptop-and-tablets-at-google-4302767236/\" target=\"_blank\">Senior Product Manager, Android, Laptop and Tablets</a>.’ While we already know Google is bringing Android to the PC, the listing explicitly states that the role involves ‘working on a new Aluminium, Android-based, operating system.’ This effectively confirms that Aluminium is the codename for the new unified platform. The name appears to be a nod to the project’s roots: like Chromium (the open-source version of ChromeOS), Aluminium is a metal ending in ‘-ium.’ The choice of the British spelling — emphasizing the ‘Al’ prefix — likely pays homage to Android serving as the project’s foundation.”</p></div><div><p>Much like <a href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/android-xr-3507061/\">Android XR</a>, Google says its new Aluminium OS is ‘built with artificial intelligence (AI) at the core.’ This implies deep integration with <a href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/gemini-models-explained-3547148/\">Gemini</a>, Google’s AI chatbot and large language model (LLM). At the Snapdragon Summit, Rick Osterloh, Google’s SVP of Devices and Services, outlined the company’s plans to bring its AI stack to PCs:</p><blockquote><div>“This is another way we can leverage all of the great work we’re doing together on our AI stack, our full stack, bringing Gemini models, bringing the assistant, bringing all of our applications and developer community into the PC domain. And I think this is another way in which Android is gonna be able to serve everyone in every computing category.”</div></blockquote></div><div><p>We have yet to see exactly what new features Gemini will enable on Android PCs, but we hope the OS will fully leverage the hardware’s potential. On select premium smartphones, Gemini already powers an array of on-device AI features that demand significant memory and processing power from the CPU, GPU, and NPU. There were concerns that Google might restrict this new OS to the same budget-friendly niche where Chromebooks currently excel, ceding the high-end market to Microsoft and Apple. However, the job listing dispels those fears.</p></div><div><p>The new Senior Product Manager role is tasked with “driving the roadmap and curating a portfolio of ChromeOS and Aluminium Operating System (ALOS) Commercial devices across all form factors (e.g. laptops, detachables, tablets, and boxes) and tiers (e.g., Chromebook, Chromebook Plus, AL Entry, AL Mass Premium, and AL Premium) that meets the needs of users and the business.”</p></div><div><p>This confirms that Android won’t be limited to laptops; the roadmap explicitly includes detachables, tablets, and ‘boxes’ (likely mini-PCs akin to the Chromebox or Mac Mini). Furthermore, the tiered structure — listing ‘AL Mass Premium’ and ‘AL Premium’ alongside ‘AL Entry’ — indicates that Google intends to push Android beyond budget PC hardware. While exact pricing for these tiers is hard to predict, it is clear Google aims to compete across the entire spectrum — a strategy foreshadowed by the recent Chromebook Plus initiative.</p></div><div><p>Speaking of Chromebooks, the job listing also raises questions about the future of ChromeOS. The listing notes that the person will help “drive ChromeOS and Aluminium (e.g., Android) platforms and devices,” creating a roadmap and product portfolio that encompasses both. This implies the two platforms will coexist for some time. However, the person is also explicitly tasked with developing a strategy for transitioning “Google from ChromeOS to Aluminium with business continuity in the future.” This confirms that Google aims to eventually replace ChromeOS entirely — a move that must be managed carefully to avoid disrupting enterprise customers. This transition will likely require a multi-pronged approach:</p><ul><li> Existing ChromeOS devices that cannot be migrated to Aluminium OS will likely receive updates until they reach their end-of-life. This means Google will need to maintain the legacy ChromiumOS codebase for several more years.</li><li> Rather than forcing an immediate switch, Google may offer an optional upgrade path for capable hardware. The company is currently testing Aluminium OS on development boards featuring MediaTek Kompanio 520 and 12th Gen Intel Alder Lake processors, so existing Chromebooks with these chips could be eligible for the update. However, migrating an operating system on live hardware is a massive technical hurdle that will require meticulous execution.</li></ul></div><div><p>And of course, there will be new PCs launching with Aluminium OS out of the box as well.</p></div><div><h2>Is ChromeOS dead as we know it?</h2><p>Even if Google replaces the entire foundation of ChromeOS with Android, the company may be reluctant to abandon the name. While it lacks the market share of Windows or macOS, the ChromeOS brand is widely recognized, particularly in the education and enterprise sectors. Although the job listing doesn’t confirm the final naming scheme, bug reports spotted by Frost Core hint that Google may retain the branding. Engineers have referred to the current platform as “ChromeOS Classic” and “non-Aluminium ChromeOS,” implying the new Android-based version could simply usurp the name “ChromeOS.”</p></div><div><div><h3>Would you miss Chrome OS if Google sunsets it for 'Aluminium OS'?</h3></div></div><div><p>Alternatively, Google might adopt “Android Desktop” as the name to align with its renewed focus on promoting Android as a brand. However, “Android Desktop” could merely be an internal designation for the form factor. Since these references have only appeared in bug reports, the final marketing name remains an open question.</p></div><div><h2>When will Android on PCs launch?</h2><p>Google is actively developing the platform, with bug reports confirming that the company is testing fresh builds of <a href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/android-16-features-3484159/\">Android 16</a> on development hardware. The company has confirmed the project will launch in 2026, though it remains unclear whether it will arrive in the first or second half of the year. Given this timeline, it is highly likely that the initial public release will be built upon <a href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/android-17-3561251/\">Android 17</a>, which is due next year. We will continue to monitor the project to find further details ahead of its official debut.</p></div><div data-container-type=\"content\"><div><p>Thank you for being part of our community.

      "content": "<p>Three years ago, “using an LLM” meant pasting a wall of text into a chat box and hoping for something useful back. Today, we point agents at our codebases, our browsers, and let them go off and act on our behalf. A key question that has been brewing under the surface during this time has been: <strong>how do we let end users actually customize these systems</strong>?</p><p>As models have become more capable, the ways and mechanisms that end users have access to customize them have expanded as well. We've gone from simple system prompts to complex client-server protocols and back again.</p><p>I wanted to take a moment to reflect on the history of LLM extension over the last three years and where I see it going in the future.</p><p>Just four months after launch, OpenAI announced . Looking back, these were wildly ahead of their time.</p><p>The idea was ambitious: give the LLM a link to an OpenAPI spec and let it \"run wild\" calling REST endpoints. It was a direct line to AGI-style thinking: universal tool use via standard APIs.</p><pre><code></code></pre><p>The problem? <strong>The models weren't ready.</strong> GPT-3.5 (and even early GPT-4) struggled to navigate massive API specs without hallucinating or getting lost in context. Plus, the UX was clunky. You had to manually toggle plugins for every chat!</p><p>Here's what that looked like:</p><p>But it gave us a glimpse of the future:  plugin (later Advanced Data Analysis) became indispensable, foreshadowing the powerful sandboxed execution environments we use today.</p><p>Custom instructions were the \"smooth brain\" counter-reaction to the complexity of plugins. I did a double take when writing this because I thought for sure this feature was released before plugins.</p><p>It was just a user-defined prompt appended to every chat. Simple. Obvious. Yet it solved a huge problem: repetitive context setting.</p><p>This was the spiritual ancestor to every  and  file that followed.</p><p>OpenAI repackaged instructions and tools into . This was an attempt to \"productize\" prompt engineering. You could bundle a persona, some files, and a few actions into a shareable link.</p><p>It was a retreat from the open-ended promise of plugins toward curated, single-purpose \"apps.\"</p><p>So far, we've discussed manual ways to extend LLMs.  represented a shift toward automatic personalization.</p><p>ChatGPT Memory records details from your conversations and quietly inserts them into future context. It's like a system prompt that writes itself. If you mention you're a vegetarian, it remembers that weeks later. It’s a small feature, but it marked the beginning of agents that maintain long-term state without user intervention.</p><p> changed the game by putting custom instructions where they belonged: .</p><p>The  file was a revelation. Instead of pasting context into a chat window, you committed it to git.</p><ul><li>\"We use tabs, not spaces.\"</li></ul><p>It started as a single file, then evolved into a  folder with sophisticated scoping. You could organize multiple rule files, and even define when they applied, for example, only for certain file types or subdirectories. It was the first time extension felt \"native\" to the code.</p><p>Later Cursor introduced the ability to let the LLM decide when to apply a rule, which is a pattern we will see again.</p><p>By late 2024, models were finally smart enough to handle real tools reliably. Anthropic's <strong>Model Context Protocol (MCP)</strong> was the answer.</p><p>MCP is a heavyweight solution. An MCP client needs to keep a persistent connection to an MCP server. The server serves up tool definitions, resources, and prompts to the client (in most cases is an agent) and it can send a message to the server saying a tool has been called and the server can respond with the result.</p><p>Unlike Custom Instructions (which just add context), <strong>MCP gives the model actual capabilities</strong>. It can read your repo, query your Postgres DB, or deploy to Vercel. Besides just providing tools, it also allows servers to provide  (documents, logs) and  directly to the agent.</p><p>It's powerful, and perhaps a bit of overkill. While the complexity might be worth it for agent developers asking a user to set up and connect an MCP is a lot of friction and there is an entire ecosystem of startups like <a href=\"https://smithery.ai/\">Smithery</a> built around making it easier to use MCP.</p><p>It is worth noting that ChatGPT apps which were announced in <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-apps-in-chatgpt/\">October 2025</a> are built on top of MCP as a base layer. This is an attempt to make it easier for end users to use MCP without having to actually think about it.</p><h2>Claude Code: New Agent, New Extensions (Feb 2025)</h2><p>Early 2025 brought us , which essentially added every extension mechanism under the sun to an agent.</p><ul><li> The standard for repo-level instructions.</li><li> For heavy-duty tool integration.</li><li> Like Cursor's notebooks, for reusable prompts.</li><li> The ability to intercept and modify the agent's loop (e.g., \"Stop if the tests fail\").</li><li> Spawning specialized workers to handle sub-tasks.</li><li> (Deprecated) Configuring tone and format.</li></ul><p>Time will tell how many of these features will stick around in the long term. Anthropic has already tried to <a href=\"https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#2030\">deprecate output styles</a>.</p><p>The next extension mechanism added to Claude Code is significant enough to warrant a deeper dive.  are the rebirth of ChatGPT Plugins.</p><p>While MCP has a whole client-server protocol, Agent Skills are just folders of markdown files and scripts (in whatever language you choose).</p><p>The agent simply scans a  directory, reads the frontmatter of every , and builds a lightweight index. It then chooses to read the full contents of a skill only if it's appropriate for the current task. This solves one of the major problems with MCP: the context bloat that comes from having to load all of the tool definitions into the context window at once.</p><p>Here is a snippet of the structure of a skill for doing e2e testing with Playwright taken from Anthropic's <a href=\"https://github.com/anthropics/skills/blob/main/webapp-testing/SKILL.md\">Skills examples</a> repository:</p><pre><code></code></pre><p>There is a mix of scripts, examples, and plain text instructions. The only required file is the SKILL.md file. Let's take a look at that file:</p><pre><code></code></pre><p>This is just a plain markdown file with some metadata and a description of the skill. The agent reads the file which freely references other files that the agent can read. In contrast a playwright MCP server has dozens of tool definitions to control a browser, this skill just says \"you have bash, this is how you write a playwright script\".</p><p>Granted to use a skill the agent needs to have general purpose access to a computer, but this is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitter_lesson\">bitter lesson</a> in action. Giving an agent general purpose tools and trusting it to have the ability to use them to accomplish a task might very well be the winning strategy over making specialized tools for every task.</p><p>Skills are the actualization of the dream that was set out by ChatGPT Plugins: just give the model instructions and some generic tools and trust it to do the glue work in-between. But I have a hypothesis that it might actually work now because the <strong>models are actually smart enough for it to work.</strong></p><p>Agent skills work because it assumes the agent has the ability to write its own tools (via bash commands). You can just give it code snippets and ask the agent to figure out how to run them generically for the task at hand.</p><p>Importantly, I think that skills signal towards a new definition of what an agent really is. An agent isn't just a LLM in a while loop. It's an LLM in a while loop that has a computer strapped to it.</p><p>Claude Code is the piece of software that first made this click for me, but it is way too developer focused to be the final form. Other applications like <a href=\"https://www.zo.computer/\">Zo Computer</a> try to package the llm and computer together into a single application, but I still think it still doesn't abstract the computer away enough from the end user. If I ask a coworker to do something, I don't need to see their entire file system, I just need to know that they have a computer.</p><p>Looking forward into 2026 I expect more and more llm applications that we use will have a computer strapped to them in new and interesting ways, whether we know it or not.</p><p>If I could short MCP, I would, and I expect us to go back to extending our agents with the most accessible programming language: natural language.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Good Evening from Taipei,</p><p>A power outage at an industrial gas facility servicing TSMC interrupted manufacturing at the company’s Fab 21 in Arizona late last quarter, sources told me. The incident stopped the flow of crucial inputs needed for chipmaking, forcing the facility to shut down for at least a few hours, I was told. As a result, the company had to scrap thousands of wafers that were in production for clients at the site which include Apple, Nvidia, and AMD.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.linde.com/news-and-media/2021/linde-signs-long-term-agreement-to-supply-new-world-class-semiconductor-manufacturing-complex-in-the-u-s\" rel=\"\">outsourced vendor Linde</a><a href=\"http://www.culpium.com\" rel=\"\"></a></p><p><a href=\"https://wccftech.com/tsmc-arizona-facility-hit-hard-by-profit-drop-as-rising-operating-costs-give-a-reality-check/\" rel=\"\">assumption that</a></p><p>Unfortunately, the company declined to immediately address the issue of the manufacturing disruption. </p><p>Fab shutdowns are unusual, at least for TSMC. With equipment so expensive, its factories are run 24/7. That means that an hour of idle time can cost millions of dollars. Compounding the financial effect of this incident was the fact that it occurred late in the quarter, leaving little room to make up for lost production before the quarter closed. </p><p>Profit margins on new facilities and at new nodes tend to be quite thin, even negative. In addition, TSMC has been ramping up capacity in Arizona and that capex gets reflected in depreciation costs even before the new equipment can start producing revenue. So it’s reasonable to see fluctuations in net income at the site. A halt in production and scrapping of wafers adds to the costs, dragging on earnings even if only slightly and briefly.</p><p>Impact to clients is likely to be negligible, I was told, and the financial loss to TSMC may be covered by insurance. Capacity at Fab 21 is still quite small, and many products being made there have already been taped out and manufactured in Taiwan previously. In past disruptions, lost production and revenue was made up in the subsequent quarter. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/08/business/tsmc-phoenix-arizona-semiconductor.html\" rel=\"\">an exercise in cross-cultural adaptation</a></p><p>The most common cause of production interruptions at TSMC is Mother Nature. Earthquakes regularly rattle Taiwan, and fabs are built to withstand most of them. But sometimes a big tremor can trigger a safety shutdown, while really nasty temblors have caused actual damage. Beyond natural disasters, there’ve been few man-made shutdowns at TSMC because they’re pretty rigorous about operations. </p><p><a href=\"https://pr.tsmc.com/english/news/1969\" rel=\"\">a computer virus was introduced</a><a href=\"https://pr.tsmc.com/english/news/1984\" rel=\"\">a batch of contaminated photoresist</a></p><div data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.culpium.com/p/tsmc-arizona-outage-saw-fab-halt?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;}\" data-component-name=\"CaptionedButtonToDOM\"><div><p>Sharing is caring.

      "content": "<p>It's another Monday morning, sitting down at the computer. And I see a stack of alerts from the last hour of packages showing signs of malware in our triage queue. Having not yet finished my first cup of coffee, I see Shai Hulud indicators. Yikes, surely that's a false positive? Nope, welcome to Monday, Shai Hulud struck again. Strap in.</p><h2>Timeline of the Shai-Hulud Campaign</h2><p>The timing is notable, given npm’s recent announcement that it will revoke classic tokens on December 9 after the wave of supply-chain attacks. With many users still not migrated to trusted publishing, the attacker seized the moment for one more hit before npm’s deadline.</p><ul role=\"list\"><li>August 27 - We release our report detailing the <a href=\"https://www.aikido.dev/blog/popular-nx-packages-compromised-on-npm\">S1ngularity campaign</a> targeting several nx packages on npm. &nbsp;</li><li>September 18 - We publish a <a href=\"https://www.aikido.dev/blog/bugs-in-shai-hulud-debugging-the-desert\">follow-up analysis</a>, diving deeper into the campaign’s technical quirks and early payload behavior. &nbsp;</li><li>November 24 - A second strike occurs, dubbed the “Second Coming” by the attackers, timed just before npm’s deadline for revoking old tokens.</li></ul><h2>What is Shai-Hulud?: A Quick Refresher </h2><p>Shai-Hulud, named after the gigantic sandworms from Dune as part of the attacker's flair for theatrics, is a self-replicating npm worm built to spread quickly through compromised developer environments. Once it infects a system, it searches for exposed secrets such as API keys and tokens using TruffleHog and publishes anything it finds to a <a href=\"https://github.com/search?q=Sha1-Hulud%3A+The+Second+Coming.&amp;ref=opensearch&amp;type=repositories\">public GitHub repository</a>. It then attempts to push new copies of itself to npm, helping it propagate across the ecosystem, while exfiltrating data back to the attacker. Keeping with the dramatic theme, the attacker refers to this latest wave as the “Second Coming.”</p><h2>Differences from last time</h2><p>This time around, there are some significant differences in the attack:</p><ul role=\"list\"><li>It install bun with the file  and then uses that to execute  &nbsp;which is the actual malicious code.</li><li>It creates a randomly named repository with stolen data, rather than a hardcoded name.</li><li>It will infect up to 100 npm packages, compared to 20 last time.</li><li>If it can't authenticate with GitHub or NPM, it will wipe all files in the users Home directory.</li></ul><p>This time, the malware also publishes secrets to GitHub, with a random name and the repository description:</p><p>\"Sha1-Hulud: The Second Coming.\"</p><p>Currently we see 26.3k repositories exposed:</p><p>As we've been analzying all these packages, we've noticed a number of compromised packages that appear to be from community spread, which contain the initial staging code in , but NOT&nbsp; which is the Shai&nbsp;Hulud worm itself. Here's the code that spreads the worm into other packages:</p><pre contenteditable=\"false\"><code>      }\n    }\n  }</code></pre><p>We see that the  may sometimes not be bundled, depending on different factors. It appears that mistakes were once again made by the attackers. This appears to have limited the imapct of the attack at this time. </p><h2>Compromised GitHub repositories</h2><p>The AsyncAPI&nbsp;team detected that there had been a branch of their CLI&nbsp;project, which was created just prior to the malicious packages being pushed, which deployed a version of the Shai&nbsp;Hulud malware. </p><h2>Companies acknowlege incident</h2><p>Given the nature of the incident, we were very happy to see companies quickly acknowledge what happened, in posts from these companies:</p><p>We detected the first packages starting at 11/24/2025 3:16:26 AM GMT+0, which were the packages go-template, and 36 packages from . Many more packages were quickly compromised. Afterwards, they started compromising PostHog packages at 11/24/2025 &nbsp;4:11:55 AM GMT+0, and Postman packages at 11/24/2025 &nbsp;5:09:25 AM&nbsp;GMT+0.‍</p><h2>Which packages are affected?</h2><p>We've detected the following packages compromised with a new version of Shai Hulud.

impact of Shai-Hulud: Second Coming</h2><p>Threat actors have slipped malicious code into hundreds of NPM packages — including major ones from <strong>Zapier, ENS, AsyncAPI, PostHog, Browserbase, and Postman</strong>. If a developer installs one of these bad packages, the malware quietly runs , before anything even finishes installing. This gives it access to the developer’s machine, build systems, or cloud environment. It then uses an automated tool (TruffleHog) to search for sensitive information like passwords, API keys, cloud tokens, and GitHub or NPM credentials. Anything it finds is uploaded to a public GitHub repository labeled <strong>“Sha1-Hulud: The Second Coming.”</strong> If those stolen secrets include access to code repositories or package registries, attackers can use them to break into more accounts and publish more malicious packages, helping the attack spread further. Because trusted ecosystems were involved and millions of downloads are affected, any team using NPM should immediately check whether they were impacted and rotate any credentials that may have leaked.</p><h2>‍Which actions should security teams take?</h2><ul role=\"list\"><li>Audit all Zapier/ENS-related npm dependencies and versions.</li><li>Rotate  GitHub, npm, cloud, and CI/CD secrets used during installs.</li><li>Check GitHub for strange repos with the description&nbsp; “Sha1-Hulud: The Second Coming”</li><li>Disable npm  scripts in CI where possible.</li><li>Pin package versions and enforce MFA on GitHub and npm accounts.</li><li>Use tools like <a href=\"https://www.aikido.dev/safe-chain\">Safe-Chain</a> to block malicious packages on NPM </li></ul><p>‍Story developing...

notes to that device instead.</p><p>\nTraditionally, a midi device had been considered to be hardware.&nbsp; But now, with the advent of powerful computer hardware, software can now act as virtual hardware, allowing for advanced features to be included on your computer without the need for hardware upgrades or physical adjustment.</p><p>\nA midi software driver can support a soundfont, which can greatly enhances the playback quality of a midi through it's support for large, high-quality, instrumental sound libraries.</p><p>\nTo change the playback device, select a number in the playback device control (bottom right).&nbsp; Up to ten devices (1-10) is supported.&nbsp; \"Map\" is the Windows Midi Mapper.&nbsp; Selecting a dash will cause playback to stop producing audible sound (no device selected for sound output).&nbsp; In this case, the last usable (numbered) midi device will be automatically selected after a short time delay, recommencing audible playback without the need for user input.</p><p>\nCynthia supports realtime device switching during playback.&nbsp; A small, momentary interruption to playback may occur during a device change.&nbsp; The name of the device in use by Cynthia is listed in the playback device control (bottom right), for example as \"Playback Device: Midi Mapper\".&nbsp; In later versions of Microsoft Windows the Midi Mapper was discontinued - in this case, Cynthia uses the first installed midi device. </p><p>\nIt is worth noting that using another device may require a separate adjustment to that device's volume control, some devices do,

The app's GUI components sit above this layer/merge into it, such as toolbars, tool images, buttons, text etc.&nbsp; There are 60 built-in background schemes, based on several images with different presets, like horizontal and vertical scroll speeds, fade in and out rates, and wobble levels.&nbsp; These functions allow for a static image to give movement to the app.&nbsp; While some background schemes are specially set for animation, others are not.<p>\nThe background image can be rendered in full color, or shade-shifted toward greyscale, or shade-shifted toward the app's current highlight color.&nbsp; One slider, Colorise, controls this tri-function.</p><p>\nA background scheme supports a maximum image color depth of 32 bits in RGBA format - 8 bit red, green, blue, and alpha channels - for instance a transparent PNG image.</p>:\nAn animated background scheme can operate at frame rates of up to 20 fps (frames per second), which means the entire GUI of the app is repainted in full, 20 times per second, like a video, and therefore can consume quite a bit of CPU power, especially at high resolutions.&nbsp; It is recommended a modern, powerful machine be used for high frame rates/resolutions in order to maintain smooth operation of the GUI.:\nDetermines how much of the background image is seen/made visible.&nbsp; A low value renders the background subtly beneath the GUI, whereas a high value, 100-255, renders it boldly.&nbsp; A value above 100 is disabled by default.&nbsp; To enable, click \"Options &gt; Settings\" and deselect \"Display &gt; Safe Background\".&nbsp; A value over 100 may overpower the GUI making it hard to navigate or operate.&nbsp; If this becomes the case, press the \"F2\" key, and then the Enter key to confirm restoration of the app's default settings.\nSet the color rendering method.&nbsp; A value of 100 renders the background image in full color, a value of 0 in greyscale, and a value of -100 in the app's current highlight color.\nPaint speed in frames per second.&nbsp; 0 is static - the background scheme only repaints when required.&nbsp; This is the least stressful option.&nbsp; A value of 1-20 sets a constant repaint cycle of 1-20 fps (frames per second).<p>\nHorizontal Scroll/Vertical Scroll (-100..100):</p>\nMoves background image left/up (minus value) or right/down (plus value) by X pixels.&nbsp; A value of zero turns movement off.<p>\nHorizontal Wobble/Vertical Wobble (0..300):</p>\nApplies a wobble factor to the above Horizontal Scroll/Vertical Scroll movement(s).\nCycles through a high-to-low-to-high intensity flow, gradually fading the background image from view, then back again, in a continuous cycle.&nbsp; Use a low value for a slow cycle, and a high value for a fast cycle.&nbsp; \nApplies a wobble factor to the Fade In/Out flow cycle above.<a href=\"https://www.blaizenterprises.com/cynthia.html#help\" title=\"Help Topics\">⏶</a>Yes you can.&nbsp; There are 10 custom background scheme slots.&nbsp; Click \"Options &gt; Background\" and scroll down to the section named \"Custom\".&nbsp; For instance, click on \"Custom 1\".&nbsp; A sub-toolbar will display in the right column at the top.&nbsp; From there, you can paste in an image from Clipboard - click \"Paste\", or open an image from file - click \"File\".<p>\nFor best visual results, your image should be a similar size to the app's overall area, and be prepped for tiling work - that is, have it's right and bottom edges modified so that its colors/pixels seamlessly wrap back round to its opposing edge (right-to-left and top-to-bottom).&nbsp; You can use a tile creation app, or a good quality graphics app to accomplish this, or use our \"Blend It\" app to prep your image.</p><p>\nWithout this, tiling the image may present abrupt edges of unwanted opposing lines of horizontal/vertical colors, and be visually jarring in nature.</p><p>\nAdjust the sliders as required to accomplish animation and visual effects.&nbsp; All changes to the image and sliders are saved in realtime.</p><a href=\"https://www.blaizenterprises.com/cynthia.html#help\" title=\"Help Topics\">⏶</a>The frame on our apps have a long history reaching back to the late 1990s, where they first adorned our FastCards and PowerCards (still/animated electronic musical greeting cards).<p>\nIn the context of an app, they primarily serve as a large, easy-grip area for resizing the app's overall size, and a touch of decoration to boot.</p><p>\nA frame can be made wide or narrow as required.&nbsp; The modern app has a typical frame width of 7 px in a plain style, so as not to distract or occupy excessive screen real estate.</p><p>\nFurthermore, a frame may render with an optional, randomised sparkle effect, with a range of 0 (no sparkle) to 20 (heavy sparkle).</p><p>\nClick \"Options &gt; Frame\" to edit the app's current frame settings.&nbsp; A list of 50 built-in frames is available to choose from, ranging from Antique to Traditional 5.</p><p>\nToward the bottom of the window are two sliders to adjust the frame's Sparkle (strength) and Size (width in pixels).&nbsp; A frame can be sized from 0 px (no frame) up to a wide frame of 72 px.&nbsp; All changes update in realtime.</p><a href=\"https://www.blaizenterprises.com/cynthia.html#help\" title=\"Help Topics\">⏶</a>Click \"Options &gt; Font\" to display zoom and font specific settings.&nbsp; By default, the app is set to automatic zoom, which means it will scale up its text and images if the monitor it's displayed on is above 2K in resolution.Why scale text and images at all?&nbsp; What is special about 4K and 8K monitors?&nbsp; At first glance it may not be obvious the significant difference between standard 2K resolution, and the much higher 4K and 8K resolutions.<p>\nBut high resolution monitors, such as 4K and 8K displays have far more pixels (colored dots) per inch on screen than previous generations of monitors, that is, the screen size may be the same but more dots are packed into the same area.&nbsp; Consequently, an app without scaling abilities may appear small or even blurred on these monitors.&nbsp; That's because as new monitors and TVs gain ever greater resolutions, statically sized apps shrink in size/fail to compensate.&nbsp; This is why a modern app must be able to scale up to match the appropriate resolution.</p><p>\nHere is a comparison of common display resolutions:</p>\n2K = 1920w x 1080h =&nbsp; 2,073,600 pixels<p>\n4K = 3840w x 2160h =&nbsp; 8,294,400 pixels</p>\n8K = 7680w x 4320h = 33,177,600 pixels<p>\nA 4K (ultra high definition) monitor uses four times (4x) more pixels than it's 2K (full high definition) counterpart.&nbsp; A statically built app without scaling would shrink to 50% of it's size, making it difficult to use.&nbsp; An operating system may attempt to counter this by scaling it up using pixel stretching - very much like zooming up a photo - unfortunately this tends to blur the appearance of the app.</p><p>\nThe same app on an 8K monitor would suffer even greater shrinkage, rendering at only a quarter (25%) of it's original size, or scaling with significant blurring.</p><p>\nThis app has a built-in zoom mode, which multiples the width and height of its text and images by a factor of 2, 3, or 4, dependant on the resolution of the display.&nbsp; This does away for the need of the operating system to stretch/scale its pixels.</p><p>\nOn a 2K monitor there is no need to scale as this is the app's intended resolution.&nbsp; On a 4K monitor the app switches to a zoom factor of 200% (2x), upscaling text and images and the main window's dimension accordingly, and 400% (4x) on an 8K monitor.&nbsp; The end result is an app that appears appropriately sized over different monitor resolutions.</p><p>\nYou can override this automatic zoom function, and set your own zoom value of: 100%, 200%, 300%, or 400%, if desired.&nbsp; An option that may be useful on a custom display resolution, and/or multiple monitor display environment.</p>:\nSetting the zoom value to 300% or above on a 2K monitor may render the app so large as to make it unusable.&nbsp; If this occurs, you can press the \"F2\" key at anytime to restore the app's default settings.<a href=\"https://www.blaizenterprises.com/cynthia.html#help\" title=\"Help Topics\">⏶</a>The text size (font size) can be set between 6 and 24.&nbsp; Click \"Options &gt; Font\" and choose a size option.&nbsp; Any change updates the app text in realtime.<p>\nIn some instances, the app may display slightly larger or smaller text in special areas, however this text is directly scaled from the size set.</p><p>\nBy default the app uses a size of 10.</p>:\nNot all sizes are supported by all fonts.&nbsp; On Ubuntu for instance, a large font size for Arial can cause text to appear weird or slightly off.&nbsp; If this occurs, try reducing the font size a tad, or alternatively select another font (font name).<a href=\"https://www.blaizenterprises.com/cynthia.html#help\" title=\"Help Topics\">⏶</a>A font determines what sort of characters appear on the screen, and in what style.&nbsp; Click \"Options &gt; Font\" and choose a font name (font) from the list of options, from Arial to DejaVu Serif.&nbsp; Any change updates the app in realtime.<p>\nOlder fonts like \"System\" were simple formats constructed from small images or bitmaps, one per character, and did not scale up very well, partly because to save on memory, not all character sizes were stored inside the font.&nbsp; Today, modern fonts use mathematical vectoring to draw shapes and lines etc to construct characters on the screen, though the infrastructure and overhead required for such fonts can be complex and heavy on a computer system.&nbsp; But because these fonts employ mathematics to draw their characters, they do scale up well.</p><p>\nEleven common font name options are presented for best compatibility and visual appearance, taking into consideration operating systems as old as Window 95, through to modern-day Windows 11, and other systems such as Mac and Linux.</p><p>\nIn general, you want a font that is widely supported and guaranteed to render well on most computers.&nbsp; Bearing that in mind, Arial, is a good choice, as it is widely supported by operating systems going as far back as Windows 95, if not further.</p><p>\nIf a font name is selected but is not supported by the current computer, for example \"DejaVu Sans\" - not supported by Windows 95 - a close approximate/fallback font is used instead.</p><p>\nFor a specific/custom font, click the \"Custom\" option once to switch it on, and click it again to display a Font dialog.&nbsp; Choose the font name from the list of fonts and click the \"OK\" button when done.</p><p>\nIf the app becomes unreadable, or hard to read after choosing a new font name - it can happen with a bad font, a foreign language font, or a symbols only font like \"Wingdings\" - press the \"F2\" key to restore the app's default settings.</p><a href=\"https://www.blaizenterprises.com/cynthia.html#help\" title=\"Help Topics\">⏶</a>For maximum font compatibility, two completely separate methods have been employed to render text with antialiasing.<p>\nClick \"Options &gt; Font\" for font settings.</p><p>\n1. The first method, Font Feathering, is a simple feather designed specifically to outline each text character in realtime.&nbsp; This has the effect of gently softening the often harsh outline of text characters on LCD screens, which by their nature do not blur neighbouring pixels, as the older CRT (Cathode Ray Tubes) did.</p><p>\nThe feather is universally applied to both bitmap fonts (older image based fonts) and vectors fonts (newer mathematical fonts).&nbsp; In this way it allows for a quick and direct text feathering technique, that is easily adjusted to suit, without any need for any complicated or tricky multi-step setup configurations and/or processes.</p><p>\nAs a bonus, it works on older operating systems - e.g. Windows 95 - which back in the day had no need/support for it, as LCD monitors were not widely used.&nbsp; It also works on fonts that don't have any embedded feather information, or for smaller font sizes that at times can abruptly discontinue feather support.</p><p>\nThis method generates an even, edge-based blurring of the outermost pixels of the text characters.&nbsp; A high value - high or ultra - renders a strong/bold feather, and a low value reduces this to a more subtle display.</p><p>\nAny change updates in realtime.</p><p>\nOn a high quality computer monitor were all pixels are transmitted and displayed without any color loss, a \"Low\" value is typically sufficient to render text gently on the screen.&nbsp; But TVs, which tend to heavily compress their video streams for speed loose some color information and therefore may require a higher setting of \"Medium\" or \"High\" for similar results.</p><p>\n2. The second method, Font Specific Antialiasing, relies on the font itself to provide all feather based information.&nbsp; This is usually an 8 bit greyscale range of 0-255.&nbsp; The downside is, if the font has no feather support, or the operating system is old, e.g. Windows 95, then no antialiasing will appear.&nbsp; This method can sometimes be hit and miss.</p><p>\nFor instance, take the font Arial, it is universally supported, but surprisingly looses feather support at 12 pt or less, leaving only sharp text characters to be rendered on screen.</p><p>\nTo adjust the antialiasing strength, select an option from \"Dark\" (strong) to \"Light\" (subtle).</p><p>\nBy default, options 1 and 2 above are set to \"Low/Dark\", which provides the best fit for a wide variety of fonts and their behavior over a broad spectrum of old and new operating systems.</p><a href=\"https://www.blaizenterprises.com/cynthia.html#help\" title=\"Help Topics\">⏶</a>The app can be set to start up in various ways: normally, minimised, maximised or in fullscreen mode.&nbsp; To adjust, click \"Options &gt; Settings\" and set an option under \"Start Style\".\nStarts the app as a window, which is the default mode.\nStarts the app hidden from view as a button on your taskbar.\nStarts the app as a window, maximised to fill all the available work area on your desktop.\nStarts the app in fullscreen mode, blocking out everything else on your desktop.:\nIf the app has the \"Multi-Monitor\" option selected (next section down named \"Display\"), then modes \"Maximised\" and \"Fullscreen\" will render the app over the combined screen real estate of all monitors.<a href=\"https://www.blaizenterprises.com/cynthia.html#help\" title=\"Help Topics\">⏶</a>The app can create, maintain and remove links for you.<p>\nThere are three link types supported:</p>\n1. Start button\n3. Automatic Startup<p>\nClick \"Options &gt; Settings\" to adjust.</p><p>\n1. The first link type, Start button, creates and automatically maintains a link - also known as a shortcut - on your Start Menu called \"Cynthia by BlaizEnterprises.com\".&nbsp; As this link is created by and maintained by the app, you must unselect the option to remove the link from your Start Menu.</p><p>\n2. The Desktop link operates identically to the above, maintaining a link on your Desktop named \"Cynthia by BlaizEnterprises.com\".&nbsp; It also must be unselected to remove the link permanently from your Desktop.</p>:\nAs long as either options 1 or 2 above is selected, then the corresponding links are maintained and automatically re-created if need be by the app, even if they're manually deleted from outside the app.<p>\nBy default, neither option is selected.&nbsp; Optionally, you can create your own manual link/shortcut to the app using Windows with any name/label you wish.</p><p>\n3. The last option, Automatic Startup, creates a link to the app in the startup location of your computer, informing Windows to launch the app when your computer boots/starts up.&nbsp; Again, this link is automatically maintained, therefore unselect the option to remove it.</p>:\nIf any of the links above are selected and you plan to remove/delete the app from your computer, it is highly recommended you first unselect all the options above (1-3), then remove/delete the app.&nbsp; Otherwise, Windows can get a little weird and put the links back in some cases without any interaction from the app itself, even if the app is no longer present.&nbsp; This behaviour was observed with earlier versions of Windows 10.<a href=\"https://www.blaizenterprises.com/cynthia.html#help\" title=\"Help Topics\">⏶</a>The majority of the app's important system settings can be found in one location - click \"Options &gt; Settings\".<p>\nAn option is considered \"on/enabled/selected\" when lit, and \"off/disabled/unselected\" when unlit.</p>Round Corners:\nRender all visual controls, windows, and dialogs with round (curved) corners.\nAutomatically close an active dialog window when a click/tap strikes outside the window area - e.g. Save, Open, Font, Options dialogs.&nbsp; This can speed up typical workflows by skipping the need to specifically click the OK or Cancel buttons to close the dialog.&nbsp; For instance, click \"Options\" to display the options dialog, change a few settings and click/tap outside the window to close it and save changes.&nbsp; Also convenient to cancel a dialog displayed by mistake/change of mind, such as a Save dialog.\nRetains app window on screen at all times, and any sub windows or dialogs within the app.&nbsp; Any attempt to drag the app out-of-range triggers an automatic position correction - a passive system that continuously checks the window position and monitor size.&nbsp; Supports both single and multi-monitor modes.\nDisplays an informative/artistic splash screen on app startup.&nbsp; Unselect to disable.\nScrolls control-centric help across the top of the current window, dialog, or menu.&nbsp; Hover mouse cursor over / tap finger on a control for related help.\nHover mouse over / tap finger on a control to display help related information in a popup bubble\nComfortably enlarge controls and menus for touch access (finger taps)\nSome options work best with a double click / tap for confirmation.&nbsp; This option supports the traditional double click mode.&nbsp; For example, navigating a disk drive using a double click / tap to switch between folders.\nSet the app above all other apps and windows\nNormal app operation can use a lot of paint cycles and CPU power, especially if it's rendering graphics and effects continuously on the screen.&nbsp; Economy mode throttles back this usage during periods of extended idleness, e.g. when there is no direct app keyboard input, or indirect mouse cursor movement or finger taps.&nbsp; For more specific information refer to the topic \"Economy mode\".\nNot noticeable on today's powerful computers with their 32 bit monitors and video cards, it however can deliver a small performance improvement on older computers running 24 bit graphics\nShow the app's frame whilst maximised.&nbsp; The frame is always hidden whilst in fullscreen mode.\nAn optional static or animated background scheme can be set, which renders an image beneath the GUI.&nbsp; If this image is too bold / strong the GUI can be hard to view / use.&nbsp; By default this option limits the background strength to a safe maximum level of 100.&nbsp; Unselect this option to permit the full range of background strength (0-255).&nbsp; If the GUI becomes hard to use or unreadable, press the \"F2\" key at anytime to restore the app's default settings.\nPermit the app to span the full range of attached monitors when maximised or in fullscreen mode.&nbsp; By default the app spans the current monitor only.\nPosition the name of the app in the center of the app's window header\nAlign the content of all participating toolbars to the left, center, or to the right\nColor coordinate important system settings and options into color specific input panels for rapid visual identification\nUse high-contrast, color-adaptive, monochromatic tool images on the app's GUI\nRetain highlight areas and other important GUI zones whilst a background scheme is in use\nAdjust the brightness of the entire app, from 60 being the darkest right up to 130 being the brightest.&nbsp; Any change takes affect immediately.&nbsp; The default brightness is 100.\nRenders the app translucent upon loosing focus - e.g. when another app is in use.&nbsp; Available range is 30 almost invisible, through to 255 fully visible.&nbsp; Default value is 255.&nbsp; This feature requires support of a modern operating system and is therefore not supported by Windows 95/98 etc.\nThe speed by which to transition the app from a focused state to a non-focused state or vice-versa.&nbsp; Speed range is 1-10, where 1 is the slowest and 10 the fastest.\nRenders the app translucent upon gaining focus - e.g. when the user interacts with it.&nbsp; Available range is 50 almost invisible, through to 255 fully visible.&nbsp; Default value is 255.&nbsp; As above, this feature requires support of a modern operating system and is therefore not supported by Windows 95/98 etc.\nChange the default cursor to one of the built-in cursors, each of which scale from small to large, according to the current size set by the operating system.&nbsp; A range of static colors are available: Red, Orange, Pink, Yellow, Purple, Aqua, Blue, Green, Grey, Black, White, along with Default and Custom.<p>\nIn addition, two dynamically colored cursors are included: \"Adaptive - Hover\" and \"Adaptive - Title\".&nbsp; These special cursors acquire their color from the current color scheme.&nbsp; Any change to the color scheme is reflected in the color of the cursor.</p><p>\nThe custom cursor option supports both static cursors \".cur\" and animated cursor \".ani\" file formats.&nbsp; To use, select the \"Custom\" option.&nbsp; The cursor will update if previously customised.&nbsp; To change the cursor, click the option again and select a cursor from file using the Open dialog.</p>\nApplies a random texture to the app's frame.&nbsp; Select a value from 0 (off) to 20 (bold).\nAdjust the app's frame size (width in pixels) from 0 (none) to 72 (wide).&nbsp; The default frame size is typically 7.\nSet the width and/or height of the app's scrollbars.&nbsp; A value of 5 (thin/short) to 72 (wide/tall) is supported.\nWine is basically a large computer instruction conversion app, which allows an app designed for Microsoft Windows to execute its instructions \"run\" on another operating system, such as a Mac or Linux.&nbsp; Because Wine does not emulate / bridge any logic gaps and only translates an app's instructions, the underlying computer hardware must match that used by Microsoft Windows - namely Intel and AMD64.<p>\nA notable exception to this requirement is the modern-day Mac, e.g. Mac Mini, which runs an Intel emulator under the hood.&nbsp; This allows a Microsoft Windows app to run by the following sequence: App to Wine to Intel emulator to Apple hardware.&nbsp; Incredibly, this appears to be a very effective and rather efficient strategy, especially for our lightweight apps.</p><p>\nAlthough Wine's functionality is both wide and impressive, there is some functionality that falls short of Windows.&nbsp; The Wine Compatibility option compensates where possible for important shortcomings, such as volume handling, and allows the app to maintain functionality.</p><p>\nThe default option is automatic and detects the presence of Wine based on the existence of drive \"Z:\\\".&nbsp; For more information on Wine refer to their website </p><a title=\"Visit https://www.winehq.org\" href=\"https://www.winehq.org\" target=\"_blank\">www.winehq.org</a> .&nbsp; \nEasily reset the app's system settings, such as color, font size, zoom level etc to their defaults.&nbsp; Click the \"Restore Defaults...\" button at the bottom-right of the Options window or press the \"F2\" key at any time in the app to display the \"Restore Defaults\" confirmation prompt.&nbsp; Confirm your intention to reset and then click the \"Restore Defaults\" button.&nbsp; The app will reset to default values.<p>\nAn app typically has settings in addition to these which are not restored / reset.&nbsp; Instead, they should be adjusted via the app itself as required.</p><a href=\"https://www.blaizenterprises.com/cynthia.html#help\" title=\"Help Topics\">⏶</a>Click the app menu button <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAA4AAAAOCAYAAAAfSC3RAAAANElEQVR4AWL8z0AeYCJPGwPDiNLIyMDwH4RhgUWIT3bgMMKtgFlFJE22jSNBIwAAAP//AwCX3ggZmj2LzQAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\" title=\"inf TEP image\nClick to view image full size in a new tab\"> (top right) and tick \"On Top\" option.&nbsp;

At this stage the app works with the legacy Windows-1252 character encoding for both text processing and filenames.&nbsp; The app is therefore unable to handle foreign language text, or load and save files with special, foreign, or emoji characters in their filenames.&nbsp; All text and filenames are restricted to english ASCII characters in the Windows-1252 encoding standard.</p><p>\nIn addition, some options and minor operations may not work as expected, or at all on operating systems other than Microsoft Windows.&nbsp;

A standard or traditionally engineered app requires a lot of support in the form of libraries, data files, images, scripts, etc and the list goes on.&nbsp; You get the picture.&nbsp; Some portable apps out there still include this bundle of bits, they merely offload it into a local folder.&nbsp; A dump of goodies of sorts.<p>\nWe tend to see a portable app in quite a different light.&nbsp; Our vision of a portable app is designed tight, clean, free of bloat, and all data where possible is included directly within, structured right into the fabric of the app itself, and designed from the bare-metal up if required.</p><p>\nThough the most important difference between a traditional app and a portable app is that a portable app will not install on your computer.&nbsp; This is extremely important as the installation process is often messy, and can clutter up your computer by dumping a lot of stuff all over the Windows file structure and registry, and over time may slow down and decrease the overall performance of your computer.</p><p>\nA portable app will not do this, which keeps your computer clean and running smooth and fast as it should.&nbsp; Unfortunately most software is not designed with portable in mind.&nbsp; They're more akin to a large leaky box of bits than tight engineering.&nbsp; And because a portable app is not installed on your computer, it runs outside the normal scope of the operating system, and is not locked down or tied to it.&nbsp; And thus can be moved about, from disk to disk, or computer to computer.</p><p>\nTypically a portable app will reside on a USB pen stick, removable media, or in a special folder on a portable hard disk.&nbsp; This makes it easy to take from one computer to the next, and use over and over.&nbsp; An immensely valuable freedom, and something an installed app can only dream of.</p><p>\nBut a serious technical hurdle must be overcome for a truly portable app to be free.&nbsp;

All without the help of the Windows' registry or other operating system dependent structures.</p><p>\nAn installed app typically can't or won't do this.&nbsp; Instead, it relies on Windows and the registry to manage it's settings and other important data sets for it.&nbsp; It therefore takes a higher degree of technical competence to escape this \"tied to the operating system\" situation.</p><p>\nHere is our current standard for a portable app:</p><ul><li> Require no installation or setup</li><li> Require no additional DLL libraries to run and perform it's core function</li><li> Make no alteration to the host operating system, or its settings, files, libraries or core functions, or the Windows registry, unless it forms a part or a whole of the app's core function, and then, only when initiated by the user</li><li> Be able to run \"out of the box\"</li><li> Require no compiling, conversion, installation or setup of support structures in order to execute, except for when such an environment constitutes an execution enabling environment, such as a command translation service like Wine</li><li> Be free of zipped or otherwise externally bundled blob structures containing folders, files and bits</li><li> Operate on less powerful hardware to facilitate operation on a broad spectrum of computers</li><li> Less demanding API landscape to facilitate execution on a broad range of operating systems and software translation environments</li><li> Require no special software libraries be present in order to run, such as .NET or JAVA, unless typically pre-installed on the target operating system or execution environment</li><li> Not require an internet connection to run, unless the connection is required to fulfill the app's core function, such as a web server</li><li> Require no downloads, addons, or registration in order to run</li><li> Provide help and documentation offline via a built-in viewer, or by limited external means, such as Notepad</li><li> Be self-contained with all necessary files, data sets, and samples stored within it's internal structure, such that access be provided preferably through direct enabling mechanisms</li><li> Store, hold and manage external app settings and user data in a local sub-folder, and that sub-folder be easily identifiable as belonging to the app</li><li> Provide a mostly consistent appearance and experience to the user across the widest possible range of operating systems and execution environments</li><li> Value backwards compatibility, and be able to actively make use of that older hardware and software</li><li> Possess a compact, bloat-free footprint</li></ul><a href=\"https://www.blaizenterprises.com/cynthia.html#help\" title=\"Help Topics\">⏶</a>Make sure any app related data that is precious to you is backed up before you delete.As a portable app does not install itself on your computer there will be no automatic uninstall option listed in Windows.&nbsp;

ECC+PQ.\nIETF's TLS working group is standardizing ECC+PQ.\nBut IETF management is also non-consensually ramming a particular NSA-driven document\nthrough the IETF process,\na \"non-hybrid\" document that adds  as another TLS option.</p><p>Don't worry: we're standardizing cars with seatbelts.\nAlso, recognizing generous funding from the National Morgue Association,\nwe're going to standardize cars  seatbelts as another option,\nignoring the safety objections.\nThat's okay, right?</p><p>Last month I posted\n<a href=\"https://blog.cr.yp.to/20251004-weakened.html\">part 1</a>\nof this story.\nToday's\n<a href=\"https://blog.cr.yp.to/20251123-corruption.html\">part 2</a>\nhighlighted the corruption.\nThis blog post, part 3,\nhighlights the dodging in a particular posting at the beginning of this month\nby an IETF \"security area director\".\n<a href=\"https://blog.cr.yp.to/20251123-scope.html\">Part 4</a>\nwill give an example of how\ndissent on this topic has been censored.</p><p><strong>Consensus means whatever the people in power want to do.</strong>\nRecall from my previous blog post that\n\"adoption\" of a document is a preliminary step\nbefore an IETF \"working group\" works on, and decides whether to standardize, the document.\nIn April 2025,\nthe chairs of the IETF TLS WG called for \"adoption\" of this NSA-driven document.\nDuring the call period,\n20 people expressed unequivocal support for adoption,\n2 people expressed conditional support for adoption,\nand 7 people expressed unequivocal opposition to adoption.\n(<a href=\"https://blog.cr.yp.to/20251004-weakened.html#agreement\">Details for verification.</a>)</p><p>Before the chairs could even reply,\nan \"area director\"\n<a href=\"https://cr.yp.to/2025/20251006-non-hybrid.pdf#section.7\">interrupted</a>,\nclaiming, inter alia, the following:\n\"There is clearly consensus\nbased on the 67 responses to the adoption call. ...\nThe vast majority was in favour of adoption ...\nThere were a few dissenting opinions\".</p><p>After these lies by the \"area director\" were\n<a href=\"https://cr.yp.to/2025/20251006-non-hybrid.pdf#section.10\">debunked</a>,\nthe chairs said that they had declared consensus\n\"because there is clearly sufficient interest to work on this draft\"\nspecifically \"enough people willing to review the draft\".</p><p>I can understand not everybody being familiar with\nthe specific definition of \"consensus\" that\n<a href=\"https://blog.cr.yp.to/20251004-weakened.html#standards\">antitrust law</a>\nrequires standards-development organizations to follow.\nBut it's astonishing to see chairs substituting a consensus-evaluation procedure\nthat simply ignores objections.</p><p>\nThe chairs said I could escalate.\nIETF procedures say that an unresolved dispute can be brought\n\"to the attention of the Area Director(s) for the area in which the Working Group is chartered\",\nand then \"The Area Director(s) shall attempt to resolve the dispute\".</p><p>I filed a complaint with the \"security area directors\"\nin <a href=\"https://cr.yp.to/2025/20250605-non-hybrid.pdf\">early June 2025</a>.\nOne of them never replied.\nThe other,\nthe same one who had claimed that there was \"clearly consensus\",\nsent a <a href=\"https://cr.yp.to/2025/20251006-non-hybrid.pdf#section.14\">series of excuses</a>\nfor not handling the complaint.\nFor example, one excuse was that the PDF format \"discourages participation\".</p><p>Do IETF procedures say \"The Area Director(s) shall attempt to resolve the dispute\nunless the dispute is documented in a PDF\"?\nNo.</p><p>I sent email two days later\nsystematically addressing the excuses.\nThe \"area director\" never replied.</p><p>It isn't clear under IETF procedures whether a non-reply allows an appeal.\nIt is, however, clear that an appeal  be filed after two months.\nI escalated to the \"Internet Engineering Steering Group\" (IESG)\nin <a href=\"https://cr.yp.to/2025/20250812-non-hybrid.pdf\">August 2025</a>.</p><p>(These aren't even marginally independent groups.\nThe \"area directors\" are the IESG members.\nIESG appoints the WG chairs.)</p><p>IESG didn't reply until October 2025.\nIt rejected one of the \"Area Director\" excuses for having ignored my complaint,\nbut endorsed another excuse.\nI promptly filed a\n<a href=\"https://cr.yp.to/2025/20251006-non-hybrid.pdf\">revised complaint</a>\nwith the \"area director\",\njumping through the hoops that IESG had set.\nThere were then further\n<a href=\"https://cr.yp.to/2025/20251024-rules.pdf\">runarounds</a>.</p><p>\nSuddenly,\non 1 November 2025,\nIESG publicly instructed the \"area director\" to address the following question:\n\"Was rough consensus to adopt draft-connolly-tls-mlkem-key-agreement in the\nTLS Working Group appropriately called by the WG chairs?\"</p><p>The \"area director\" posted his conclusion mere hours later:\n\"I agree with the TLS WG Chairs that the Adoption Call result\nwas that there was rough consensus to adopt the document\".</p><p><strong>Dodging procedural objections.</strong>\nBefore looking at how the \"area director\" argued for this conclusion,\nI'd like to emphasize three things that the \"area director\"  do.</p><p>First,\ndid the \"area director\" address my <a href=\"https://cr.yp.to/2025/20251006-non-hybrid.pdf\">complaint</a>\nabout the chair action on this topic?\nNo.</p><p>One reason this matters is that\nthe law requires standards-development organizations to provide an\n<a href=\"https://blog.cr.yp.to/20251004-weakened.html#standards\">\"appeals process\"</a>.\nStructurally,\nthe \"area director\" isn't quoting and answering the points in my complaint;\nthe \"area director\" puts the entire burden on the reader\nto try to figure out what's supposedly answering what,\nand to realize that many points remain unanswered.</p><p>Second,\ndid the \"area director\" address the chairs claiming that\n\"we have consensus to adopt this draft\"?\nOr the previous claim from the \"area director\"\nthat there was \"clearly consensus\"?\nNo.\nInstead IESG and this \"area director\"\nquietly shifted from \"consensus\" to \"rough consensus\".\n(Did you notice this shift when I quoted IESG's \"rough consensus\" instruction?)</p><p>One reason this matters is that\n<a href=\"https://blog.cr.yp.to/20251004-weakened.html#standards\">\"consensus\"</a>\nis another of the legal requirements for standards-development organizations.\nThe law doesn't allow \"rough consensus\".\nAlso,\nIETF claims that\n<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250528213926/https://www.ietf.org/blog/ietf-llc-statement-competition-law-issues/\">\"decision-making requires achieving broad consensus\"</a>.\n\"broad consensus\" is even stronger than \"consensus\",\nsince it's saying that there's consensus .</p><p>Third,\nthe way that my complaint had established the\n<a href=\"https://cr.yp.to/2025/20251006-non-hybrid.pdf#section.5\">lack of consensus</a>\nwas, first, by reviewing the general definition of \"consensus\"\n(which I paraphrased from the definition in the law, omitting a citation only because\nthe TLS chairs had threatened me with a\n<a href=\"https://blog.cr.yp.to/20251123-scope.html\">list ban</a>\nif I mentioned the law again),\nand then applying the components of that definition to the situation at hand.\nDid the area director follow this structure?\nHere's the definition of \"consensus\", or \"rough consensus\" if we're switching to that,\nand now let's apply that definition?\nNo.\nNobody reading this message from the \"area director\" can figure out what the \"area director\" believes these words mean.</p><p>Wow, look at that:\n<a href=\"https://blog.cr.yp.to/20251004-weakened.html#standards\">\"due process\"</a>\nis another of the legal requirements for standards-development organizations.\nPart of due process is simply <em>making clear what procedures are being applied</em>.\nCould it possibly be that the people writing the law\nwere thinking through how standardization processes could be abused?</p><p>\nWithout further ado,\nlet's look at what the \"security area director\" did write.</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>As noted above,\nIESG had instructed the \"area director\" to answer the following question:\n\"Was rough consensus to adopt draft-connolly-tls-mlkem-key-agreement in the\nTLS Working Group appropriately called by the WG chairs?\"</p><p>Side note:\nGiven that the \"area director\" posted all of the following\non the same day that IESG instructed the \"area director\" to write this,\npresumably this was all written in advance and coordinated with the rest of IESG.\nI guess the real point of finally (on 1 November 2025) addressing the adoption decision (from 15 April 2025)\nwas to try to provide cover for the \"last call\" a few days later (5 November 2025).</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>As noted above,\nthe TLS WG chairs had claimed \"consensus\",\nand the \"area director\" had claimed that there was \"clearly consensus\".\nThe \"area director\" is now quietly shifting to a weaker claim.</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>\"About 40\"?\nWhat happened to the \"area director\" previously writing\n\"There is clearly consensus\nbased on the 67 responses to the adoption call\"?\nAnd why is the number of messages supposed to matter in the first place?</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>Messages after the specified adoption-call deadline can't justify the claim that\n\"the Adoption Call result was that there was rough consensus to adopt the document\".\nThe adoption call  to reach consensus.</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>The fact that the ADs and IESG stonewalled in response to complaints\ndoesn't mean that they were \"attempted\" complaints.</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>These numbers are  closer to reality\nthan the \"area director\" previously writing\n\"There is clearly consensus\nbased on the 67 responses to the adoption call. ...\nThe vast majority was in favour of adoption ...\nThere were a few dissenting opinions\".</p><p>Also, given that the \"area director\" is continually making claims that aren't true\n(see examples below)\nand seems generally allergic to providing evidence\n(the text I'm quoting below has, amazingly,  URLs),\nit's a relief to see the \"area director\" providing names to back up the claimed numbers here.</p><p>But somehow, even after being\n<a href=\"https://cr.yp.to/2025/20251006-non-hybrid.pdf#section.10\">caught</a>\nlying about the numbers before,\nthe \"area director\" still can't resist shading the numbers a bit.</p><p>The actual numbers were\n20 people unequivocally supporting adoption,\n2 people conditionally supporting adoption,\nand 7 people unequivocally opposing adoption.\nClearly 7 is close to 6, and 20+2 is close to 23, but, hmmm, not exactly.\nLet's check the details:</p><ul><li><p>How does the \"area director\" end up with 6 negative votes rather than 7?\n  By falsely listing Thomas Bellebaum as \"ambivalent\"\n  and falsely attributing a \"prefer not, but okay if we do\" position to Bellebaum.\n  In fact,\n  Bellbaum had\n  <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250813164633/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/YyemGJF-4-hRVwOcJ47Rw4Nu8Js/\">written</a>\n  \"I agree with Stephen on this one and would not support adoption of non-hybrids.\"\n  (This was in reply to Stephen Farrell,\n  who had written \"I'm opposed to adoption, at this time.\")</p></li><li><p>How does the \"area director\" end up with 23 positive votes rather than 22?\n  By falsely listing the document author (Deirdre Connolly) as having stated a pro-adoption position during the call.\n  The \"area director\" seems generally clueless about conflict-of-interest issues\n  and probably doesn't find it obvious that an author  vote,\n  but the simple fact is that the author  vote.\n  She\n  <a

commenting on specific points,\n  not casting a vote on the adoption question.</p></li></ul><p>The document author didn't object to the \"area director\" fudging the numbers.\nBellebaum did politely\n<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20251123055459/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/FmhDavgLrGR2y920WWbM80yMge8/\">object</a>;\nthe \"area director\"\n<a

consensus\" claim.\nThe \"area director\" also hasn't commented on IETF\n<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250603130154/https://www.ietf.org/about/introduction/\">saying</a>\nthat IETF doesn't make decisions by voting.</p><p><strong>Bogus arguments for the draft.</strong>\nI mentioned in my previous blog post that IETF\n<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250528213926/https://www.ietf.org/blog/ietf-llc-statement-competition-law-issues/\">claims</a>\nthat \"IETF participants use their best engineering judgment to find the best solution for the whole Internet,\nnot just the best solution for any particular network, technology, vendor, or user\".</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>Okay,\nthe \"area director\"\nseems to have some basic awareness\nthat this document flunks the \"engineering judgment\" criterion.\nThe \"area director\" tries to defend this by saying that other documents flunk too.\nSo confidence-inspiring!</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>Wrong.\nAnything+PQ, and in particular ECC+PQ,\ncomplies with NIST's standards when the PQ part does.\nSee\n<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250924170028/https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-227.pdf\">NIST SP 800-227</a>:\n\"This publication approves the use of the key combiner (14) for any t &gt; 1 if at least one\nshared secret (i.e., S for some j) is generated from the key-establishment methods in SP\n800-56A [1] or SP 800-56B [2] or an approved KEM.\"\nFor example, if the PQ part is ML-KEM as per FIPS 203,\nthen NIST allows ECC+PQ too.</p><p>What's next:\nclaiming that using PQ in an Internet protocol would violate NIST standards\nunless NIST has standardized that particular Internet protocol?</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>I won't bother addressing the errors here,\nsince the bottom-line claim is orthogonal to the issue at hand.\nThe TLS WG already has an ECC+PQ document using NIST-approved PQ;\nthe question is whether to also have a document allowing the ECC seatbelt to be removed.</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>You know what would be even less complicated?\nEncrypting with the null cipher!</p><p>There was a claim that PQ is less complex than ECC+PQ.\nThere was no response to\n<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20251005085401/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/uOmcMEqlyekrvcOgdsf7GtIlf3w/\">Andrey Jivsov</a>\nobjecting that having a PQ option makes the ecosystem  complicated.\nThe basic error in the PQ-less-complex claim is that it ignores ECC+PQ already being there.</p><p><strong>How the \"area director\" described the objections.</strong></p><blockquote></blockquote><p>This is the closest that the \"area director\" comes to acknowledging the central security argument for ECC+PQ.\nOf course, the \"area director\" spends as little time as possible on security.\nCompare this to\n<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20251005085348/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/2Dfu4x678DEKCzF-fkdvJHJkS-8/\">my own objection</a>\nto adoption,\nwhich started with SIKE as a concrete example of the dangers\nand continued with\n\"SIKE is not an isolated example: https://cr.yp.to/papers.html#qrcsp\nshows that 48% of the 69 round-1 submissions to the NIST competition\nhave been broken by now\".</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>Hmmm.\nBy listing this as part of an \"opposed argument summary\",\nis the \"area director\" suggesting that this was disputed?\nWhen and where was the dispute?</p><p>As noted above, I've seen\n<a href=\"https://blog.cr.yp.to/20240102-hybrid.html\">unquantified NSA/GCHQ fearmongering about costs</a>,\nbut that was outside IETF.\nIf NSA and GCHQ tried the same arguments on a public mailing list\nthen they'd end up being faced with questions that they can't answer.</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>When I wrote my own summary of the\n<a href=\"https://cr.yp.to/2025/20251006-non-hybrid.pdf#section.4\">objections</a>,\nI provided a quote and link for each point.\nThe \"area director\" doesn't do this.\nIf the \"area director\" is accurately presenting an argument that was raised,\nwhy not provide a quote and a link?\nIs the \"area director\" misrepresenting the argument?\nMaking up a strawman?\nThe reader can't tell.</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>This comment about \"weight\" is revealing.\nWhat we'll see again and again is that the \"area director\"\nis expressing the weight that  places on each argument\n(within the arguments selected and phrased by the \"area director\"),\ni.e., the extent to which  is convinced or not convinced by those arguments.</p><p>Given that IESG has power under IETF rules to unilaterally block publications approved by WGs,\nit's unsurprising that the \"area directors\", in their roles as IESG members,\nwill end up evaluating the merits of WG-approved documents.\nBut <em>that isn't what this \"area director\" was instructed to do here</em>.\nThere isn't a WG-approved document at this point.\nInstead the \"area director\" was instructed to evaluate whether the chairs \"appropriately\"\ncalled \"rough consensus\" to \"adopt\" the document.\nThe \"area director\" is supposed to be evaluating procedurally what the WG decision-makers did.\nInstead the \"area director\" is putting his thumb on the scale in favor of the document.</p><p><strong>Incompetent risk management.</strong></p><blockquote></blockquote><p>I think that the \"area director\" is trying to make some sort of claim here\nabout ML-KEM not having been attacked,\nbut the wording is so unclear as to be unevaluatable.\nWhy doesn't <a href=\"https://kyberslash.cr.yp.to\">KyberSlash</a> count?\nHow about <a href=\"https://pqshield.com/pqshield-plugs-timing-leaks-in-kyber-ml-kem-to-improve-pqc-implementation-maturity/\">Clangover</a>?\nHow about the continuing advances in lattice attacks\nthat have already reduced ML-KEM below its claimed security targets,\nthe most recent news being from\n<a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/1910\">last month</a>?</p><p>More importantly,\nclaiming that ML-KEM isn't \"known\" to have problems\nis utterly failing to address the point of the ECC seatbelt.\nIt's like saying\n\"This car hasn't crashed, so the absence of seatbelts isn't a basic flaw\".</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>Here the \"area director\" is reasonably capturing\na statement from one document proponent\n(original wording:\n\"I find it\nto be cognitive dissonance to simultaneously argue that the quantum threat requires immediate work, and\nyet we are also somehow uncertain of if the algorithms are totally broken. Both cannot be true at the same time\").</p><p>But I promptly\n<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20251005085348/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/2Dfu4x678DEKCzF-fkdvJHJkS-8/\">followed up</a>\nexplaining the error:\n\"Rolling out PQ is trying to reduce the damage from an attacker having a\nquantum computer within the security lifetime of the user data. Doing\nthat as ECC+PQ instead of just PQ is trying to reduce the damage in case\nthe PQ part is broken. These actions are compatible, so how exactly do\nyou believe they're contradictory?\"</p><p>There was, of course, no reply at the time.\nThe \"area director\" now simply repeats the erroneous argument.</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>\"Non-hybrid classics\" is weird terminology.\nSometimes pre-quantum algorithms (ECC, RSA, etc.) are called \"classical\",\nso I guess the claim here is that using just ECC in TLS isn't being phased out.\nThat's a bizarre claim.\nThere are intensive efforts to roll out ECC+PQ in TLS\nto try to protect against quantum computers.\nCloudflare\n<a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/adoption-and-usage#post-quantum-encryption-adoption\">reports</a>\nthe usage of post-quantum cryptography having risen to about 50% of all browsers that it sees\n(compared to 20% a year ago);\nwithin those connections,\n<a href=\"https://groups.google.com/a/list.nist.gov/g/pqc-forum/c/vtMTuE_3u-0/m/k6JisLwXAQAJ\">95%</a> use ECC+MLKEM768 and 5% use ECC+Kyber768.</p><p>The \"area director\" also gives no explanation of\nwhy the \"not phasing out\" claim is supposed to be relevant here.</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>See how the \"area director\" is saying the weight that the \"area director\" places on each argument\n(within the arguments selected and phrased by the \"area director\"),\nrather than evaluating whether there was consensus to adopt the document?</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>Circular argument.\nThere wasn't consensus to adopt the document in the first place.</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>I think many readers will be baffled by this comment.\nIf something is \"not recommended\",\nwouldn't that be an argument  standardizing it,\nrather than an argument  standardizing it?</p><p>The answer is that \"not recommended\" doesn't mean what you think it means:\nthe \"area director\" is resorting to confusing jargon.\nI don't think there's any point getting into the weeds on this.</p><p><strong>Incompetent planning for the future.</strong></p><blockquote></blockquote><p>If someone is trying to argue for removing ECC,\nthere's a big difference between the plausible scenario of ECC having \"less\" value\nand the extreme scenario of ECC having \"no\" value.\nIt's wrong for the \"area director\" to be conflating these possibilities.</p><p>As I put it\n<a href=\"https://blog.cr.yp.to/20240102-hybrid.html\">almost two years ago</a>:\n\"Concretely, think about a demo showing that spending a billion dollars on quantum computation can break a thousand X25519 keys.\nYikes! We should be aiming for much higher security than that!\nWe don't even want a billion-dollar attack to be able to break  key!\nUsers who care about the security of their data will be happy that we deployed post-quantum cryptography.\nBut are the users going to say 'Let's turn off X25519 and make each session a million dollars cheaper to attack'?\nI'm skeptical.\nI think users will need to see much cheaper attacks before agreeing that X25519 has negligible security value.\"</p><p>Furthermore,\nlet's think for a moment about the idea\nthat one will eventually want to transition to ,\nthe specific proposal that the \"area director\" is portraying as the future.\nHere are three ways that this can easily be wrong:</p><ul><li><p>Maybe ML-KEM's implementation issues\n  end up convincing the community to shift to a more robust option,\n  analogously to what happened with <a href=\"https://cr.yp.to/papers.html#safecurves\">ECC</a>.</p></li><li><p>Maybe the advances in public attacks continue to the point of breaking ML-KEM outright.</p></li><li><p>Maybe the cliff stops crumbling and ML-KEM survives,\n  but more efficient options also survive. \n  At this point there are quite a few options more efficient than ML-KEM.\n  (Random example: <a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/739\">SMAUG</a>.\n  The current SMAUG software isn't as fast as the ML-KEM software,\n  but this is outweighed by SMAUG using less network traffic than ML-KEM.)\n  Probably some options will be broken,\n  but ML-KEM would have to be remarkably lucky to end up as the most efficient remaining option.</p></li></ul><p>Does this \"area director\" think that all of the more efficient options are going to be broken, while ML-KEM won't?\nSounds absurdly overconfident.\nMore likely is that the \"area director\" doesn't even realize that there are more efficient options.\nFor anyone thinking \"presumably those newer options have received less scrutiny than ML-KEM\":\nwe're talking about what to do long-term, remember?</p><p>Taking ML-KEM as the PQ component of ECC+PQ is working for getting something rolled out now.\nHopefully ML-KEM will turn out to not be a security disaster (or a patent disaster).\nBut, for guessing what will be best to do in 5 or 10 or 15 years,\npicking ML-KEM is premature.</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>Here the \"area director\" is  attacking a strawman.</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>How is rolling out PQ supposed to be gaining experience\nthat isn't gained from the current rollout of ECC+PQ?</p><p>Also, I think it's important to call out the word \"pure\" here\nas incoherent, indefensible marketing.\nWhat we're actually talking about isn't modifying ML-KEM in any way;\nit's simply hashing the ML-KEM session key together with other inputs.\nIs ML-KEM no longer \"pure\" when it's plugged into TLS,\nwhich also hashes session keys?\n(The word \"pure\" also showed up in a few of the earlier quotes.)</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>Here we again see <em>the area director making a decision to support the document</em>,\nrather than evaluating whether there was consensus in the WG to adopt the document.</p><p><strong>Again getting the complexity evaluation backwards.</strong></p><blockquote></blockquote><p>Here the \"area director\" is again\nmaking the same mistake explained earlier:\nignoring the fact that ECC+PQ is already there,\nand thus getting the complexity evaluation backwards.</p><p>The \"thus add risk\" logic is also wrong.\nAgain, all of these options are more complex than the null cipher.</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>No, the details of how to combine ECC with PQ in TLS are already settled and deployed.</p><p>Looking beyond TLS:\nChempat hashes the transcript (similarly to TLS),\nmaking it robust for a wide range of protocols.\nThe other options add fragility by hashing less for the sake of minor cost savings.\nEach of these options is under 10 lines of code.\nThe \"area director\" exaggerates the complexity by mentioning \"extensive discussions\",\nand spends much more effort hyping this complexity as a risk\nthan acknowledging the risks of further PQ attacks.</p><p>Anyway,\nit's not as if the presence of this document\nhas eliminated the discussions of ECC+PQ details,\nnor is there any credible mechanism by which it could do so.\nAgain, the actual choice at hand is whether to have PQ as an option  ECC+PQ.\nAdding that option  complexity.\nThe \"area director\" is getting the complexity comparison backwards\nby instead comparing\n(1) PQ in isolation to (2) ECC+PQ in isolation.</p><p><strong>Botching the evaluation of human factors.</strong></p><blockquote></blockquote><p>I would expect a purchasing manager to have instructions\nalong the lines of \"Buy only products complying with the standards\",\nand to never see IETF's confusing jumble of further designations.</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>From a security perspective,\nit's a big mistake to ignore the human factor,\nsuch as the impact of a purchasing manager saying\n\"This is the most efficient standard so I'll pick that\".</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>Is this supposed to have something to do with the consensus question?</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>Ah, yes, \"known to consume\"!\nThere was, um,\none of those, uh, studies showing the details of, um, how implementors use RFCs,\nwhich, uh, showed that 100% of the implementors diligently consumed the warnings in the RFCs.\nYeah, that's the ticket.\nI'm sure the URL for this study is sitting around here somewhere.</p><p>Let's get back to the real world.\nEven if an implementor does see a \"This document is a bad idea\" warning,\nthis simply doesn't matter\nwhen the implementors are chasing contracts issued by purchasing managers\nwho simply care what's standardized and haven't seen the warning.</p><p>It's much smarter for the document to\n(1) eliminate making the proposal that it's warning about\nand (2) focus, starting in the title, on saying why such proposals are bad.\nThis makes people  likely to see the warning,\nand at the same time it removes the core problem of the bad proposal being standardized.</p><p><strong>Fictions regarding country actions.</strong></p><blockquote></blockquote><p>Certainly there were competition-like aspects to the process.\nI tend to refer to it as a competition.\nBut in the end the selection of algorithms to standardize was made by NIST,\nwith <a href=\"https://nist.pqcrypto.org/foia/highlights.html\">input behind the scenes from NSA</a>.</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>Nonsense.\nThe premier multi-year effort by cryptographers to \"publicly discuss post-quantum crypto candidates\"\nis the cryptographic literature.</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>Here's the objection from\n<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250814213602/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/toxVUv_d1pdDspbfo8OxcJeC_QU/\">Stephen Farrell</a>\nthat the \"area director\" isn't quoting or linking to:\n\"I don't see what criteria we might use in adopting this that\n   wouldn't leave the WG open to accusations of favouritism if\n   we don't adopt other pure PQ national standards that will\n   certainly arise\".</p><p>After reading this objection,\nyou can see how the \"area director\" is sort of responding to it\nby suggesting that everybody is following NIST\n(i.e., that the \"certainly arise\" part is wrong).</p><p>But that's not true.\nNIST's selections are controversial.\nFor example, ISO is\n<a href=\"https://blog.cr.yp.to/20250423-mceliece.html\">considering</a>\nnot just ML-KEM but also</p><ul><li><p>Classic McEliece,\n  where NIST has\n  <a href=\"https://blog.cr.yp.to/20250423-mceliece.html\">said</a>\n  it's waiting for ISO\n  (\"After the ISO standardization process has been completed, NIST may consider developing a standard for Classic McEliece based on the ISO standard\"),\n  and</p></li><li><p>FrodoKEM,\n  which NIST\n  <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20221005222322/https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2022/NIST.IR.8413-upd1.pdf\">said</a>\n  \"will not be considered further for standardization\".</p></li></ul><p>ISO is also now\n<a href=\"https://info.isl.ntt.co.jp/crypt/ntru/index.html\">considering</a>\nNTRU, where the\n<a href=\"https://info.isl.ntt.co.jp/crypt/ntru/index.html\">advertisement</a>\nincludes \"All patents related to NTRU have expired\"\n(very different from the ML-KEM situation).</p><p>BSI, which sets cryptographic standards for Germany,\n<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20251123095123/https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/BSI/Publications/TechGuidelines/TG02102/BSI-TR-02102-1.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=9\">recommends</a>\nnot just ML-KEM\nbut also FrodoKEM (which it describes as \"more conservative\" than ML-KEM)\nand Classic McEliece (\"conservative and very thoroughly analysed\").\nMeanwhile China has called for\n<a href=\"https://www.niccs.org.cn/en/\">submissions</a>\nof new post-quantum proposals for standardization.</p><p>I could keep going,\nbut this is enough evidence to show that Farrell's prediction was correct;\nthe \"area director\" is once again wrong.</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>Notice how the \"area director\" is dodging Farrell's point.\nIf NSA can pressure the TLS WG into standardizing non-hybrid ML-KEM,\nwhy can't China pressure the TLS WG into standardizing something China wants?\nWhat criteria will IETF use to answer this question\nwithout leaving the WG \"open to accusations of favouritism\"?\nIf you want people to believe that it isn't about the money\nthen you need a  convincing alternative story.</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>This is just rehashing earlier text,\neven if the detailed wording is a bit different.</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>Irrelevant.\nThe question is whether they're being standardized.</p><blockquote></blockquote><blockquote></blockquote><blockquote></blockquote><p>Yes, NSA waving around money has convinced some corporations to provide software.\nHow is this supposed to justify the claim\nthat \"there was rough consensus to adopt the document\"?</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>Repeating a claim doesn't make it true.</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>Irrelevant.\nWhat matters is whether the document is standardized.</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>This sort of dismissal might be more convincing\nif it were coming from someone providing more URLs and fewer easily debunked claims.\nBut it's in any case not addressing the consensus question.</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>The chairs claimed that \"we have consensus to adopt this draft\"\n(based on claiming that \"there were enough people willing to review the draft\",\nnever mind the number of objections).\nThat claim is wrong.\nThe call for adoption failed to reach consensus.</p><p>The \"area director\" claimed that\n\"There is clearly consensus\nbased on the 67 responses to the adoption call. ...\nThe vast majority was in favour of adoption ...\nThere were a few dissenting opinions\".\nThese statements still haven't been retracted;\nthey were and are outright lies about what happened.\nAgain, the\n<a href=\"https://blog.cr.yp.to/20251004-weakened.html#agreement\">actual tallies</a>\nwere\n20 people unequivocally supporting adoption,\n2 people conditionally supporting adoption,\nand 7 people unequivocally opposing adoption.</p><p>Without admitting error,\nthe \"area director\" has retreated to a claim of \"rough consensus\".\nThe mishmash of ad-hoc comments from the \"area director\"\ncertainly doesn't demonstrate any coherent meaning of \"rough consensus\".</p><p>It's fascinating that IETF's\n<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250528213926/https://www.ietf.org/blog/ietf-llc-statement-competition-law-issues/\">advertising to the public</a>\nclaims that IETF's \"decision-making requires achieving broad consensus\",\nbut IETF's\n<a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2418.html\">WG procedures</a>\nallow controversial documents to be pushed through on the basis of \"rough consensus\".\nTo be clear,\nthat's only if the \"area director\" approves of the documents,\nas you can see from the same \"area director\"\nissuing yet another mishmash of ad-hoc comments to\n<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20251004151803/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/41gkoA74Dr-6JZYNThfpjZD0BPM/\">overturn</a>\na separate chair decision in September 2025.</p><p>You would think that the WG procedures would  \"rough consensus\".\nThey don't.\nAll they say is that\n\"51% of the working group does not qualify as 'rough consensus' and 99% is better than rough\",\nnot even making clear whether 51% of  within a larger working group can qualify.\nThis leaves a vast range of ambiguous intermediate cases up to the people in power.</p>",

      "content": "<p>OOP-bashing seems fashionable nowadays. I decided to write this article after seeing two OOP-related articles on <a href=\"https://lobste.rs/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lobsters</a> in quick succession. I’m not interested in defending or attacking OOP, but I do want to throw in my two cents and offer a more nuanced view.</p><p>The industry and the academy have used the term “object-oriented” to mean so many different things. One thing that makes conversations around OOP so unproductive is the lack of consensus on what OOP is.</p><p>What is Object-Oriented Programming? <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia defines it</a> as “a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects.” This definition is unsatisfactory, as it requires a definition of an “object” and fails to encompass the disparate ways the term is used in the industry. There is also <a href=\"http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/~ram/pub/pub_jf47ht81Ht/doc_kay_oop_en\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Alan Kay’s vision of OOP</a>. However, the way most people use the term has drifted apart, and I don’t want to fall into <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essentialism\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">essentialism</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etymological_fallacy\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">etymological fallacy</a> by insisting on a “true” meaning.</p><p>Instead, I think it is better to treat OOP as a mixed bag of interrelated ideas and examine them individually. Below, I will survey some ideas related to OOP and mention their pros and cons (in my subjective mind).</p><blockquote><p>Object-oriented programming is a method of implementation in which programs are organized as cooperative collections of objects, each of which represents an instance of some class, and whose classes are all members of a hierarchy of classes united via inheritance relationships. — Grady Booch</p></blockquote><p>Classes extend the idea of a “struct” or “record” with support for the method syntax, information hiding, and inheritance. We will talk about those specific features later.</p><p>Classes can also be viewed as blueprints for objects. It is not the only way to do that, and  is an alternative pioneered by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self_(programming_language)\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Self</a> and, most famously, used by JavaScript. Personally, I feel that prototypes are harder to wrap one’s head around compared to classes. Even JavaScript tries to hide its usage of prototypes from newcomers with ES6 classes.</p><blockquote><p>In Japanese, we have sentence chaining, which is similar to method chaining in Ruby — <a href=\"https://evrone.com/blog/yukihiro-matsumoto-interview\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Yukihiro Matsumoto</a></p></blockquote><p>The method syntax is one of the less controversial OOP features. It captures common programming use cases involving operations on a specific subject. Even in languages without methods, it is common to see functions effectively serve as methods by taking the relevant data as their first argument (or last, in languages with currying).</p><p>The syntax involves method definitions and method calls. Usually, languages supporting methods have both, unless you consider the “pipe operators” in functional languages as a form of method call.</p><p>The method call syntax aids IDE autocompletion, and method chaining is often more ergonomic than nested function calls (similar to the pipe operator in functional languages).</p><p>There are some debatable aspects of the method syntax, too. First, in many languages, methods are often not definable outside of a class, which causes a power imbalance compared to functions. There are certain exceptions, such as Rust (methods are always defined outside of the struct), Scala, Kotlin, and C# (extension methods).</p><p>Second, in many languages,  or  is implicit. This keeps the code more concise, but it can also introduce confusion and increase the risk of accidental name shadowing. Another drawback of an implicit this is that it is always passed as a pointer, and its type cannot be changed. This means you cannot pass it as a copy, and sometimes this indirection leads to performance issues. More importantly, because the type of this is fixed, you cannot write generic functions that accept different  types. Python and Rust got  right from the start, and C++ just fixed this issue in C++23 with <a href=\"https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2021/p0847r7.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">deducing this</a>.</p><p>Fourth, the dot notation is used for both instance variable accesses and method calls in most languages. This is an intentional choice to make methods look more <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_access_principle\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">uniform</a> with objects. In certain dynamically typed languages where <em>methods are instance variables</em>, this is fine and pretty much not even a choice. On the other hand, in languages like C++ or Java, this can cause confusion and shadowing problems.</p><blockquote><p>Its interface or definition was chosen to reveal as little as possible about its inner workings — <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/361598.361623\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">[Parnas, 1972b]</a></p></blockquote><p>In Smalltalk, all instance variables are not directly accessible from outside the object, and all methods are exposed. More modern OOP languages support information hiding via access specifiers like  at the class level. Even non-OOP languages usually support information hiding in some way, be it module systems, opaque types, or even C’s header separation.</p><p>Information hiding is a good way to prevent <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_invariant\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">invariant</a> from being violated. It is also a good way to separate frequently changed implementation details from a stable interface.</p><p>Nevertheless, aggressively hiding information may cause unnecessary boilerplate or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_inversion\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">abstraction inversion</a>. Another criticism comes from functional programmers, who argue that you don’t need to maintain invariants and thus don’t need much information hiding if data is . And, in a sense, OOP encourages people to write mutable objects that must be maintained as invariants.</p><p>Information hiding also encourages people to create small, self-contained objects that “know how to handle themselves,” which leads directly into the topic of encapsulation.</p><blockquote><p>If you can, just move all of that behavior into the class it helps. After all, OOP is about letting objects take care of themselves. — Bob Nystrom, <a href=\"https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/singleton.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Game Programming Patterns</a></p></blockquote><p>Encapsulation is often confused with information hiding, but the two are distinct. Encapsulation refers to bundling data with the functions that operate on it. OOP languages directly support encapsulation with classes and the method syntax, but there are other approaches (e.g., <a href=\"https://ocaml.org/docs/modules\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the module system in OCaml</a>).</p><p>The most common construct for encapsulation is objects, but it is not the only mechanism. Many modern languages also support <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">closures</a> (in fact, closures and objects can simulate each other). There are also other lesser-known approaches, such as modules found in the ML family.</p><p>Separation of interface and implementation is an old idea closely related to information hiding, encapsulation, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_data_type\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">abstract data type</a>. In some sense, even C’s header files can be considered an interface, but OOP usage of “interface” most often refers to a specific set of language constructs that support polymorphism (typically implemented via inheritance). Usually, an interface can’t contain data, and in more restricted languages (e.g., early versions of Java), they can’t contain method implementations either. The same idea of an interface is also common in non-OOP languages: Haskell type classes, Rust traits, and Go interfaces all serve the role of specifying an abstract set of operations independent of implementations.</p><p>Interface is often considered a simpler, more disciplined alternative to full-blown class inheritance. It is a single-purpose feature and doesn’t suffer from the same diamond problem that plagues multiple inheritance.</p><p>Interface is also extremely useful in combination with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_polymorphism\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">parametric polymorphism</a>, since it allows you to constrain the operations a type parameter must support. Dynamically-typed languages (and C++/D template) achieve something similar through <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">duck-typing</a>, but even languages with duck-typing introduce interface constructs later to express constraints more explicitly (e.g., C++ concepts or TypeScript interfaces).</p><p>The interface as implemented in OOP languages often has a runtime cost, but that’s not always the case. For example, <a href=\"https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/constraints.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">C++ concepts</a> is an example that only supports compile-time, and Rust’s trait only has opt-in runtime polymorphism support via .</p><blockquote><p>OOP to me means only messaging, local retention and protection and hiding of state-process, and extreme late-binding of all things — <a href=\"https://userpage.fu-berlin.de/~ram/pub/pub_jf47ht81Ht/doc_kay_oop_en\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Alan Kay</a></p></blockquote><p>Late binding refers to delaying the lookup of a method or a member until runtime. It is the default of most dynamic-typed languages, where method calls are often implemented as a hash table lookup, but can also be achieved with other means, such as dynamic loading or function pointers.</p><p>A key aspect of late binding is that behaviour can be changed while the software is still running, enabling all kinds of hot-reloading and monkey-patching workflows.</p><p>The downside of late binding is its non-trivial performance cost. Moreover, it can also be a footgun for breaking invariants or even interface mismatches. Its mutable nature can also introduce subtler issues, for example, the “late binding closures” pitfall in Python.</p><p>A concept related to late binding is dynamic dispatch, in which the implementation of a polymorphic operation is selected at runtime. The two concepts overlap, though dynamic dispatch focuses more on selecting multiple known polymorphic operations rather than on name lookup.</p><p>In a dynamically typed language, dynamic dispatch is the default since everything is late-bound. In statically typed languages, it is usually implemented as a virtual function table that looks something like this under the hood:</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"cpp\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>These languages also provide compile-time guarantees that the vtable contains valid operations for the type.</p><p>Dynamic dispatch can be decoupled from inheritance, whether by manually implementing a v-table (e.g., C++‘s “type-erased types” such as <a href=\"https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/functional/function\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"></a>) or an interface/trait/typeclass kind of constructs. When not paired with inheritance, dynamic dispatch alone is usually not considered “OOP.”</p><p>Another thing to note is that the pointer to the v-table can be directly inside the object (e.g., C++) or embedded in “fat pointers” (e.g., Go and Rust).</p><blockquote><p>programming using class hierarchies and virtual functions to allow manipulation of objects of a variety of types through well-defined interfaces and to allow a program to be extended incrementally through derivation  — <a href=\"https://www.stroustrup.com/bs_faq.html#oop\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Bjarne Stroustrup</a></p></blockquote><p>Inheritance has a long history, way backed to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simula\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Simula 67</a>. It is probably the most iconic feature of OOP. Almost every language marketed as “object-oriented” includes it, while languages that avoid OOP typically omit it.</p><p>It can be damn . In many cases, using an alternative approach will result in significantly more boilerplate.</p><p>On the other hand, inheritance is a very <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonality_(programming)\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">non-orthogonal</a> feature. It is a single mechanism that enables dynamic dispatch, subtyping polymorphism, interface/implementation segregation, and code reuse. It is flexible, though that flexibility makes it easy to misuse. For that reason, some languages nowadays replace it with more restrictive alternative constructs.</p><p>There are some other problems with inheritance. First, using inheritance almost certainly means you are paying the performance cost of dynamic dispatch and heap allocation. In some languages, such as C++, you can use inheritance without dynamic dispatch and heap allocation, and there are some valid use cases (e.g., code reuse with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiously_recurring_template_pattern\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CRTP</a>), but the majority of uses of inheritance are for runtime polymorphism (and thus rely on dynamic dispatch).</p><p>Finally, inheritance hierarchies are rigid. They suffer from issues like the diagonal problem, and that inflexibility is one of the main reasons people prefer composition over inheritance. The <a href=\"https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/component.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">component pattern chapter of Game Programming Patterns</a> provides a good example.</p><blockquote><p>If for each object  of type  there is another object  of type  such that for all programs  defined in terms of , the behavior of  is unchanged when  is substituted for , then  is a subtype of . — Barbara Liskov, “<a href=\"https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/cs257/archive/barbara-liskov/data-abstraction-and-hierarchy.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Data Abstraction and Hierarchy</a>”</p></blockquote><p>Subtyping describes an “is a” relation between two types. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Liskov substitution principle</a> defines the property that safe subtyping relationships must uphold.</p><p>OOP languages often support subtyping via inheritance, but note that inheritance doesn’t always model subtyping, and it is not the only form of subtyping either. Various interface/trait constructs in non-OOP languages often support subtyping. And besides , where one explicitly declares the subtyping relationship, there are also , where the subtyping is implicit if one type contains all the features of another type. Good examples of structural subtyping include OCaml (<a href=\"https://dev.realworldocaml.org/objects.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">objects</a> and polymorphic variants) and TypeScript interfaces. Subtyping also shows in all kinds of little places, such as Rust lifetime and TypeScript’s coercion from a non-nullable type to its nullable counterpart.</p><p>A related concept to subtyping is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_variance\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">variance</a> (not related to class-invariant), which bridges parametric polymorphism and subtyping. I won’t bother explaining variance here, as this topic probably needs an entire blog post to explain well. It is a great ergonomic boost (e.g., C++ pointers will be unusable for polymorphic use if they are not covariant), but most languages only implement a limited, hard-coded version, because it is hard to understand and also error-prone. In particular, mutable data types should usually be invariant, and Java/C#‘s covariant arrays are a primary example on this gone wrong. Only a few languages allow programmers to explicitly control variance, including <a href=\"https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/variances.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Scala</a> and <a href=\"https://kotlinlang.org/docs/generics.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Kotlin</a>.</p><p>Type conversion via subtyping relationships is often implicit. Implicit conversion has a bad reputation. Though doing it with subtyping is ergonomic, and is probably the least surprising kind of implicit conversion. Another way to view subtyping is as the dual of implicit conversions. We can “fake” a subtyping relation with implicit conversion. For example, C++ templated types are invariant, but  achieves covariance with an implicit conversion from  to . <a href=\"https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2023/10/19/does-go-have-subtyping/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Does Go Have Subtyping?</a> is a good article to further explore this idea.</p><p>One reason that language designers often try to avoid subtyping is the implementation complexity. Integrating bidirectional type inference and subtyping is notoriously difficult. Stephen Dolan’s 2016 thesis <a href=\"https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/cs257/archive/stephen-dolan/thesis.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Algebraic Subtyping</a> makes good progress addressing this issue.</p><blockquote><p>I thought of objects being like biological cells and/or individual computers on a network, only able to communicate with messages — <a href=\"https://userpage.fu-berlin.de/~ram/pub/pub_jf47ht81Ht/doc_kay_oop_en\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Alan Kay</a></p></blockquote><p>Message passing means using objects that send each other “messages” as a way of execution. It is the centric theme of Alan Kay’s vision of OOP, though the definition can be pretty vague. An important point is that message names are late-bound, and the structures of these messages are not necessarily fixed at compile time.</p><p>Many early object-oriented concepts were influenced by distributed and simulation systems, where message passing is natural. However, in the era where most people work on single-threaded code, the message was gradually forgotten in languages such as C++ and Java. The method syntax only has limited benefit compared to the original message-passing idea (Bjarne Stroustrup was definitely aware of the idea from Simula, but there is practical constraint on how to make it fast). There was still some genuine message passing, but only in specific areas such as inter-process communication or highly event-driven systems.</p><p>Message passing gains a Renaissance in concurrent programming, ironically through non-OOP languages like Erlang and Golang, with constructs such as actors and channels. This kind of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared-nothing_architecture\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">shared-nothing concurrency</a> removed a whole range of data race and race condition bugs. In combination with supervision, actors also provide fault tolerance, so that the failure of one actor will not affect the entire program.</p><blockquote><p>In general, a rule of thumb is: use classes and objects in situations where open recursion is a big win. — <a href=\"https://dev.realworldocaml.org/objects.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Real World OCaml</a></p></blockquote><p>Originating in the famous <a href=\"https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Types and Programming Languages</a>,  is probably the least well-known and understood term in this blog post. Nevertheless, it just describes a familiar property of object-oriented systems: methods for an object can call each other, even if they are defined in different classes in the inheritance hierarchy.</p><p>The term is somewhat misleading, as there may not be recursive function calls, but here “recursion” means “mutually recursive.” The word “open” refers to “open to extension,” typically empowered by inheritance.</p><p>It’s easiest to see with an example:</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"cpp\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>For anyone with some familiarity with OOP, we probably take open recursion for granted, even though we may not be aware of its name. However, not all language constructs have this property. For example, in many languages, functions are not mutually recursive by default:</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"cpp\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>Now, in languages with late-bound functions, functions in the same module can always call each other (e.g., Python, JavaScript). There are other languages where functions are mutually recursive by default (e.g., Rust), or have forward declarations (C) or a  construct (Scheme and ML family) to make functions mutually recursive. This solves the “recursion” part, but still not the “open” part yet:</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"cpp\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>Let’s fix this problem by using a callback:</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"cpp\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>Tada, we just reinvented prototype-style dispatch!</p><p>Anyway, with my quick example above, I want to show that open recursion is a property that OOP gives for free, but reproducing it in languages without built-in support can be tricky. Open recursion allows interdependent parts of an object to be defined separately, and this property is used in many instances, for example, the entire idea of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">decorator pattern</a> depends on open recursion.</p><p>Perhaps the more common complaints about OOP are not about specific language features, but rather about the programming styles it encourages. Many practices are taught as universal best practices, sometimes with rationales, but their downsides are often omitted. Some examples popped into my mind are</p><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>preferring polymorphism over tagged union/if/switch/pattern matching</td><td>Open to extension, easier to add new cases.</td><td>Performance hit; Related behaviors get scattered in multiple places; harder to see the whole controll flow in one place</td></tr><tr><td>making all data members private</td><td>More boilerplates; Often unnecessary to hide data without invariants; Getter/setter pairs work less well compared to direct access in languages without property syntax</td></tr><tr><td>preferring small “self-managed” objects over central “managers”</td><td>Harder to violate invariants, cleaner code organization</td><td>Potential bad data locality, missing parallelism opportunities, and duplicated references to common data (“back pointer”)</td></tr><tr><td>Prevent new features from breaking the old one. Prevent API break</td><td>No reason to “close” a non-public module where you own its usage. Leads to unnecessary complexity and inheritance chain; poorly designed interfaces are not changed; Can cause abstraction inversion</td></tr><tr><td>preferring abstraction over concrete implementations</td><td>Making more system swappable and testable</td><td>Overuse sacrifices readability and debuggability. Performance cost of extra indirection</td></tr></tbody></table><p>This blog post is long enough, so I will not go into more details. Feel free to disagree with my “advantages and disadvantages”. What I want to convey is that almost all those practices come with trade-offs.</p><p>Congratulations on making it to the end of this article! There are other topics I’d love to discuss, such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_acquisition_is_initialization\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">RAII</a> and design patterns. However, this article is long enough, so I will leave those for you to explore on your own.</p>",

If so, I invite you to try your hand at the\nprojects in my class,\n<a href=\"https://kmicinski.com/cis531-f25\">CIS531</a>. CIS531 is a masters-level\nclass on compiler design which assumes that (a) you know how to\nprogram, (b) you’ve had some exposure to C (know about stack\nallocation, malloc, etc.), and (c) have seen some assembly code. My\nclass projects are in the Racket programming language, but if you\ndon’t know Racket, it is quite easy to learn: I have a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jrwXpUZW7k&amp;list=PLXaqTeMx01E_eK1ZEpKvKL5KwSaj7cJW9\">set of YouTube\nvideo lectures that teach Racket\nquickly</a>!\nIf you’ve never heard of Racket before, or you’re skeptical of\nfunctional programming, indulge me for a bit: there’s no hardcore FP\ntheory or math in this course, and Racket is genuinely the best\nlanguage to use for this specific setup.</p><p>My class follows Prof. Jeremy Siek’s excellent book, “Essentials of\nCompilation.” While I highly recommend buying the book and supporting\nProf. Siek, I will also note that there are <a href=\"https://brinckerhoff.org/clements/2194-csc431/essentials-of-compilation.pdf\">free online preliminary\neditions</a>\nfloating around; in my class, I followed the free version and\nsuggested that students buy the book if doing so fit their\ngoals. However, along with the book, I also have a set of class slides\nalong with sporadic course videos, both available on the <a href=\"https://kmicinski.com/cis531-f25\">class\nwebsite</a>.</p><p>This class builds up to a compiler with the following features:</p><ul><li>Variables and assignment via </li><li>Integer arithmetic via  and </li><li>Reading inputs / printing output</li><li>Booleans, conjunctions/disjunctions (and/or)</li><li>Branching via , integer comparisons (&lt;, etc.)</li><li>Assignment / mutation ()</li><li>Fixed-arity functions and function application</li><li>Lambdas (closures at runtime)</li></ul><p>The unique combination of features lets us tour an interesting\ncross-section of programming languages, exploring both imperative\nprogramming with loops and mutation but also functional programming\nwith lists and recursion.</p><p>To be specific, I challenge you to complete five projects, each\nincluding a comprehensive test suite that will seriously stress the\ncorrectness of your implementation. p1 is a warmup project (you should\nskip if you already know Racket), but p2-5 build a compiler for a set\nof increasingly-complex languages to x86-64. The languages nest inside\nof each other, with p2 giving us straight-line arithmetic, p3 giving\nus decision trees, p4 giving us loops and mutation, and p5 giving us\nfunctions, recursion, and lambdas.</p><p>The projects are designed with one key principle in mind: get us to\nthe <em>most expressive/fun language possible, as fast as possible</em>. In\ndoing this, we sacrifice a lot that might be typically covered:</p><ul><li><p>Our languages aren’t type/memory safe, we assume the programmer is\ncorrect</p></li><li><p>No register allocation (possible to add, not too hard)</p></li><li><p>No garbage collection of any kind: we . We could\ntrivially support the Boehm GC (I have done that in the past), but\nit was another static library to link in and I really wanted to make\nthis self contained.</p></li><li><p>We support a  limited set of builtins (but it is trivial to\nadd more)</p></li></ul><p>So even after project 5, getting to a “real” compiler would take a bit\nof effort. The most important (in my opinion) are (a) memory safety\n(the language needs to be safe, period) via dynamic type tagging and\n(b) slightly more builtins, and (c) register allocation. That would\nget us to a respectable compiler. After that, we could add more\nlanguage features, or optimize the ones we have, e.g., by using\nabstract interpretation.</p><p>Our language will include functions, loops, branching, assignment, and\neven heap-allocated vectors.

Each pass transforms an input language into an output\nlanguage, and these intermediate languages (IRs) are codified via\npredicates in . To define the meaning of each IR, we give an\ninterpreter for each in . For the compiler to be\ncorrect, it needs to be the case that–for all input streams–the\ncompiler produces the same output stream across all intermediate\nIRs. There is some system-specific stuff in , which takes\ncare of things like Linux vs. Mac ABI issues, specifying register\nnames, etc. The  file acts as a main compiler entrypoint,\nand it carefully runs each pass of the compiler, checking predicates\nbefore/after each pass and interpreting each IR, checking to ensure\nconsistency. This is a  win for debugging, in my opinion: you\n want to localize errors to the proximate pass which causes\nmisinterpretation, and  seriously aids debugging in my\nexperience. There is also more comprehensive test infrastructure in\n; this test script is invoked by the Python-based test\nscripts in . These tests check the behavior of the compiler on\nthe programs in the  directory, using the files from\n as inputs and comparing to the outputs in .</p><h3>Why Is This Course Unique and Cool?</h3><ul><li><p>You build a , all the way to actual x86-64\nassembly.</p></li><li><p>Each IR has a corresponding interpreter, which is easy to find/read\nand written in a familiar style, giving semantic clarity and\ntestable correctness.</p></li><li><p>The project is , meaning that you can use it as\na base for building your own language.

I made the whole\nclass free, at least as free as I could given practical\nconstraints. This class work on compilation is partially supported by\nour <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/show-award/?AWD_ID=2316159&amp;HistoricalAwards=false\">NSF PPoSS\nlarge</a>,\nwhich has already produced <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.14330\">many</a><a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3721145.3730431\">cool</a><a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3669940.3707274\">major</a><a href=\"https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/download/33665/35820\">results</a>. In\nsubsequent explorations, I am hoping that I can use this class\ncompiler as a baseline for highly-scalable engines that reason about\nprograms. Given the simple, self-contained nature–and the presence of\nper-pass interpreters and consistency testing–I see this as an\nawesome potential baseline for cool extensions.</p><p>My course is of course heavily inspired by Prof. Siek’s book and\ncourse, along with inspiration from Thomas Gilray at Washington\nState. Eight years ago, Tom and I took a spontaneous trip to see the\neclipse halfway across the country (skipping out on the ICSE ‘17\ndeadline basically); we discussed compiler design over a steamed\nseafood buffet in Myrtle Beach after napping in a cheap motel, having\nbeen awake for over 24 hours and feeling the eclipse had made it worth\nit. We sketched out his whole compiler on that roadtrip, and ever\nsince that night eating steamed crabs, I wanted to build my own course\ncompiler. Now that I have, I am not sure it compares to waking up for\njust four hours of twilight, only to consume copious amounts of butter\nand shellfish as the brisk ocean air wisps over your face, the\nclosures and continuations softly washing rhythmically through the\nconversation as you walk along the beach back to your $50 motel room.</p><p>In closing, thanks for checking this out, this compiler was a ton of\nfun to build. Even as someone who has some amount of expertise in\ncompiler design, building it and getting it 100% right (I hope!) was\nsuch a rewarding experience. My real sincere hope is that it offers\nstudents (and you!) a fun journey. If you end up doing anything this,\nplease get in touch: kkmicins@syr.edu. I’d love to see what you come\nup with.

In\nDepartment of Energy facilities across the country, incidences of employees\naccidentally carrying phones into secure areas are reduced through a sort of\nautomated nagging. A device at the door monitors for the presence of a tag;\nwhen the tag is detected it plays an audio clip. Because this is the government,\nthe device in question is highly specialized, fantastically expensive, and\nsays \"government cell phone\" even though most of the phones in question are\npersonal devices. Look, they already did the recording, they're not changing\nit now!</p><p>One of the things that I love is weird little wireless networks. Long ago I\nwrote about <a href=\"https://computer.rip/2023-01-02-ANT-plus-is-PAN-for-ants.html\">ANT+</a>,\nfor example, a failed personal area network standard designed mostly around\nfitness applications. There's tons of these, and they have a lot of\nsimilarities---so it's fun to think about the protocols that went down a\ncompletely different path. It's even better, of course, if the protocol is\nobscure outside of an important niche. And a terrible website, too? What more\ncould I ask for.</p><p>The DoE's cell-phone nagging boxes, and an array of related but more critical\napplications, rely on an unusual personal area networking protocol called RuBee.</p><p>RuBee is a product of Visible Assets Inc., or VAI, founded in 2004  by John K.\nStevens. Stevens seems a somewhat improbable founder, with a background in\nbiophysics and eye health, but he's a repeat entrepreneur. He's particularly fond of companies\ncalled Visible: he founded Visible Assets after his successful tenure as CEO of\nVisible Genetics. Visible Genetics was an early innovator in DNA sequencing, and\nstill provides a specialty laboratory service that sequences samples of HIV in\norder to detect vulnerabilities to antiretroviral medications.</p><p>Clinical trials in the early 2000s exposed Visible Genetics to one of the more\nfrustrating parts of health care logistics: refrigeration. Samples being shipped\nto the lab and reagents shipped out to clinics were both temperature sensitive.\nProviders had to verify that these materials had stayed adequately cold throughout\nshipping and handling, otherwise laboratory results could be invalid or incorrect.\nStevens became interested in technical solutions to these problems; he wanted\nsome way to verify that samples were at acceptable temperatures both in storage\nand in transit.</p><p>Moreover, Stevens imagined that these sensors would be in continuous communication.\nThere's a lot of overlap between this application and personal area networks (PANs),\nprotocols like Bluetooth that provide low-power communications over short ranges.\nThere is also clear overlap with RFID; you can buy RFID temperature sensors.\nVAI, though, coined the term  to describe RuBee. That's\nvisibility as in asset visibility: somewhat different from Bluetooth or RFID,\nRuBee as a protocol is explicitly designed for situations where you need to\n\"keep tabs\" on a number of different objects. Despite the overlap with other\ntypes of wireless communications, the set of requirements on a visibility network\nhave lead RuBee down a very different technical path.</p><p>Visibility networks have to be highly reliable. When you are trying to keep\ntrack of an asset, a failure to communicate with it represents a fundamental\nfailure of the system. For visibility networks, the ability to actually convey\na payload is secondary: the main function is just reliably detecting that\nendpoints exist. Visibility networks have this in common with RFID, and indeed,\ndespite its similarities to technologies like BLE RuBee is positioned mostly as\na competitor to technologies like UHF RFID.</p><p>There are several differences between RuBee and RFID; for example, RuBee uses\nactive (battery-powered) tags and the tags are generally powered by a complete\n4-bit microcontroller. That doesn't necessarily sound like an advantage, though.\nWhile RuBee tags advertise a battery life of \"5-25 years\", the need for a battery seems\nmostly like a liability. The real feature is what active tags enable: RuBee\noperates in the low frequency (LF) band, typically at 131 kHz.</p><p>At that low frequency, the wavelength is very long, about 2.5 km. With such a\nlong wavelength, RuBee communications all happen at much less than one wavelength\nin range. RF engineers refer to this as near-field operation, and it has some\nproperties that are intriguingly different from more typical far-field RF\ncommunications. In the near-field, the magnetic field created by the antenna is\nmore significant than the electrical field. RuBee devices are intentionally\ndesigned to emit very little electrical RF signal. Communications within a RuBee network are\nachieved through magnetic, not electrical fields. That's the core of RuBee's magic.</p><p>The idea of magnetic coupling is not unique to RuBee. Speaking of the near-field,\nthere's an obvious comparison to NFC which works much the same way. The main difference,\nbesides the very different logical protocols, is that NFC operates at 13.56 MHz.\nAt this higher frequency, the wavelength is only around 20 meters. The requirement\nthat near-field devices be much closer than a full wavelength leads naturally to\nNFC's very short range, typically specified as 4 cm.</p><p>At LF frequencies, RuBee can achieve magnetic coupling at ranges up to about 30\nmeters. That's a range comparable to, and often much better than, RFID inventory\ntracking technologies. Improved range isn't RuBee's only benefit over RFID. The\nproperties of magnetic fields also make it a more robust protocol. RuBee promises\nsignificantly less vulnerability to shielding by metal or water than RFID.</p><p>There are two key scenarios where this comes up: the first is equipment stored in\nmetal containers or on metal shelves, or equipment that is itself metallic. In\nthat scenario, it's difficult to find a location for an RFID tag that won't suffer\nfrom shielding by the container. The case of water might seem less important, but\nkeep in mind that people are made mostly of water. RFID reading is often unreliable\nfor objects carried on a person, which are likely to be shielded from the reader\nby the water content of the body.</p><p>These problems are not just theoretical. WalMart is a major adopter of RFID inventory\ntechnology, and in early rollouts struggled with low successful read rates. Metal,\nmoisture (including damp cardboard boxes), antenna orientation, and multipath/interference\neffects could cause read failure rates as high as 33% when scanning a pallet of goods.\nLow read rates are mostly addressed by using RFID \"portals\" with multiple antennas.\nEight antennas used as an array greatly increase read rate, but at a cost of over\nten thousand dollars per portal system. Even so, WalMart seems to now target a\nsuccess rate of only 95% during bulk scanning.</p><p>95% might sound pretty good, but there are a lot of visibility applications where\na failure rate of even a couple percent is unacceptable. These mostly go by the\neuphemism \"high value goods,\" which depending on your career trajectory you may\nhave encountered in corporate expense and property policies. High-value goods\ntend to be items that are both attractive to theft and where theft has particularly\nsevere consequences. Classically, firearms and explosives. Throw in classified\nmaterial for good measure.</p><p>I wonder if Stevens was surprised by RuBee's market trajectory. He came out of\nthe healthcare industry and, it seems, originally developed RuBee for cold\nchain visibility... but, at least in retrospect, it's quite obvious that its\nmost compelling application is in the armory.</p><p>Because RuBee tags are small and largely immune to shielding by metals, you\ncan embed them directly in the frames of firearms, or as an aftermarket\nmodification you can mill out some space under the grip. RuBee tags in\nweapons will read reliably when they are stored in metal cases or on\nmetal shelving, as is often the case. They will even read reliably when a\nweapon is carried holstered, close to a person's body.</p><p>Since RuBee tags incorporate an active microcontroller, there are even more\npossibilities. Temperature logging is one thing, but firearm-embedded RuBee\ntags can incorporate an accelerometer (NIST-traceable, VAI likes to emphasize)\nand actually count the rounds fired.</p><p>Sidebar time: there is a long history of political hazard around \"smart guns.\"\nThe term \"smart gun\" is mostly used more specifically for firearms that\nidentify their user, for example by fingerprint authentication or detection of\nan RFID fob. The idea has become vague enough, though, that mention of a\nfirearm with any type of RFID technology embedded would probably raise the\nspecter of the smart gun to gun-rights advocates.</p><p>Further, devices embedded in firearms that count the number of\nrounds fired have been proposed for decades, if not a century, as a means of\naccountability. The holder of a weapon could, in theory, be required to\npositively account for every round fired. That could eliminate incidents of\nunreported use of force by police, for example. In practice I think this is\nless compelling than it sounds, simple counting of rounds leaves too many\nopportunities to fudge the numbers and conceal real-world use of a weapon as\nrange training, for example.</p><p>That said, the NRA has long been vehemently opposed to the incorporation of any sort of\ntechnology into weapons that could potentially be used as a means of state\ncontrol or regulation. The concern isn't completely unfounded; the state of\nNew Jersey did, for a time, have legislation that would have made user-identifying\n\"smart guns\" mandatory if they were commercially available. The result of\nthe NRA's strident lobbying is that no such gun has ever become commercially\navailable; \"smart guns\" have been such a political third rail that any firearms\nmanufacturer that dared to introduce one would probably face a boycott by most\ngun stores. For better or worse, a result of the NRA's powerful political\nadvocacy in this area is that the concept of embedding security or accountability\ntechnology into weapons has never been seriously pursued in the US. Even a\ntentative step in that direction can produce a huge volume of critical press\nfor everyone involved.</p><p>I bring this up because I think it explains some of why VAI seems a bit vague\nand cagey about the round-counting capabilities of their tags. They position it\nas purely a maintenance feature, allowing the armorer to keep accurate tabs on\nthe preventative maintenance schedule for each individual weapon (in armory\nenvironments, firearm users are often expected to report how many rounds\nthey fired for maintenance tracking reasons). The resistance of RuBee tags\nto concealment is only positioned as a deterrent to theft, although the idea\nof RuBee-tagged firearms creates obvious potential for security screening.\nProbably the most profitable option for VAI would be to promote RuBee-tagged\nfirearms as tool for enforcement of gun control laws, but this is\na political impossibility and bringing it up at all could cause significant\nreputational harm, especially with the government as a key customer. The result\nis marketing copy that is a bit odd, giving a set of capabilities that imply\nan application that is never mentioned.</p><p>VAI found an incredible niche with their arms-tracking application. Institutional\nusers of firearms, like the military, police, and security forces, are relatively\nprice-insensitive and may have strict accounting requirements. By the mid-'00s,\nVAI was into the long sales cycle of proposing the technology to the military.\nThat wasn't entirely unsuccessful. RuBee shot-counting weapon inventory tags were\nselected by the Naval Surface Warfare Center in 2010 for installation on SCAR\nand M4 rifles. That contract had a five-year term, it's unclear to me if it was\nrenewed. Military contracting opened quite a few doors to VAI, though, and\ncreated a commercial opportunity that they eagerly pursued.</p><p>Perhaps most importantly, weapons applications required an impressive round of\nsafety and compatibility testing. RuBee tags have the fairly unique distinction\nof military approval for direct attachment to ordnance, something called \"zero\nseparation distance\" as the tags do not require a minimum separation from\nhigh explosives. Central to that certification are findings of intrinsic safety\nof the tags (that they do not contain enough energy to trigger explosives) and\nthat the magnetic fields involved cannot convey enough energy to heat anything\nto dangerous temperatures.</p><p>That's not the only special certification that RuBee would acquire. The military\nhas a lot of firearms, but military procurement is infamously slow and mercurial.\nImproved weapon accountability is, almost notoriously, not a priority for the\nUS military which has often had stolen weapons go undetected until their later\nuse in crime. The Navy's interest in RuBee does not seem to have translated to\nmore widespread military applications.</p><p>Then you have police departments, probably the largest institutional owners of\nfirearms and a very lucrative market for technology vendors. But here we run\ninto the political hazard: the firearms lobby is very influential on police\ndepartments, as are police unions which generally oppose technical accountability\nmeasures. Besides, most police departments are fairly cash-poor and are not\nlikely to make a major investment in a firearms inventory system.</p><p>That leaves us with institutional security forces. And there is one category\nof security force that are particularly well-funded, well-equipped, and\nbeholden to highly R&amp;D-driven, almost pedantic standards of performance:\nthe protection forces of atomic energy facilities.</p><p>Protection forces at privately-operated atomic energy facilities, such as\ncivilian nuclear power plants, are subject to licensing and scrutiny by the\nNuclear Regulatory Commission. Things step up further at the many facilities\noperated by the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). Protection\nforces for NNSA facilities are trained at the Department of Energy's National\nTraining Center, at the former Manzano Base here in Albuquerque. Concern over\nadequate physical protection of NNSA facilities has lead Sandia National\nLaboratories to become one of the premier centers for R&amp;D in physical security.\nTeams of scientists and engineers have applied sometimes comical scientific rigor to \"guns,\ngates, and guards,\" the traditional articulation of physical security in the\nnuclear world.</p><p>That scope includes the evaluation of new technology for the management of\nprotection forces, which is why Oak Ridge National Laboratory launched an\nevaluation program for the RuBee tagging of firearms in their armory. The\nwhite paper on this evaluation is curiously undated, but citations \"retrieved 2008\"\nlead me to assume that the evaluation happened right around the middle of the\n'00s. At the time, VAI seems to have been involved in some ultimately unsuccessful\npartnership with Oracle, leading to the branding of the RuBee system as Oracle\nDot-Tag Server. The term \"Dot-Tag\" never occurs outside of very limited materials\naround the Oracle partnership, so I'm not sure if it was Oracle branding for\nRuBee or just some passing lark. In any case, Oracle's involvement seems to have\nmainly just been the use of the Oracle database for tracking inventory data---which\nwas naturally replaced by PostgreSQL at Oak Ridge.</p><p>The Oak Ridge trial apparently went well enough, and around the same time, the Pantex\nPlant in Texas launched an evaluation of RuBee for tracking classified tools.\nClassified tools are a tricky category, as they're often metallic and often stored\nin metallic cases. During the trial period, Pantex tagged a set of sample classified\ntools with RuBee tags and then transported them around the property, testing the\nability of the RuBee controllers to reliably detect them entering and exiting areas of\nbuildings. Simultaneously, Pantex evaluated the use of RuBee tags to track containers\nof \"chemical products\" through the manufacturing lifecycle. Both seem to have\nproduced positive results.</p><p>There are quite a few interesting and strange aspects of the RuBee system, a\nresult of its purpose-built Visibility Network nature. A RuBee controller can have\nmultiple antennas that it cycles through. RuBee tags remain in a deep-sleep mode\nfor power savings until they detect a RuBee carrier during their periodic wake\ncycle. When a carrier is detected, they fully wake and listen for traffic. A\nRuBee controller can send an interrogate message and any number of tags can respond,\nwith an interesting and novel collision detection algorithm used to ensure\nreliable reading of a large number of tags.</p><p>The actual RuBee protocol is quite simple, and can also be referred to as IEEE 1902.1\nsince the decision of VAI to put it through the standards process. Packets are\nsmall and contain basic addressing info, but they can also contain arbitrary payload in both directions,\nperfect for data loggers or sensors. RuBee tags are identified by something that VAI\noddly refers to as an \"IP address,\" causing some confusion over whether or not VAI\nuses IP over 1902.1. They don't, I am confident saying after reading a whole lot of\ndocuments. RuBee tags, as standard, have three different 4-byte addresses. VAI refers\nto these as \"IP, subnet, and MAC,\"  but these names are more like analogies.\nReally, the \"IP address\" and \"subnet\" are both configurable arbitrary addresses,\nwith the former intended for unicast traffic and the latter for broadcast. For example,\nyou would likely give each asset a unique IP address, and use subnet addresses for\ncategories or item types. The subnet address allows a controller to interrogate for\nevery item within that category at once. The MAC address is a fixed, non-configurable\naddress derived from the tag's serial number. They're all written in the formats\nwe associate with IP networks, dotted-quad notation, as a matter of convenience.</p><p>And that's about it as far as the protocol specification, besides of course the\nphysical details which are a 131,072 Hz carrier, 1024 Hz data clock, either ASK\nor BPSK modulation. The specification also describes an interesting mode called\n\"clip,\" in which a set of multiple controllers interrogate in exact synchronization\nand all tags then reply in exact synchronization. Somewhat counter-intuitively,\nbecause of the ability of RuBee controllers to separate out multiple simultaneous\ntag transmissions using an anti-collision algorithm based on random phase shifts\nby each tag, this is ideal. It allows a room, say an armory, full of RuBee\ncontrollers to rapidly interrogate the entire contents of the room. I think this\nfeature may have been added after the Oak Ridge trials...</p><p>RuBee is quite slow, typically 1,200 baud, so inventorying a large number of assets\ncan take a while (Oak Ridge found that their system could only collect data on 2-7\ntags per second per controller). But it's so robust that it an achieve a 100% read\nrate in some very challenging scenarios. Evaluation by the DoE and the military\nproduced impressive results. You can read, for example, of a military experiment in\nwhich a RuBee antenna embedded in a roadway reliably identified rifles secured in\nsteel containers in passing Humvees.</p><p>Paradoxically, then, one of the benefits of RuBee in the military/defense context\nis that it is also  to receive. Here is RuBee's most interesting trick:\nsomewhat oversimplified, the strength of an electrical radio signal goes as 1/r,\nwhile the strength of a magnetic field goes as 1/r^3. RuBee equipment is optimized,\nby antenna design, to produce a minimal electrical field. The result is that RuBee\ntags can very reliably be contacted at short range (say, around ten feet), but are\nvirtually impossible to contact or even detect at ranges over a few hundred feet.\nTo the security-conscious buyer, this is a huge feature. RuBee tags are highly\nresistant to communications or electronic intelligence collection.</p><p>Consider the logical implications of tagging the military's rifles. With\nconventional RFID, range is limited by the size and sensitivity of the antenna.\nParticularly when tags are incidentally powered by a nearby reader, an adversary\nwith good equipment can detect RFID tags at very long range. VAI heavily references\na 2010 DEFCON presentation, for example, that demonstrated detection of RFID tags\nat a range of 80 miles. One imagines that opportunistic detection by satellite is feasible for\na state intelligence agency. That means that your rifle asset tracking is also\nrevealing the movements of soldiers in the field, or at least providing a way to\ndetect their approach.</p><p>Most RuBee tags have their transmit power reduced by configuration, so even the\nmaximum 100' range of the protocol is not achievable. VAI suggests that typical\nRuBee tags cannot be detected by radio direction finding equipment at ranges\nbeyond 20', and that this range can be made shorter by further reducing transmit\npower.</p><p>Once again, we have caught the attention of the Department of Energy. Because of\nthe short range of RuBee tags, they have generally been approved as not representing\na COMSEC or TEMPEST hazard to secure facilities. And that brings us back to the\nvery beginning: why does the DoE use a specialized, technically interesting, and\nlargely unique radio protocol to fulfill such a basic function as nagging people\nthat have their phones? Because RuBee's security properties have allowed it to be\napproved for use adjacent to and inside of secure facilities. A RuBee tag, it is\nthought, cannot be turned into a listening device because the intrinsic range\nlimitation of magnetic coupling will make it impossible to communicate with the\ntag from outside of the building. It's a lot like how infrared microphones still\nsee some use in secure facilities, but so much more interesting!</p><p>VAI has built several different product lines around RuBee, with names like\nArmory 20/20 and Shot Counting Allegro 20/20 and Store 20/20. The founder started\nhis career in eye health, remember. None of them are that interesting, though.\nThey're all pretty basic CRUD applications built around polling multiple RuBee\ncontrollers for tags in their presence.</p><p>And then there's the \"Alert 20/20 DoorGuard:\" a metal pedestal with a RuBee\ncontroller and audio announcement module, perfect for detecting government\ncell phones.</p><div><p>I put a lot of time into writing this, and I hope that you enjoy reading\nit. If you can spare a few dollars, consider <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/jbcrawford\">supporting me on\nko-fi</a>. You'll receive an occasional extra,\nsubscribers-only post, and defray the costs of providing artisanal, hand-built\nworld wide web directly from Albuquerque, New Mexico.</p></div><p>One of the strangest things about RuBee is that it's hard to tell if it's still\na going concern. VAI's website has a press release section, where nothing has been\nposted since 2019. The whole website feels like it was last revised even longer\nago. When RuBee was newer, back in the '00s, a lot of industry journals covered it\nwith headlines like \"the new RFID.\" I think VAI was optimistic that RuBee could\ndisplace all kinds of asset tracking applications, but despite some special\ncertifications in other fields (e.g. approval to use RuBee controllers and tags\naround pacemakers in surgical suites), I don't think RuBee has found much success\noutside of military applications.</p><p>RuBee's resistance to shielding is impressive, but RFID read rates have improved\nconsiderably with new DSP techniques, antenna array designs, and the generally\nreduced cost of modern RFID equipment. RuBee's unique advantages, its security\nproperties and resistance to even intentional exfiltration, are interesting but\nnot worth much money to buyers other than the military.</p><p>So that's the fate of RuBee and VAI: defense contracting. As far as I can tell,\nRuBee and VAI are about as vital as they have ever been, but RuBee is now installed\nas just one part of general defense contracts around weapons systems, armory\nmanagement, and process safety and security. IEEE standardization has opened the\ndoor to use of RuBee by federal contractors under license, and indeed, Lockheed\nMartin is repeatedly named as a licensee, as are firearms manufacturers with military\ncontracts like Sig Sauer.</p><p>Besides, RuBee continues to grow closer to the DoE. In 2021, VAI appointed Lisa\nGordon-Hagerty to it board of directors. Gordon-Hagerty was undersecretary of\nEnergy and had lead the NNSA until the year before. This year, the New Hampshire\nSmall Business Development Center wrote a glowing profile of VAI. They described\nit as a 25-employee company with a goal of hitting $30 million in annual revenue in the\nnext two years.</p><p>Despite the outdated website, VAI claims over 1,200 RuBee sites in service. I wonder\nhow many of those are Alert 20/20 DoorGuards? Still, I do believe there are military\nweapons inventory systems currently in use. RuBee probably has a bright future, as a\nniche technology for a niche industry. If nothing else, they have legacy installations\nand intellectual property to lean on. A spreadsheet of VAI-owned patents on RuBee,\nwith nearly 200 rows, encourages would-be magnetically coupled visibility network inventors\nnot to go it on their own. I just wish I could get my hands on a controller....</p>",

      "content": "<div data-component=\"text-block\"><p>The island of Hokkaido has long been an agricultural powerhouse – now Japan is investing billions to turn it into a global hub for advanced semiconductors.</p><p>More than half of Japan's dairy produce comes from Hokkaido, the northernmost of its main islands. In winter, it's a wonderland of ski resorts and ice-sculpture festivals; in summer, fields bloom with bands of lavender, poppies and sunflowers.</p><p>These days, cranes are popping up across the island – building factories, research centres and universities focused on technology. It's part of Japan's boldest industrial push in a generation: an attempt to reboot the country's chip-making capabilities and reshape its economic future.</p><p>Locals say that beyond the cattle and tourism, Hokkaido has long lacked other industries. There's even a saying that those who go there do so only to leave.</p><p>But if the government succeeds in turning Hokkaido into Japan's answer to Silicon Valley - or \"Hokkaido Valley\", as some have begun to call it - the country could become a new contender in the $600bn (£458bn) race to supply the world's computer chips.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\"><p>At the heart of the plan is Rapidus, a little-known company backed by the government and some of Japan's biggest corporations including Toyota, Softbank and Sony.</p><p>Born out of a partnership with IBM, it has raised billions of dollars to build Japan's first cutting-edge chip foundry in decades.</p><p>The government has invested $12bn in the company, so that it can build a massive semiconductor factory or \"fab\" in the small city of Chitose.</p><p>In selecting the Hokkaido location, Rapidus CEO Atsuyoshi Koike points to Chitose's water, electricity infrastructure and its natural beauty. </p><p>Mr Koike oversaw the fab design, which will be completely covered in grass to harmonise with Hokkaido's landscape, he told the BBC.</p><p>Local authorities have also flagged the region as being at lower risk of earthquakes compared to other potential sites in Japan.</p><p>A key milestone for Rapidus came with the delivery of an extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) system from the Dutch company ASML.</p><p>The high-tech machinery helped bring about Rapidus' biggest accomplishment yet earlier this year – the successful production of prototype two nanometre (2nm) transistors.</p><p>These ultra-thin chips are at the cutting edge of semiconductor technology and allow devices to run faster and more efficiently.</p><p>It's a feat only rival chip makers TSMC and Samsung have accomplished. Intel is not pursuing 2nm, it is leapfrogging from 7nm straight to 1.8nm.</p><p>\"We succeeded in manufacturing the 2nm prototype for the first time in Japan, and at an unprecedented speed in Japan and globally,\" Mr Koike said.</p><p>He credits the IBM partnership for helping achieve the breakthrough.</p><p>Tie-ups with global companies are essential to acquiring the technology needed for this level of chips, he added.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\"><p>Rapidus is confident that it is on track to mass produce 2nm chips by 2027. The challenge will be achieving the yield and quality that is needed to survive in an incredibly competitive market – the very areas where Taiwan and South Korea have pulled ahead.</p><p>TSMC for example has achieved incredible success in mass production, but making high-end chips is costly and technically demanding.</p><p>In a 2024 report, the Asean+3 Macroeconomic Research Office highlighted that although Rapidus is receiving government subsidies and consortium members are contributing funds: \"The financing falls short of the expected 5 trillion yen ($31.8bn; £24.4bn) needed to start mass production.\"</p><p>The Center for Security and International Studies (CSIS) has previously said: \"Rapidus has no experience in manufacturing advanced chips, and to date there is no indication that it will be able to access actual know-how for such an endeavour from companies with the requisite experience (ie TSMC and Samsung).\"</p><p>Finding customers may also be a challenge – Samsung and TSMC have established relationships with global companies that have been buying their chips for years.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\"><p>Nevertheless, Japan's government is pouring money into the chip industry - $27bn between 2020 and early 2024 - a larger commitment relative to its gross domestic product (GDP) than the US made through the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62482141\">Biden-era CHIPS Act</a>.</p><p>In late 2024, Tokyo unveiled a $65bn package for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and semiconductors that could further support Rapidus's expansion plans.</p><p>This comes after decades of decline. Forty years ago Japan made more than half of the world's semiconductors. Today, it produces just over 10%.</p><p>Many point to US-Japan trade tensions in the 1980s as a turning point.</p><p>Naoyuki Yoshino, professor emeritus at Keio University, said Japan lost out in the technology stakes to Taiwan and South Korea in the 1980s, leaving domestic companies weaker.</p><p>Unlike its rivals, Japan failed to sustain subsidies to keep its chipmakers competitive.</p><p>But Mr Koike says that mentality has changed.</p><p>\"The [national] government and local government are united in supporting our industry to revive once again.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\"><p>Japan's broader economic challenges also loom large. Its population is shrinking while the number of elderly citizens continues to surge. That has determined the national budget for years and has contributed to slowing growth.</p><p>More than a third of its budget now goes to social welfare for the elderly, and that squeezes the money available for research, education and technology, Prof Yoshino says.</p><p>Japan also faces a severe shortage of semiconductor engineers – an estimated 40,000 people in the coming years.</p><p>Rapidus is partnering with Hokkaido University and others to train new workers, but agrees it will have to rely heavily on foreigners, at a time when public support for workers coming into the country for employment is low.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\"><p>The government's push is already attracting major global players.</p><p>TSMC is producing 12–28nm chips in Kumamoto, on the south-western island of Kyushu - a significant step for Japan, even if it lags behind the company's cutting-edge production in Taiwan. </p><p>The expansion has transformed the local economy, attracting suppliers, raising wages, and leading to infrastructure and service developments. </p><p>Japan's broader chip revival strategy appears to be following a playbook: establish a \"fab\", and an entire ecosystem will tend to follow. </p><p>TSMC started building a second plant on Kyushu in October this year, which is due to begin production by the end of 2027. </p><p>Beyond Rapidus and TSMC, local players like Kioxia and Toshiba are also getting government backing.</p><p>Kioxia has expanded fabs in Yokkaichi and Kitakami with state funds and Toshiba has built one in Ishikawa. Meanwhile, ROHM has been officially designated as a company that provides critical products under Tokyo's economic security framework.</p><p>American memory chipmaker Micron will also receive $3.63bn in subsidies from the Japanese government to grow facilities in Hiroshima, while Samsung is building a research and development facility in Yokohama.</p><p>Hokkaido is seeing similar momentum. Chipmaking equipment companies ASML and Tokyo Electron have both opened offices in Chitose, off the back of Rapidus building a production facility there.</p><p>\"This will make a form of 'global ecosystem',\" Mr Koike says, \"where we work together to be able to produce semiconductors that contribute to the world.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\"><p>Mr Koike said Rapidus's key selling point would be - as its name suggests - an ability to produce custom chips faster than competitors, rather than competing directly with other players.</p><p>\"TSMC leads the world, with Intel and Samsung close behind. Our edge is speed - we can produce and deliver chips three to four times faster than anyone else. That speed is what gives us an edge in the global semiconductor race,\" Mr Koike said.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\"><p>Global demand for chips is surging with the rise of AI, while Japan's automakers -  still recovering from pandemic-era supply shocks - are pressing for more reliable, domestically or regionally sourced production across the entire supply chain, from raw materials to finished chips.</p><p>Securing control over chip manufacturing is being seen as a national security priority, both in Japan and elsewhere, as recent trade frictions and geopolitical tensions between China and Taiwan raise concerns around the risks of relying on foreign suppliers.</p><p>\"We'd like to provide products from Japan once again – products that are powerful and with great new value,\" Mr Koike said.</p><p>For Japan's government, investing in Rapidus is a high-stakes gamble to revive its semiconductor industry and more broadly its tech power.</p><p>And some analysts say it may be the country's best chance to build a domestic ecosystem to supply advanced chips to its many manufacturers, and one day become a formidable challenger in the global market.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\"><p><i>Additional reporting by Jaltson Akkanath Chummar</i></p></div>",

And I’m staring at the bug leaderboard, genuinely sad that Monday means going back to regular work. Which is weird because I  regular work. But fixit weeks have a special place in my heart.</p><p>Once a quarter or so, my org with ~45 software engineers stops all regular work for a week. That means no roadmap work, no design work, no meetings or standups.</p><p>Instead, we fix the small things that have been annoying us and our users:</p><ul><li>an error message that’s been unclear for two years</li><li>a weird glitch when the user scrolls and zooms at the same time</li><li>a test which runs slower than it should, slowing down CI for everyone</li></ul><p>The rules are simple: 1) no bug should take over 2 days and 2) all work should focus on either small end-user bugs/features or developer productivity.</p><p>We also have a “points system” for bugs and a leaderboard showing how many points people have. And there’s a promise of t-shirts for various achievements: first bug fix, most points, most annoying bug, etc. It’s a simple structure, but it works surprisingly well.</p><p>Some stats from this fixit:</p><ul><li>4 was the median number of bugs closed per person</li><li>12 was maximum number of bugs closed by one person</li></ul><p>Here are some of the highlights (sadly many people in my org work in internal-facing things so I cannot share their work!):</p><ul><li>I closed a <a href=\"https://github.com/google/perfetto/issues/154\">feature request</a> from 2021! It’s a classic fixit issue: a small improvement that never bubbled to the priority list. It took me  to implement. One day for something that sat there for . And it’s going to provide a small but significant boost to every user’s experience of Perfetto.</li><li>My colleague made this <a href=\"https://github.com/google/perfetto/pull/3736\">small change</a> to improve team productivity. Just ~25 lines of code in a GitHub Action to avoid every UI developer taking two extra clicks to open the CI’s build. The response from the team speaks for itself:</li></ul><ul><li>I also fixed <a href=\"https://github.com/google/perfetto/issues/713\">this</a> issue to provide a new “amalgamated” version of our SDK, allowing it to be easily integrated into projects. It’s one of those things that might be the difference between someone deciding to use us or not, but building it took just one hour of work (with liberal use of AI!).</li></ul><h3>For the product: craftsmanship and care</h3><p>I care deeply about any product I work on. That means asking big questions like “what should we build?” and “how do we make this fast?” But it also means asking smaller questions: “is this error message actually helpful?” or “would I be frustrated using this?”</p><p>A hallmark of any good product is attention to detail: a sense that someone has thought things through, and the pieces fit together to make a cohesive whole. And the opposite is true: a product with rough edges might be tolerated if there are no alternatives, but there will always be a sense of frustration and “I wish I could use something else”.</p><p>Fixits are a great chance to work on exactly those details that separate good products from great ones. The small things your average user might not consciously notice, but absolutely will notice if they’re wrong.</p><h3>For the individual: doing, not thinking</h3><p>I sometimes miss the feeling I had earlier in my career when I got to just fix things. See something broken, fix it, ship it the same day.</p><p>The more senior you get in a big company, the less you do that. Most of your time becomes thinking about what to build next, planning quarters ahead, navigating tradeoffs and getting alignment.</p><p>Fixits give me that early-career feeling back. You see the bug, you fix it, you ship it, you close it, you move on. There’s something deeply satisfying about work where the question isn’t “what should we do?” but rather “can I make this better?” And you get to answer that question multiple times in a week.</p><h3>For the team: morale and spirit</h3><p>Having 40 people across two time zones all fixing bugs together adds a whole other dimension.</p><p>The vibe of the office is different: normally we’re all heads-down on different projects, but during fixit the team spirit comes out strong. People share their bug fixes in chat rooms, post before-and-after screenshots and gather around monitors to demo a new feature or complain about a particularly nasty bug they’re wrestling.</p><p>The leaderboard amplifies this energy. There’s a friendly sense of competition as people try and balance quick wins with meatier bugs they can share stories about.</p><p>There’s also a short update every morning about how the previous day went:</p><ul><li>how many people have fixed at least one bug</li><li>how many different products we’ve fixed things in</li><li>who’s currently at the top of the leaderboard</li></ul><p>All of this creates real momentum, and people feel magnetically pulled into the effort.</p><p>I’ve participated in 6 fixits over the years and I’ve learned a lot about what makes them successful. Here are a few things that matter more than you’d think.</p><p>Most of what makes a fixit work happens before the week even starts.</p><p>All year round, we encourage everyone to tag bugs as “good fixit candidates” as they encounter them. Then the week before fixit, each subteam goes through these bugs and sizes them:</p><ul><li>small (less than half a day)</li><li>large (less than 2 days).</li></ul><p>They assign points accordingly: 1, 2, or 4.</p><p>We also create a shortlist of high-priority bugs we really want fixed. People start there and move to the full list once those are done. This pre-work is critical: it prevents wasting day one with people aimlessly searching for bugs to fix.</p><p>In one of our early fixits, someone picked up what looked like a straightforward bug. It should have been a few hours, maybe half a day. But it turned into a rabbit hole. Dependencies on other systems, unexpected edge cases, code that hadn’t been touched in years.</p><p>They spent the entire fixit week on it. And then the entire week after fixit trying to finish it. What started as a bug fix turned into a mini project.\nThe work was valuable! But they missed the whole point of a fixit. No closing bugs throughout the week. No momentum. No dopamine hits from shipping fixes. Just one long slog.</p><p>That’s why we have the 2-day hard limit now. If something is ballooning, cut your losses. File a proper bug, move it to the backlog, pick something else. The limit isn’t about the work being worthless - it’s about keeping fixit feeling like fixit.</p><p>We didn’t always do fixits with 40 people. Early on, this wasn’t an org-wide effort, just my subteam of 7 people. It worked okay: bugs got fixed and there was a sense of pride in making the product better. But it felt a bit hollow: in the bigger picture of our org, it didn’t feel like anyone else noticed or cared.</p><p>At ~40 people, it feels like a critical mass that changes things significantly. The magic number is probably somewhere between 7 and 40. And it probably varies based on the team. But whatever the number is, the collective energy matters. If you’re trying this with 5 people, it might still be worth doing, but it probably won’t feel the same.</p><p>The points and leaderboard are more than a gimmick, but they have to be handled carefully.</p><ul><li><strong>Points are coarse, not precise</strong>: We deliberately use 1/2/4 points instead of trying to measure exact effort; the goal is “roughly right and fun”, not accurate performance evaluation.</li><li><strong>Celebrate breadth, not just volume.</strong> We give t-shirts for things like “first bug fix”, “most annoying bug fixed”, not just “most points”. That keeps newer or less experienced engineers engaged.</li><li> A shout-out in the daily update or an internal post often matters more than the actual t-shirt.</li><li><strong>No attachment to perf reviews</strong>. This is important: fixit scores do  feed into performance reviews. The moment they do, people will start gaming it and the good vibe will die.</li></ul><p>We’ve had very little “gaming” in practice. Social norms do a good job of keeping people honest and 40 is still small enough that there’s a sense of “loyalty to the cause” from folks.</p><p>The big challenge with fixits is context switching. Constantly changing what you’re working on means constantly figuring out new parts of the codebase, thinking about new problems.</p><p>AI tools have mitigated this in a big way. The code they write is less important than their ability to quickly search through relevant files and summarize what needs to change. They might be right or wrong, but having that starting point really reduces the cognitive load. And sometimes (rarely) they one-shot a fix.</p><p>This <a href=\"https://github.com/google/perfetto/pull/3774\">docs change</a> was a perfect example of the above: an update to our docs which catches out new contributors and AI was able to one-shot the fix.</p><p>On the other hand, in my <a href=\"https://github.com/google/perfetto/pull/3780\">record page change</a> it was more useful for giving me prototypes of what the code should look like and I had to put in significant effort to correct the bad UX it generated and its tendency to “over-generate” code. Even so, it got me to the starting line much faster.</p><h2>Criticisms of fixits (and why I still like them anyway)</h2><p>I’ve definitely come across people who question whether fixits are actually a good idea. Some of the criticisms are fair but overall I still think it’s worth it.</p><h3>“Isn’t this just admitting you ignore bugs the rest of the time?”</h3><p>To some extent, yes, this is an admission of the fact that “papercut” bugs are underweighted in importance, both by managers and engineers. It’s all too easy to tunnel on making sure a big project is successful and easier to ignore the small annoyances for users and the team.</p><p>Fixits are a way of counterbalancing that somewhat and saying “actually those bugs matter too”. That’s not to say we don’t fix important bugs during regular work; we absolutely do. But fixits recognize that there should be a place for handling the “this is slightly annoying but never quite urgent enough” class of problems.</p><p>The whole reason we started fixits in the first place is that we observed these bugs never get actioned. Given this, I think carving out some explicit time for it is a good thing.</p><h3>“Isn’t it a waste to pause roadmap work for a whole week?”</h3><p>It’s definitely a tradeoff. 40 engineer-weeks is a  of manpower and there’s an argument to be made it should be used for actually solving roadmap problems.</p><p>But I think this underweights the importance of polish of products to users. We’ve consistently found that the product feels noticeably better afterward (including positive comments from users about things they notice!) and there’s a sense of  in having a well-functioning product.</p><p>Also, many of the team productivity fixes compound (faster tests, clearer errors, smoother workflows) so the benefits carry forward well beyond the week itself.</p><p>I agree that a full week might be too much for tiny teams or startups. But you can still borrow the idea in smaller chunks: a “fixit Friday” once a month, or a 2-day mini-fixit each quarter. The core idea is the same: protected, collective time to fix the stuff people complain about but no one schedules time to address.</p><h2>Fixits are good for the soul</h2><p>The official justification for fixits is that they improve product quality and\ndeveloper productivity. And of course they do this.</p><p>But the unofficial reason I love them is simpler: it just feels good to fix things. It takes me back to a simpler time, and putting thought and attention into building great products is a big part of my ethos for how software engineering should be done. I wouldn’t want to work like that all the time. But I also wouldn’t want to work somewhere that never makes time for it.</p>",

      "content": "<p>In our daily lives empathy and humility are obvious virtues we aspire to. They keep our egos in check. Less obvious is that they’re practical skills in the workplace, too. I think, for developers and technical leaders in particular, that the absence of ego is the best way to further our careers and do great work.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/theory-of-knowledge/202105/what-is-the-ego\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener external\">the simplest of terms</a> the ego is the characteristic of personhood that enables us to practice self-reflection, self-awareness, and accountability for the actions or decisions we take.</p><p>However, the ego also motivates us to reframe our perception of the world in whatever way keeps us centered in it. Each of us is perpetually driven to justify our place in the world. This <em>constant self-justification</em> is like an engine that idles for our entire lives, and it requires constant fine-tuning. When it runs amok this is what we call a “big” ego.</p><h2>Breaking News! Developers Have Egos!</h2><p>I’m not thinking only of the 10x engineer stereotype, although I’ve worked with such folks in the past. Ego is more nuanced than that. Besides the most arrogant developer in the room throwing their weight around, our egos manifest in hundreds of ways that are much harder to detect.</p><p>As developers we’re more susceptible to letting our egos run free. The nature of our work is so technical that to others it can seem obscure, arcane, or even magical. Sometimes we don’t do enough to actively dispel that notion—and just like that half the work of self-justification is already done for us.</p><p>Very often it’s not intentional. The simplest example is the overuse of jargon and acronyms. We all do it, but as <a href=\"https://clearleft.com/thinking/letters-of-exclusion\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener external\">Jeremy Keith explains</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Still, I get why initialisms run rampant in technical discussions. You can be sure that most discussions of particle physics would be incomprehensible to outsiders, not necessarily because of the concepts, but because of the terminology.</p></blockquote><p>Simply mashing a few letters together can be empowering for ourselves while being exclusionary for others. It’s an artifact—albeit a small one—of our egos. We know what the technobabble means. Our justified place in the universe is maintained.</p><p>Sometimes we express our egos more deliberately. Developers have a clear tendency towards gatekeeping. For most, it’s an honest mistake. There’s a fine line between holding others to a certain expectation versus actively keeping people on the outside. When we see ourselves doing this we can correct it easily enough.</p><p>Sadly there are developers who seemingly like to gatekeep. They get to feel like wizards in their towers with their dusty books and potions. But, it’s actually self-limiting. Gatekeeping by definition means you’re fixed in place and never moving, standing guard for eternity.</p><p>My point is our egos can “leak” in so many ways that it takes diligence to catch it let alone correct it. The following is a short, incomplete list of typical statements we as developers might say or hear at work. If you parse them more precisely each one is an attempt at self-justification:</p><ul role=\"list\"><li>“That’s the way we’ve always done it.”</li><li>“It’s not that complicated! You just…”</li><li>“Yeah, I should be able to finish this in a day.”</li><li>“This legacy codebase is an absolute disaster.”</li><li>“Assign it to me. Nobody else will be able to fix it.”</li><li>“You can’t be a senior dev. You don’t know anything about…”</li><li>“Ugh, our morning standup is so useless.”</li><li>“This feature is too important to assign to the junior dev.”</li><li>“We should start using this new tool in our pipeline.”</li><li>“We should never use that new tool in our pipeline.”</li></ul><h2>Everything Is Bigger Than You</h2><p>The ego is concerned with the self but very easily becomes something harmful in the absence of new information or context. Indeed, the ego nudges us to self-justify so much that one could argue it actively  new information when left unchecked.</p><p>You may have read one of the example statements above with some familiarity and thought, “But what if I’m right?”</p><p>To which I’d say: OK, but should that be your default stance? Why might you feel the need to immediately start a conversation with a self-justification? There are ways to adjust our approach, make our points, and accept new information all at the same time.</p><p>In any interaction—be it a meeting, Slack thread, or water cooler conversation—we must remember that <strong>the matter at hand is bigger than us in ways we don’t yet understand</strong>.</p><p>To make these concepts more actionable I find it simpler to define them in terms of the purposes they serve. Specifically…</p><ol role=\"list\"><li>Empathy is how we .</li><li>Humility is how we <em>allow information to change our behavior</em>.</li></ol><p>This framing also helps remind us what empathy and humility . It’s not about putting yourself in another’s shoes, as the saying goes. It’s not about being submissive or a pushover. It’s not about altruism or self-sacrifice. We can easily practice empathy and humility without it ever being at our own expense.</p><h2>The Pursuit Of Information</h2><p>I don’t know about you but I go to work to solve problems, be creative, and build shit. I can’t think of a single instance where an unruly ego solved anything I’ve worked on. Ego just makes an existing challenge worse. Solutions require information I don’t have yet.</p><p>Empathy and humility are usually top of mind during situations of pain or distress, but they’re really aspects of emotional intelligence that should be activated at all times. Once you adjust your mindset to treat them as basic tools for the  you’ll see opportunities to leverage them everywhere.</p><p>Developers can apply this mindset with almost anybody they come into contact with. Fellow developers, naturally. But also less technical teammates (e.g., QAs, designers, product owners, stakeholders) who have their own unique skills and context that our success depends on. And of course our users should be at the center of every problem we’re working to solve. Lastly, even executives and upper management have some insight to offer if you dare (<a href=\"https://matthogg.fyi/how-to-care-about-your-job-when-it-doesnt-care-about-you/\">but only up to a certain point</a>).</p><h2>“Be Curious, Not Judgmental”</h2><p>I’ve been waiting years for a chance to work <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Lasso\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener external\">Ted Lasso</a> into one of my essays. Today’s the day, readers.</p><p>The titular character is such an archetype for leadership that my jaw hit the floor when I first watched the show. The example Ted sets has spawned <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=ted+lasso+leadership\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener external\">countless think pieces about leadership and management</a>. Suffice it to say he exhibits all of my principles over the series’ 34 episodes. He’s empathy and humility sporting a mustache. He’s the absence of ego personified.</p><p>I highly recommend watching the show but to get a taste this 5 minute clip is worth your time. This is the famous “darts scene”…</p><p>There’s a common and derisive attitude that qualities like empathy or humility are signs of weakness. You have to get all up in your feelings. Ew! But they require enormous reserves of strength, patience, and determination. It’s those who follow their egos who are weak.</p><p>Letting your ego take control is the easiest thing in the world. Just ask any toddler throwing a temper tantrum. Resisting those impulses and remaining calm, on the other hand, has been a virtue humanity has aspired to for thousands of years. As the Roman emperor and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener external\">Stoic</a> philosopher <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener external\">Marcus Aurelius</a> wrote: “The nearer a man comes to a calm mind, the closer he is to strength.”</p><h2>You’re Neither Ted Lasso Nor A Roman Emperor</h2><p>The practice of empathy, humility, and keeping your ego in check will . The feedback I’ve received the most from my coworkers is that I’m extraordinarily calm and even-keeled in any situation—even situations where I’d be right to freak out.</p><p>Is that just naturally my personality? Maybe in part, but <em>remaining calm is a choice</em>. I’m actively choosing to favor solutions over my own ego. To my colleagues past and present I confess to you now that any time you’ve seen me calm, cool, and collected I was very likely .</p><p>If this sounds like a lot of work you might be wondering if it’s worth it. I think it is. At the very least your coworkers and colleagues will like you better. That’s no small thing.</p><p>In all seriousness, the positive feedback I get most about the developers I manage is when they’ve demonstrated empathy and humility while dialing back their egos. This is because they’re people we can work with—literally. Nobody wants to work with a narcissist or a rock star. Nobody is materially impressed by <a href=\"https://matthogg.fyi/developers-your-job-is-not-to-write-code/\">how many lines of code we wrote</a>, or how fast we wrote it.</p><p>When people want to work with us—or even look forward to it—that means we have trust and respect. We’ll be on proper footing for working effectively as a group to solve problems. For developers this looks like coaching a junior developer, hopping on a quick call to pair with somebody, or understanding the business value of the next backlog item. For leaders this looks like people who feel empowered to do their work, who can proactively identify issues, or who can rally and adapt when circumstances change.</p><p>Anybody can do this! I can’t think of any other career advice that’s as universal as empathy and humility. Everybody is capable of, at any point in their lives, small yet impactful improvements.</p><p>So remember—watch your ego and look for opportunities to leverage empathy and humility in the pursuit of information so that you can solve problems together.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://matthogg.fyi/my-working-principles-for-managing-ego-empathy-and-humility/\">my next essay on this subject</a> I’ll get into the practical. What I like about this advice is that, while there’s much we can do, we don’t have to do it all to see some benefit. We can pick and choose and try something out. We can take your time and grow. Nobody’s perfect, not even Ted Lasso. Even if we take after a character like <a href=\"https://ted-lasso.fandom.com/wiki/Roy_Kent\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener external\">Roy Kent</a> we can still call that a win. Just watch the show, OK?</p>",

These fuzzy, diminutive creatures, complete with a stare some have described as <a href=\"https://eviemagazine.substack.com/i/169239251/the-pazuzu-connection\">demonic</a>, became truly inescapable over this past summer. Everywhere I turned, from the airport to the mall to the bathroom at my below-minimum-wage job, Labubus followed, staring at me ominously from backpacks and keychains.</p><p>Labubus began innocently enough, originating in 2015 <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/06/18/g-s1-72939/what-is-labubu-pop-mart-explained#:~:text=Before%20they%20became%20highly%20sought,and%20often%20playfully%20teases%20him.\">from a picture book series</a> by Kasing Lung before they were made into toys. However, after slowly gaining traction throughout 2024 and early 2025, Labubus <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/21/us/labubu-doll-plushie-pop-mart-dg\">exploded in popularity</a> over the summer, flying off store shelves around the world. <a href=\"https://www.aol.com/labubu-dolls-selling-insane-prices-131633116.html\">Resale prices skyrocketed</a> as demand rose and they became harder to come across, to the point where some people instead opted to knowingly shell out money to buy fake Labubus, affectionately referred to as “<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/labubu-knockoff-lafufu-monsters-cost-counterfeit-fake-pop-mart-doll-2025-5\">Lafufus</a>.” </p><p>This traction, however, was short-lived. While in the summer you might have had to spend $200 on a Labubu you could get your hands on one, today I scroll my feed and find microinfluencers promoting genuineLabubus for $30 on TikTok Shop. They’re just not hard to find anymore. Combined with the fact that the <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/9992.HK/\">stock price of Pop Mart</a> — the company behind Labubus — is down nearly 35% (at the time of writing) since its peak in August 2025, it’s clear that Labubus are on the downswing. </p><p>Of course, Labubus are not alone in this fall from grace; fads have <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2015/04/04/397107966/pondering-the-popularity-of-the-pet-rock-and-other-fads\">always come and gone</a>. However, for as prominent as Labubus became, they seem to have faded from popular culture abnormally fast — even for a fad. Although it might seem anomalous, a clear pattern emerges when analyzing Labubus and the other massive trends that have appeared out of nowhere as of late. </p><p>In an era when people are more connected with each other via the internet and social media, trends can gain greater prevalence than ever, faster than ever. Simultaneously, in the era when most internet users <a href=\"https://nuvoodoo.com/2025/04/04/new-data-short-form-video-explodes-in-popularity/\">consume more short-form content</a> than anything else, our attention spans are <a href=\"https://time.com/3858309/attention-spans-goldfish/\">shorter than ever</a>, causing these trends to seemingly drop off the face of the Earth once people get bored of them.</p><p>Because of this, the internet has become a tapestry of many different digital phenomena, all so massive that they define the culture while they’re around, only to evacuate our minds as quickly as they appeared when it’s time to make room for the next trend. There’s no longer one single, massive cultural moment that sticks around for years in the vein of “<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/style/article/psy-gangnam-style-10-years-intl-hnk\">Gangnam Style</a>” or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/11/how-slime-crazed-kids-made-gunk-a-booming-business\">slime</a> or <a href=\"https://apnews.com/parenting-general-news-2d9d6c370ff641b6986c77ac951b3e88\">fidget spinners</a>. Instead, trends from various corners of the internet coalesce into one, and we get a mush of whatever “Labubu <a href=\"https://www.tasteofhome.com/article/dubai-chocolate/\">Dubai chocolate</a> ‘<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/14/nx-s1-5464947/season-7-love-island-usa-popularity\">Love Island</a>’ <a href=\"https://time.com/7305699/we-are-drinking-so-much-matcha-that-supplies-are-running-out/\">matcha</a><a href=\"https://crumblcookies.com/profiles/841c5770-40ba-11f0-9d85-b5b7ec4f4d74%3ACookies\">Benson Boone moonbeam ice cream cookie</a>” is supposed to be. It’s a complete mess.</p><p>And yet, as cringeworthy as the modern internet may be, it will never go back to the way it was before. The reality is that the internet has become decentralized; rather than people staying in one gigantic, unified group with shared trends and moments like they used to, users go their separate ways, with social media algorithms providing hyper-curated content that pushes users toward smaller groups with niche shared interests. It is from all of these individual, smaller communities that the many different trends we see today seem to merge into one.</p><p>But maybe this — the mess, the chaos, the mishmash — is a unifying cultural moment after all, just in a new form. The beauty of the internet has always been that people from so many different places and backgrounds are able to come together and interact with one another, so it only makes sense that our trends would follow the same pattern. Looking back on the big trends of the past, I’ve realized it’s unrealistic for everyone to come together and enjoy the same thing, especially when we constantly preach <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3271573/#:~:text=Individualism%20emphasizes%20personal%20freedom%20and,innovations%2C%20or%20great%20artistic%20achievements.\">individualism</a> and influencers push us to be ourselves. For the most part, the internet trends of before were not truly unifying; they were just bandwagons we all hopped onto for fear of missing out.</p><p>But now, in this new wave of internet trends, nobody has to miss out. We are free to enjoy what we want to enjoy while experiencing the trends and culture from sides of the internet we might have never ventured into otherwise. It’s not everyone being the same that brings us together, but rather the exchange of culture, information, interests and everything in-between that is facilitated by the internet. Labubus themselves are an example of this — despite initially only being prominent in China (where Pop Mart is headquartered), small interactions between internet users from there and the rest of the world allowed the culture barrier between them to be breached, eventually making Labubus a global phenomenon, even if only for a little while.</p><p>The decentralization of the internet and its trends has allowed the web to become a more unified, multicultural place — and it’s beautiful. Even if it’s a jumble, I will gladly take all of the “Labubu Dubai chocolate ‘Love Island’matcha Benson Boone moonbeam ice cream cookie” summers that the internet has to offer.</p>",

Several profiles online, that had pushed certain narratives are now being found to have been operating from outside the US.</p></div><p>The social media platform introduced a feature where one can see the country the account is based in. One has to head to an account and click on the date joined tab, which opens up onto a new page. This shows the country where that particular account is being operated from. While the feature was briefly removed after its introduction, it has now been added again, and both sides of the political spectrum are having a field day, calling out each other online.</p><h3>What to know about ‘American’ accounts based out of US</h3><p>The accounts being discussed here have pushed agendas within the US, and commented on US politics regularly. Many are also named to echo political movements, like some MAGA accounts.</p><p>However, these ‘political influencers’ have been found to be based outside the US, raising questions about the motives.</p><p>One profile going by 'MAGA NATION' with a follower count of over 392,000, is based out of eastern Europe. Similarly, ‘Dark Maga’ a page with over 15,000 followers is based out of Thailand. ‘MAGA Scope’ which boasts over 51,000 followers is actually operated out of Nigeria, and ‘America First’, an account with over 67,000 followers is based out of Bangladesh.</p><p>“At this time thousands of MAGA-aligned influencer accounts and large political pages that claim to be based in the U.S. are now being investigated and exposed with many of them traced to India, Nigeria, and other countries,” a news aggregator page on X noted.</p><p>It wasn't just on the MAGA side. An account going by ‘Ron Smith’ whose bio claims he's a ‘Proud Democrat’ and ‘Professional MAGA hunter’ is operated out of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kenya-uses-u-s-funded-antiterrorism-courts-for-political-crackdown-101757413804786.html\" data-vars-page-type=\"story\" data-vars-link-type=\"Manual\" data-vars-anchor-text=\"Kenya\">Kenya</a>. The account has over 52,000 followers.</p><p>‘Republicans against Trump’ an anti-<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/donald-trump\" data-vars-page-type=\"story\" data-vars-link-type=\"Manual\" data-vars-anchor-text=\"Donald Trump\">Donald Trump</a> page on X, which tries to push politics against MAGA, was reportedly operating out of Austria. While the location now shows US, X notes that the account location might not be accurate due to use of VPN. “The Anti-Trump account “Republicans Against Trump” which 1M followed has been identified as a non-American from Austria and is currently using a VPN to hide their location,” a page said, making note of this.</p><p>‘Republicans against Trump’ has over 978,000 followers.</p><p>On a side note, an account going by ‘Mariana Times’, with over 78,000 followers, which posts pro-Israel content has been found to be based out of India. </p><p>People within the MAGA orbit have also reacted to this new feature. Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna wrote on X from her personal account, “All of these pretend “pro-America” accounts that were pushing infighting within Maga are literally foreign grifters. I’m telling you, the foreign opp is real and so are the bot accounts.” </p><p>Alexis Wilkins, FBI director Kash Patel's girlfriend, also added, “I hope that everyone sees, regardless of their specific reason, that the enemy is outside of the house. The people posing as Americans with big American opinions but are actually operating from a basement across the world have one common goal - to destroy the United States. We have our issues, but we really can’t allow them to succeed.”</p>",

      "content": "<p>I used to call myself a Rust hater, but really I was doing it just to compensate for the perceivable fanboyism e.g. Rust tops on stackoverflow surveys as most-loved language. There are many reasons to hate C++, and I hate C++ too. Lots of people were waiting for a better programming language, but got Rust instead.</p><p>There are several core problems with Rust:</p><ol><li>Its compilation is slow. I mean SLOW. Slower than C++.  I know over years Rust became several times faster, but objectively we need it to be two orders of magnitude faster, not just two times.</li><li>It’s complex. Just as complex as C++. But C++ had legacy and Rust had not. The complexity of forcing your way through the jungle of  on every single step directly impacts the quality of the logic being implemented i.e. you can’t see the forest for the trees. Once again, C++ has the same problem, so what’s the point of the language switch in the end?</li><li>Memory safety is not that sacred. In fact, for many applications malfunctioning is better than crashing — particulary in the embedded world where Rust wants to be present. You cannot get 99.999% reliability with Rust — it crashes all the time.</li><li>When handling lots of mutable shared state (GUI, DB, stateful services, OS/hardware), the performance of native Rust memory model is subpar, and non-native unsafes just leave you with slow compilation, high complexity, and no memory safety in the end — which makes Rust practically meaningless for heavy mutable state jobs.</li></ol><p>There is no doubt about it. Undefined behavior (UB) is a fundamental aspec of the language, you don’t simply encounter UB — the whole language is built on UB. You do array indexing and you immediately encounter UB because the language just does not check out of bound access. I want to emphasize that lots of UB-s are not even justified by performance matters — it’s an outright sloppy design of C carried over and amplified in C++. I can go all day long about how C++ sucks:</p><ul><li>implicit type conversions, implicit copies, implicit constructors, implicit object slicing, and pretty much everything implicit;</li><li>function overloading (implicit), particulary considering its omnipresence in STL;</li><li>non-uniform error handling with exceptions as afterthought;</li><li>still #include-ing text files 40 years after C and One Definition Rule barely checked by compilers;</li><li>unsound combination of paradigms (good luck overriding a generic function in descendant classes);</li><li>SFINAE nuisance as a core mechanism of generic programming;</li><li>T, T&amp;, T*, std::optional</li></ul><p>So C++ is complex, unsafe, and it’s compiler is slow. How does the Rust (not) fix those issues?</p><p><a href=\"https://prev.rust-lang.org/en-US/faq.html#why-is-rustc-slow\">Rust FAQ</a> explains that there are many efforts to optimize it, like better frontend, MIR, and so on. But MIR effort was started at 2015 and it still fails to significantly quicken the compilation (although it speeds up compiler checks).</p><p>Unfortunately, it’s impossible to make Rust compile fast. The problem is inherent to all similar generics-heavy languages, like Haskell. Arguably, Rust is closer to Haskell than it is to C++. You can also say it’s close to a template-heavy C++ — and template-heavy C++ code exhibits the same problem of slow compilation.\nWhen you do  — you don’t just iterate, you create a range, you create an iterator, you iterate over it — all of it monomorphized to your concrete types and have to be optimized individually (non-optimized Rust code is insanely slow, it’s mostly unusable even for debugging).\nPut a non-optional borrow-checker on top of it — and there you have your insanely slow compiler. And you WILL recompile a lot, because borrow checker is relentless.</p><p>You just cannot avoid it. You cannot go along like “I’m writing a cold path high-level code, I don’t need performance, I don’t need to go deeper into lifetime handling, I just want to write a high level logic”. You will be forced into the low level nuances every time you write a single line of Rust. There is no garbage collector for Rust and will never be — you will have to semi-manually pack all your data into a tree of ownership. You have to be fluent in ownership, borrowing, traits to write just a few lines of code.</p><p>As I’ve already mentioned, this makes it very hard to write high-level logic in Rust. That’s why many of early Rust adopters actually revert to Node.js and Go for less performance-sensitive services — high complexity combined with slow compilation makes it impractical to write anything complex in sole Rust.</p><p>There are two uncompromising things in the Rust fundament: performance and memory safety. I have to argue that Rust designers went wa-a-ay overboard with memory safety. You know the containers are actually implemented with  functions, because there is just no perfect correctness possible in the Turing machine model — you have to build safe programs from carefully arranged unsafe building blocks. Node.js and Go are considered practically safe language. Rust sacrificed sanity and practicality for memory safety — and gets none of them at the end of the day, it’s still not 100% memory safe.</p><p>Now speaking about practicality — lots of use cases just don’t need perfect memory safety. There are ways to implement unsafe programs that still don’t execute remote code or leak secret — they only corrupt user data and act sporadically. If a pacemaker stops — telling a victim “but the memory was not corrupted in the crash” is a weak consolation. We actually had a recent Cloudflare outage caused by a crash on  function:<a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/18-november-2025-outage/\">https://blog.cloudflare.com/18-november-2025-outage/</a></p><p>It’s probably the strongest point of my whining: <strong>Rust is memory safe and unreliable. The price of memory safety was reliability</strong> in addition to the developer’s sanity ­— that’s why I’m telling the language designers went overboard. They sacrificied core practical quality for an abstract principle of memory safety. Just like Haskell designers sacrificed practicality for purity — that’s why I reiterate on parallels between Rust and Haskell.</p><p>It’s possible, but employing mutable shared state in Rust just makes no sense. You lose most of advantages and are left with all the deficiencies of Rust. Pretty much all of the successful Rust projects are employing shared read-only state, one way data flow, acyclic data structures: rustc compiler, mdbook and pulldown-cmark Markdown tools, Actix and Axum for stateless handlers, append-only blockchains, single-threaded WASM. The model is, once again, very similar to Haskell, which also excels in parsers, stateless handler, mostly-non-interactive CLI tools, and was employed in blockchains.</p><p>Early prototypes of Rust actually had Software Transactional Memory (STM) as an option for safe concurrency, however, STM has performance penalties and it requires simple but significant runtime support.</p><p>Step into the shared mutable state — and there a memory corruption is not an exception, it’s a rule. You have to handle the corruptions, you cannot simply crash. Borrow checker, ownership? Just useless, you cannot analyze ownership in a cyclic graph without GC-like algorithm.</p><p>Sync/Send, Mutex and reference counting (Arc)? Unfortuantely, those lock or simply mess with CPU caches badly, so they are inefficient for multithreaded communication, at least an intensive one. They are safe, but inefficient. Which kinda destroys the first uncompromising thing in Rust — performance. So, to reiterate, the second you step into the shared mutable state you lose every single advantage of Rust. Which is kinda rational considering that the main concept of Rust was to never employ a shared mutable state.</p><p>Particulary, GUI is a mutable shared state. Hence we don’t see any big GUI projects in Rust. <a href=\"https://zed.dev/\">Zed IDE</a> is still beta for so many years — I can almost feel the pain of the developers hacking their way through the borrow checker jungle just to realize their logic is bug-ridden, and they are yet to implement dozens of other features.\nBig databases, scalable stateful services, operating systems, at least significant Linux modules? Yet to be seen.</p><p>So, is the Rust bad or good? It’s neither. It’s a mediocre programming language with thousands of man-month put into its development — this fact alone makes Rust a viable tool, just because you can pick it from the shelf and employ as-is. This blog was generated with Zola, written in Rust — I did not have to write a single line of Rust code to use it. And the Rust is a good fit for Zola SSG because of its non-interactive nature with one-way flow of immutable data. Just, please, don’t run around screaming “we should all switch our development to Rust because it’s the best programming language”.</p>",

The first one came a few months after I started, and he mostly asked me about a colleague’s work quality.\nThe second came when I gave notice that I was leaving to <a href=\"https://lethain.com/digg-v4/\">join Digg</a>.\nA modern evaluation of this manager would be scathing, but his management style closely resembled that of the\nteam leader in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Soul-New-Machine-Tracy-Kidder/dp/0316491977\"><em>The Soul of A New Machine</em></a>:\nidentifying an important opportunity for the team, and navigating the broader organization that might impede progress\ntowards that goal.\nHe was, in the context we were working in, an effective manager.</p><p>Compare that leadership style to the expectations of the 2010s, where attracting, retaining, and motivating engineers\nwas emphasized as the most important leadership criteria in many organizations.\nThis made sense in <a href=\"https://lethain.com/productivity-in-the-age-of-hypergrowth/\">the era of hypergrowth</a>, where budgets were uncapped\nand many companies viewed hiring strong engineers as their constraint on growth.\nThis was an era where managers were explicitly told to stop writing software as the first step of their transition into management,\nand it was good advice! Looking back we can argue it was bad guidance by today’s standards, but it aligned the managers with the leadership expectations\nof the moment.</p><p>Then think about our current era, that started in late 2022, where higher interest rates killed <a href=\"https://www.readmargins.com/p/zirp-explains-the-world\">zero-interest-rate-policy (ZIRP)</a>\nand productized large language models are positioned as killing deep Engineering organizations.\nWe’ve flattened Engineering organizations where many roles that previously focused on coordination\nare now expected to be hands-on keyboard, working deep in the details.\nOnce again, the best managers of the prior era–who did exactly what the industry asked them to do–are now reframed as bureaucrats\nrather than integral leaders.</p><p>In each of these transitions, the business environment shifted, leading to a new formulation of ideal leadership.\nThat makes a lot of sense: of course we want leaders to fit the necessary patterns of today.\nWhere things get weird is that in each case a morality tale was subsequently superimposed on top of the transition:</p><ul><li>In the 2010s, the morality tale was that it was all about empowering engineers as a fundamental good.\nSure, I can get excited for that, but I don’t really believe that narrative: it happened because hiring was competitive.</li><li>In the 2020s, the morality tale is that bureaucratic middle management have made organizations stale and inefficient.\nThe lack of experts has crippled organizational efficiency.\nOnce again, I can get behind that–there’s truth here–but the much larger drivers aren’t about morality,\nit’s about ZIRP-ending and optimism about productivity gains from AI tooling.</li></ul><p>The conclusion here is clear: the industry will want different things from you as it evolves,\nand it will tell you that each of those shifts is because of some complex moral change,\nbut it’s pretty much always about business realities changing.\nIf you take any current morality tale as true, then you’re setting yourself up\nto be severely out of position when the industry shifts again in a few years,\nbecause “good leadership” is just a fad.</p><h2>Self-development across leadership fads</h2><p>If you accept the argument that the specifically desired leadership skills of today\nare the result of fads that frequently shift, then it leads to an important followup question:\nwhat are the right skills to develop in to be effective today and to be impactful across fads?</p><p>Having been and worked with engineering managers for some time, I think there are\n<a href=\"https://lethain.com/categories-engineering-leadership/\">eight foundational engineering management skills</a>,\nwhich I want to personally group into two clusters: core skills that are essential to operate in all roles\n(including entry-level management roles), and growth skills whose presence–or absence–determines\nhow far you can go in your career.</p><ol><li><p>: lead team to deliver expected tangible and intangible work.\nFundamentally, management is about getting things done, and you’ll neither\nget an opportunity to begin managing, nor stay long as a manager, if your\nteams don’t execute.</p><p>: ship projects, manage on-call rotation, sprint planning, manage incidents</p></li><li><p>: shape the team and the environment such that they succeed.\nThis is  working for the team, nor is it working for your leadership, it is\nfinding the balance between the two that works for both.</p><p>: hiring, coaching, performance management, advocate with your management</p></li><li><p>: navigate reality to make consistent progress, even when reality is difficult\nFinding a way to get things done, rather than finding a way that it not getting done is someone else’s fault.</p><p>: doing hard things, showing up when it’s uncomfortable, being accountable despite systemic issues</p></li><li><p>: build shared understanding across leadership, stakeholders, your team, and the problem space.\nFinding a realistic plan that meets the moment, without surprising or being surprised by those around you.</p><p>: document and share top problems, and updates during crises</p></li></ol><ol><li><p>: exercise discerning judgment about what “good” looks like—technically, in business terms, and in process/strategy.\nTaste is a broadchurch, and my experience is that broad taste is an somewhat universal criteria for truly senior roles.\nIn some ways, taste is a prerequisite to Amazon’s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/our-workplace/leadership-principles\">Are Right, A Lot</a>.</p><p>: refine proposed product concept,\navoid high-risk rewrite,\nfind usability issues in team’s work</p></li><li><p>: your team, stakeholders, and leadership know what you’re doing and why, and agree that it makes sense.\nIn particular, they understand how you are overcoming your biggest problems. So clarity is not, “Struggling with scalability issues”\nbut instead “Sharding the user logins database in a new cluster to reduce load.”</p><p>: identify levers to progress,\ncreate plan to exit a crisis,\nshow progress on implementing that plan</p></li><li><p>: work from complex problem to opinionated, viable approach.\nIf you’re given an extremely messy, open-ended problem, can you still find a way to make progress?\n(I’ve <a href=\"https://lethain.com/navigating-ambiguity/\">written previously about this topic</a>.)</p><p>: launching a new business line,\nimproving developer experience,\ngoing from 1 to N cloud regions</p></li><li><p><strong>Working across timescales</strong>: ensure your areas of responsibility make progress across both the short and long term.\nThere are many ways to appear successful by cutting corners today, that end in disaster tomorrow.\nSuccess requires understanding, and being accountable for, how different timescales interact.</p><p>: have an explicit destination,\nensure short-term work steers towards it,\nbe long-term rigid and short-term flexible</p></li></ol><p>Having spent a fair amount of time pressure testing these, I’m pretty sure most effective managers, and manager archetypes, can be fit into these boxes.</p><h3>Self-assessing on these skills</h3><p>There’s no perfect way to measure anything complex, but here are some thinking\nquestions for you to spend time with as you assess where you stand on each of these skills:</p><ol><li><ul><li>When did your team last have friction delivering work? Is that a recurring issue?</li><li>What’s something hard you shipped that went really, really well?</li><li>When were you last pulled onto solving a time-sensitive, executive-visible project?</li></ul></li><li><ul><li>Who was the last strong performer you hired?</li><li>Have you retained your strongest performers?</li><li>What strong performers want to join your team?</li><li>Which peers consider your team highly effective?</li><li>When did an executive describe your team as exceptional?</li></ul></li><li><ul><li>When did you or your team overcome the odds to deliver something important? (Would your stakeholders agree?)</li><li>What’s the last difficult problem you solved that stayed solved (rather than reoccurring)?</li><li>When did you last solve the problem first before addressing cross-team gaps?</li></ul></li><li><ul><li>When was the last time you were surprised by a stakeholder? What could you do to prevent that reoccuring?</li><li>How does a new stakeholder understand your prioritization tradeoffs (incl rationale)?</li><li>When did you last disappoint a stakeholder without damaging your relationship?</li><li>What stakeholders would join your company because they trust you?</li></ul></li><li><ul><li>What’s a recent decision that is meaningfully better because you were present?</li><li>If your product counterpart left, what decisions would you struggle to make?</li><li>Where’s a subtle clarification that significantly changed a design or launch?</li><li>How have you inflected team’s outcomes by seeing around corners?</li></ul></li><li><ul><li>What’s a difficult trade-off you recently helped your team make?</li><li>How could you enable them to make that same trade-off without your direct participation?</li><li>What’s a recent decision you made that was undone?

Today, with more family responsibilities, I am unwilling to make the tradeoffs to\nconsistently work that way, which has real implications on how I think about which roles to prioritize\nover time.</p><p>Recognizing these tradeoffs, and making them deliberately, is one of the highest value things you can do\nto shape your career. Most importantly, it’s extremely hard to have a career at all if you don’t think about\nthese dimensions and have a healthy amount of self-awareness to understand the tradeoffs that will allow you\nto stay engaged over half a lifetime.</p><div><time datetime=\"2025-10-26T04:00:00-07:00\">Published on October 26, 2025.</time></div>",

      "title": "Fran Sans – font inspired by San Francisco light rail displays",

      "content": "<a href=\"https://www.emilysneddon.com/fransans\" target=\"_blank\">Fran Sans</a> is a display font in every sense of the term. It’s an interpretation of the destination displays found on some of the light rail vehicles that service the city of San Francisco. because destination displays aren’t consistently used across the city’s transit system. In fact, SF has an unusually high number of independent public transit agencies. Unlike New York, Chicago or L.A., which each have one, maybe two, San Francisco and the greater Bay Area have over two dozen. Each agency, with its own models of buses and trains, use different destination displays, creating an eclectic patchwork of typography across the city.<p>Among them, one display in particular has always stood out to me: the LCD panel displays inside Muni’s Breda Light Rail Vehicles. I remember first noticing them on a Saturday in October on the N-Judah, heading to the Outer Sunset for a shrimp hoagie. This context is important, as anyone who’s spent an October weekend in SF knows this is the optimal vibe to really take in the beauty of the city.&nbsp;</p><p>\nWhat caught my eye was how the displays look mechanical and yet distinctly personal. Constructed on a 3×5 grid, the characters are made up of geometric modules: squares, quarter-circles, and angled forms. Combined, these modules create imperfect, almost primitive letterforms, revealing a utility and charm that feels distinctly like the San Francisco I’ve come to know.</p><p>\nThis balance of utility and charm seems to show up everywhere in San Francisco and its history. The Golden Gate’s “International Orange” started as nothing more than a rust-proof primer, yet is now the city’s defining colour. The Painted Ladies became multicoloured icons after the 1960s Colourist movement covered decades of grey paint. Even the steepness of the streets was once an oversight in city planning but has since been romanticised in films and on postcards. So perhaps it is unsurprising that I would find this same utility and charm in a place as small and functional as a train sign.</p><p>\nTo learn more about these displays, I visited the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency’s (SFMTA) Electronics Shop at Balboa Park. There, technician Armando Lumbad had set up one of the signs. They each feature one large LCD panel which displays the line name, and twenty-four smaller ones to display the destination. The loose spacing of the letters and fluorescent backlighting gives the sign a raw, analogue quality. Modern LED dot-matrix displays are far more efficient and flexible, but to me, they lack the awkwardness that makes these Breda signs so delightful.</p><p>\nArmando showed me how the signs work. He handed me a printed matrix table listing every line and destination, each paired with a three-digit code. On route, train operators punch the code into a control panel at the back of the display, and the LCD blocks light on specific segments of the grid to build each letter. I picked code 119, and Armando entered it for me. A few seconds later the panels revealed my own stop: the N-Judah at Church &amp; Duboce. There in the workshop, devoid of the context of the trains and the commute, the display looked almost monolithic, or sculptural, and I have since fantasised whether it would be possible to ship one of these home to Australia.</p><p>\nLooking inside of the display, I found labels identifying the make and model. The signs were designed and manufactured by Trans-Lite, Inc., a company based in Milford, Connecticut that specialised in transport signage from 1959 until its acquisition by the Nordic firm Teknoware in 2012. After lots of amateur detective work, and with the help from an anonymous Reddit user in a Connecticut community group, I was connected with Gary Wallberg, Senior Engineer at Trans-Lite and the person responsible for the design of these very signs back in 1999.</p><p>\nLearning that the alphabet came from an engineer really explains its temperament and why I was drawn to it in the first place. The signs were designed for sufficiency: fixed segments, fixed grid, and no extras. Characters were created only as destinations required them, while other characters, like the Q, X, and much of the punctuation, were never programmed into the signs. In reducing everything to its bare essentials, somehow character emerged, and it’s what inspired me to design Fran Sans.</p><p>I shared some initial drawings with Dave Foster of </p><a href=\"https://www.fostertype.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Foster Type</a> who encouraged me to get the font software Glyphs and turn it into my first working font. From there, I broke down the anatomy of the letters into modules, then used them like Lego to build out a full set: uppercase A–Z, numerals, core punctuation.&nbsp;<p>\nSome glyphs remain unsolved in this first version, for example the standard @ symbol refuses to squeeze politely into the 3×5 logic. Lowercase remains a question for the future, and would likely mean reconsidering the grid. But, as with the displays themselves, I am judging Fran Sans as sufficient for now.</p><p>\nGetting up close to these signs, you’ll notice Fran Sans’ gridlines are simplified even from its real‑life muse, but my hope is that its character remains. Specifically: the N and the zero, where the unusually thick diagonals close in on the counters; and the Z and 7, whose diagonals can feel uncomfortably thin. I’ve also noticed the centre of the M can scale strangely and read like an H at small sizes, but in fairness, this type was never designed for the kind of technical detail so many monospaced fonts aim for. Throughout the process I tried to protect these unorthodox moments, because to me, they determined the success of this interpretation.</p><p>\nFran Sans comes in three styles: Solid, Tile, and Panel, each building in visual complexity. The decision to include variations, particularly the Solid style, was inspired by my time working at </p><a href=\"https://christopherdoyle.co/\" target=\"_blank\">Christopher Doyle &amp; Co.</a> There, we worked with Bell Shakespeare, Australia’s national theatre company dedicated to the works of William Shakespeare. The equity of the Bell Shakespeare brand lies in its typography, which is a beautiful custom typeface called Hotspur, designed and produced by none other than Dave Foster.<p>\nOften, brand fonts are chosen or designed to convey a single feeling. Maybe it’s warmth and friendliness, or a sense of tech and innovation. But what I’ve always loved about the Bell typeface is how one weight could serve both Shakespeare’s comedies and tragedies, simply by shifting scale, spacing, or alignment. Hotspur has the gravity to carry the darkness of </p> and the roundness to convey the humour of . And while Fran Sans Solid is technically no Hotspur, I wanted it to share that same versatility.<p>\nFurther inspiration for Fran Sans came from the </p><a href=\"https://letterformarchive.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Letterform Archive</a>, the world’s leading typography archive, based in San Francisco. Librarian and archivist <a href=\"https://www.kateallalong.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Kate Long Stellar</a> thoughtfully curated a research visit filled with modular typography spanning most of the past century. On the table were two pieces that had a significant impact on Fran Sans and are now personal must-sees at the archive. First, Joan Trochut’s  “Fast Type” (1942) was created during the Second World War when resources were scarce.  gave printers the ability to draw with type, rearranging modular pieces to form letters, ornaments and even illustrations.<p>\nSecond, Zuzana Licko’s process work for </p> (1985), an Emigre typeface, opened new ways of thinking about how ideas move between the physical and the digital and then back again. Seeing how  was documented through iterations and variations gave the typeface a depth and richness that changed my understanding of how fonts are built. At some point I want to explore physical applications for Fran Sans out of respect for its origins, since it is impossible to fully capture the display’s charm on screen.<p>\nBack at the SFMTA, Armando told me the Breda vehicles are being replaced, and with them their destination displays will be swapped for newer LED dot-matrix units that are more efficient and easier to maintain. By the end of 2025 the signs that inspired Fran Sans will disappear from the city, taking with them a small but distinctive part of the city’s voice. \nThat feels like a real loss. San Francisco is always reinventing itself, yet its charm lies in how much of its history still shows through. My hope is that Fran Sans can inspire a deeper appreciation for the imperfections that give our lives and our cities character. Life is so rich when ease and efficiency are not the measure.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I’m not saying this will definitely happen, but I think we could be on the cusp of a significant shift in Windows market share for consumer computers. It is not going to drop to 2% in a year or anything, but I feel like a few pieces are coming together that could move the needle in a way we have not seen in several decades. There are three things on my mind .</p><p>Number one is that Microsoft just does not feel like a consumer tech company at all anymore. Yes, they have always been much more corporate than the likes of Apple or Google, but it really shows in the last few years as they seem to only have energy for AI and web services. If you are not a customer who is a major business or a developer creating the next AI-powered app, Microsoft does not seem to care about you.</p><p>I just do not see excitement there. The only thing of note they have added to Windows in the last five years is Copilot, and I have yet to meet a normal human being who enjoys using it. And all the Windows 11 changes seem to have just gone over about as well as a lead balloon. I just do not think they care at all about Windows with consumers.</p><p>The second thing is the affordable MacBook rumored to be coming out in 2026. This will be a meaningfully cheaper MacBook that people can purchase at price points that many Windows computers have been hovering around for many years. Considering Apple’s focus on consumers first and a price point that can get more people in the door, it seems like that could move the needle.</p><p>The third thing is gamers. Gamers use Windows largely because they have to, not because they are passionate about it. Maybe they were passionate about it in the 90s, but any passion has gone away. Now it is just the operating system they use to launch Steam. In early 2026, Valve is going to release the Steam Machine after a few years of success with the Steam Deck. We will see how they do there, but what they are doing is releasing a machine that runs Windows games on Linux. And it runs them really well. The Steam Deck has proven that over the last few years. If someone can package up a version of Linux that is optimized for gamers, then I think there is a meaningful number of PC gamers who would happily run that on their computer instead.</p><p>I do not know if this is going to happen. It is always easy to be cynical and suggest everything will stay the same, and I understand that markets of this size take a long time to change. However, it just feels like there are some things happening right now that are going to move the needle, and I am excited to see what happens.</p>",

      "content": "<p>It’s Friday at 4pm. I’ve just closed my 12th bug of the week. My brain is completely fried. And I’m staring at the bug leaderboard, genuinely sad that Monday means going back to regular work. Which is weird because I  regular work. But fixit weeks have a special place in my heart.</p><p>Once a quarter or so, my org with ~45 software engineers stops all regular work for a week. That means no roadmap work, no design work, no meetings or standups.</p><p>Instead, we fix the small things that have been annoying us and our users:</p><ul><li>an error message that’s been unclear for two years</li><li>a weird glitch when the user scrolls and zooms at the same time</li><li>a test which runs slower than it should, slowing down CI for everyone</li></ul><p>The rules are simple: 1) no bug should take over 2 days and 2) all work should focus on either small end-user bugs/features or developer productivity.</p><p>We also have a “points system” for bugs and a leaderboard showing how many points people have. And there’s a promise of t-shirts for various achievements: first bug fix, most points, most annoying bug, etc. It’s a simple structure, but it works surprisingly well.</p><p>Some stats from this fixit:</p><ul><li>4 was the median number of bugs closed per person</li><li>12 was maximum number of bugs closed by one person</li></ul><p>Here are some of the highlights (sadly many people in my org work in internal-facing things so I cannot share their work!):</p><ul><li>I closed a <a href=\"https://github.com/google/perfetto/issues/154\">feature request</a> from 2021! It’s a classic fixit issue: a small improvement that never bubbled to the priority list. It took me  to implement. One day for something that sat there for . And it’s going to provide a small but significant boost to every user’s experience of Perfetto.</li><li>My colleague made this <a href=\"https://github.com/google/perfetto/pull/3736\">small change</a> to improve team productivity. Just ~25 lines of code in a GitHub Action to avoid every UI developer taking two extra clicks to open the CI’s build. The response from the team speaks for itself:</li></ul><ul><li>I also fixed <a href=\"https://github.com/google/perfetto/issues/713\">this</a> issue to provide a new “amalgamated” version of our SDK, allowing it to be easily integrated into projects. It’s one of those things that might be the difference between someone deciding to use us or not, but building it took just one hour of work (with liberal use of AI!).</li></ul><h3>For the product: craftsmanship and care</h3><p>I care deeply about any product I work on. That means asking big questions like “what should we build?” and “how do we make this fast?” But it also means asking smaller questions: “is this error message actually helpful?” or “would I be frustrated using this?”</p><p>A hallmark of any good product is attention to detail: a sense that someone has thought things through, and the pieces fit together to make a cohesive whole. And the opposite is true: a product with rough edges might be tolerated if there are no alternatives, but there will always be a sense of frustration and “I wish I could use something else”.</p><p>Fixits are a great chance to work on exactly those details that separate good products from great ones. The small things your average user might not consciously notice, but absolutely will notice if they’re wrong.</p><h3>For the individual: doing, not thinking</h3><p>I sometimes miss the feeling I had earlier in my career when I got to just fix things. See something broken, fix it, ship it the same day.</p><p>The more senior you get in a big company, the less you do that. Most of your time becomes thinking about what to build next, planning quarters ahead, navigating tradeoffs and getting alignment.</p><p>Fixits give me that early-career feeling back. You see the bug, you fix it, you ship it, you close it, you move on. There’s something deeply satisfying about work where the question isn’t “what should we do?” but rather “can I make this better?” And you get to answer that question multiple times in a week.</p><h3>For the team: morale and spirit</h3><p>Having 40 people across two time zones all fixing bugs together adds a whole other dimension.</p><p>The vibe of the office is different: normally we’re all heads-down on different projects, but during fixit the team spirit comes out strong. People share their bug fixes in chat rooms, post before-and-after screenshots and gather around monitors to demo a new feature or complain about a particularly nasty bug they’re wrestling.</p><p>The leaderboard amplifies this energy. There’s a friendly sense of competition as people try and balance quick wins with meatier bugs they can share stories about.</p><p>There’s also a short update every morning about how the previous day went:</p><ul><li>how many people have fixed at least one bug</li><li>how many different products we’ve fixed things in</li><li>who’s currently at the top of the leaderboard</li></ul><p>All of this creates real momentum, and people feel magnetically pulled into the effort.</p><p>I’ve participated in 6 fixits over the years and I’ve learned a lot about what makes them successful. Here are a few things that matter more than you’d think.</p><p>Most of what makes a fixit work happens before the week even starts.</p><p>All year round, we encourage everyone to tag bugs as “good fixit candidates” as they encounter them. Then the week before fixit, each subteam goes through these bugs and sizes them:</p><ul><li>small (less than half a day)</li><li>large (less than 2 days).</li></ul><p>They assign points accordingly: 1, 2, or 4.</p><p>We also create a shortlist of high-priority bugs we really want fixed. People start there and move to the full list once those are done. This pre-work is critical: it prevents wasting day one with people aimlessly searching for bugs to fix.</p><p>In one of our early fixits, someone picked up what looked like a straightforward bug. It should have been a few hours, maybe half a day. But it turned into a rabbit hole. Dependencies on other systems, unexpected edge cases, code that hadn’t been touched in years.</p><p>They spent the entire fixit week on it. And then the entire week after fixit trying to finish it. What started as a bug fix turned into a mini project.\nThe work was valuable! But they missed the whole point of a fixit. No closing bugs throughout the week. No momentum. No dopamine hits from shipping fixes. Just one long slog.</p><p>That’s why we have the 2-day hard limit now. If something is ballooning, cut your losses. File a proper bug, move it to the backlog, pick something else. The limit isn’t about the work being worthless - it’s about keeping fixit feeling like fixit.</p><p>We didn’t always do fixits with 40 people. Early on, this wasn’t an org-wide effort, just my subteam of 7 people. It worked okay: bugs got fixed and there was a sense of pride in making the product better. But it felt a bit hollow: in the bigger picture of our org, it didn’t feel like anyone else noticed or cared.</p><p>At ~40 people, it feels like a critical mass that changes things significantly. The magic number is probably somewhere between 7 and 40. And it probably varies based on the team. But whatever the number is, the collective energy matters. If you’re trying this with 5 people, it might still be worth doing, but it probably won’t feel the same.</p><p>The points and leaderboard are more than a gimmick, but they have to be handled carefully.</p><ul><li><strong>Points are coarse, not precise</strong>: We deliberately use 1/2/4 points instead of trying to measure exact effort; the goal is “roughly right and fun”, not accurate performance evaluation.</li><li><strong>Celebrate breadth, not just volume.</strong> We give t-shirts for things like “first bug fix”, “most annoying bug fixed”, not just “most points”. That keeps newer or less experienced engineers engaged.</li><li> A shout-out in the daily update or an internal post often matters more than the actual t-shirt.</li><li><strong>No attachment to perf reviews</strong>. This is important: fixit scores do  feed into performance reviews. The moment they do, people will start gaming it and the good vibe will die.</li></ul><p>We’ve had very little “gaming” in practice. Social norms do a good job of keeping people honest and 40 is still small enough that there’s a sense of “loyalty to the cause” from folks.</p><p>The big challenge with fixits is context switching. Constantly changing what you’re working on means constantly figuring out new parts of the codebase, thinking about new problems.</p><p>AI tools have mitigated this in a big way. The code they write is less important than their ability to quickly search through relevant files and summarize what needs to change. They might be right or wrong, but having that starting point really reduces the cognitive load. And sometimes (rarely) they one-shot a fix.</p><p>This <a href=\"https://github.com/google/perfetto/pull/3774\">docs change</a> was a perfect example of the above: an update to our docs which catches out new contributors and AI was able to one-shot the fix.</p><p>On the other hand, in my <a href=\"https://github.com/google/perfetto/pull/3780\">record page change</a> it was more useful for giving me prototypes of what the code should look like and I had to put in significant effort to correct the bad UX it generated and its tendency to “over-generate” code. Even so, it got me to the starting line much faster.</p><h2>Criticisms of fixits (and why I still like them anyway)</h2><p>I’ve definitely come across people who question whether fixits are actually a good idea. Some of the criticisms are fair but overall I still think it’s worth it.</p><h3>“Isn’t this just admitting you ignore bugs the rest of the time?”</h3><p>To some extent, yes, this is an admission of the fact that “papercut” bugs are underweighted in importance, both by managers and engineers. It’s all too easy to tunnel on making sure a big project is successful and easier to ignore the small annoyances for users and the team.</p><p>Fixits are a way of counterbalancing that somewhat and saying “actually those bugs matter too”. That’s not to say we don’t fix important bugs during regular work; we absolutely do. But fixits recognize that there should be a place for handling the “this is slightly annoying but never quite urgent enough” class of problems.</p><p>The whole reason we started fixits in the first place is that we observed these bugs never get actioned. Given this, I think carving out some explicit time for it is a good thing.</p><h3>“Isn’t it a waste to pause roadmap work for a whole week?”</h3><p>It’s definitely a tradeoff. 40 engineer-weeks is a  of manpower and there’s an argument to be made it should be used for actually solving roadmap problems.</p><p>But I think this underweights the importance of polish of products to users. We’ve consistently found that the product feels noticeably better afterward (including positive comments from users about things they notice!) and there’s a sense of  in having a well-functioning product.</p><p>Also, many of the team productivity fixes compound (faster tests, clearer errors, smoother workflows) so the benefits carry forward well beyond the week itself.</p><p>I agree that a full week might be too much for tiny teams or startups. But you can still borrow the idea in smaller chunks: a “fixit Friday” once a month, or a 2-day mini-fixit each quarter. The core idea is the same: protected, collective time to fix the stuff people complain about but no one schedules time to address.</p><h2>Fixits are good for the soul</h2><p>The official justification for fixits is that they improve product quality and\ndeveloper productivity. And of course they do this.</p><p>But the unofficial reason I love them is simpler: it just feels good to fix things. It takes me back to a simpler time, and putting thought and attention into building great products is a big part of my ethos for how software engineering should be done. I wouldn’t want to work like that all the time. But I also wouldn’t want to work somewhere that never makes time for it.</p>",

      "content": "<div><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">Sex trafficking on Meta platforms was both difficult to report and widely tolerated, according to a court filing unsealed Friday. In a plaintiffs’ brief filed as part of a major lawsuit against four social media companies, Instagram’s former head of safety and well-being Vaishnavi Jayakumar testified that when she joined Meta in 2020 she was shocked to learn that the company had a “17x” strike policy for accounts that reportedly engaged in the “trafficking of humans for sex.”&nbsp;</p></div><div><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">“You could incur 16 violations for prostitution and sexual solicitation, and upon the 17th violation, your account would be suspended,” Jayakumar reportedly testified, adding that “by any measure across the industry, [it was] a very, very high strike threshold.” The plaintiffs claim that this testimony is corroborated by internal company documentation.</p><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">The brief, filed by plaintiffs in the Northern District of California, alleges that Meta was aware of serious harms on its platform and engaged in a broad pattern of deceit to downplay risks to young users. According to the brief, Meta was aware that millions of adult strangers were contacting minors on its sites; that its products exacerbated mental health issues in teens; and that content related to eating disorders, suicide, and child sexual abuse was frequently detected, yet rarely removed. According to the brief, the company failed to disclose these harms to the public or to Congress, and refused to implement safety fixes that could have protected young users.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><div><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">“Meta has designed social media products and platforms that it is aware are addictive to kids, and they’re aware that those addictions lead to a whole host of serious mental health issues,” says Previn Warren, the co-lead attorney for the plaintiffs in the case. “Like tobacco, this is a situation where there are dangerous products that were marketed to kids,” Warren adds. “They did it anyway, because more usage meant more profits for the company.”&nbsp;</p><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">The following allegations against Meta come from the brief filed in an unprecedented multidistrict litigation. More than 1,800 plaintiffs—including children and parents, school districts, and state attorneys general—have joined together in a suit alleging that the parent companies behind Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, and YouTube “relentlessly pursued a strategy of growth at all costs, recklessly ignoring the impact of their products on children’s mental and physical health,” according to their master complaint. The newly unsealed allegations about Meta are just one small part of the sprawling suit. (TIME filed a motion to intervene in the case to ensure public access to court records; the motion was denied.)</p></div><div><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">The plaintiffs’ brief, first reported by TIME, purports to be based on sworn depositions of current and former Meta executives, internal communications, and company research and presentations obtained during the lawsuit’s discovery process. It includes quotes and excerpts from thousands of pages of testimony and internal company documents. TIME was not able to independently view the underlying testimony or research quoted in the brief, since those documents remain under seal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">But the brief still paints a damning picture of the company’s internal research and deliberations about issues that have long plagued its platforms. Plaintiffs claim that since 2017, Meta has aggressively pursued young users, even as its internal research suggested its social media products could be addictive and dangerous to kids. Meta employees proposed multiple ways to mitigate these harms, according to the brief, but were repeatedly blocked by executives who feared that new safety features would hamper teen engagement or user growth.</p></div><div><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">“We strongly disagree with these allegations, which rely on cherry-picked quotes and misinformed opinions in an attempt to present a deliberately misleading picture,\" a Meta spokesperson said in a statement to TIME. \"The full record will show that for over a decade, we have listened to parents, researched issues that matter most, and made real changes to protect teens – like introducing Teen Accounts with built-in protections and providing parents with controls to manage their teens’ experiences. We’re proud of the progress we’ve made and we stand by our record.”</p><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">In the years since the lawsuit was filed, Meta has implemented new safety features designed to address some of the problems described by plaintiffs. In 2024, Meta unveiled Instagram Teen Accounts, which defaults any user between 13 and 18 into an account that is automatically private, limits sensitive content, turns off notifications at night, and doesn’t allow messaging from unconnected adults. “We know parents are worried about their teens having unsafe or inappropriate experiences online, and that’s why we’ve significantly reimagined the Instagram experience for tens of millions of teens with new Teen Accounts,” a Meta spokeswoman told TIME in June. “These accounts provide teens with built-in protections to automatically limit who’s contacting them and the content they’re seeing, and teens under 16 need a parent’s permission to change those settings. We also give parents oversight over their teens’ use of Instagram, with ways to see who their teens are chatting with and block them from using the app for more than 15 minutes a day, or for certain periods of time, like during school or at night.”</p></div><div><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">And yet the plaintiffs’ brief suggests that Meta resisted safety changes like these for years.&nbsp;</p><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">The brief quotes testimony from Brian Boland, Meta’s former vice president of partnerships who worked at the company for 11 years and resigned in 2020. “My feeling then and my feeling now is that they don’t meaningfully care about user safety,” he allegedly said. “It’s not something that they spend a lot of time on. It’s not something they think about. And I really think they don’t care.”</p><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">After the plaintiffs’ brief was unsealed late Friday night, Meta did not immediately respond to TIME’s requests for comment.&nbsp;</p><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">Here are some of the most notable allegations from the plaintiffs’ omnibus brief:&nbsp;</p><h2>Allegation: Meta had a high threshold for \"sex trafficking\" content—and no way to report child sexual content</h2><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">Despite Instagram’s “zero tolerance” policy for child sexual abuse material, the platform did not offer users a simple way to report child sexual abuse content, according to the brief. Plaintiffs allege that Jayakumar raised the issue multiple times when she joined Meta in 2020, but was told it would be too difficult to address. Yet Instagram allowed users to easily report far less serious violations, like “spam,” “intellectual property violation” and “promotion of firearms,” according to plaintiffs.</p></div><div><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">Jayakumar was even more shocked to learn that Instagram had a disturbingly high tolerance for sex trafficking on the platform. According to the brief, she testified that Meta had a “17x” strike policy for accounts that reportedly engaged in the “trafficking of humans for sex,” meaning it would take at least 16 reports for an account to be deleted.   </p><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">“Meta never told parents, the public, or the Districts that it doesn’t delete accounts that have engaged over fifteen times in sex trafficking,” the plaintiffs wrote. </p><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">A Meta spokesperson disputed this allegation to TIME, saying the company has for years removed accounts immediately if it suspects them of human trafficking or exploitation and has made it easier over time for users to report content that violates child-exploitation policies. </p><h2>Allegation: Meta \"lied to Congress\" about its knowledge of harms on the platform</h2><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">For years, plaintiffs allege, Meta’s internal research had found that teenagers who frequently use Instagram and Facebook have higher rates of anxiety and depression.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">In late 2019, according to the brief, Meta designed a “deactivation study,” which found that users who stopped using Facebook and Instagram for a week showed lower rates of anxiety, depression, and loneliness. Meta halted the study and did not publicly disclose the results, stating that the research study was biased by the “existing media narratives around the company.” (A Meta spokesperson told TIME that the study was initially conceived as a pair of one-weeks pilots, and researchers declined to continue it because it found that the only reductions in feelings of depression, anxiety, and loneliness were among people who already believed Facebook was bad for them.)</p><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">At least one Meta employee was uncomfortable with the implications of this decision: “If the results are bad and we don’t publish and they leak,” this employee wrote, according to the brief, “is it going to look like tobacco companies doing research and knowing cigs were bad and then keeping that info to themselves?”</p></div><div><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">Indeed, in December 2020, when the Senate Judiciary Committee asked the company in a set of written questions whether it was “able to determine whether increased use of its platform among teenage girls has any correlation with increased signs of depression” and “increased signs of anxiety,” the company offered only a one-word answer: “No.”</p><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">To the plaintiffs in the case, the implication is clear: “The company never publicly disclosed the results of its deactivation study. Instead, Meta lied to Congress about what it knew.”</p><h2>Allegation: The company knew Instagram was letting adult strangers connect with teenagers</h2><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">For years <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/10/instagram-has-massive-harassment-problem/572890/\">Instagram has had </a>a well-documented problem of adults harassing teens. Around 2019, company researchers recommended making all teen accounts private by default in order to prevent adult strangers from connecting with kids, according to the plaintiffs’ brief. Instead of implementing this recommendation, Meta asked its growth team to study the potential impact of making all teen accounts private. The growth team was pessimistic, according to the brief, and responded that the change would likely reduce engagement.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">By 2020, the growth team had determined that a private-by-default setting would result in a loss of 1.5 million monthly active teens a year on Instagram. The plaintiffs’ brief quotes an unnamed employee as saying: “taking away unwanted interactions… is likely to lead to a potentially untenable problem with engagement and growth.” Over the next several months, plaintiffs allege, Meta’s policy, legal, communications, privacy, and well-being teams all recommended making teen accounts private by default, arguing that the switch “will increase teen safety” and was in line with expectations from users, parents, and regulators. But Meta did not launch the feature that year.&nbsp;</p><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">Safety researchers were dismayed, according to excerpts of an internal conversation quoted in the filing. One allegedly grumbled: “Isn’t safety the whole point of this team?”&nbsp;</p><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">“Meta knew that placing teens into a default-private setting would have eliminated 5.4 million unwanted interactions a day,” the plaintiffs wrote. Still, Meta didn’t make the fix. Instead, inappropriate interactions between adults and kids on Instagram skyrocketed to 38 times that on Facebook Messenger, according to the brief. The launch of Instagram Reels allegedly compounded the problem. It allowed young teenagers to broadcast short videos to a wide audience, including adult strangers.</p></div><div><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">.</p><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">An internal 2022 audit allegedly found that Instagram’s Accounts You May Follow feature recommended 1.4 million potentially inappropriate adults to teenage users in a single day. By 2023, according to the plaintiffs, Meta knew that they were recommending minors to potentially suspicious adults and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">It wasn’t until 2024 that Meta rolled out default privacy settings to all teen accounts. In the four years it took the company to implement their own safety recommendations, teens experienced billions of unwanted interactions with strangers online. Inappropriate encounters between teens and adults were common enough, according to the brief, that the company had an acronym for them: “IIC,” or “inappropriate interactions with children.”&nbsp;</p><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">A Meta spokesperson said the company has defaulted teens under 16 to private accounts since 2021, began defaulting teens under 18 into private accounts with the introduction of its Teen Accounts program, and has <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2023/12/combating-online-predators/\">taken steps</a> to protect users from online predators. </p></div><div><h2>Allegation: Meta aggressively targeted young users</h2><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">Meta feared young users would abandon Facebook and Instagram for their competitors. Acquiring and keeping young users became a central business goal. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg suggested that “teen time spent be our top goal of 2017,” according to a company executive quoted in the brief. That has remained the case, plaintiffs allege; internal company documents from 2024 stated that “acquiring new teen users is mission critical to the success of Instagram.” (A Meta spokesperson said time spent on its platforms is not currently a company goal.)</p><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">Meta launched a campaign to connect with school districts and paid organizations like the National Parent Teacher Association and Scholastic to conduct outreach to schools and families. Meanwhile, according to the brief, Meta used location data to push notifications to students in “school blasts,” presumably as part of an attempt to increase youth engagement during the school day. As one employee allegedly put it: “One of the things we need to optimize for is sneaking a look at your phone under your desk in the middle of Chemistry :)”.</p></div><div><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">Though Meta aggressively pursued young users, it may not have known exactly how old those new users were. Whistleblower <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/6ccd5abd-cbb9-5107-d48d-b99e821eb244/2025-09-09%20-%20QFR%20Responses%20-%20Sattizahn.pdf\">Jason Sattizahn recently</a> testified to Congress that Meta does not reliably know the age of its users. (Meta pushed back on Sattizahn’s testimony, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/meta-whistleblower-research-kids-vr-former-employees-stock-rcna230131\">saying in a statement to NBC</a> that his claims were “nonsense” and “based on selectively leaked internal documents that were picked specifically to craft a false narrative.”) In 2022, according to the plaintiffs’ brief, there were 216 million users on Meta platforms whose age was “unknown.”</p><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">Federal law requires social media platforms to observe various data-privacy safeguards for users under 13, and Meta policy states that users under 13 are not allowed on its platforms. Yet the plaintiffs’ court filing claims Meta knew that children under 13 used the company’s products anyway. Internal research cited in the brief suggested there were 4 million users under 13 on Instagram in 2015; by 2018, the plaintiffs claim, Meta knew that roughly 40% of children aged 9 to 12 said they used Instagram daily.</p></div><div><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">The plaintiffs allege that this was a deliberate business strategy. The brief describes a coordinated effort to acquire young users that included studying the psychology and digital behavior of “tweens” and exploring new products designed for “users as young as 5-10.”&nbsp;</p><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">Internally, some employees expressed disgust at the attempt to target preteens. “Oh good, we’re going after &lt;13 year olds now?” one wrote, according to the brief. “Zuck has been talking about that for a while...targeting 11 year olds feels like tobacco companies a couple decades ago (and today). Like we’re seriously saying ‘we have to hook them young’ here.”</p><h2>Allegation: Meta's executives initially shelved efforts to make Instagram less toxic for teens</h2><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">To combat toxic “social comparison,” in 2019 Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri announced a new product feature that would “hide” likes on posts. Meta researchers had determined that hiding likes would make users “significantly less likely to feel worse about themselves,” according to the plaintiffs’ brief. The initiative was code-named Project Daisy.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">But after a series of tests, Meta backtracked on Project Daisy. It determined the feature was “pretty negative to FB metrics,” including ad revenue, according to the plaintiffs’ brief, which quotes an unnamed employee on the growth team insisting: “It’s a social comparison app, fucking get used to it.”&nbsp;</p><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">A similar debate took place over the app’s beauty filters. Plaintiffs claim that an internal review concluded beauty filters exacerbated the “risk and maintenance of several mental health concerns, including body dissatisfaction, eating disorders, and body dysmorphic disorder,” and that Meta knew that “children are particularly vulnerable.” Meta banned beauty filters in 2019, only to roll them back out the following year after the company realized that banning beauty filters would have a “negative growth impact,” according to the plaintiffs’ brief.&nbsp;</p><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">Other company researchers allegedly built an AI “classifier” to identify content that would lead to negative appearance comparison, so that Meta could avoid recommending it to vulnerable kids. But Mosseri allegedly killed the project, disappointing developers who “felt like they had a solution” to “a big problem.”</p></div><div><h2>Allegation: Meta doesn't automatically remove harmful content, including self-harm content</h2><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">While Meta developed AI tools to monitor the platforms for harmful content, the company didn’t automatically delete that content even when it determined with “100% confidence” that it violated Meta’s policies against child sexual-abuse material or eating-disorder content. Meta’s AI classifiers did not automatically delete posts that glorified self-harm unless they were 94% certain they violated platform policy, according to the plaintiffs’ brief. As a result, most of that content remained on the platform, where teenage users often discovered it. In a 2021 internal company survey cited by plaintiffs, more than 8% of respondents aged 13 to 15 reported having seen someone harm themselves, or threaten to do so, on Instagram during the past week.</p></div><div><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">A Meta spokesperson said the company reports more child sexual-abuse material than any other service and uses an array of tools to proactively find that content, including photo and video-matching technologies as well as machine learning. The spokesperson said human reviewers assess content flagged before it is deleted to ensure it violates policies, prevent mistakes that could affect users, and maintain the integrity of the company's detection databases. </p><h2>Allegation: Meta knew its products were addictive, but publicly downplayed the harms</h2><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">The addictive nature of the company’s products wasn’t a secret internally. “Oh my gosh yall IG is a drug,” one of the company’s user-experience researchers allegedly wrote to a colleague. “We’re basically pushers.”&nbsp;</p><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">Meta does not officially study addiction to its products, plaintiffs allege; it studies “problematic use.” In 2018, company researchers surveyed 20,000 Facebook users in the U.S. and found that 58% had some level of “problematic use”—55% mild, and 3.1% severe. But when Meta published an account of this research the following year, only the smaller number of users with “severe” problematic use was mentioned. “We estimate (as an upper bound) that 3.1% of Facebook users in the U.S. experience problematic use,” <a href=\"https://scontent-sjc6-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/240848801_924166131530538_1308218914254273445_n.pdf?_nc_cat=111&amp;ccb=1-7&amp;_nc_sid=e280be&amp;_nc_ohc=C_tgb_3384YQ7kNvwHuZaN0&amp;_nc_oc=Adm09HFJ1ktJoo9WIE0m4qDw6-OlF_2k7EQF8rnKbmwRLRsOB1cDAsP3XLwyT8q2accez_oKoOZRXzLKpBMUCsHU&amp;_nc_zt=14&amp;_nc_ht=scontent-sjc6-1.xx&amp;_nc_gid=WZWa2peYFXQxwOygthrZ6g&amp;oh=00_AfhNhtKp-IiYwptqBR42Y2exRT2A9v9zp5xlCdNIzxAJ_A&amp;oe=6925C501\">wrote the researchers</a>. The other 55% of users are not mentioned anywhere in the public report.&nbsp;</p></div><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">Plaintiffs allege that Meta’s safety team proposed features designed to lessen addiction, only to see them set aside or watered down. One employee who helped develop a “quiet mode” feature said it was shelved because Meta was concerned that this feature would negatively impact metrics related to growth and usage.</p><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\">Around the same time, another user-experience researcher at Instagram allegedly recommended that Meta inform the public about its research findings: “Because our product exploits weaknesses in the human psychology to promote product engagement and time spent,” the researcher wrote, Meta needed to “alert people to the effect that the product has on their brain.”&nbsp;</p><p data-testid=\"paragraph-content\"><em>This story has been updated to reflect additional comments from Meta. </em></p>",

      "content": "<p>Google, the Silicon Valley company , proclaimed to “organise the world’s information” and adopted “don’t be evil” as its corporate motto. And what could possibly be wrong with such aspirations? Indeed, most company leaders and high-tech workers, in the Valley, genuinely believe they are “making the world a better place” while also making money.</p><p>Silicon Valley is the progressive face of capitalism. We’ve experienced it, intimately. Billions of people, across the globe, enjoy real benefits from searching the world’s information, connecting with people across time and space, and carrying a supercomputers in their pockets. Silicon Valley doesn’t obviously throw workers into factories and mines for endless hours on low pay; such images are hidden, rendered distant by the supply chain . Instead, the Valley, in our imaginations, is populated by knowledge workers, a diverse and smart workforce that designs, solves, and codes in humane office spaces, with above average wages, ping pong, cafeterias, flexible working hours, sleeping cubicles. What’s not to like?</p><p>We could consider the Valley’s hidden workers, those who clean, wait tables, wash cars, nanny, deliver packages, tend gardens, fix infrastructure for poverty wages; we could explore the trailer parks down the road from Google HQ, or document the shootings in the streets, the homeless that push shopping trolleys up and down the El Camino, their world a bundle of rags; or the gun shops that sell semi-automatics, the out-of-control, over-staffed police, armed with military-grade cast-me-downs, that regularly gun down the poor; the families crowded into small apartments, the father who spends his days scouring trash bins for recyclable bottles to trade for cash, the human trafficking of women, the prostitution, coerced to serve a predominately male workforce; or the disciplining and harassment of the undocumented, the deportations, the splitting up and destruction of families; or the local charities that collect food for kids, during seasonal holidays, since outside of school time their families cannot provide; or the extraordinarily high incarceration rates that control the surplus labour force, the armed guards on campuses and in schools, office complexes and shop interiors; or the poverty, the child who cannot concentrate in class since their teeth are rotting in their mouth, the extreme and devastating inequalities in wealth and income, the untreated illnesses and injuries, for lack of medical access, the widespread use of antidepressants, the addictions, the dispossessed, the broken dreams and the crying … </p><p>Yet these symptoms of a broken and decaying society are studiously ignored, repressed, unmentioned by Silicon Valley’s middle and upper classes. Psychological repression is widespread amongst the highly paid of the Valley. It’s a defence: it’s just too damn painful to contemplate the full horror of social reality. And life can be organised to avoid it, or deny it. So many don’t even notice.</p><p>I could mention all the evil business models, where vast computing power and fancy algorithms trawl our digital footprints to track and surveil, to sell and manipulate, to intensify our addictions; and we might reflect on the Valley’s enormous and continuing contributions to building military  machines that rain down death and destruction. </p><p>Instead, here, in this article, I want to point to the root problem, <em>the ultimate source of evil</em>, and explain why Silicon Valley is hypocrisy on a grand scale. The Valley’s movers and shakers believe they are progressive, that entrepreneurial capitalism is the road to utopia. But it’s not. In fact, the opposite is the case: the Valley is a cause of this horror, of the social ills, and the social breakdown that it must repress: it is both responsible and culpable for creating a dystopia.</p><p>I want all the talented, hopeful, optimistic high-tech workers, who genuinely want to make the world a better place, who are about to found a new and exciting startup, to just take a short pause, to stop, look around, think, reflect and reconsider: <em>the kind of firm you incorporate, the institutional rules you adopt, is precisely the choice point between doing evil and doing good</em>.</p><p>I will try to explain. My apologies if it takes a little while, since if the following facts were readily understood and generally accepted, then Silicon Valley would already be good, not evil, and I wouldn’t need to explain.</p><h2>Silicon Valley: midwife of the capitalist firm</h2><p>The Valley is all about startups. They spring up all the time. New exciting and hopeful adventures. It’s like forming a band, but better.</p><p>In huge, mature corporations the social relations of production are obscured by layers of hierarchy and absentee ownership. But in a startup the power relations are direct and visible, and often share an office with you. You can observe the basic unit of production in capitalism—the capitalist firm—as if under a microscope.</p><p>Let’s lay out the property relations of a (slightly simplified) typical startup. </p><p>The startup has owner(s), usually “high net worth” individuals, either directly present or indirectly in the form of venture capital firms. Venture capital provides the initial funds for the new venture. The actual founders, the ones with the ideas and talent, but no money, also part own the firm. The divvying up of the initial share issue between founders and early investors is a detail. The founders, armed with a new injection of capital, then recruit workers by convincing them of “the vision”. These are the first employees. And off we go. </p><p>The owner(s) of the startup are in complete control, and their decisions are final. Owners can promote, demote, hire and fire anyone, at any time. Owners set wage levels, which are kept secret (and the workers, being earnest and highly disciplined, avoid this subject with each other—that would break a taboo). Startups are definitely not run on democratic lines: workers don’t get to appoint managers, set strategy, or distribute profits. Instead, the startup is a mini dictatorship: sure, there’s plenty of technical debate, and back-and-forth, and head scratching, but ultimately it’s a dictatorship.</p><p>The owners pays all input costs—such as office rental, computers, electricity and heating, labour etc. They own all outputs, such as new software or hardware, and any inventions (which, in the Valley, are aggressively patented). The owners are liable for any profits and losses of the company. The startup’s bank accounts are hidden from the workers, and out of their control.</p><p>This basic social relation—between profit-taking capitalist owners and wage-earning workers—is constitutive of capitalism. For example, today you can travel to Shropshire, England, and visit Ironbridge village, one of the birthplaces of the industrial revolution and “the silicon valley of the 1800s”. You can tour an early ironworks and see the great furnaces where workers toiled, the tiny administrative office (to dole out wages, and keep accounts), and nearby, on a large hill overlooking the site, the capitalists’ large and imposing mansions.</p><p>The form may have changed, but not the content. In this sense, Silicon Valley is deeply conservative. It proclaims to disrupt everything, and make all fresh, new and shiny—except this basic social relationship.</p><p>Almost all Silicon Valley workers accept these social relations as entirely natural, acceptable, and pretty much fair and equitable. The owners fund the company. They therefore “own the firm”. The owners risk a lot of capital, and the workers receive a good wage, based on supply and demand in the marketplace, plus some ramp-up time to try and invent new stuff, which is fun. What’s not to like? What’s the problem?</p><h2>Silicon Valley: it’s theft all the way down</h2><p>Startups reproduce, in embryo form, the wage system, where the capitalist owner hires-in labour at a pre-agreed rental price. In a capitalist firm, labour is just an another  cost of production. The workers mix their labour with inputs and produce an output for sale. Normally, firms sell at prices that exceed their costs of production, which includes the cost of used-up inputs, rent, interest on capital loans, and wage costs etc. Any residual income then gets distributed as profit to the owner, or owners, of the firm.</p><p>Imagine that you and I agree to exchange something in the marketplace, say a second-hand iPhone on Ebay. You get the money, I get an iPhone. You may get a good deal, or I may get a good deal, depending on our “higgling and haggling” in the marketplace. Whether a fair price is struck, or not, there’s an exchange of something for something: some goods for some money. This social transaction satisfies a “principle of exchange”. We’ve swapped stuff, and no-one forced us to.</p><p>But let’s say I just took the iPhone from you. And you received no money at all. This violates the principle of exchange. I got something for nothing: some goods, some resources, for free. That’s theft. Obviously so.</p><p><em>All startups in Silicon Valley violate the principle of exchange and institute a system of theft</em>. They are theft-based institutions. If the startup is successful and grows, so does the theft, since theft is baked into the institutional structure of the firm, right from the get go. If the startup goes global, like an Apple, Facebook, or Google, then the cancer spreads and the theft takes place on a global scale.</p><p>But the theft is hidden. We need some reflection to really see it.</p><p>The workers in a startup are the actual cause of any profits it makes. We can demonstrate this with a simple thought experiment: imagine the workers stopped working. Would the firm have any possibility of making a profit, or if already profitable, continue to make that profit? But we don’t need to imagine. This is called a strike. And owners hate it, since it kills their profit.</p><p>So, in any company, including a startup, the workers create the value. </p><p>What, then, do the owners contribute or create?</p><p>The owners, or venture capitalists, contribute capital. They advance money to fund the startup until it (hopefully) starts making money. And then they expect a return. Since they’ve given something they should definitely get something back, otherwise we violate the principle of exchange. In fact, they should expect repayment of the sums advanced and—let’s be generous here—also a risk premium (since most startups fail without making profit) and, also—in order to be really straight and fair about this—some collateral as security (such as first dibs on any outstanding assets if the venture fails). This seems like a fair exchange.</p><p>But if early investors merely did this—that is, simply advance some —they would not become the owners of the firm. Once the startup made money, the loan would be repaid (by the firm), and the early investors would have no further claims on the fruits of others’ labour (that is the value created by the workers).</p><p>The important point is this: loan capital does not violate the principle of exchange.</p><p>But Silicon Valley startups are not funded by loan capital. Venture capitalists want, and get, much more than this. They advance capital to a firm, but in addition to being repaid, they demand ownership of the firm, i.e. , and receive stock (shares in the firm). And so they “own the firm”. In consequence, once their initial loan and risk premium is repaid, they get even more: they retain a claim on the firm’s future income, that is the fruits of others’ labour  (or until the firm dissolves, or they sell their shares etc.)</p><p>And the mere legal ownership of a firm is  to lay claim on its profit. And, right here, is precisely the moment when the principle of exchange is violated. Once the firm repays its debt then the early investors are now made whole. Beyond this point, we have workers creating profits, and owners appropriating that profit without needing to contribute an hour of their time, or a dime from their pockets. The owners are getting something for nothing. The owners can, as John Stuart Mill put it: “grow richer, as it were in their sleep”. There’s no exchange. Just appropriation. And that is what’s commonly, and accurately, called economic exploitation.</p><p>The important point is this: equity capital violates the principle of exchange. </p><p>Sometimes the meaning of a social situation can suddenly flip. You notice something new, like an object in the wrong place, or a small inconsistency that points to a secret, or a lie. This is one of those occasions. There’s an enormous difference between  capital to a firm, and  a firm. This vital distinction is conspicuously absent from all the upbeat, world-changing, and progressive chit-chat in the coffee shops, restaurants, offices and homes of Silicon Valley. So let’s pretend they might be listening, that all their chatter stops, just for a moment, and we whisper into each and every individual ear: . </p><p>When you take profits, but contribute  to the output of a firm, other than holding a paper claim, you are stealing.</p><p>Yet this is how startups in Silicon Valley are organised. Cohort after cohort of “smart” groups of highly educated workers are quite happy to sign up to their own exploitation, and cede control over how they organise their working day, and what they produce. The most effective prison is the one you don’t realise you’re in.</p><p>But hold on. Look, we’ve woken the libertarian consciousness of Silicon Valley, and its rationality is strong and terrible: those that were whispered to have been stirred, and they reply, in unison: No-one forces workers to accept these terms, and the wage contract is voluntary, and therefore perfectly OK! Go away, annoying socialist, and stop spoiling our fun!</p><h2>Silicon Valley: forcing people to sell their labour</h2><p>Do workers freely enter into the wage contract? Do founders, with great ideas, have the freedom to start new commercial ventures that aren’t based on theft? To answer, let’s first define non-exploitative social relations of production.</p><p>In principle, Silicon Valley startups could be incorporated as profit-sharing worker cooperatives. In this type of institution, all working members share the profit, which is democratically distributed. So if you join the co-op, you get a say, and you get profit shares. If you leave, you don’t anymore. The firm is collectively owned by its current working members.</p><p>Worker co-ops don’t hire in labour at a pre-agreed rental price. They do the opposite. They hire-in capital at a pre-agreed rental price (i.e., raise loan capital  equity capital). So capital, not labour, is merely another  cost of production with no claim on the residual income of the firm.</p><p>In a democratic worker co-op, the principle of exchange is not violated, and no-one systematically exploits others and steals the value they (jointly) created. Clearly, this is a more lucrative deal for workers: profit-sharing is better than a wage. So why doesn’t this happen in the Valley? Why don’t lots of workers incorporate worker co-ops? </p><p>There are some carrots and a stick.</p><h3>The carrot: join us, join us!</h3><p>High-tech workers, especially those with in-demand skills, get more than wages, they get stock options.</p><p>A stock option bestows the right to purchase company shares at a (very low) predefined price. You have to work, normally for many years, before you can exercise that right. The aim is worker retention, and align incentives so workers are motivated to create profits “for the company”. Stock options, in a sense, automatically bestow the material benefits of trade unionism without the need to organise. Any worker is, of course, glad of this potential source of additional income.</p><p>But stock options, when exercised, are equity capital and confer (part) ownership of the firm: and, as we’ve seen, that fundamentally means participating in theft. Stock options, therefore, invite a section of the working class to join the elevated ranks of the capitalist class, and start exploiting others’ labour. (In practice, most stock options turn out worthless, since most new ventures fail. But it’s the hope that motivates).</p><p>In a small startup, as is common in Silicon Valley, it’s especially clear that the workers create all the added value. But the owner(s) appropriate it. So even the best educated minds start to notice. And this doesn’t seem entirely fair. So stock options function to muddy the waters, and paper over the inconvenient truth of exploitation.</p><p>So that’s one carrot, which pushes high-tech workers to sign-up to a capitalist firm. But there are more. If a group of workers decide to incorporate a new venture then, unless they are highly politically conscious and especially moral creatures, they will incorporate a capitalist firm, not a worker co-op. Why? Because you’ll definitely make more money by owning a firm, paying others wages, and keeping the profit to yourself.</p><p>Many startup founders in Silicon Valley know they’re ripping off the workers they employ. They might soothe their guilt by pointing out they offer stock options, or throw themselves into libertarianism, which conveniently coincides with their material interests. But it’s a fact that stock is normally heavily concentrated amongst a few early founders and venture capitalists. As time goes on, the founders contributions are eclipsed by the hired workers, and then it’s just exploitation all down the line. The company is bought-out, the founders get their initial advances and more, and therefore cash in, and make their millions. But, in almost all cases, they did not contribute to the creation of that value—they stole it from the workers they hired.</p><p>So the wage contract is sweetened by stock options. That works. But the contract is only voluntary if the workers have other options, if they have a choice. Do they?</p><h3>The stick: reproduce capitalism or wither and die</h3><p>But there are sticks too, which remove all choice, and prevent founders from incorporating worker co-operatives, even if they were sufficiently politically conscious to want to. </p><p>Silicon Valley is famous for its vibrant and extensive venture capital community. Plenty of capital swills around, continually searching, like Sauron’s great eye, for the latest hit company to fund, and therefore own and exploit the efforts and creativity of hundreds and thousands of workers.</p><p>Any venture capitalist, quite naturally, wants to maximise their returns. So, if faced with a choice between funding two companies, A and B, where A is a capitalist firm, and therefore offers equity in return for capital, whereas B is a worker co-op, and only offers interest repayments in return for capital, then the venture capitalist will always opt to fund A. No contest. Equity capital is strictly a better deal than loan capital. (And it’s not just more money, but also top-down dictatorial control of the company’s direction, and the working conditions and wage levels of employees. And being powerful is much more fun than being powerless. It’s great for the ego.)</p><p>Hence worker co-ops don’t get funded in Silicon Valley, and never will. So all those talented and creative workers, with good ideas for making things that people want, have no choice but to incorporate a capitalist firm, and begin sorting people into a class of owners, and a class of workers.</p><p>I witnessed an especially ugly example at an Silicon Valley business conference. An “Angel Investor” (someone who provides early seed capital) presented a talk about the criteria they apply when deciding which new ventures to invest in, and therefore what aspiring founders should do in order to maximise their chances of raising capital. A big factor, for the Angel, was that founders also raise money from friends and family, since “the desire to not disappoint loved ones is a great stimulant to hard work”. The Angel gave examples of “great stories” about teams they’d funded and the great returns made “by everybody”. At the close the Angel invited any founders in the audience to come and pitch their ideas to him—right there and then.</p><p>A line of about twenty or so young people formed in front of the Angel, desperate to get funding for their cherished ideas. And there it was, like a frozen scene from a perverted nativity: an anointed minority of one, with the monopoly on capital, and an unwashed majority, full of aspirations and creativity, lining up, cap-in-hand, to proffer the sacrifice of equity in their newborn, and surrender themselves to exploitation.</p><p>There was no choice, there is no choice: either submit to capital or watch your ideas wither and die. There are no other practical ways to raise significant capital. Real Angels don’t exist: those that ask only for their loan to be repaid, and not ownership of the firm; who reject the social relationship of equity capital, and therefore only invest in new ventures that incorporate as democratic worker-owned co-ops, so that all profit is shared, according to actual merit and contribution. If such fabled beings were present, the line before them would have been much, much longer.</p><p>There is no choice. Founders must incorporate capitalist firms, and must rent-in labour. And workers, who need income, don’t have the option to join a worker co-op. They must sign the wage contract. This isn’t voluntary, it’s coerced—by those with the monopoly on capital.</p><p>Silicon Valley culture celebrates venture capital, the Schumpeterian heroic entrepreneur, the dynamism of capitalism, and the gee-whiz technical and creative ideas of startup founders. But Silicon Valley repeatedly and continually reproduces exploitation, where some members of the firm own it, and others simply rent their labour to it. There’s zero innovation or disruption in this sphere. The Valley is a great engine, churning out new companies, day after day, which reproduce the division between an economic class that wins, and an economic class that loses.</p><p>Economic inequality has always been around. But notably, in the last 30 years or so, economic inequality, in the rich countries, has significantly increased. So we find people at the bottom struggling for food and shelter, while those at the top earn many years worth of the average salary while they sleep. The majority in the middle work hard yet lack savings, living their entire lives a few paychecks from destitution.</p><p>Things have got so bad that even mainstream discourse has shifted to reflect the new reality. We’re routinely told that millennials face low wages, poor quality jobs, high debt, and worse economic outcomes compared to their parents. People now accept that the political system is rigged by a rich elite who’ve captured the institutions of the nation state. And even the arch conservative world of academic economics talks about inequality. And that simply didn’t happen as recently as ten years ago.</p><p>Bourgeois thinkers struggle to explain the major cause of economic inequality, because to do requires thinking deeply about property relations and the issue of systematic exploitation. Instead, they prefer to think about unequal human capital endowments, taxation policies, interest and growth rates, the saving habits of workers, rising costs in child and health care, or the impact of automation. They’ll think about anything and everything except the actual reason for inequality.</p><p>Capitalist firms, in an important sense, are social machines, institutions that operate within the context of a market economy to “sort” individuals into different classes by means of the wage system. This sorting produces a very specific income and wealth distribution, which is peculiar to capitalism. Empirically, capitalist societies exhibit two distinct regimes: a lognormal distribution of wage income, and a Pareto distribution of profit income.</p><p>In any dynamic society, with a continual reallocation of the division of labour as new skills are demanded and other skills are automated or changed, we should expect some level of wage inequality due to mismatches between supply and demand in the labour market. Also, some jobs are terrible and dangerous, and people should get more for risking more. And some people really do contribute more within the workplace, and its OK if they get additional awards from their peers, if only to make sure they stick around. And some people actually need more, perhaps due to illness or disabilities or additional domestic responsibilities. All this is fine.</p><p>But, empirically, we see more than wage inequality. We see two distinct regimes. We see a majority earning wages, at the bottom of the scale, and a minority taking profits, at the top of the scale. Capitalist societies produce extreme inequalities where the top 10% or so take a big and disproportionate slice of the social pie.</p><p>And the reason is obvious, for those willing to look: the major cause of economic inequality is the wage system itself. The more workers a capitalist exploits the more profit they make. The more profit they make the more workers they can exploit. And capitalists in the super-rich bracket enjoy positive feedback effects. They can hardly lose. The economic game is entirely rigged in their favour. And, in this elevated state, they fall asleep, wake up the next morning, having earned more than workers do in their entire lifetimes.</p><p>In fact, the inequality between capitalists far exceeds the inequality between workers. The super-rich become astronomically rich as we bounce along the power-law tail of the Pareto distribution. The astronomically rich capture ostensibly democratic institutions, a phenomenon that is particularly clear in the USA, so that even mild social reforms are off the table. We’ve seen a collection of post-war policies, that once mitigated economic inequality, ditched in the last thirty years or so. This is why things have got even worse. Economic exploitation has increased.</p><p>Extreme economic inequality causes untold misery. At the top we see excessive and wasteful hyper-consumption. At the bottom, countless everyday struggles to live a dignified life. All the social ills of Silicon Valley, many of which are hidden in plain sight, are suffered mostly by the poorly paid, those with the least money. But inequality affects everyone. Societies with high Gini coefficients do worse on almost all measures of social well-being.</p><p>But it doesn’t have to be this way. Let’s imagine an impossible event, just for the sake of illustrating a point. Imagine that all the people we whispered to—in the cafes, the offices and homes of Silicon Valley—actually listened, and decided, right there and then, to abolish exploitation, and resolved, with great determination, to only ever incorporate worker co-ops, and only lend capital, and never demand equity, then—with one decisive and unlikely step—Silicon Valley would actually begin to do good. Because it’s at this precise pivotal moment—the birth of a new productive unit—that a society’s social relations of production either get reproduced, or changed. For once you start to abolish the wage contract, and the renting of human beings, you start to abolish economic classes and extreme income inequality. Wealth would then start to be shared more equitably, and fairly, upon the principle of exchange, according to actual contributions to production, and not specious paper claims. The Pareto upper-regime would lose its material basis, would totter and fall, and therewith all the power that goes with it, the ability to capture and corrupt democracies and run them for the benefit of a privileged and undeserving few. The majority of the population would have more, enjoy more, and live better.</p><p>You know, perhaps some really gifted entrepreneurs could figure out a way to export this culture, and good social outcomes, to the rest of the world. </p><h2>Silicon Valley: bullshit progressivism</h2><p>But sadly, as of today, that is a dream. And it’s not even a dream that’s widely shared. Silicon Valley does not see the connection between the kinds of firms it funds and creates, and the kinds of social ills that surround it.</p><p>But why single out Silicon Valley? What I’ve just described applies to capitalism in general.\nSilicon Valley deserves especial opprobrium because the contradiction between its self-image and its reality is particularly stark. Silicon Valley desperately, desperately wants to view itself, and be seen as, socially progressive, enlightened, cutting-edge and, yes, utopian.</p><p>But despite the explosion of ideas and firms, and the progressive rhetoric, the core propositions of capitalism are completely untouched, inviolate. The coupling of radical technical experimentation, with extreme conservation of capitalist property relations, has been a very successful recipe for the Valley’s elite.</p><p>But the very startups that want to “change the world for the better” immediately reproduce economic exploitation: they separate human beings into a class that must rent their labour, and a class that appropriates the fruits of that labour; a class that is disciplined and must do as they are told in the workplace, and a class that disciplines and commands without democratic control. Every time an optimistic and earnest group of workers, with some great ideas, incorporate a startup and issue equity, any progressive content of those ideas are irreparably harmed.</p><p>Yet this is the specific evil that Silicon Valley does: it funnels the progressive content of technical utopianism (the increase in the forces of production) into institutions that exploit workers on a global scale, and contribute to extreme economic inequality (the existing social relations of production). Silicon Valley helps produce the dystopia we live in. It doesn’t change the world for the better. It makes it worse, every single day.</p><p>The narcissistic self-image of Valley culture contributes to its political backwardness. Some workers celebrate a victory when corporate HR departments commit to diversity in the workplace, or promise to address the gender pay gap. But these are easy concessions for capitalism, softballs, and the owners of your firm will happily accommodate you. Just don’t ask for bottom-up democracy in the workplace, or profit-sharing. Try it. You’ll get a very different response.</p><p>But that’s what I do wish for. And I’m talking to you now, fellow workers of the Valley! If you really want to do no evil, to be good, disrupt the status quo and make the world a better place, then <em>don’t create a capitalist firm</em>: it’s a top-down dictatorship, where the dictators steal the money. There’s nothing progressive about this kind of social institution. Founding such a startup is deeply unethical, represents institutionalised theft, and is a prime cause of diverse social ills. </p><p>Instead, use your talents to create democratic worker-owned cooperatives, based on equality among its working members; or help think of creative ways to solve the political problem of capitalists’ monopoly on capital. Abolishing economic exploitation genuinely makes the world a better place. Reproducing it in your startup does not.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Or, at the very least, they can.</p><p>Recently I got a friend to finally join me on Signal. He asked something about whether or not Signal is truly secure and private, like if it was safe from US government surveillance. I told him: <em>“Well, it’s end-to-end encrypted, so they don’t know  we’re talking about, but they definitely know that we’re talking to each other.”</em></p><p>I said that because Signal uses our phone numbers as ID’s. So, Signal would know that Phone Number A is talking to Phone Number B, and if they can figure out that Phone Number A belongs to me, and Phone Number B belongs to my buddy (usually not too hard to figure out with some OSINT or the assistance of certain governments), then Signal would know that my buddy and I are talking, even if they don’t know what we’re talking about.</p><p>This is a limit of end-to-end encryption, which I’ve <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://sanesecurityguy.com/articles/the-limits-of-end-to-end-encryption/\" target=\"_blank\">talked about before</a>. End-to-end encryption provides confidentiality of data, but not anonymity or protection from identifying metadata.</p><p>However, I was surprised when my friend got back to me saying that, no, Signal actually doesn’t know who’s talking to who because of this feature called “<a href=\"https://signal.org/blog/sealed-sender/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Sealed Sender</a>“.</p><p><em>“Woah! Seriously?! Cool!”</em> I thought. But then I started reading how Sealed Sender actually works, according to none other than Signal themselves, and I found that this feature is very technically complex, and .</p><blockquote><p>ʕ ಠ ᴥಠ ʔ: Woah! Seriously?! Not cool!</p></blockquote><h2>One-way anonymity for two-way communications</h2><p>While Sealed Sender is pretty complicated under the hood, the result of it is one-way anonymity. That means that, when Phone Number A sends a message to Phone Number B, Signal won’t know that the message is coming from Phone Number A and will only know that the message is to be delivered to Phone Number B.</p><p>It does this in a way that’s very similar to snail mail without a return address: the letter inside the mail envelope might tell the recipient who the sender is, but the mail envelope itself tells the post office only who the recipient is so that it can be delivered to them. If the post office doesn’t or can’t open the envelope to read the letter itself, then they don’t know who the sender is. Later on, when the recipient wants to send a reply to the sender, they can do the same thing.</p><blockquote><p>ʕ·ᴥ·ʔ: Hm, okay. This kind of sounds like it’s anonymous.</p></blockquote><p>Well, yes, it sort of is, but only when there’s only one message to be sent. The problem comes up when multiple messages are being sent back-and-forth like this.</p><p>Sticking with the snail mail analogy, what happens when two pen pals keep sending mail to each other from their homes without including return addresses in their envelopes? The postal service might not know who exactly is sending each piece of mail but, over time, they would know that <strong>Address A in Lower Manhattan</strong>, New York, keeps on getting one-way mail from the post office in 3630 East Tremont Avenue, , New York; and  keeps on getting one-way mail from the post office in 350 Canal Street, .</p><blockquote><p>ʕ´•ᴥ•`ʔ: Oh. Then the postal service would be pretty sure that whoever is living at Address A and Address B are talking to each other.</p></blockquote><p>Exactly. That’s the limitation of one-way anonymity:  Once you start doing two-way communications, with replies going back-and-forth, then one-way anonymity is useless.</p><p>With multiple messages being sent back-and-forth over time, and with Signal knowing <em>only the recipient phone number</em> of each message, it would be pretty hard for Signal to figure out who’s talking to who when their servers are getting thousands of messages every second from different senders, with each message being conveyed to thousands of different recipients. But, Signal doesn’t know <em>only the recipient phone number</em> of each message; they also know the IP address of each sender. And this is where the snail mail analogy fails, because IP addresses are  than post offices.</p><p>Signal messages, as we all know, get sent over the internet, and the internet sends data around using IP addresses. Sealed Sender only protects the sender’s phone number; it does not protect the sender’s IP address. So, if you’re sending Signal messages to your super secret pen pal from your house, and you aren’t using a VPN or Tor, then Signal knows that the messages being sent to your pen pal’s phone number are coming from your house’s IP address (not a post office, your house).</p><p>Even if you are using some method of masking your real IP address, you still have to use  IP address in order to communicate on the internet, and Signal will see that <em>the same IP address keeps on sending messages to the same phone number</em>. That’s enough to easily figure out that all of these different messages meant for the recipient are coming from the same sender. Sure, maybe you’re using the IP address of a VPN server or Tor exit node that has other Signal users sending messages at the same time, but that’s extremely unlikely. More likely: Even when you use a VPN or Tor, Signal can easily tell that every Sealed Sender message you’re sending to your pen pal are coming from one person: you.</p><p>And if your pen pal replies, the reply will have his IP address on it (the same IP address Signal sent your messages to) and your phone number on it. And then, when you want to receive the reply, you have to connect to Signal’s servers using, again, your IP address (the same IP address you used to send your messages to your pen pal earlier). Just like that, with two messages, Signal figured out which phone number (yours) is talking to which other phone number (your pen pal’s). If they ever decide to try and figure out who own these two phone numbers, they could ask your telecoms, or simply search Facebook and Twitter.</p><p>You can’t avoid using IP addresses on the internet; they are a necessity on the internet. But you can use a VPN or Tor to mask your real IP address with a fake one that’s not tied to your identity. <strong>But you can’t do that with phone numbers.</strong> A phone number is either tied to your identity or it isn’t; there is no masking possible, unless you use a service like <a href=\"https://mysudo.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">MySudo</a> which <a href=\"https://mysudo.com/mysudo-plans/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">isn’t available for most of us</a> (US and Canada only, as of this writing). If you’re fortunate enough to be able to buy a prepaid SIM without ID, then great, all you and your pen pal have to do is buy some SIM cards that aren’t tied to your identities. If buying a prepaid SIM without ID ain’t an option, then your phone number has to be tied to your identity, and Signal can use these unmasked phone numbers, in combination with masked or unmasked IP addresses, to figure out who’s talking to who, <em>despite Sealed Sender’s promises</em>, as long as there’s a two-way conversation going on.</p><p>Which brings up an interesting question: <strong>Why does Signal require phone numbers?</strong></p><blockquote><p>ʕ´•ᴥ•`ʔ: Hey, that is an interesting question…</p></blockquote><p>Signal works over the internet, and the internet requires IP (internet protocol) addresses in order to figure out where a message should go. But sending messages over the internet  require phone numbers; that’s a requirement when using SMS or cellular calls or mobile data, <strong>but not for using the internet</strong>. And yet, the “privacy-protecting” Signal app requires you to use a phone number to send and receive messages…</p><h2>It’s always a two-way street</h2><p>It gets worse. I keep repeating this: . Sealed Sender doesn’t work with . But, I’ve kind of been lying. The truth is: <strong>Signal already knows which phone numbers have been talking to which, even with Sealed Sender and only one-way communication.</strong></p><p>Do these check marks look familiar to you? (Forgive the pixelation.)</p><blockquote><p>ʕ·ᴥ·ʔ: Hm, yeah. Aren’t they the check marks that show up for at least a second whenever I send a Signal message? This is what’s shown after the lone check mark, and before they both turn white to indicate that my message was read, right?</p></blockquote><p>That’s right. The lone check mark indicates that your Signal message was sent to Signal’s servers, these two check marks above indicate that your Signal message has been delivered to the recipient, and the two white check marks indicate that the recipient has read your Signal message.</p><p>Now, the thing about the two check marks above is that your Signal app only shows them when your phone has received what’s called a “delivery receipt” from the recipient’s phone. Whenever your pen pal gets a message from you, their Signal app sends a delivery receipt from their phone, through Signal’s servers, to your phone. Their Signal app does this <em>automatically and instantly</em>, and neither of you can turn it off. You can turn off read receipts (the two white check marks) and typing indicators, but you can’t turn off the : delivery receipts.</p><p>The delivery receipt is –  – also “protected” using Sealed Sender, but what was it that I’ve been saying this whole time is wrong with Sealed Sender?</p><blockquote><p>ʕ·ᴥ·ʔ: It works only one-way…</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>ʕ&nbsp;&nbsp; • ᴥ • &nbsp;&nbsp;ʔ: It works only one-way…</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>ʕ&nbsp;&nbsp; º ᴥ º &nbsp;&nbsp;ʔ: …and the delivery receipt automatically makes it two-way.</p></blockquote><p>Exactly. And you can’t turn it off. Go figure why.</p><h2>Some alternatives and a work in progress</h2><p>So if you can’t trust Signal, who can you trust? Well, if all you need is a private text-based communication channel that won’t falsely advertise their privacy guarantees to you, <a href=\"https://proton.me/mail\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Proton Mail</a> and <a href=\"https://tuta.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Tutanota</a> (now called Tuta) are pretty good. But if you want private voice-based communication, then that’s gonna’ be a problem. WhatsApp is even worse than Signal, Telegram is <a href=\"https://sanesecurityguy.com/articles/the-limits-of-end-to-end-encryption/#end-to-end-apps\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">even worse than WhatsApp</a>, Wire requires an email address to use it (another unnecessary requirement), and most of the rest can’t be trusted because they aren’t open-source.</p><p>You could use <a href=\"https://meet.jit.si/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Jitsi</a> for voice communications, but you’d have to use a separate service for text communications. You could use <a href=\"https://matrix.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Matrix</a> for both text and voice, but that’s a software and communication protocol, so you’d have to set up your own server running it. You could use <a href=\"https://element.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Element</a>, which runs Matrix servers, but you’d have to <a href=\"https://element.io/privacy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">trust Amazon and Cloudflare</a> with your metadata, making this a rather messy solution to a privacy problem.</p><p>What that leaves us with is a single service that is still a work in progress: <a href=\"https://simplex.chat/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">SimpleX</a>. It asks for no global identifiers like phone numbers or email addresses. It at least tries, unlike Signal, <em>to make sure that it doesn’t know who’s talking to who</em>. It does this with the use of proxies that you randomly send your messages through to get to your recipient (the <a href=\"https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplexmq/blob/master/protocol/overview-tjr.md#technical-details\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">technical details</a> of which are too complicated to get into here). Of course it is <a href=\"https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplex-chat\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">open-source</a> and end-to-end encrypted, otherwise I wouldn’t be mentioning it. It even goes so far as to  with it, or any <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOCKS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">SOCKS</a> proxy. It’s pretty cool, actually; the most technically amazing communications platform I’ve ever seen.</p><p>But, it ain’t perfect. It’s kinda’ slow, and messages sometimes don’t come in in the right order or don’t come in at all. Voice calls are… iffy, particularly when using Tor. It is still a young, developing project, though it has been making great strides in improving itself, including <a href=\"https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/SimpleXChat.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">getting a security audit</a>.</p><p>Time will tell how it turns out, but at least I can say one thing: we’ve got a viable alternative.</p><blockquote><p>ʕ •̀ᴥ•́ ʔ: Where have you been for the past 11 months?!</p></blockquote><p>I actually started writing this article months ago and then got busy again.</p><blockquote><p>ʕ ಠ ᴥಠ ʔ: Well at least visit me with some tips and tricks every once in a while.</p></blockquote><p>I’ll try, buddy, but real life comes first before imaginary friends.</p><blockquote><p>ʕ •̀ᴥ•́ ʔ: I know I’m imaginary, but are your subscribers?</p></blockquote><p>I dunno’. Maybe they should give me a hint by signing up below!</p><p>Or don’t; my RSS feed’s in the site menu. Unlike Signal, I don’t need you to sign up with a global identifier.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Recently I got around to making steps toward a better mobile-PC workflow. Until now, I’ve pretty much exclusively been using the community-developed <a href=\"https://github.com/orgzly-revived/orgzly-android-revived\">orgzly-revived</a> app on Android. My intention was to use orgzly-revived for simple todo management and another app for more note-taking purposes—but I could never find another app I was happy with on Android. But I happened to remember reading good things about the  Emacs app on Android a few months ago. So I tried it out… and was immediately sold!</p><h2><a href=\"https://kristofferbalintona.me/posts/202505291438/#the-good-and-bad-what-to-expect-on-android\"></a>The good and bad: what to expect on Android</h2><p>First, let’s make sure our expectations are tempered: Emacs on Android won’t be as pleasant as the full desktop experience. Of course. A phone’s screen is tiny, and unless you have a physical keyboard connected, you’ll have to manage with a virtual one (see <a href=\"https://kristofferbalintona.me/posts/202505291438/#use-a-special-virtual-keyboard\">Use a Special virtual keyboard</a>). On top of that:</p><dl><dd>To have non-Emacs programs available, you have to install Emacs in a particular way with Termux to expose Termux’s binaries to Emacs. (See <a href=\"https://kristofferbalintona.me/posts/202505291438/#option-2--recommended\">the recommended way to install Emacs</a>.) The initial set up is longer, but it’s worth it.</dd><dd>Android “sandboxes” each app. You can think of each app having their own “section” of the file system that they can read or write to (unless they are given explicit access to that outside directory; see <code>info \"(emacs) Android Document Providers\"</code>). As such, one finds themselves fiddling with the obnoxiously long Android file paths if they want to, for instance, access their notes directory that is outside the Emacs app sandbox. This is a minor inconvenience though.</dd><dd>Relatively speaking, writing to the file system can be long sometimes. Not too long, but long nonetheless, As far as I’ve experienced, this has only been the case when saving files that are outside the Emacs sandbox.</dd></dl><p>So, really, the situation is pretty good!</p><p>And finally: YMMV on other Android devices. My current phone is the OnePlus 7 Pro running Android version 12.</p><p>The first option is as easy as it can get, but you won’t have a way to access other CLI tools:</p><ol><li>Download the <a href=\"https://f-droid.org/\">F-droid</a> app store. For the layperson who doesn’t know what it is: it’s basically an alternative to the Play Store. Some apps that can’t be on the Play Store (fact check, maybe link tk) are there.</li><li>Open Emacs! The version of Emacs as I write this that is available is Emacs 30.1.</li></ol><p>Using Emacs this way is totally possible if all you need is elisp. But if you need other tools, like git, I recommend the second way to install Emacs.</p><p>This option makes other CLI tools accessible to the Emacs Android application container. It is a little bit more of a hassle.</p><p>The method is <a href=\"https://sourceforge.net/projects/android-ports-for-gnu-emacs/files/termux/\">outlined in this SourceForge repository</a>. In essence, inside the  directory of this SourceForge repository are modified Emacs .apk files. These .apk files allow the Emacs app container to access the Termux (explain what Termux is tk) app container, meaning the CLI tools installed with Termux will become accessible to Emacs. But the installation is specific; read the instructions detailed inside that repository. I will outline them briefly below, but be careful if you are reading this in the future, for the instructions could have changed relevantly.</p><ol><li>Delete any existing Emacs or Termux apps.</li><li>Ensure you have enabled the setting that allows you to install third-party apps (i.e., non-Play Store apps) on your phone.</li><li>Install Termux. Don’t open Termux yet.</li><li>Select the .apk file appropriate to your phone. There are various .apk files for different versions of Emacs and devices.</li><li>Install Emacs through this .apk. (If your phone refuses to install the .apk, you might have selected the wrong type of .apk file for your device. So try different .apk files for the same Emacs version.)</li><li>In Termux, run . Say “yes” to each of the prompts.</li><li>Create a  and place the following inside of it:<div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><code data-lang=\"emacs-lisp\"></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></li><li>And you’re done! Programs installed through Termux will be made accessible to Emacs.</li></ol><h2><a href=\"https://kristofferbalintona.me/posts/202505291438/#configuring-an-android-specific-emacs\"></a>Configuring an Android-specific Emacs</h2><h3><a href=\"https://kristofferbalintona.me/posts/202505291438/#necessary-reading-the-manual\"></a>Necessary reading: the manual</h3><p>Chances are that you don’t know that the Emacs manual has its own section for the Android system: . Before anything, I highly recommend you peruse this section, returning to and reading more deeply specific parts as you see fit.

But I highly recommend that until you’ve settled on a configuration you’re willing to type out that you <strong>heavily utilize the customize interface</strong>. This means accessing the Customize interfaces via the tool-bar buttons then using your touchscreen to tap the buttons available in  buffers. (Then, if you prefer, after setting many options with Customize, you can refactor the options Customize put in your  into e.g. use-package forms.)</p><p>If you haven’t used Customize much before, you can check out the available Customize commands via  (), search for “customize.” The most useful commands are:</p><ul></ul><h3><a href=\"https://kristofferbalintona.me/posts/202505291438/#first-step-a-better-ui-for-touchscreens\"></a>First step: A Better UI for touchscreens</h3><p>The very first thing I did when I opened Emacs was enable these minor modes:</p><ul></ul><p>and set  to , placing it closer to where my fingers and the virtual keyboard are.</p><p>Desktop users might have disabled these years ago in favor of keyboard-centric workflow, but they are awesome for touchscreens in my opinion.</p><p>There are a few built-in Android commands and options you should be aware of.

For that, we install a virtual keyword that gives us easier access to modifier keys, function keys, arrow keys, and symbols. As far as I know, there are currently two main options:</p><p>Having briefly tried both, I personally prefer the latter. Though the former works just fine if you like it.</p><p>You might want a set of fonts not already installed on your Android system. If that’s the case, you should read the  manual page.</p><p>That page explains that if you want to install fonts for your user (in the Emacs app container), you should place them in . Getting those fonts was somewhat cumbersome for me: I had to manually download them, unzip them with Termux, place them inside a directory Emacs had access to (see <a href=\"https://kristofferbalintona.me/posts/202505291438/#android-specific-commands-and-options\">Android-specific Commands and Options</a>), then copy them to .</p><p>Note: in my experience, <em>fonts are not recursively checked inside this directory</em>.

      "content": "<p>I've been studying the standard cell circuitry in the Intel 386 processor recently.\nThe 386, introduced in 1985, was Intel's most complex processor at the time, containing 285,000 transistors.\nIntel's existing design techniques couldn't handle this complexity and the chip began to fall behind schedule.\nTo meet the schedule, the 386 team started using a technique called standard cell logic.\nInstead of laying out each transistor manually, the layout process was performed by a computer.</p><p>The idea behind standard cell logic is to create standardized circuits (standard cells) for each type of logic element, such\nas an inverter, NAND gate, or latch.\nYou feed your circuit description into software that selects the necessary cells, \npositions these cells into columns, and then routes the wiring between the cells.\nThis \"automatic place and route\" process creates the chip layout much faster than manual layout.\nHowever, switching to standard cells was a risky decision since if the software couldn't create a\ndense enough layout, the chip couldn't be manufactured.\nBut in the end, the 386 finished ahead of schedule, an almost unheard-of accomplishment.</p><p>The 386's standard cell circuitry contains a few circuits that I didn't expect.\nIn this blog post, I'll take a quick look at some of these circuits:\nsurprisingly large multiplexers, a transistor that doesn't fit into the standard cell layout,\nand inverters that turned out not to be inverters.\n(If you want more background on standard cells in the 386, see my earlier post,\n\"<a href=\"https://www.righto.com/2024/01/intel-386-standard-cells.html\">Reverse engineering standard cell logic in the Intel 386 processor</a>\".)</p><p>The photo below shows the 386 die with the automatic-place-and-route regions highlighted; I'm focusing\non the red region in the lower right.\nThese blocks of logic have cells arranged in rows, giving them a characteristic striped appearance.\nThe dark stripes are the transistors that make up the logic gates, while the lighter regions between the stripes are the\n\"routing channels\" that hold the wiring that connects the cells.\nIn comparison,\nfunctional blocks\nsuch as the datapath on the left\nand the microcode ROM in the lower right\nwere designed manually to optimize density and performance, giving them a more solid appearance.</p><div>The 386 die with the standard-cell regions highlighted.</div><p>As for other features on the chip,\nthe black circles around the border are bond wire connections that go to the chip's external pins.\nThe chip has two metal layers, a small number by modern\nstandards, but a jump from the single metal layer of earlier processors such as the 286.\n(Providing two layers of metal made automated routing practical: one layer can hold horizontal wires while the other layer\ncan hold vertical wires.)\nThe metal appears white in larger areas, but\npurplish where circuitry underneath roughens its surface.\nThe underlying silicon and the polysilicon wiring are obscured by the metal layers.</p><p>The standard cell circuitry that I'm examining (red box above) is part of the control logic that selects registers\nwhile executing an instruction.\nYou might think that it is easy to select which registers take part in an instruction, but\ndue to the complexity of the x86 architecture, it is more difficult.\nOne problem is that a 32-bit register such as EAX can also be treated as the 16-bit register AX,\nor two 8-bit registers AH and AL.\nA second problem is that some instructions include a \"direction\" bit that switches the source and\ndestination registers.\nMoreover, sometimes the register is specified by bits in the instruction, but in other cases,\nthe register is specified by the microcode.\nDue to these factors, selecting the registers for an operation is a complicated process with many\ncases, using control bits from the instruction, from the microcode, and from other sources.</p><p>Three registers need to be selected for an operation—two source registers and a destination register—and there\nare about 17 cases that need to be handled.\nRegisters are specified with 7-bit control signals that select one of the 30 registers and control\nwhich part of the register is accessed.\nWith three control signals, each 7 bits wide, and about 17 cases for each, you can see that\nthe register control logic is large and complicated.\n(I wrote more about the 386's registers <a href=\"https://www.righto.com/2025/05/intel-386-register-circuitry.html\">here</a>.)</p><p>I'm still reverse engineering the register control logic, so I won't go into details.\nInstead, I'll discuss how the register control circuit uses multiplexers, implemented with standard cells.\nA multiplexer is a circuit that combines multiple\ninput signals into a single output by selecting one of the inputs.\nA multiplexer can be implemented with logic gates, for instance, by ANDing each input with the\ncorresponding control line, and then ORing the results together.\nHowever, the 386 uses a different approach—CMOS switches—that avoids a large AND/OR gate.</p><div>Schematic of a CMOS switch.</div><p>The schematic above shows how a CMOS switch is constructed from two MOS transistors.\nWhen the two transistors are on, the output is connected to the input, but when the two transistors are\noff, the output is isolated.\nAn NMOS transistor is turned on when its input is high, but a PMOS transistor is turned on when its\ninput is . Thus, the switch uses two control inputs, one inverted.\nThe motivation for using two transistors is that an NMOS transistor is better at pulling the output\nlow, while a PMOS transistor is better at pulling the output high, so combining them yields the best performance.\nUnlike a logic gate, the CMOS switch has no amplification, so a signal is weakened as it passes through the switch.\nAs will be seen below, inverters can be used to amplify the signal.</p><p>The image below shows how CMOS switches appear under the microscope.\nThis image is very hard to interpret because the two layers of metal on the 386 are packed together densely, but you\ncan see that some wires run horizontally and others run vertically.\nThe bottom layer of metal (called M1) runs vertically in the routing area, as well as providing internal\nwiring for a cell.\nThe top layer of metal (M2) runs horizontally; unlike M1, the M2 wires can cross a cell.\nThe large circles are vias that connect the M1 and M2 layers, while the small circles are connections\nbetween M1 and polysilicon or M1 and silicon.\nThe central third of the image is a column of standard cells with two CMOS switches outlined in green.\nThe cells are bordered by the vertical ground rail and\n+5V rail that power the cells. \nThe routing areas are on either side of the cells, holding the wiring that connects the cells.</p><div>Two CMOS switches, highlighted in green. The lower switch is flipped vertically compared to the upper switch.</div><p>Removing the metal layers reveals the underlying silicon with a layer of polysilicon wiring on top.\nThe doped silicon regions show up as dark outlines.\nI've drawn the polysilicon in green; it forms a transistor (brighter green) when it crosses doped silicon.\nThe metal ground and power lines are shown in blue and red, respectively, with other metal wiring in purple.\nThe black dots are vias between layers.\nNote how metal wiring (purple) and polysilicon wiring (green) are combined to route signals within\nthe cell.\nAlthough this standard cell is complicated, the important thing is that it only needs to be designed once.\nThe standard cells for different functions are all designed to have the same width, so the cells can be arranged in\ncolumns, snapped together like Lego bricks.</p><div>A diagram showing the silicon for a standard-cell switch. The polysilicon is shown in green. The bottom metal is shown in blue, red, and purple.</div><p>To summarize, this switch circuit allows the input to be connected to the output or disconnected, controlled by the select signal.\nThis switch is more complicated than the earlier schematic because it includes two inverters to amplify\nthe signal.\nThe data input and the two select lines are connected to the polysilicon (green); the cell is designed so\nthese connections can be made on either side.\nAt the top, the input goes through a standard two-transistor inverter.\nThe lower left has two transistors, combining the NMOS half of an inverter with the NMOS half of the switch.\nA similar circuit on the right combines the PMOS part of an inverter and switch.\nHowever, because PMOS transistors are weaker, this part of the circuit is duplicated.</p><p>A multiplexer is constructed by combining multiple switches, one for each input.\nTurning on one switch will select the corresponding input.\nFor instance, a four-to-one multiplexer has four switches, so it can select one of the four inputs.</p><div>A four-way multiplexer constructed from CMOS switches and individual transistors.</div><p>The schematic above shows a hypothetical multiplexer with four inputs.\nOne optimization is that if an input is always 0, the PMOS transistor can be omitted. Likewise,\nif an input is always 1, the NMOS transistor can be omitted.\nOne set of select lines is activated at a time to select the corresponding input.\nThe pink circuit selects 1,\ngreen selects input A, yellow selects input B, and blue selects 0.\nThe multiplexers in the 386 are similar, but have more inputs.</p><p>The diagram below shows how much circuitry is devoted to multiplexers in this block of standard cells.\nThe green, purple, and red cells correspond to the multiplexers driving the three register control\noutputs.\nThe yellow cells are inverters that generate the inverted control signals for the CMOS switches.\nThis diagram also shows how the automatic layout of cells results in a layout that appears random.</p><div>A block of standard-cell logic with multiplexers highlighted. The metal and polysilicon layers were removed for this photo, revealing the silicon transistors.</div><p>The idea of standard-cell logic is that standardized cells are arranged in columns.\nThe space between the cells is the \"routing channel\", holding the wiring that links the cells.\nThe 386 circuitry follows this layout, except for one single transistor, sitting between two columns\nof cells.</p><div>The \"misplaced\" transistor, indicated by the arrow. The irregular green regions are oxide that was incompletely removed.</div><p>I wrote some software tools to help me analyze the standard cells. Unfortunately, my tools\nassumed that all the cells were in columns, so this one wayward transistor caused me considerable inconvenience.</p><p>The transistor turns out to be a PMOS transistor, pulling a signal high as part of a multiplexer.\nBut why is this transistor out of place?\nMy hypothesis is that the transistor is a bug fix.\nRegenerating the cell layout was very costly, taking many hours on an IBM mainframe computer.\nPresumably, someone found that they could just stick the necessary transistor into an unused spot in the\nrouting channel, manually add the necessary wiring, and avoid the delay of regenerating all the cells.</p><p>The simplest CMOS gate is the inverter, with an NMOS transistor to pull the output low and a\nPMOS transistor to pull the output high.\nThe standard cell circuitry that I examined contains over a hundred inverters of various\nsizes.\n(Performance is improved by using inverters that aren't too small but also aren't\nlarger than necessary for a particular circuit. Thus, the standard cell library includes inverters of multiple sizes.)</p><p>The image below shows a medium-sized standard-cell inverter under the microscope.\nFor this image, I removed the two metal layers with acid to show the underlying polysilicon\n(bright green) and silicon (gray).\nThe quality of this image is\npoor—it is difficult to remove the metal without destroying the polysilicon—but the diagram below\nshould clarify the circuit.\nThe inverter has two transistors: a PMOS transistor connected to +5 volts to pull the output high when\nthe input is 0, and an NMOS transistor connected to ground to pull the output low when the input is 1.\n(The PMOS transistor needs to be larger because PMOS transistors don't function as well as NMOS transistors due to\nsilicon physics.)</p><div>An inverter as seen on the die. The corresponding standard cell is shown below.</div><p>The polysilicon input line plays a key role: where it crosses the doped silicon, a transistor gate is\nformed.\nTo make the standard cell more flexible, the input to the inverter\ncan be connected on either the left or the right; in this case, the input\nis connected on the right and there is no connection on the left.\nThe inverter's output can be taken from the polysilicon on the upper left or the right, but in this case, it\nis taken from the upper metal layer (not shown).\nThe power, ground, and output lines are in the lower metal layer, which I have represented by\nthe thin red, blue, and yellow lines. The black circles are connections between the metal layer and\nthe underlying silicon.</p><p>This inverter appears dozens of times in the circuitry.\nHowever, I came across a few inverters that didn't make sense. The problem was\nthat the inverter's output was connected to the output of a multiplexer.\nSince an inverter is either on or off, its value would clobber the output of the multiplexer.\nThis didn't make any sense.\nI double- and triple-checked the wiring to make sure I hadn't messed up.\nAfter more investigation, I found another problem: the input to a \"bad\" inverter didn't make sense\neither. The input consisted of two signals shorted together, which doesn't work.</p><p>Finally, I realized what was going on. A \"bad inverter\" has the exact silicon layout of an inverter,\nbut it wasn't an inverter: it was independent NMOS and PMOS transistors with separate inputs.\nNow it all made sense.\nWith two inputs, the input signals were independent, not shorted together.\nAnd since the transistors were controlled separately, the NMOS transistor could pull the output\nlow in some circumstances, the PMOS transistor could pull the output high in other circumstances,\nor both transistors could be off, allowing the multiplexer's output to be used undisturbed.\nIn other words, the \"inverter\" was just two more cases for the multiplexer.</p><div>The \"bad\" inverter. (Image is flipped vertically for comparison with the previous inverter.)</div><p>If you compare the \"bad inverter\" cell below with the previous cell, they look  the same, but\nthere are subtle differences.\nFirst, the gates of the two transistors are connected in the real inverter, but disconnected\nby a small gap in the transistor pair.\nI've indicated this gap in the photo above; it is hard to tell if the gap is real or just an imaging\nartifact, so I didn't spot it.\nThe second difference is that the \"fake\" inverter has two input connections, one to each transistor,\nwhile the inverter has a single input connection.\nUnfortunately, I assumed that the two connections were just a trick to route the signal across\nthe inverter without requiring an extra wire.\nIn total, this cell was used 32 times as a real inverter and 9 times\nas independent transistors.</p><p>Standard cell logic and automatic place and route have a long history before the 386,\nback to the early 1970s, so this isn't an Intel invention.\nNonetheless, the 386 team deserves the credit for deciding to use this technology at a time when it\nwas a risky decision.\nThey needed to develop custom software for their placing and routing needs, so this wasn't a trivial undertaking.\nThis choice paid off and they completed the 386 ahead of schedule.\nThe 386 ended up being a huge success for Intel, moving the x86 architecture to 32 bits and defining the dominant computer\narchitecture for the rest of the 20th century.</p><p>If you're interested in standard cell logic, I also wrote about <a href=\"https://www.righto.com/2021/03/reverse-engineering-standard-cell-logic.html\">standard cell logic in an IBM chip</a>.\nI plan to write more about the 386, so \nfollow me on\n<a href=\"https://oldbytes.space/@kenshirriff\">Mastodon</a>, <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/righto.com\">Bluesky</a>,\nor RSS for updates.\nThanks to Pat Gelsinger and Roxanne Koester for providing helpful papers.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Today we’re introducing the proposal for the <a href=\"https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps\">MCP Apps Extension</a> (<a href=\"https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/1865\">SEP-1865</a>) to standardize support for interactive user interfaces in the Model Context Protocol.</p><p>This extension addresses one of the most requested features from the MCP community and builds on proven work from <a href=\"https://github.com/idosal/mcp-ui\">MCP-UI</a> and <a href=\"https://developers.openai.com/apps-sdk/\">OpenAI Apps SDK</a> - the <strong>ability for MCP servers to deliver interactive user interfaces to hosts</strong>.</p><p>MCP Apps Extension introduces a standardized pattern for declaring UI resources, linking them to tools, and enabling bidirectional communication between embedded interfaces and the host application.</p><p>The SEP was authored by MCP Core Maintainers at OpenAI and Anthropic, together with the MCP-UI creators and lead maintainers of the MCP UI Community Working Group.</p><h2>Standardization for interactive interfaces<a hidden=\"\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"http://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/2025-11-21-mcp-apps/#standardization-for-interactive-interfaces\">#</a></h2><p>Currently, MCP servers are limited to exchanging text and structured data with hosts. While this works well for many use cases, it creates friction when tools need to present visual information or gather complex user input.</p><p>For example, consider a data visualization MCP server that returns chart data as JSON. The host application must interpret that data and render it. Handling all kinds of specialized data in this scenario translates to a significant burden for client developers, who would need to build their own logic to render the UI. As more UI requirements come up, like the need to collect multiple related settings from users, the complexity balloons. Alternatively, without UI support, these interactions become awkward exchanges of text prompts and responses.</p><p>The MCP community has been creative in working around these limitations, but different implementations using varying conventions and architectures make it harder for servers to work consistently across clients. This lack of standardization creates a real risk of ecosystem fragmentation - something we’re working to proactively prevent.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/MCP-UI-Org/mcp-ui\">MCP-UI project</a>, created by <a href=\"https://github.com/idosal\">Ido Salomon</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/liady\">Liad Yosef</a> and maintained by a dedicated community, spearheaded the vision of agentic apps with interactive interfaces. The project developed patterns for delivering rich user interfaces as first-class MCP resources, proving that agentic apps fit naturally within the MCP architecture. The project is backed by a large community and provides <a href=\"https://mcpui.dev/guide/client/overview\">rich SDKs</a>, adopted at leading companies and projects such as Postman, Shopify, Hugging Face, Goose, and ElevenLabs.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://developers.openai.com/apps-sdk/\">OpenAI Apps SDK</a> further validated the demand for rich UI experiences within conversational AI interfaces. The SDK enables developers to build rich, interactive applications inside ChatGPT using MCP as its backbone. To ensure interoperability and establish consistent security and usage patterns across the ecosystem, Anthropic, OpenAI, and MCP-UI are collaborating to create an official MCP extension for interactive interfaces.</p><h2>MCP Apps Extension specification<a hidden=\"\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"http://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/2025-11-21-mcp-apps/#mcp-apps-extension-specification\">#</a></h2><p>We’re proposing a specification for UI resources in MCP, but the implications go further than just a set of schema changes. The MCP Apps Extension is starting to look like an agentic app runtime: a foundation for novel interactions between AI models, users, and applications. The proposal is intentionally lean, starting with core patterns that we plan on expanding over time.</p><p>UI templates are resources with the  URI scheme, referenced in tool metadata.</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"ts\"></code></pre></div><p>This approach enables hosts to prefetch and review templates before tool execution, improving both performance and security. It also separates static presentation (the template) from dynamic data (tool results), enabling better caching.</p><p>Instead of inventing a custom message protocol, UI components communicate with hosts using existing MCP JSON-RPC base protocol over . This means that:</p><ul><li>UI developers can use the standard <code>@modelcontextprotocol/sdk</code> to build their applications</li><li>All communication is structured and auditable</li><li>Future MCP features automatically work with the UI extension</li></ul><p>The initial extension specification supports only  content, rendered in sandboxed <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/iframe\">iframes</a>. This provides:</p><ul><li>Universal browser support</li><li>Well-understood security model</li><li>Screenshot and preview generation capabilities</li><li>A clear baseline for future extensions</li></ul><p>Other content types such as external URLs, remote DOM, and native widgets are explicitly deferred to future iterations.</p><p>Hosting interactive content from MCP servers requires careful security consideration. The proposal addresses this through multiple layers:</p><ol><li>: All UI content runs in sandboxed iframes with restricted permissions</li><li>: Hosts can review HTML content before rendering</li><li>: All UI-to-host communication goes through loggable JSON-RPC</li><li>: Hosts can require explicit approval for UI-initiated tool calls</li></ol><p>These mitigations create defense in depth against malicious servers while preserving the flexibility developers need.</p><p>MCP Apps is an optional extension. Existing implementations continue working without changes, and hosts can gradually adopt UI support at their own pace. Servers should provide text-only fallback for all UI-enabled tools and return meaningful content even when UI is unavailable, so they can serve both UI-capable and text-only hosts.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol-community/working-groups/issues/35\">UI Community Working Group</a> has been instrumental in shaping this proposal through extensive feedback and discussion. We have built an <a href=\"https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps\">early access SDK</a> to demonstrate the patterns and types described in the specification proposal. The <a href=\"https://mcpui.dev/\">MCP-UI</a> client and server SDKs support these patterns.</p><p>If you are interested in contributing to this effort, we invite you to:</p><p>This proposal wouldn’t exist without the work of the maintainers at MCP-UI, OpenAI, and Anthropic.</p><p> and , through MCP-UI and moderation of , incubated and championed many of the patterns that MCP Apps now standardizes, and together with contributors demonstrated that UI resources can be a natural part of MCP.</p><p>, , , and  from Anthropic helped steer the initiative and drive the collaboration.</p><p>, , and  from OpenAI have provided valuable direction from their experience building the Apps SDK.</p><p>Special thanks to the <strong>UI Community Working Group</strong> members and everyone who contributed to the discussions that shaped this proposal.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I’ve been testing Google’s new Gemini 3 model. It is very good. But rather than give you benchmark numbers, I’m going to show you how far AI has come in three years by asking the AI to demonstrate it.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/ai-has-a-strategy\" rel=\"\">first post on this Substack about OpenAI’s earlier GPT-3 model.</a><a href=\"https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/the-mechanical-professor\" rel=\"\">wrote </a></p><p>I think I got that one right.</p><p>I could explain the difference between the original ChatGPT and the new AI model from Google, Gemini 3, that launched today. But I don’t have to. Instead, I gave the screenshot above to Gemini 3 with a single prompt:</p><p><strong>fully interactive, playable Candy-Powered FTL Starship Simulator</strong></p><p>In 2022, AI could describe the engine. In 2025, AI can code the engine, design the interface, and let you pilot the ship yourself.”</p><p>And, indeed, it built me a tiny game where I had to use the power of candy to escape otters, featuring small poems and an ongoing set of amusing updates. If you’re reading this blog, you probably knew AI could do that. What’s more interesting is what else Gemini 3 can do when you stop thinking of it as a chatbot and start thinking of it as something else entirely</p><p>Along with Gemini 3, Google has launched Antigravity. For programmers, Antigravity should be familiar territory, it is similar to Claude Code and OpenAI Codex, specialized tools that can be given access to your computer and which can autonomously write computer programs with guidance. If you aren’t a programmer, you may dismiss Antigravity and similar tools. I think that is a mistake because the ability to code isn’t just about programming, it’s about being able to do anything that happens on a computer. And that changes what these tools actually are.</p><p>Gemini 3 is very good at coding, and this matters to you even if you don’t think of what you do as programming. A fundamental perspective powering AI development is that everything you do on a computer is, ultimately, code, and if AI can work with code it can do anything someone with a computer can: build you dashboards, work with websites, create PowerPoint, read your files, and so on. This makes agents that can code general purpose tools. Antigravity embraces this idea, with the concept of an Inbox, a place where I can send AI agents off on assignments and where they can ping me when they need permission or help. </p><p><a href=\"https://splendid-gaufre-5b2bd4.netlify.app/\" rel=\"\">deploy them here.</a></p><p>It was not that Gemini 3.0 was capable of doing everything correctly without human intervention — agents aren’t there yet. There were no hallucinations I spotted, but there were things I corrected, though those errors were more about individual judgement calls or human-like misunderstandings of my intentions than traditional AI problems. Importantly, I felt that I was in control of the choices AI was making because the AI checked in and its work was visible. It felt much more like managing a teammate than prompting an AI through a chat interface.</p><p>But Antigravity isn’t the only way Gemini 3 surprised me. The other was in how it handled work that required genuine judgment. As I have mentioned many times on this site, benchmarking AI progress is a mess. Gemini 3 takes a definitive benchmark lead on most stats, (although it may still not be able to beat the $200 GPT-5 Pro Model, but I suspect that might change when Gemini 3’s inevitable Deep Think version comes out). But you will hear one phrase repeated a lot in the AI world - that a model has “PhD level intelligence.”</p><p>I decided to put that to the test. I gave Gemini 3 access to a directory of old files I had used for research into crowdfunding a decade ago. It was a mishmash of files labelled things like “project_final_seriously_this_time_done.xls” and data in out-of-date statistical formats. I told the AI to “figure out the data and the structure and the initial cleaning from the STATA files and get it ready to do a new analysis to find new things.” And it did, recovering corrupted data and figuring out the complexities of the environment.</p><p>Then I gave it a typical assignment that you would expect from a second year PhD student, doing minor original research. With no further hints I wrote: “great, now i want you to write an original paper using this data. do deep research on the field, make the paper not just about crowdfunding but about an important theoretical topic of interest in either entrepreneurship or business strategy. conduct a sophisticated analysis, write it up as if for a journal.” I gave it no suggestions beyond that and yet the AI considered the data, generated original hypotheses, tested them statistically, and gave me formatted output in the form of a document. The most fascinating part was that I did not give it any hints about what to research, it walked the tricky tightrope of figuring out what might be an interesting topic and how to execute it with the data it had - one of the hardest things to teach. After a couple of vague commands (“build it out more, make it better”) I got a 14 page paper.</p><p>Aside from this, I was impressed that the AI came up with its own measure, a way of measuring how unique a crowdfunding idea was by using natural language processing tools to compare its description mathematically to other descriptions. It wrote the code, executed it and checked the results.</p><p>So is this a PhD-level intelligence? In some ways, yes, if you define a PhD level intelligence as doing the work of a competent grad student at a research university. But it also had some of the weaknesses of a grad student. The idea was good, as were many elements of the execution, but there were also problems: some of its statistical methods needed more work, some of its approaches were not optimal, some of its theorizing went too far given the evidence, and so on. Again, we have moved past hallucinations and errors to more subtle, and often human-like, concerns. Interestingly, when I gave it suggestions with a lot of leeway, the way I would a student: (“make sure that you cover the crowdfunding research more to establish methodology, etc.”) it improved tremendously, so maybe more guidance would be all that Gemini needed. We are not there yet, but “PhD intelligence” no longer seems that far away.</p><p>Gemini 3 is a very good thinking and doing partner that is available to billions of people around the world. It is also a sign of many things: the fact that we have not yet seen a significant slowdown in AI’s continued development, the rise of agentic models, the need to figure out better ways to manage smart AIs, and more. It shows how far AI has come.</p><p>Three years ago, we were impressed that a machine could write a poem about otters. Less than 1,000 days later, I am debating statistical methodology with an agent that built its own research environment. The era of the chatbot is turning into the era of the digital coworker. To be very clear, Gemini 3 isn’t perfect, and it still needs a manager who can guide and check it. But it suggests that “human in the loop” is evolving from “human who fixes AI mistakes” to “human who directs AI work.” And that may be the biggest change since the release of ChatGPT.</p>",

      "content": "<p><em>A documented case of infrastructure failure, failed escalation, and a company that refuses to investigate.</em></p><h2><strong>Here’s the situation: I have outages. My neighbor has the same outages. Xfinity won’t fix it.</strong></h2><p>I bought Xfinity internet in June 2024. Immediately, my connection started dropping. Multiple times a day. Every single day. After troubleshooting every piece of equipment I had and questioning my sanity my neighbor complained about the same thing which led me to understand this was not my equipment.</p><p>I set up an uptime monitor and found that these outages happen 6-7 times per day for 125 seconds.</p><p>Over 17 months of my service term that’s approximately 3,387 outage incidents totaling 117+ hours of cumulative downtime.</p><p>This outage pattern has recurred thousands of times. It is consistent, predictable, and it follows an automated schedule.</p><p>My neighbor has the same problem. Different house. Different line from a different junction box. Same 125-second outages happening at the same times of day.</p><ul><li><div><p>Same CMTS-MAC (00:90:f0:32:11:00)</p></div></li><li><div><p>Both logs show :33 and :59 minute markers (overlapping)</p></div></li><li><div><p>Different modem manufacturers (proves it’s not equipment-specific)</p></div></li><li><div><p>Different log formats show the EXACT SAME PATTERN</p></div></li></ul><p><strong>Both modems are responding to the same R-PHY node crash/restart</strong>, just at different layers of the network stack. The ~30-minute lag is expected because upstream errors take time to cascade through the downstream systems.</p><p>I called support. Multiple times. They blamed my WiFi (I’m hardwired). They blamed my modem (an Xfinity Approved MB8611). They blamed my router (I tested with multiple devices). They sent a subcontracted technician. Then another subcontracted technician. Then a subcontracted crew. The crew ran a new coax line and grounded it to a water pipe that turns into PVC when it enters the ground (this doesn’t ground anything). Then they sent an Xfinity technician to look at the line.</p><p>The problem never changed. The only thing that changed is my download speed dropped from advertised 1200Mbps to &lt;500Mbps.</p><p>I escalated to retention. They offered me nothing. I provided detailed technical documentation showing the exact pattern of the outages, the minute markers they occur at, the exact duration every single time. They didn’t understand it. They couldn’t escalate it.</p><p>I was transferred to technical support. The person did not care and put me on speaker phone with so much background noise I couldn’t hear myself think. I imagine he was rolling his eyes while trying his utmost to care less.</p><h2><strong>My Neighbor’s Attempts to Fix It</strong></h2><p>He called Xfinity about his TV cutting out repeatedly. The technician told him his UPS grounding his coax cable was causing the problem. So he ungrounded the cable, pocketed the spare cable, and my neighbor kept having the same issues.</p><p>Just in the last 72 hours I have documented 20 consecutive outages using OPNSense’s built in gateway uptime monitor. Here’s what they show:</p><p><strong>Every single outage lasted 124.8 ± 1.3 seconds.</strong> That’s not random hardware failure. That’s a timeout value hardcoded into something in Xfinity’s infrastructure.</p><p><strong>The outages cluster at specific minute markers.</strong> 35% start at minute :44. 35% start at minute :29. This is scheduled automation. This is likely a cron job or automated task running at those exact times every hour.</p><p><strong>The outages peak at specific hours.</strong> Most happen between noon and 1 PM. Others cluster in early morning around 2-3 AM. This is not random.</p><p>This is an infrastructure problem on Xfinity’s network. Not on my end. Not on my neighbor’s end. Upstream. Somewhere on their equipment something is failing for exactly 125 seconds multiple times per day.</p><p>I have the data. I have the patterns. I have another customer (my neighbor) on a different line experiencing the exact same thing.</p><p>Xfinity has all this information. They know about the problem. They just won’t investigate it.</p><ol><li><strong>Support can’t understand technical data.</strong> They follow scripts. When I attempted to explain monitoring logs they had no framework for discussing it. They blamed my equipment because that’s what they’re trained to do.</li><li><strong>Nobody has authority to escalate.</strong> Retention transferred me to tech support. Tech support couldn’t care nor help. They dug up my yard and placed a new line which did nothing to solve the problem. Nobody would actually order an investigation into the upstream infrastructure.</li><li><strong>There’s no pressure to fix it.</strong> Xfinity is the only gigabit provider in this area. No competition. No alternatives. I can’t leave. So they don’t have to care.</li><li><strong>A 2-minute outage every few hours is “tolerable.”</strong> It’s annoying enough to frustrate customers but not enough to make them quit (since they have nowhere else to go). It’s cheap to ignore compared to actually investigating and fixing it.</li></ol><p><strong>There’s Also a Security Problem</strong></p><p>About half of the Xfinity junction boxes in my neighborhood are unlocked or broken. Anyone can walk up and disconnect whomever they want.</p><p>If your home security system is on Xfinity with no wireless backup, someone can just walk to the street and physically disconnect your internet, rob your house, and your security system won’t notify you.</p><p>I’ve done everything I can do as a customer:</p><ul><li>Documented the problem professionally</li><li>Escalated through all available channels</li><li>Provided technical evidence</li><li>Been ignored at every level</li></ul><p>The problem is real. My neighbor confirms it. Everyone downstream of whatever is broken on their infrastructure probably has it too.</p><p>I can’t fix this. Only Xfinity can. And they won’t.</p><p>So I’m publishing this hoping someone with actual authority, perhaps someone at a regulatory agency, someone at a news outlet, someone who has power over Xfinity sees this and decides to actually investigate.</p><p>Because I’m out of options. My neighbors are out of options. And Xfinity’s counting on us staying out of options. Because this is the reality of my neighborhood (<a href=\"https://broadbandmap.fcc.gov/location-summary/fixed\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://broadbandmap.fcc.gov/location-summary/fixed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">source</a>):</p><p><em>If you’re in Sacramento County and have Xfinity internet, check two things:</em></p><p><em>1. Walk to your junction box. Is it locked? If not, you have a physical security problem.</em></p><p><em>2. Look at where your cable grounds. Does it go to your electrical panel? Or to a water pipe? If it’s a water pipe or PVC, that’s wrong.</em></p><p><em>3. Have you noticed your connection drop briefly multiple times a day? Same times of day? If you see a pattern, document it. You might have the same problem.</em></p><p><strong>If you want to report this:</strong></p>",

      "content": "<h2>1.0 The Silicon Root of Trust: Pre-Boot &amp; Hardware Primitives</h2><p>The security of the macOS platform on Apple Silicon is not defined by the kernel; it is defined by the physics of the die. Before the first instruction of  is fetched, a complex, cryptographic ballet has already concluded within the Application Processor (AP). This section dissects the immutable hardware logic that establishes the initial link in the Chain of Trust.</p><h3>1.1 The Reset Vector &amp; Boot ROM (SecureROM)</h3><p>The Apple Silicon boot process begins in a state of absolute trust, anchored by the Boot ROM (often colloquially referred to as SecureROM). This code is mask-programmed into the silicon during fabrication. It is immutable, unpatchable, and serves as the hardware root of trust for the entire platform.</p><h4>1.1.1 Execution at Reset: Analyzing the Reset Vector ()</h4><p>Upon Power-On Reset (POR), the cores of the M-series SoC (and A-series) initialize in the highest privilege state implemented by the microarchitecture. In the Armv8/v9 architecture, this role is architecturally associated with  and its reset vector register family . On Apple Silicon, public reverse engineering strongly suggests that Apple does  expose a persistent, software-visible EL3 monitor in the style of classical TrustZone. Instead, the Application Processor (AP) Boot ROM executes in an implementation-defined reset context that has strictly higher privilege than the runtime EL2/EL1 kernel environment and is the only code allowed to touch certain secure configuration registers.</p><p>For the purposes of this discussion, the important property is not the exact architectural EL label, but that the Boot ROM runs in a <strong>one-shot, highest-privilege reset context</strong> that:</p><ul><li>owns the reset vector () and initial exception state, and</li><li>can program security-critical registers that are later hidden from or read-only to EL2/EL1.</li></ul><p>The execution flow begins at the address defined in the <strong>Reset Vector Base Address Register</strong> (one of the  registers, depending on the concrete implementation). Reverse engineering of recent Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) indicates the memory map places the Boot ROM at a high base address, typically observed around .</p><p><strong>The Initial Instruction Stream:</strong></p><p>The very first instructions executed by the silicon are responsible for establishing a sane C execution environment from a raw hardware state. Analysis of the entry point in similar Apple SoCs reveals a standard initialization sequence:</p><ol><li><p> The  bits are set to mask all interrupts (IRQ, FIQ, SError, Debug). The Boot ROM operates in a strictly polled mode; interrupts are nondeterministic and introduce attack surface.</p></li><li><p> The instruction and data caches are invalidated to prevent cold-boot attacks or stale data usage.</p></li><li><p> The Stack Pointer for the reset context (architecturally , but on Apple Silicon effectively the highest-privilege stack pointer) is initialized to point to a dedicated region of on-chip SRAM. DRAM is  initialized at this stage. The Boot ROM runs entirely within the constraints of the SoC’s internal SRAM.</p></li><li><p> The System Control Register for the reset context ( at the highest implemented level) is programmed to enable the MMU, mapping the Boot ROM text as Read-Only/Executable and the SRAM stack/heap as Read-Write/No-Execute.</p></li></ol><blockquote><p> Apple’s high-privilege reset context is ephemeral. There is no persistent EL3 monitor analogous to Qualcomm’s QSEE. Once the Boot ROM has initialized hardware, validated and decrypted the next stage, and “demoted” the core into the runtime EL2/EL1 regime, the reset context is no longer reachable. Subsequent firmware (LLB, iBoot, XNU) can observe the effects of its configuration but cannot re-enter that privilege level or read back the Boot ROM contents directly.</p></blockquote><h4>1.1.2 The GID Key (Group ID): Hardware-entangled Decryption</h4><p>The Boot ROM’s primary objective is to load the Low-Level Bootloader (LLB). However, the LLB stored on the boot medium is not a raw binary; it is wrapped in an Image4 () container, and its payload () is both encrypted and, on production devices, .</p><p>At the heart of this process is the .</p><p>The GID Key is a 256-bit AES key fused into the silicon during manufacturing. It is shared across processors of the same class (e.g., all M3 Pro chips share a GID, distinct from M3 Max), and it never leaves the confines of the on-die crypto hardware.</p><p><strong>KBAG Unwrapping: GID as a Wrapping Key</strong></p><p>Image4 payloads do not store the LLB ciphertext encrypted “directly under GID.” Instead, they contain an embedded : a small structure that holds per-image AES keys and IVs encrypted under the GID (and, where applicable, UID) keys.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Manifest &amp; Payload Parsing:</strong>\nThe Boot ROM parses the Image4 container, separates the  (Manifest) from the  (Payload), and locates the KBAG for the LLB within .</p></li><li><p><strong>KBAG Decryption (GID Slot):</strong>\nThe KBAG consists of one or more wrapped key records (e.g., development vs. production keys). To unwrap the appropriate record, the Boot ROM:</p><ul><li>Writes the KBAG ciphertext (the wrapped IV+key material) into the AES engine’s input FIFO.</li><li>Programs the AES configuration register to use the  as the decryption source (a “use GID” control bit or mode selector).</li><li>Triggers the engine. The hardware AES block internally reads the GID key from fuses, decrypts the KBAG fragment, and emits the plaintext IV and AES key for the LLB.</li></ul><p>The GID value itself is never exposed to software; only the result of the KBAG unwrap is visible.</p></li><li><p><strong>LLB Payload Decryption (Target Key):</strong>\nWith the per-image AES key and IV recovered from the KBAG, the Boot ROM then decrypts the LLB payload:</p><ul><li>It configures the AES engine (or, on some generations, uses the ARMv8 AES instructions) with the  obtained from the KBAG.</li><li>It streams the LLB ciphertext through this AES context into SRAM, yielding the plaintext LLB image.</li></ul></li><li><p>\nAfter decryption, the AES hardware clears any internal registers holding the GID-derived material. The Boot ROM code has no mechanism to read back the GID key and no direct path to expose the target key outside the immediate decryption context.</p></li></ol><p>This two-stage scheme (GID → KBAG → LLB) is what makes the system : the cryptographic key that ultimately decrypts the bootloader exists only as the output of a GID-protected unwrap on  class of silicon.</p><p>Even if an attacker gains arbitrary code execution inside the Boot ROM (as in -class vulnerabilities on earlier A-series devices), they still cannot extract the raw GID key and cannot perform offline decryption of production firmware:</p><ul><li>The GID key is never mapped into general-purpose registers or memory.</li><li>The only decryption primitive available is “unwrap KBAG under GID,” running  the AES peripheral.</li><li>Firmware images must be decrypted , with the AES engine acting as a constrained decryption oracle at best, and only for keys/payloads consistent with the KBAG format accepted by the ROM.</li></ul><h4>1.1.3 The Public Key Accelerator (PKA): Hardware-Enforced Verification</h4><p>Decryption provides confidentiality, but not integrity. To prevent the execution of malicious firmware, the Boot ROM enforces strict code signing using the <strong>Public Key Accelerator (PKA)</strong>.</p><p>The PKA is a dedicated hardware block optimized for asymmetric cryptography (RSA and ECC). The verification flow is as follows:</p><ol><li> The Apple Root CA public key is embedded directly within the immutable Boot ROM code. This serves as the anchor for the chain of trust.</li><li> The Boot ROM parses the Image4 (img4) container of the LLB. It extracts the Image4 Manifest (IM4M), which contains the payload's signature and the certificate chain used to sign it.</li><li> The Boot ROM validates the certificate chain found in the manifest against the Root CA embedded in the ROM. If the chain is invalid or does not lead back to the hardware anchor, the boot halts (the device typically enters DFU/Recovery mode).</li><li> The Boot ROM offloads the signature verification to the PKA. It passes the hash of the payload (typically SHA-2 family) and the RSA/ECC signature. The PKA performs the mathematical verification. Architectural inference and reverse engineering suggest it returns a boolean result to a status register, although this specific implementation detail is not explicitly defined in public Apple documentation.</li></ol><p><strong>Fault Injection Hardening:</strong>\nAnalysis of recent Apple Boot ROMs suggests the implementation of glitch-resistant logic around the PKA check. Rather than a simple  (Branch if Equal) instruction following the PKA result—which could be bypassed via voltage glitching—reverse engineering indicates the code often employs redundant checks, loop invariants, or specific register values that must be populated by the PKA hardware itself to allow the boot flow to proceed.</p><h4>1.1.4 RE Focus: Dev vs. Prod Fused Silicon</h4><p>For reverse engineering and exploit development, distinguishing  from  silicon is critical. The Boot ROM and security subsystem change behavior based on fuse fields that encode the  of the chip.</p><p>A central knob here is Apple’s  field (“Chip Production / Firmware Mode”), burned into fuses and exposed in various debug logs and DFU responses.</p><p>Across multiple generations, public Boot ROM banners and tooling logs show a consistent pattern:</p><ul><li><p>\nUsed for  or internal security domains:</p><ul><li>Enable richer debug visibility.</li><li>Allow additional boot modes and demotion paths.</li><li>Often relax some signature enforcement or allow alternate signing roots for internal firmware.</li></ul></li><li><p>\nStandard  configuration for consumer devices:</p><ul><li>Full signature enforcement for all boot stages.</li><li>Debug interfaces (JTAG/SWD) and invasive trace disabled or tightly restricted.</li></ul></li></ul><p>The exact semantics of intermediary values (e.g., ) and the precise bit-level encoding are SoC- and generation-specific, but the broad distinction above is stable across published ROM dumps and DFU tooling.</p><p>This is the configuration for retail hardware:</p><ul><li> Disabled or heavily locked. External debug probes cannot halt the core at reset in any supported way.</li><li> The GID key is set to the production group value, shared only across chips of the same class, and never accessible via software.</li><li> The Boot ROM enforces the full Apple Root CA chain and Image4 constraints. Unsupported or revoked OS builds fail before DRAM initialization, dropping the device into DFU.</li></ul><p><strong>Development (CPFM ≈ 0x0 / 0x1):</strong></p><p>Dev-fused devices, including security research units and internal engineering hardware, typically relax some of these constraints:</p><ul><li><p> The  /  debug signals are asserted. Hardware debuggers (Lauterbach, Astris, etc.) can halt the core immediately after reset and single-step Boot ROM code.</p></li><li><p> Dev-fused chips can usually enter “demoted” modes where unsigned or custom-signed firmware images are bootable. The exact mechanisms (special DFU commands, provisioning profiles, or special Image4 manifests) are implementation details, but the high-level effect is that certain signature and version checks are bypassed or altered for internal workflows.</p></li><li><p> Dev silicon often uses a distinct GID key (or set of keys) from production. This means:</p><ul><li>Firmware encrypted for Prod cannot be decrypted on Dev, and vice versa.</li><li>Dev images are cryptographically bound to dev-fused hardware, preventing accidental cross-leakage into production units.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Identifying Silicon State in Practice:</strong></p><p>From the outside, the security domain can be inferred via DFU and other low-level interfaces:</p><ul><li><p>\nUSB DFU responses (e.g., from , , or equivalent tooling) expose fields such as , , and CPFM-like indicators. On many platforms:</p><ul><li>Values where CPFM-like bits are  correspond to production devices.</li><li>Values where CPFM-like bits are  or  correspond to dev-fused hardware.</li></ul></li><li><p>\nReverse-engineering tools often apply heuristic masks to these fields to classify devices. For example, certain high bits set in  or specific ranges in  are empirically associated with production vs. development, but the exact encodings vary by SoC and should be treated as version-specific heuristics rather than universal rules.</p></li></ul><p><strong>The “Un-dumpable” Region:</strong></p><p>Regardless of dev or prod state, once the Boot ROM prepares to jump to the next stage (LLB), it typically performs a lockdown sequence:</p><ul><li>Writes to the memory controller or system registers to unmap its own address range (e.g., around ) from the normal physical address space.</li><li>Ensures that any subsequent attempt by LLB or the kernel to read that region either raises a bus error or returns zeros.</li></ul><p>This is why practical Boot ROM dumps require a vulnerability  the Boot ROM execution window (e.g., -style exploits or carefully timed glitching) rather than a simple read from a later boot stage. On production (CPFM ≈ 0x3) devices this window is tightly constrained; on dev-fused hardware, JTAG/SWD access and relaxed policy make that window significantly easier to instrument but do not fundamentally change the “self-erasing” behavior.</p><h3>1.2 Proprietary ISA Extensions (arm64e+)</h3><p>While the M-series cores implement the Armv8-A architecture with a comprehensive set of optional extensions (e.g., , ), Apple has aggressively extended the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) with proprietary logic. For the reverse engineer, standard Arm documentation is insufficient. Understanding the security posture of macOS Tahoe requires mastering these custom extensions, as they form the hardware enforcement layer for the new kernel isolation model.</p><h4>1.2.1 Pointer Authentication (PAC): The Cryptographic Control Flow</h4><p>Apple’s implementation of Armv8.3-PAuth is the most pervasive security mitigation in the XNU kernel. It repurposes the unused high-order bits above the configured virtual address size (the \"top\" bits of a 64-bit pointer) to store a cryptographic signature, or Pointer Authentication Code (PAC).</p><p>\nThe hardware maintains five distinct 128-bit keys in system registers. On macOS with VHE (Virtualization Host Extensions) enabled, the kernel accesses these keys via the  register aliases, which the hardware redirects to the EL2 bank of the key registers:</p><ul><li><strong> /  (Instruction):</strong> Signs code pointers (function pointers, return addresses).</li><li> Signs data pointers. Crucial for protecting C++ vtables in IOKit ().</li><li> Signs arbitrary data blobs, effectively a hardware-accelerated MAC.</li></ul><p><strong>The  Failure Mechanism (Canonical Non-Valid):</strong>\nFor the reverse engineer analyzing crash dumps, understanding the failure mode is critical. When an  instruction (e.g., ) is executed on a corrupted or forged pointer, the CPU does  immediately raise an exception.</p><p>Instead, the hardware corrupts the pointer in a deterministic way to ensure it causes a translation fault upon dereference.</p><ol><li> The CPU recalculates the PAC.</li><li> If the calculated PAC does not match the bits in the pointer, the CPU writes an error pattern into the PAC field, flipping specific high-order bits.</li><li> The pointer becomes a \"canonical non-address\": the PAC field is overwritten with an error pattern so that any use of the pointer leads to an architectural fault.</li><li> The subsequent  or  triggers a Data Abort or Prefetch Abort.</li></ol><blockquote><p> Empirically, on many M-series SoCs, a PAC authentication failure often manifests as a pointer where the upper byte is partially set (e.g.,  or ). If you see a crash involving such a pointer, you are likely looking at a PAC failure rather than a standard NULL dereference or heap corruption.</p></blockquote><h4>1.2.2 Branch Target Identification (BTI): The Landing Pads</h4><p>Often deployed in tandem with PAC (<code>-mbranch-protection=standard</code>), BTI mitigates Jump-Oriented Programming (JOP). It enforces a state machine on indirect branches.</p><ul><li> The Page Table Entries (PTE) now include a Guarded Page () bit.</li><li> This is a \"hint\" instruction (NOP on older silicon). It acts as a valid landing pad.</li><li> When the CPU executes an indirect branch (, ) targeting a Guarded Page, the very next instruction  be a  instruction of the correct type ( for call,  for jump,  for both).</li></ul><p>If the target is not a  instruction, the CPU raises a . In XNU, observations suggest this often manifests as a  (Illegal Instruction) with a specific subcode, distinguishing it from standard undefined opcode exceptions. For exploit development, this necessitates finding gadgets that not only perform the desired operation but are also preceded by a valid landing pad.</p><h4>1.2.3  The Guarded Execution Feature (GXF)</h4><p>This is the most significant architectural divergence in the Apple Silicon era. Standard Arm defines a vertical privilege stack (EL0 → EL1 → EL2). Apple has introduced a parallel execution domain, conceptually a  (distinct from Arm TrustZone), accessed via .</p><p>GXF allows the processor to switch between the \"Normal World\" (where macOS runs) and the \"Secure World\" (where Exclaves run). These worlds share the same physical silicon but possess vastly different hardware permissions and system register views.</p><p>\nGuarded Levels (GL) do not merely mirror standard Exception Levels in a parallel context; GL2 maps directly to the hardware Exception Level 2 (EL2), effectively repurposing the architectural level for the monitor. The mapping for macOS Tahoe is as follows:</p><ul><li><ul><li> Userland processes (Apps, Daemons).</li><li> The XNU Kernel. On M4 systems employing the Tahoe architecture, the Secure Page Table Monitor (SPTM) occupies the hardware EL2 (mapped to GL2). Consequently, the XNU kernel operates at GL1 (Hardware EL1) as a virtualized guest, rather than executing at EL2.</li></ul></li><li><ul><li> (secure user workloads) and a privileged Conclave hosting the <strong>Trusted Execution Monitor (TXM)</strong>. This is where policy logic, privacy indicators, and Passkey logic reside.</li><li><strong>The Secure Kernel (ExclaveOS)</strong>. An L4-inspired microkernel responsible for scheduling and IPC within the secure world.</li><li><strong>The Secure Page Table Monitor (SPTM)</strong>. The ultimate hardware root of trust, mirroring the privilege of a hypervisor but strictly for security enforcement.</li></ul></li></ul><p>\nTransitions between worlds are not handled by standard  calls. Apple added custom instructions to the ISA:</p><ul><li><strong> (Opcode ):</strong> Synchronous entry into the Secure World. It behaves like a hypercall, atomically switching the hardware context (SPRR state, stack pointer, and system registers) from ELx to GLx.</li><li> Returns from the Secure World to the Normal World.</li></ul><h4>1.2.4  Shadow Permission Remapping Registers (SPRR)</h4><p>To enforce isolation between the Normal World (XNU) and the Secure World (Exclaves), Apple replaced the older APRR (Access Permission Remapping Registers) on newer silicon (A15/M2+) with the more robust <strong>SPRR (Shadow Permission Remapping Registers)</strong>.</p><p>In standard Arm MMUs, the Page Table Entry (PTE) bits define permissions directly. In Apple Silicon with SPRR enabled, the PTE's  bits and NX bits (, ) are repurposed as a  into a hardware permission table.</p><ol><li> The PTE specifies a permission index (e.g., Index 5).</li><li> The hardware checks the current execution mode (EL2, GL1, or GL2).</li><li> It looks up Index 5 in the  register specific to that mode.</li></ol><p><strong>The Security Implication:</strong>\nThis allows for \"View-Based\" memory protection.</p><ul><li>A particular SPRR index (for example, index 5) is configured so that in  it resolves to .</li><li>The same index resolves to  in .</li></ul><p>This is how the SPTM protects page tables. The physical pages containing the translation tables are marked with a specific SPRR index. The hardware configuration for EL2 (Kernel) maps that index to Read-Only. Even if an attacker has a kernel-level arbitrary write primitive, the MMU will reject the write to the page table because the SPRR configuration for EL2 forbids it. The only way to write to that page is to execute  to switch to GL2, where the SPRR configuration permits the write.</p><p>If the Application Processor (AP) is the brain of the device, the Secure Enclave Processor (SEP) is its conscience. It is not merely a coprocessor; it is a fully independent computer-on-a-chip, sharing the same die but architecturally severed from the AP. It runs its own operating system (), based on an Apple-customized L4 microkernel, manages its own peripherals, and holds the keys to the kingdom (UID/GID). In the macOS Tahoe generation, the SEP effectively acts as the root of authority for biometric authentication decisions and for OS-bound key material used in attestation and Data Protection.</p><h3>2.1 SEP Initialization &amp; Boot</h3><p>The SEP boot process is designed to be resilient against a fully compromised Application Processor. From the moment power is applied, the SEP operates under the threat model that the AP is hostile.</p><h4>2.1.1 The SEPROM: SRAM Execution and the Memory Protection Engine (MPE)</h4><p>Like the AP, the SEP begins execution from an immutable on-die Boot ROM, the .</p><p><strong>The Hardware Environment:</strong>\nThe SEP core (historically an ARMv7-A \"Kingfisher\" core on A7–A9, though the specific microarchitecture of M-series SEP cores is undocumented) initializes in a highly constrained environment. Execution begins in the SEPROM using a small on-die SRAM for stack and early state. However, the  is too large to fit entirely in SRAM. To utilize the device's main DRAM securely, the SEP relies on the <strong>Memory Protection Engine (MPE)</strong>. Before the SEP accesses external DRAM, the Boot ROM initializes the MPE, ensuring all subsequent memory transactions are encrypted and authenticated. This isolation prevents early-boot DMA attacks from the AP or Thunderbolt peripherals.</p><p><strong>The Memory Protection Engine (MPE):</strong>\nThe MPE sits inline between the SEP core and the memory controller. It creates a cryptographic window into physical memory that is opaque to the rest of the SoC.</p><ol><li> On system startup, the SEP Boot ROM programs the MPE with a random, ephemeral AES key. This key exists only in the MPE hardware registers and is never exposed to software (even ). On M-series silicon, the MPE manages distinct ephemeral keys for the SEP and the Secure Neural Engine (SNE), ensuring isolation even between secure subsystems.</li><li> Data written by the SEP to DRAM is encrypted transparently using AES in XEX (XOR-Encrypt-XOR) mode.</li><li> The MPE calculates a CMAC tag for every block of memory (cache line granularity). This tag is stored alongside the encrypted data.</li></ol><p> If you attempt to dump the physical memory range assigned to the SEP from the AP (kernel mode), you will see high-entropy noise. Furthermore, any attempt to modify a single bit of this memory via the AP will invalidate the CMAC tag. The next time the SEP reads that line, the MPE will detect the forgery and trigger a hardware panic, locking down the Enclave until a full system reset.</p><h4>2.1.2 The Boot Monitor: Hardware Enforcement of OS-Bound Keys</h4><p>On modern silicon (A13/M1 and later), Apple introduced the <strong>Secure Enclave Boot Monitor</strong> to mitigate the risk of Boot ROM exploits (like ) compromising the chain of trust for key derivation.</p><p>In older architectures, the SEPROM would verify the  signature and then jump to it. If the SEPROM was exploited, the attacker could jump to a malicious payload while retaining access to the hardware UID key. The Boot Monitor closes this gap by enforcing <strong>System Coprocessor Integrity Protection (SCIP)</strong>.</p><ol><li> The AP (iBoot) loads the  payload into a region of physical memory.</li><li> The AP signals the SEP via a hardware mailbox register.</li><li> The SEPROM parses the Image4 container. It verifies the signature against the SEP-specific Apple Root CA public key embedded within the immutable SEPROM.</li><li> Crucially, the SEPROM  simply jump to the loaded image. The SCIP hardware prevents execution of mutable memory.</li><li> The SEPROM invokes the Boot Monitor hardware block.\n<ul><li>The Monitor  the SEP core to a known clean state.</li><li>The Monitor calculates a cryptographic hash of the loaded  memory range.</li><li>The Monitor updates the SCIP registers to permit execution of that specific range.</li><li>The Boot ROM and Boot Monitor jointly produce a measurement of the loaded  and lock it into a dedicated register used by the Public Key Accelerator (PKA).</li></ul></li></ol><p>\nThis finalized hash is the critical component. When the  later requests keys (e.g., to decrypt user data), the hardware Key Derivation Function (KDF) mixes the hardware UID with this locked hash.</p><p>$$ K_{derived} = KDF(UID, Hash_{sepOS}) $$</p><p>If an attacker modifies a single byte of the  (even with a Boot ROM exploit), the Boot Monitor calculates a different hash. Consequently, the KDF derives different OS-bound keys, so any data protected by those keys (e.g., passcode- and SKP-bound Data Protection keys) remains cryptographically inaccessible under the modified . This is \"Bound Security\"—the data is bound not just to the device, but to a specific, signed software version.</p><h4>2.1.3 Anti-Replay Mechanisms: The Integrity Tree</h4><p>A classic attack vector against secure enclaves is the : capturing a snapshot of the encrypted RAM (e.g., when the passcode retry counter is 0) and restoring it later after the counter has incremented.</p><p>To prevent this, the SEP implements a hardware-enforced  (Merkle Tree).</p><ol><li> The root node of the integrity tree is stored in  within the Secure Enclave complex. This memory is physically distinct from the main DRAM and cannot be addressed by the AP.</li><li> The protected memory region (where  data and the Secure Storage Manager reside) is divided into blocks. Each block's hash is stored in a parent node, recursively up to the root.</li><li> When the SEP writes to protected memory (e.g., incrementing a failed attempt counter), the MPE updates the data, recalculates the hashes up the tree, and atomically updates the root hash in the on-chip SRAM.</li><li> On every read, the MPE verifies the path from the data block up to the SRAM root.</li></ol><p>If an attacker replays an old DRAM state, the hash of the replayed block will not match the current root hash stored in the internal SRAM. The MPE detects the mismatch (Anti-Replay Violation) and halts the SEP. This mechanism ensures that the SEP has a strictly monotonic view of time and state, rendering snapshot fuzzing and counter rollbacks impossible.</p><h3>2.2 SEP Runtime Architecture</h3><p>Once the  is bootstrapped and verified, the Secure Enclave transitions into its runtime state. At this point, it functions as a fully autonomous operating system running an Apple-customized variant of the L4 microkernel (historically derived from L4-embedded/Darbat). For the reverse engineer, understanding the runtime architecture is crucial for analyzing how the SEP communicates with the hostile \"Rich Execution Environment\" (the AP running XNU) and how it persists sensitive state.</p><h4>2.2.1 The Mailbox Interface: Analyzing the IPC Transport</h4><p>Communication between the Application Processor (AP) and the SEP is strictly asynchronous and interrupt-driven. Unlike the tight coupling of the SPTM (which uses synchronous instruction traps), the SEP interaction is mediated by a hardware mechanism known as the , which relies on the proprietary <strong>Apple Interrupt Controller (AIC)</strong> to manage signaling.</p><p><strong>The Physical Transport: Registers and Shared Memory</strong>\nThere is no shared virtual memory space; the two processors exchange messages via a combination of Memory-Mapped I/O (MMIO) registers and physical memory buffers.</p><ol><li><p><strong>The Control Mailbox (MMIO):</strong>\nThe primary control channel consists of dedicated hardware registers within the SEP's configuration space (typically mapped at  on A-series, with evolving offsets on M-series).</p><ul><li> The AP writes a message to the  register, which triggers an IRQ on the SEP. The SEP writes a reply to the  register, which triggers an IRQ on the AP.</li><li> On Apple Silicon (M1+), reverse engineering of the  driver indicates a shift toward using shared memory ring buffers for the control path to handle higher throughput, managed by the AIC's hardware event lines.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>The Doorbell (Apple Interrupt Controller):</strong>\nTo signal a message, the sender must trigger an exception on the receiver.</p><ul><li> The kernel writes to a specific AIC \"Set\" register. This asserts a hardware IRQ line wired to the SEP's core.</li><li> When the SEP replies, it asserts an IRQ line routed to the AP's AIC. The kernel's interrupt handler (within ) acknowledges this by writing to the AIC \"Clear\" register.</li></ul></li></ol><p>\nThe data payload passed through the control registers follows a strict, serialized format (often referred to as the  format). Analysis of the  /  stack reveals a compact 64-bit structure:</p><pre><code>struct sep_msg {\n    uint8_t endpoint;  // Destination service (e.g., 0x10)\n    uint8_t tag;       // Transaction ID for async correlation\n    uint8_t opcode;    // Message type / Command\n    uint8_t param;     // Immediate parameter\n    uint32_t data;     // Payload or pointer to OOL buffer\n};\n</code></pre><ul><li> Routes the message to a specific task within  (e.g., the Secure Key Store).</li><li><strong>Out-of-Line (OOL) Buffers:</strong> For payloads larger than 32 bits (such as biometric templates or firmware updates), the  field contains a physical address. The AP allocates a physical page, pins it, and passes the address to the SEP. The SEP maps this page into its address space using its own IOMMU (often implemented via  on M-series chips).</li></ul><p><strong>RE Focus: Fuzzing the Boundary</strong>\nThe mailbox is the primary attack surface for the SEP. Vulnerabilities here (parsing malformed messages) can lead to code execution within the Enclave.</p><ul><li> The  kernel dispatches messages to user-mode L4 tasks based on the Endpoint ID. Fuzzing specific endpoints (especially legacy or debug endpoints left enabled in production) is a standard methodology.</li><li><strong>Shared Memory Hazards (TOCTOU):</strong> While the mailbox registers handle control flow, bulk data is passed via shared memory. A classic attack vector involves the AP modifying the data in the shared buffer  the SEP has validated the header/signature but  it processes the body (Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use).</li></ul><p>The SEP has no general-purpose NAND flash of its own. It must rely on the Application Processor’s storage stack to persist long-lived secrets (passcode state, biometric templates, token material). However, it cannot  the AP or its filesystem to store this data without tampering.</p><p>To solve this, Apple pairs the SEP with a , often referred to in firmware and kexts as  (eXtended Anti-Replay Technology).</p><p>At a high level, xART behaves as a <strong>dedicated, tamper-resistant non-volatile store</strong> that is  attached exclusively to the SEP:</p><ul><li>It has its own non-volatile memory and cryptographic logic.</li><li>It is only addressable from within the SEP’s trust domain over a dedicated, authenticated channel.</li><li>The AP and XNU have no direct protocol to read or write its contents; all access is mediated by .</li></ul><p>You can think of xART as a small, secure NVRAM bank whose sole purpose is to hold anti-replay metadata and counters that anchor SEP-managed state.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Physical / Logical Separation:</strong></p><ul><li>At the implementation level, the Secure Storage Component may be a discrete die or a dedicated block within a larger package, but architecturally it presents as a separate secure store accessed only by the SEP.</li><li>The AP sees none of its registers or address space; there are no MMIO ranges that the kernel can map to talk directly to xART.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>SEP-Centric View of Storage:</strong></p><ul><li>The SEP treats AP-managed NAND (the main SSD / NVMe) as an untrusted block device.</li><li>All SEP data structures stored there (keybags, counters, templates, tickets) are encrypted and authenticated using keys derived from the UID/GID and xART’s state.</li><li>The xART component holds the small, high-value bits: monotonic counters, per-volume or per-domain nonces, and commitment hashes for larger encrypted blobs stored on the AP’s filesystem.</li></ul></li></ol><p><strong>The Anti-Replay Guarantee:</strong></p><p>When the SEP writes persistent state—for example, updating the failed passcode attempt counter or credential state—it performs a two-phase commit:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Write to Untrusted Storage (AP):</strong></p><ul><li>The SEP encrypts the payload (e.g., a keybag or metadata record) with keys derived from the UID and appropriate class keys.</li><li>It sends the ciphertext to the AP via the mailbox protocol.</li><li>The AP writes this to its filesystem (e.g., a file under ), but the contents are opaque to it.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Commit to xART (Secure Storage Component):</strong></p><ul><li>In parallel, the SEP computes a cryptographic digest (e.g., a hash or MAC) over the new payload and the associated monotonic counter or nonce.</li><li>It writes this digest and the updated counter/nonce to xART.</li><li>xART becomes the authoritative record of “what the latest version of this object should look like” and “how many times it has been updated.”</li></ul></li></ol><ol><li>The SEP requests the ciphertext from the AP.</li><li>It recomputes the digest and compares it against the value stored in xART for that object.</li><li>If the digests and counters match, the SEP accepts and decrypts the payload.</li><li>If the AP has replayed an old copy (e.g., with a lower counter or different hash), the mismatch is detected and the SEP treats it as an —typically halting access to that data or, in severe cases, triggering a lockout.</li></ol><ul><li><p>\nThe SEP’s view of sensitive state (e.g., passcode retry counters, escrow records) is strictly monotonic. An attacker cannot reset or roll back these counters by snapshotting and restoring AP-visible storage, because xART’s internal counters would not match.</p></li><li><p>\nFrom the AP’s perspective, xART is a black box.

Since it is based on L4, it relies heavily on synchronous IPC for system calls.</p><p><strong>Identifying the Syscall Handler:</strong>\nIn the disassembled  binary (decrypted via Boot ROM exploit), the exception vector table is the starting point. The  handler dispatches requests based on the immediate value or a register (typically  or ).</p><p>\nThe  is modular, consisting of the kernel and several user-mode \"apps\" or \"tasks.\" Analysis of firmware dumps reveals the internal naming convention:</p><ul><li> The root task and kernel.</li><li> The backend for , managing Data Protection and Keychain items.</li><li><strong> (Secure Biometric Sensor Driver):</strong> The backend for , handling the processing of fingerprint and face data.</li><li> Manages communication with the NFC Secure Element for Apple Pay.</li><li> A directory service mapping symbolic names to endpoints.</li></ul><p>By tracing the IPC messages dispatched from the Mailbox handler, you can map which L4 task handles which service. For example, messages routed to the endpoint associated with  will contain the proprietary command structures for biometric enrollment and matching. Analyzing the message parsing logic within that specific task reveals the attack surface for biometric bypasses.</p><blockquote><p> Standard tools like IDA Pro or Ghidra require custom loaders for  binaries. The memory layout is non-standard, and the binary format (Mach-O) often has stripped headers or non-standard segment protections that must be manually reconstructed based on the SCIP configuration found in the Boot Monitor logic.</p></blockquote><h2>3.0 The Chain of Trust: Firmware &amp; Bootloaders</h2><p>With the hardware root of trust established and the Secure Enclave operating as a parallel authority, the Application Processor begins the process of bootstrapping the mutable software stack. This phase is governed by the  serialization format and a strict chain of cryptographic handover.</p><h3>3.1 Low-Level Bootloader (LLB)</h3><p>On platforms that implement an LLB stage (e.g., Apple Silicon Macs and older A-series SoCs), the <strong>Low-Level Bootloader (LLB)</strong> is the first piece of mutable code executed by the Application Processor. Loaded by the Boot ROM from the boot partition of the internal flash (NAND, or NOR SPI on some development hardware), it executes initially out of on-die SRAM before DRAM has been brought online. Its primary directive is architectural: it must bridge the gap between the raw silicon state and the feature-rich environment required by iBoot.</p><h3>3.1.1 Parsing the Image4 () Container</h3><p>To the reverse engineer, \"firmware\" on Apple Silicon is synonymous with . LLB is not a raw binary; it is encapsulated in an Image4 container, a format based on ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One) and DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules). Understanding this structure is prerequisite to any firmware analysis.</p><p>A complete Image4 object consists of an  and an , with an optional  object used in restore flows.</p><ol><li><p> The actual executable code (the LLB binary).</p><ul><li> The payload is encrypted under a per-image AES key. On production devices, this per-image key is wrapped using the SoC’s  and stored in the  tag within the payload. At boot, the hardware AES engine unwraps the KBAG under the GID key to recover the IV and payload key, then decrypts the payload. This means the payload is opaque to external analysis unless decrypted on-device (or via a GID oracle).</li><li> Once decrypted, the payload is typically compressed (LZSS or LZFSE).</li><li> A 4-character code (e.g., , ) identifying the component.</li></ul></li><li><p> The signature and constraints, commonly known as the .</p><ul><li> An RSA or ECDSA signature over the SHA-384 hash of the payload.</li><li> A set of entitlements and constraints (tags) that dictate  and  this payload can run.</li><li> The manifest includes the certificate chain leading back to the Apple Root CA. The Boot ROM holds the corresponding root public key (or its hash) in immutable hardware and verifies the chain using the <strong>Public Key Accelerator (PKA)</strong>.</li></ul></li><li><p> (Optional) Contains hardware-specific personalization data used during the restore process, such as the unique nonce generated by the SEP.</p></li></ol><p>\nWhen the Boot ROM loads LLB (and when LLB subsequently loads iBoot), it performs the following  routine:</p><ol><li>Parse the ASN.1 structure to separate  and .</li><li>Hash the  (ciphertext).</li><li>Locate the corresponding hash in the  (under the specific tag, e.g., ).</li><li>Verify the  signature using the PKA.</li><li>If valid, the hardware unwraps the payload key from the KBAG using the GID Key, loads it into the AES engine, and decrypts the  ciphertext.</li></ol><h4>3.1.2 DRAM Training and Memory Controller Configuration</h4><p>Before external LPDDR4X/LPDDR5 Unified Memory can be used, the memory controller and PHY must be trained. Early boot code (Boot ROM and/or LLB) runs initially from on-die SRAM until DRAM training has converged. The physical characteristics of RAM—signal timing, voltage margins, and skew—vary slightly between every physical device due to manufacturing tolerances.</p><ol><li><strong>Reading SPD/Calibration Data:</strong> The boot code reads calibration data from the device tree or dedicated EEPROM areas.</li><li> It configures the Physical Layer (PHY) interface of the memory controller.</li><li> The code executes a complex algorithm that writes patterns to DRAM and reads them back, adjusting delay lines (DLLs) and drive strengths until the signal is stable.</li><li> Once training is complete, the MCU is brought online. The Memory Management Unit (MMU) is then reconfigured to map the vast expanse of DRAM into the address space.</li></ol><p>\nIf you are attempting to exploit the Boot ROM or early LLB, you are constrained to SRAM. You cannot load large payloads or use heap spraying techniques that require gigabytes of memory until  the bootloader has successfully trained the DRAM. This creates a \"choke point\" for early-boot exploits.</p><h3>3.1.3 Verifying the Exclusive Chip ID (ECID) and Board ID</h3><p>Apple utilizes a mechanism called  (or Taming) to prevent firmware replay attacks. You cannot simply take a valid, signed LLB from one iPhone and run it on another, nor can you downgrade to an older, vulnerable LLB version.</p><p>This enforcement happens inside the Image4 parser logic within LLB (checking the next stage) and the Boot ROM (checking LLB).</p><p>\nThe  manifest contains specific tags that bind the signature to the hardware:</p><ul><li> A unique per-SoC identifier fused into the chip and exposed as an integer value used for personalization.</li><li> Identifies the PCB model (e.g.,  for a specific iPhone logic board).</li><li> Identifies the SoC model (e.g.,  for M1).</li><li> for Production,  for Development.</li></ul><p>\nDuring boot, the executing code reads the actual values from the hardware fuses and compares them against the values present in the signed .</p><ul><li>If <code>Hardware.ECID != Manifest.ECID</code>, the boot halts.</li><li>If <code>Hardware.BORD != Manifest.BORD</code>, the boot halts.</li></ul><p>This mechanism, combined with the  (a random value generated by the SEP during updates and baked into the ), ensures that the firmware is:</p><ol><li> Signed by Apple.</li><li> Valid only for .</li><li> Valid only for <em>this specific boot/update cycle</em> (preventing downgrades).</li></ol><blockquote><p> In the \"Tahoe\" architecture, reverse engineering suggests this verification logic appears to use redundant checks and bitwise operations that resist simple instruction skipping (e.g., glitching a  instruction).</p></blockquote><h3>3.2 iBoot (Stage 2 Bootloader)</h3><p>Once LLB has initialized the DRAM and verified the next stage, it hands off execution to . While LLB is a hardware-focused shim, iBoot is a sophisticated, compact operating system in its own right. It features a cooperative task scheduler (rather than a simple single-threaded loop) that manages concurrent subsystems including a full USB stack, a display driver (for the Apple logo), and a filesystem driver (APFS/HFS+). In the Tahoe architecture, iBoot’s role has expanded beyond merely bootstrapping the XNU kernel; it now serves as the orchestrator of the platform's security domains, responsible for loading and isolating the hardware-enforced monitors before the kernel is permitted to execute.</p><h4>3.2.1 The Apple Device Tree (ADT)</h4><p>The hardware configuration of an Apple Silicon device is not discoverable via standard buses like PCI enumeration alone. Instead, iBoot relies on the —a hierarchical binary data structure (conceptually similar to OpenFirmware or Linux Device Trees) that describes the SoC's topology.</p><p>\nThe raw ADT is either embedded within the iBoot binary or loaded as a separate  payload. It contains nodes describing CPUs, memory maps, interrupt controllers (AIC), and peripherals. Unlike Linux systems which often use a \"Flattened Device Tree\" (FDT), Apple utilizes its own proprietary binary format for the ADT, which XNU consumes directly via the  APIs.</p><p><strong>Runtime Population ():</strong>\nBefore jumping to the kernel, iBoot populates the  node of the ADT with critical runtime parameters.</p><ul><li> A high-entropy random value (inferred to be derived from the TRNG). The kernel uses this to randomize its memory slide.</li><li> A critical array of structures defining physical memory regions. iBoot marks regions used by the Boot ROM, LLB, and itself as reserved, ensuring the kernel does not overwrite them.</li><li> The command-line arguments passed to the kernel (e.g., , ). On production devices, these are strictly filtered based on the  flags in LocalPolicy; only specific flags are allowed unless the device is in a specific research or demoted state.</li></ul><h4>3.2.2  Loading the Security Monitors</h4><p>In pre-Tahoe architectures (iOS 14 / macOS 11), iBoot would simply load the kernelcache and jump to it. In the Tahoe era (A15/M2+), iBoot must construct the <strong>Guarded Execution Environment</strong> before the kernel can exist.</p><p><strong>Allocation and Reservation:</strong>\niBoot parses the device tree to identify physical memory ranges reserved for the new monitors. It carves these out of the available DRAM:</p><ul><li> Reserved for the Secure Page Table Monitor.</li><li> Reserved for the Trusted Execution Monitor.</li></ul><p>\niBoot locates the specific Image4 payloads, which are co-packaged with the kernelcache (referenced in the OS firmware manifest):</p><ul><li><strong><code>Ap,SecurePageTableMonitor</code>:</strong> The GL2 binary.</li><li><strong><code>Ap,TrustedExecutionMonitor</code>:</strong> The GL1 binary.</li></ul><p>It decrypts and verifies these payloads just like any other firmware component. However, instead of loading them into standard memory, it loads them into the reserved physical regions identified above.</p><p><strong>Locking SPRR Regions (Conceptual View):</strong>\nThis is the critical security pivot. Before handing off control, iBoot establishes the initial <strong>Shadow Permission Remapping Registers (SPRR)</strong> state to enforce isolation. While the SPTM performs its own fine-grained configuration upon initialization, the architectural guarantee provided by iBoot is:</p><ol><li>The  view is configured to have Read/Write/Execute access to its own memory region.</li><li>The  view is configured to have access to its region.</li><li>Crucially, the  view is configured to mark the SPTM and TXM regions as .</li></ol><p>This ensures that when the processor eventually drops to EL1 (GL0) to run XNU, the kernel is physically incapable of reading or modifying the monitor code, even though it resides in the same physical DRAM.</p><h4>3.2.3 LocalPolicy &amp; BAA: The Shift to Local Signing</h4><p>For macOS, Apple introduced a mechanism to allow users to boot older OS versions or custom kernels (Permissive Security) without breaking the hardware chain of trust. This is managed via .</p><p>\nThe Boot ROM and LLB enforce strict signature checks using manifests issued by Apple's global signing server (TSS). These checks are performed offline using embedded root keys. If you want to boot a custom kernel, you cannot obtain a valid signature from Apple's TSS.</p><ol><li> A policy file stored on the Data Volume (in the  volume). It specifies the security mode (Full, Reduced, Permissive) and the hash of the custom kernel collection.</li><li><strong>Owner Identity Key (OIK):</strong> When a user authorizes a downgrade or custom boot (via Recovery Mode authentication), they are effectively authorizing the use of a device-specific  generated within the Secure Enclave. This key is certified once by Apple's <strong>Basic Attestation Authority (BAA)</strong>.</li><li> The LocalPolicy is signed by the SEP using this OIK.</li><li> iBoot fetches the LocalPolicy. It asks the SEP to verify the signature against the OIK. If the SEP confirms the policy is valid (and matches the user's intent), iBoot proceeds to load the custom kernel hash specified in the policy (enabled via the  bit), effectively \"blessing\" it for this boot cycle.</li></ol><p>This allows \"Permissive Security\" to exist while keeping the Boot ROM and LLB strictly locked down to the hardware root of trust.</p><h4>3.2.4  Decrypting iBoot Payloads via the AES MMIO Interface</h4><p>To analyze iBoot, one must decrypt it. Since the GID key is fused into the silicon and physically disconnected from the CPU's register file, it cannot be extracted via software. Reverse engineers must instead turn the device into a  by manipulating the dedicated AES hardware peripheral.</p><p>\nThe Image4 payload () is encrypted with a random, per-file symmetric key (the target key). This target key is wrapped (encrypted) with the GID key and stored in the  header as a . To decrypt the firmware, one must unwrap this kbag.</p><p><strong>The Hardware Distinction (ISA vs. MMIO):</strong>\nIt is critical to distinguish between the  (instructions like , ) and the .</p><ul><li> Operates on keys loaded into standard NEON/SIMD registers (-). Useful for TLS or disk encryption where the key is known to the OS.</li><li> A memory-mapped I/O (MMIO) block, typically located at a base offset like  (on M1/T8103) or similar  ranges on newer SoCs. This peripheral has exclusive hardware access to the GID key fuses.</li></ul><p>\nUsing a Boot ROM exploit (like  on A-series) or a specialized iBoot exploit, researchers execute a payload that drives this MMIO interface directly:</p><ol><li> Reset the AES peripheral via the  register to clear internal state.</li><li> Write to the configuration register to select the  as the decryption source. This sets an internal mux; the key itself is never exposed to the bus.</li><li> Write the  (IV + Ciphertext) into the  FIFO registers.</li><li> Trigger the engine. The hardware pulls the GID key from the fuses, performs the AES-256-CBC unwrap, and pushes the result to the output buffer.</li><li> Read the unwrapped target key (typically formatted as ) from the  register.</li></ol><p><strong>Hypothesized Countermeasures:</strong>\nModern Apple Silicon (A12+/M1+) implements countermeasures against this oracle usage. Reverse engineering suggests the AES engine may enforce a state machine that requires the output of a GID decryption to be immediately DMA'd to executable memory and jumped to, rather than read back into a general-purpose register. Bypassing this theoretically requires  (voltage glitching) to corrupt the state machine or precise timing attacks to race the hardware's \"sanitize on read\" logic, allowing the extraction of the plaintext key before the hardware scrubs it.</p><h2>4.0 The Security Monitor Layer (GL1/GL2): The Exclave Architecture</h2><p>In the \"Tahoe\" architecture, the XNU kernel has been demoted. It no longer possesses the ultimate authority to define the virtual memory layout of the system. That power has been migrated to a hardware-enforced monitor running in a proprietary execution state known as the  (specifically, the Guarded Execution Feature or GXF). This section dissects the mechanics of this new layer, which effectively functions as a silicon-enforced hypervisor for the kernel itself.</p><h3>4.1 The Secure Page Table Monitor (SPTM) - GL2</h3><p>The Secure Page Table Monitor (SPTM) operates at . It is the highest privilege  component on the Application Processor, sitting above both the XNU Kernel (EL2) and the Secure Kernel (GL1). The SPTM is the sole entity permitted to write to the physical pages that constitute the translation tables (TTBR0/TTBR1) for the managed domains of both the Normal and Secure worlds.</p><h4>4.1.1 The  and  Instructions: Context Switching</h4><p>Transitions into the SPTM utilize the proprietary  instruction, which performs a synchronous, atomic context switch.</p><p>\nTo invoke the SPTM, the kernel populates specific registers and executes the opcode.</p><ul><li> (Little Endian).</li><li> The primary control register. It holds the , a 64-bit value encoding the  (e.g., XNU, TXM, SK), the , and the  (function index).</li><li> The parameters for the call (e.g., physical addresses, permission flags).  is often reserved for the thread stack pointer when relaying calls to the TXM.</li><li> The 5-bit immediate encoded in the  instruction itself serves as an entry index, selecting the specific GXF entry stub (recorded in ).</li></ul><p>\nUpon execution of :</p><ol><li> The hardware traps to GL2.</li><li> The hardware swaps the active Shadow Permission Remapping Register configuration. The memory regions containing the SPTM code and data—previously invisible to the kernel—become Read/Write/Execute.</li><li> The Stack Pointer () is switched to the  register, pointing to a dedicated secure stack within the SPTM's private memory.</li><li> Execution jumps to the vector defined in  (or equivalent GL2 vector base).</li></ol><p>\nThe SPTM returns control to the kernel using  (). This restores the EL2 SPRR configuration and the kernel's stack pointer. Crucially, on the return path, the SPTM and TXM scrub their per-thread state and shared buffers before executing , ensuring that sensitive GL-only data is not left in registers or shared pages exposed to the kernel.</p><h4>4.1.2 The Frame Table (FTE): Tracking Physical Reality</h4><p>To enforce security, the SPTM cannot rely on the kernel's data structures (like ), as they are mutable by a compromised kernel. Instead, the SPTM maintains its own \"God View\" of physical memory called the .</p><p>The Frame Table is a linear array of <strong>Frame Table Entries (FTE)</strong>, located in SPTM-private memory. There is one FTE for every 16KB page of physical RAM (matching the kernel's translation granule).</p><p><strong>FTE Structure and Domains:</strong>\nThe FTE tracks the state of every physical page, enforcing strict ownership by  (). While the internal enum values evolve, the conceptual types include:</p><ul><li> Generic kernel heap/stack.</li><li> Immutable kernel code.</li><li> A page containing translation entries (TTEs).</li><li> Memory owned by the Secure World.</li><li><strong> (SPTM Domain):</strong> Internal monitor structures.</li></ul><p>\nThe SPTM enforces that a physical page can only be mapped into a virtual address space if the mapping permissions are compatible with the page's Type and Domain. For example, a page marked  cannot be mapped as Executable. A page marked  cannot be mapped as Writable by the kernel.</p><h4>4.1.3 The Dispatch Table: Reverse Engineering the Selectors</h4><p>The interface between XNU and the SPTM is a strict, register-based API. However, unlike the stable syscall numbers of the BSD layer, the  are not guaranteed to remain static across macOS versions. Apple frequently rotates these IDs to frustrate static analysis tools.</p><ul><li>: The  (Domain + Table + Endpoint).</li><li>: Arguments (Physical Addresses, Permission Bitmasks, ASIDs).</li></ul><p><strong>Heuristic Identification:</strong>\nSince relying on static IDs is brittle, reverse engineers must fingerprint the  of the handler functions within the <code>Ap,SecurePageTableMonitor</code> binary to identify the primitives.</p><ul><li><p><strong><code>sptm_retype(ppn, old_type, new_type)</code></strong>:</p><ul><li> Look for a function that accepts a Physical Page Number (PPN), reads the corresponding Frame Table Entry (FTE), and performs a . The SPTM must zero-fill () or cache-invalidate the page before transitioning it from  to  to prevent the kernel from initializing a page table with pre-computed malicious entries.</li><li><code>assert(refcount == 0); memset(pa, 0, PAGE_SIZE); fte-&gt;type = new_type;</code></li></ul></li><li><p><strong><code>sptm_map(asid, va, ppn, perms)</code></strong>:</p><ul><li> Look for a function that walks the translation tables (reading physical memory) and performs a  against the FTE. It will contain logic that explicitly compares the requested  (e.g., Write) against the  (e.g., ).</li><li><code>if (fte-&gt;type == XNU_TEXT &amp;&amp; (perms &amp; WRITE)) panic(); write_tte(...);</code></li></ul></li><li><ul><li> Look for the  sequence. For SPTM-controlled mappings, TLB invalidation is performed inside GL2 as part of the unmap routine. XNU cannot directly update those page tables and must invoke SPTM to perform any changes, including the corresponding TLB maintenance ( or similar).</li></ul></li><li><p><strong><code>sptm_map_iommu(dart_id, context_id, dva, ppn, perms)</code></strong>:</p><ul><li> Look for writes to MMIO regions associated with DART controllers, rather than standard RAM. This function validates that the  is not a protected kernel page before mapping it into a device's IOVA space.</li></ul></li></ul><p>\nAutomated analysis scripts should not rely on . Instead, they should symbolically execute the  handler in the SPTM binary, identifying the dispatch table jump via , and then classify the target functions based on the presence of  (cache zero), , or FTE array access patterns.</p><h4>4.1.4  Analyzing Panic Strings and the State Machine</h4><p>The SPTM is designed to be . Unlike standard kernel APIs that return , the SPTM treats invalid requests as evidence of kernel compromise.</p><p>\nIf XNU sends a malformed request (e.g., trying to retype a page that is still mapped), the SPTM treats this as a fatal security violation. Instead of returning an error code that a compromised XNU could potentially suppress, the SPTM directly initiates the system panic or halt sequence.</p><ul><li><code>\"received fatal error for a selector from TXM\"</code> or <code>\"invalid state transition\"</code>.</li><li> These strings are gold for reverse engineers. They confirm that the SPTM enforces a strict <strong>Finite State Machine (FSM)</strong> for memory pages.</li></ul><p><strong>Mapping the State Machine:</strong>\nBy analyzing the panic logic and the allowed transition bitmaps, we can deduce the allowed transitions:</p><ol><li> →  (Allocation)</li><li> →  (Retype for MMU use - requires sanitization)</li><li> →  (Teardown - requires unmapping all entries)</li><li> →  (KEXT loading - One-way transition!)</li></ol><p>Any attempt to deviate from this graph (e.g., trying to turn  directly into ) results in an immediate halt. This prevents \"Page Table Spraying\" and other heap manipulation techniques used to gain kernel execution.</p><h3>4.2 The Trusted Execution Monitor (TXM) – GL0</h3><p>If the SPTM is the brawn—enforcing the physics of memory mapping—the <strong>Trusted Execution Monitor (TXM)</strong> is the brains. Operating as a privileged Conclave at , the TXM is the supreme arbiter of system policy. It represents the architectural decoupling of “mechanism” from “policy.” While the SPTM handles  a page is mapped, the TXM decides  it is allowed to be mapped executable under a given policy.</p><h4>4.2.1 Decoupling AMFI: Moving Core Code-Signature Verification</h4><p>Historically, the <strong>Apple Mobile File Integrity (AMFI)</strong> kernel extension was the primary enforcement point for code signing. While AMFI still exists to handle complex userland policy checks, in the Tahoe architecture the core cryptographic verification logic for <strong>platform and protected code</strong> has been lifted out of the kernel and placed into the TXM. TXM’s primary currency of trust is the <strong>Code Directory Hash (CDHash)</strong>.</p><p><strong>The Verification Flow (conceptual):</strong></p><ol><li><p> The kernel (XNU) loads a binary into memory (typed as ). It parses the  load command and calculates the CDHash (typically SHA-256 over the Code Directory).</p></li><li><p> XNU issues a call into the Secure World. The Secure Kernel (GL1) routes this to the TXM (GL0). The kernel passes the CDHash and the physical address range that will back the executable mapping.</p></li><li><p> The TXM consults its internal :</p><ul><li> CDHashes for immutable OS binaries (kernel collections, dyld shared cache, system daemons shipped in Cryptexes).</li><li><strong>Loadable / Dynamic Trust Caches:</strong> CDHashes for binaries that have been verified previously (third-party apps, JIT regions, auxiliary trust caches).</li></ul></li><li><p> On a , the system enters a “cold path”. The kernel, often assisted by  and , provides the CMS signature blob and certificate chain for the image. TXM performs the cryptographic verification against the relevant Apple root (or Developer ID root) inside the guarded world. On success, the CDHash is inserted into an appropriate trust cache.</p></li><li><p> Once the CDHash is validated according to platform policy, TXM updates its internal state so that the specific physical pages associated with that CDHash are marked as “permitted for execution” when requested with appropriate permissions.</p></li><li><p> When XNU later asks the SPTM to map those pages as Executable (), the SPTM consults TXM (or the trust-cache state driven by TXM). If the pages are not in a state that policy allows to become executable, the SPTM denies the Execute permission, even if EL2 code tries to set it in the PTE.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Platform distinction (iOS-class vs macOS):</strong></p><p>The exact  enforced by TXM/SPTM is platform-dependent:</p><ul><li><p>On <strong>iOS / iPadOS / watchOS / visionOS</strong>, TXM + SPTM implement a hard invariant: only code that is both correctly signed and policy-approved is allowed to become executable. AMFI’s view of “signed or not” is no longer sufficient on its own; the SPTM must agree.</p></li><li><p>On , the platform is explicitly designed to allow arbitrary and ad-hoc user code to run. In that environment:</p><ul><li>TXM still verifies and tracks  (kernel collections, system frameworks, hardened system daemons) and other code that participates in the system integrity story (e.g. components running with special entitlements or under hardened runtime).</li><li>SPTM still mediates executable mappings and protects the integrity of page tables and immutable kernel/monitor regions.</li><li>However, the global “no unsigned code ever executes” property is  applied to general userland on macOS. The set of mappings that SPTM/TXM treat as “must be verified” is narrower and aligned with Apple’s documented policy distinction between macOS and fully locked-down platforms.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><p>On , patching the kernel to ignore AMFI errors is no longer a sufficient route to arbitrary unsigned code execution: the SPTM/TXM stack must still bless the mapping. Attempts to create executable mappings for code that TXM has not accepted will fail at the SPTM boundary.</p></li><li><p>On , a kernel compromise can still influence which user binaries run (for example, by weakening or bypassing Gatekeeper and AMFI checks for user processes), and ad-hoc binaries remain architecturally admissible. The SPTM/TXM stack primarily constrains:</p><ul><li>the integrity of page tables and KIP/KTRR-like regions,</li><li>the mappings of kernel collections and other protected code, and</li><li>the ability of a compromised kernel to subvert those invariants.</li></ul></li></ul><p>In all cases, SPTM continues to arbitrate frame typing and protected mappings above EL2. TXM’s policy decisions define which code is  for protection and execution under a given mode; SPTM enforces the resulting invariants in the page-table and DART hardware.</p><h4>4.2.2 The Trust Cache: Static vs. Loadable</h4><p>To avoid the performance penalty of cryptographic verification on every page fault, the TXM manages the —a database of known-good CDHashes.</p><ul><li><p>\nThis is loaded by iBoot and passed to the TXM during the Secure World initialization. It contains the hashes of every binary in the OS (now encapsulated in the immutable ). This cache resides in Secure World memory and is strictly Read-Only.</p></li><li><p>\nThese handle third-party applications, JIT regions, and auxiliary updates. When a user launches an app, the TXM verifies the signature once and adds the CDHash to a loadable cache.</p><ul><li> The kernel queries the Trust Cache via a specific  selector.</li><li> These caches are mutable structures managed by the TXM. A logic bug in the TXM's management of this cache (e.g., a race condition during entry removal or a hash collision attack) is a high-value target for persistence.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>4.2.3 Developer Mode Enforcement and Downgrade Protection</h4><p>The TXM is also the guardian of the device's security posture, specifically .</p><p>In previous iterations, enabling debugging capabilities was often a matter of setting  variables or  (like ). In Tahoe, these states are managed by the TXM.</p><p>\nEnabling Developer Mode requires a reboot and explicit user authorization (Secure Intent via physical buttons). The TXM persists this state (likely via the Secure Enclave's secure storage).</p><p>\nThe TXM enforces that the system cannot transition from a \"Production\" state to a \"Developer\" state without a full reboot and authentication ceremony. This prevents a kernel-level attacker from dynamically relaxing security policies to load unsigned modules.</p><p>Furthermore, the  (signed by the SEP) encodes whether the system is in Full, Reduced, or Permissive Security. Early-boot components (LLB/iBoot) will refuse to start macOS without a valid LocalPolicy, preventing silent downgrades of security policy. At runtime, the TXM consults this configuration when deciding which code-signing and trust-cache policies to enforce.</p><h2>5.0 XNU Kernel Initialization: Entering GL1</h2><p>The handoff from iBoot to the XNU kernel marks the transition from a single-threaded bootloader to a symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) operating system. However, in the Tahoe architecture, this is no longer a handover of absolute power. In the Tahoe architecture on M4 silicon, the XNU kernel executes at  (Hardware EL1), while the Secure Page Table Monitor (SPTM) occupies  (Hardware EL2). Consequently, the kernel enters not as a master, but as a guest under the SPTM's supervision.</p><p>The entry point is defined in . At this precise moment, the system state is fragile: the MMU is operating under a minimal bootstrap mapping provided by iBoot (or disabled entirely depending on the specific SoC generation), interrupts are masked ( bits set), and the stack pointer is essentially arbitrary. The kernel's first objective is to orient itself within physical memory, calculate the KASLR slide, and establish the virtual memory structures required to turn on the lights.</p><h3>5.1 The  routine and KASLR</h3><p>The  symbol is the architectural entry point. Unlike x86_64, where the kernel might handle its own decompression and relocation, the Apple Silicon kernel is loaded as a raw Mach-O executable (within the  container) directly into physical memory by iBoot.</p><p><strong>The Register State at Entry:</strong></p><ul><li>: Indicates EL2 (on standard macOS Tahoe configurations).</li><li>: Physical address of the  structure (version 2).</li><li>: Physical address of the Device Tree base (if not inside ).</li><li>: 0 (Reserved/Empirically observed).</li><li>: 0 (Reserved/Empirically observed).</li></ul><h4>5.1.1 Deriving the Kernel Slide: The Decoupled Address Space</h4><p>Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (KASLR) on Apple Silicon is a cooperative effort between iBoot and XNU. iBoot generates a high-entropy value from the TRNG, populates the  property in the Device Tree, and physically relocates the kernel text in DRAM to match this slide.</p><p>\nUpon entry at , the kernel immediately parses the  structure pointed to by . This structure acts as the handover manifest, containing:</p><ul><li>: The  virtual base address where the kernel is mapped (i.e., the static base plus the slide).</li><li>: The actual physical load address in DRAM.</li></ul><p>\nThe kernel calculates its own slide by comparing the runtime virtual base provided by iBoot against its compile-time static base:</p><p>$$ \\texttt{vm\\_kernel\\_slide} = \\texttt{boot\\_args.virtBase} - \\texttt{STATIC\\_KERNEL\\_BASE} $$</p><p><strong>The Tahoe Constraint: Address Space Decoupling:</strong>\nIn the Tahoe architecture, the system operates under a paradigm of . The SPTM (GL2) and the Kernel (EL2) reside in the same physical DRAM but operate in distinct translation regimes.</p><ol><li> The kernel runs under  (or  with VHE), with a virtual layout randomized by .</li><li> The SPTM runs under the  translation regime with its own independent set of translation table base registers.</li></ol><p>\nThis separation is critical. A kernel-level memory leak (e.g., an  revealing a kernel pointer) allows an attacker to calculate . In previous architectures, if the monitor (PPL) was mapped at a fixed offset relative to the kernel, a kernel leak would instantly reveal the monitor's location.</p><p>In Tahoe, knowing  yields  about the virtual address of the SPTM. The SPTM's virtual mapping is established by iBoot in the GL2 context before the kernel executes. While the kernel is aware of the SPTM's  pages (marked as \"Reserved\" in the memory map), it is architecturally blind to the SPTM's  location.</p><p><strong>RE Focus: Finding the Slide:</strong>\nFor a reverse engineer with a kernel panic log or a JTAG connection, identifying these slides requires inspecting distinct registers:</p><ul><li> Inspect  (or  if VHE is active). The translation table base points to the physical location of the kernel's L1 table. The high bits of the PC (Program Counter) at the exception vector reveal the virtual slide.</li><li> This is invisible from EL2. To find it, one must inspect the GL2-specific TTBRs via JTAG while the core is halted in the GL2 context.</li><li> The  global variable in XNU is one of the first initialized. In a raw memory dump, locating the  struct (often at the start of a physical page aligned to 16KB) will reveal the  directly.</li></ul><h4>5.1.2 Initializing the MMU:  and the SPTM Handshake</h4><p>Before the kernel can execute C code safely, it must enable the Memory Management Unit (MMU). On standard ARMv8, this involves populating translation tables and writing to  and , then setting .</p><p>On Tahoe, this process is fundamentally altered because <strong>the kernel cannot write to its own page tables.</strong></p><p>\nHow does the kernel build its initial page tables if it requires the SPTM to map pages, but the SPTM requires the kernel to make hypercalls?</p><p><strong>The Solution: The Bootstrap Tables:</strong>\niBoot installs a minimal set of  before handing off control. These tables typically contain identity mappings for the PC and stack, allowing the kernel to execute the initialization code required to bring up the SPTM interface.</p><ol><li> The kernel configures the <strong>Translation Control Register ()</strong>.\n<ul><li> Defines the size of the virtual address space (typically 48-bit on macOS).</li><li> Granule size (16KB is standard for Apple Silicon).</li><li> Intermediate Physical Address Size (matches the SoC capability, e.g., 40 bits).</li><li> Typically configured to allow the top byte (bits 63-56) to carry metadata (such as PAC signatures or tags) without affecting address translation.</li></ul></li></ol><p><strong>The SPTM Handshake (The First ):</strong>\nOnce  is configured, the kernel must transition from the iBoot-provided bootstrap tables to its own managed tables.</p><ol><li> The kernel allocates physical pages for the new L1/L2/L3 translation tables from the  pool.</li><li> The kernel zeroes these pages.</li><li> The kernel executes  (Selector  - ) to convert these pages from  to .</li><li> The kernel executes  (Selector  - ) to populate the entries, replicating the kernel text and static data mappings.</li><li> Finally, the kernel programs the appropriate  (EL1 or EL2 depending on configuration) to point to the new L1 table. The SPTM constrains the actual effect via SPRR/GXF.</li></ol><p>\nThe final step of  is writing to the <strong>System Control Register ()</strong>.</p><ul><li> Set to 1.</li><li> Set to 1.</li></ul><p>In Tahoe, writes to  are mediated by GL2/SPTM (via GXF’s control over system registers). GL2 enforces that configurations keep  set, preventing EL2 from creating writable-executable mappings even if compromised. If the kernel attempts to disable , the SPTM rejects the configuration and panics the device.</p><p>Once the MMU is active and the kernel is running on its own page tables (managed by SPTM), the  routine branches to , beginning the high-level initialization of the BSD subsystem and IOKit.</p><h3>5.2 Hardware Security Enforcements (The \"Kill Switch\" Registers)</h3><p>As the kernel initialization sequence progresses through , it reaches a critical inflection point. The memory management structures are initialized, and the kernel is about to transition from a setup phase to a runtime phase. To prevent a compromised runtime kernel from modifying its own logic, the initialization routine must engage the hardware \"Kill Switches.\"</p><p>In the Tahoe architecture, this protection is layered:  provides the physical baseline,  defines the boot-time immutable regions, and the  virtualizes and extends these concepts to enforce dynamic immutability.</p><h4>5.2.1 KTRR (Kernel Text Read-Only Region): The Physical Lock</h4><p><strong>Kernel Text Read-Only Region (KTRR)</strong> is Apple’s hardware solution to the \"W^X\" (Write XOR Execute) problem at the physical memory controller level. While the MMU (via page tables) controls virtual access permissions, page tables are mutable data structures. KTRR enforces read-only permissions for a physical range corresponding to kernel text, below the level of page tables. Even if an attacker can mutate PTEs, writes into the KTRR physical region are blocked or faulted.</p><p>\nKTRR is controlled via a set of proprietary system registers, typically accessible via  instructions.</p><ul><li><strong> ():</strong> Defines the physical start address of the protected range.</li><li><strong> ():</strong> Defines the physical end address.</li><li><strong> ():</strong> The kill switch. Writing  to the lock bit enables the protection.</li></ul><p><strong>The Tahoe Evolution (Virtualization of KTRR):</strong>\nOn M3/M4 chips running the SPTM, the kernel's interaction with KTRR changes. It is confirmed that the SPTM virtualizes these registers; writes from the kernel trap to the SPTM at EL2, which strictly validates and rejects unauthorized modifications. When XNU executes the legacy instructions to write to  in , the hardware traps these accesses. The SPTM validates that the kernel is attempting to cover the correct physical range and enforces its own policy, effectively mocking the success of the operation to the kernel while ensuring the hardware is locked down.</p><blockquote><p><strong>RE Focus: The KTRR Slide Alignment</strong>\nBecause KTRR operates on physical ranges with large granularity (e.g., 1MB or L2 cache line boundaries), the KASLR slide is forced to align to this granularity. If you are brute-forcing the KASLR slide, knowing the KTRR alignment constraint significantly reduces the entropy search space.</p></blockquote><h4>5.2.2 Kernel Integrity Protection (KIP) and SPTM Sealing</h4><p>KTRR protects the static kernel binary (). However, modern macOS relies heavily on the <strong>Boot Kernel Collection (BKC)</strong> and <strong>Auxiliary Kernel Collection (AKC)</strong>—large caches of drivers and extensions loaded during boot.</p><p>\nApple documentation refers to <strong>Kernel Integrity Protection (KIP)</strong> as a hardware feature where the memory controller defines a protected region into which iBoot loads the kernel and kernel extensions, then denies writes after boot. This serves as the static anchor for the BKC.</p><p><strong>SPTM Dynamic Sealing ():</strong>\nThe SPTM generalizes this concept to support dynamic loading. Unlike static KTRR/KIP regions, the SPTM maintains a  where pages can be typed.</p><ol><li> During , the kernel links and relocates extensions.</li><li> The kernel issues a  call (Selector  or ) to \"seal\" the region.</li><li> The SPTM updates the Frame Table Entries (FTE) for the physical pages backing the drivers, transitioning them from  (Writable) to  (Executable/Read-Only).</li></ol><p>\nThe security invariant enforced here is that memory typed as  is  writable by EL2. If the kernel attempts to write to a sealed page, the  configuration for EL2 triggers a permission fault. This effectively turns the kernel extensions into ROM, mitigating rootkits that historically operated by patching IOKit vtables in memory.</p><h4>5.2.3 The System Control Register () Lockdown</h4><p>The final \"Kill Switch\" is the configuration of the ARM processor itself. The  register controls the MMU, caches, and alignment checks.</p><ul><li> Bit 19. When set, any memory region mapped as Writable is implicitly treated as Non-Executable ().</li></ul><p><strong>The Trap-and-Emulate Policy:</strong>\nIn a standard ARM system, EL2 can modify  at will. In the Tahoe architecture, writes to  are mediated by GL2/SPTM via GXF’s control over system registers. The effective policy under normal operation is that : GL2/SPTM will not accept configurations that clear  to create writable–executable regions. If the kernel attempts to program  with  cleared, the requested configuration is rejected by the monitor and, in current implementations, this manifests as a system panic rather than a silent relaxation of protections. This ensures that the fundamental security properties of the execution environment (in particular W^X) cannot be disabled, even by a compromised kernel.</p><h3>5.3 Exclaves: The Microkernel within the Monolith</h3><p>The introduction of  in the Tahoe architecture represents the most profound structural change to the Apple OS ecosystem since the transition from Mac OS 9 to OS X. It is an admission that the monolithic kernel architecture (XNU) has become too large, too complex, and too mutable to serve as the ultimate Trusted Computing Base (TCB) for high-value assets.</p><p>Exclaves introduce a  running side-by-side with the monolithic XNU kernel on the same Application Processor cores. Unlike the Secure Enclave (which is a separate coprocessor), Exclaves harness the full performance of the M-series cores while maintaining cryptographic isolation enforced by the SPTM.</p><h4>5.3.1 The L4 Influence: Domains, Conclaves, and IPC</h4><p>The architecture of the Exclave system is heavily indebted to the  family. It prioritizes minimalism, capability-based security, and strict isolation.</p><p><strong>The Hierarchy of Isolation:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>The Secure Kernel ():</strong> A tiny, formally verifiable kernel that manages scheduling and IPC within the secure world. It runs at .</li><li> The highest level of separation. The \"Insecure Domain\" hosts XNU and userland (EL2/EL0). The \"Secure Domain\" hosts Exclave workloads.</li><li> Within the Secure Domain (GL0), workloads are siloed into . A Conclave is a lightweight container consisting of an address space, a set of capabilities (handles to resources), and threads.</li></ol><p><strong>Memory Management via SPTM:</strong>\nThe isolation is enforced by the SPTM's Frame Table. Physical pages assigned to an Exclave are typed in the FTE (likely as  or ). The kernel sees these physical pages as \"reserved\" in the device tree. Any attempt by XNU to map these pages via  will result in a panic, as the SPTM forbids mapping Exclave-owned pages into the .</p><h4>5.3.2  The  Mechanism and </h4><p>For the reverse engineer, the critical question is: <em>How does the Kernel talk to an Exclave?</em> They share no virtual memory, run in different hardware contexts, and the SPTM actively prevents XNU from mapping Exclave physical pages. The bridge is a mechanism internally referred to by researchers as , facilitated by a component named .</p><ol><li><p>\nApple has introduced a new Interface Definition Language (IDL) called . It replaces the legacy Mach Interface Generator (MIG) for secure world communication. Tightbeam is strongly typed and buffer-centric.</p><ul><li> The serialization logic is visible in <code>/usr/lib/libTightbeam.dylib</code>.</li><li> appears both as an XNU-side component and as related services in the secure world, bridging Mach ports to Exclave endpoints.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>The Downcall (XNU → Exclave):</strong>\nWhen XNU needs a service, it cannot call the function directly.</p><ul><li> serializes the request using Tightbeam into a shared memory ring buffer.</li><li> The kernel executes a specific instruction to trigger the world switch. This is a  instruction targeting a specific Dispatch ID reserved for the Secure Kernel.</li><li> The hardware (mediated by SPTM) saves the EL2 state, switches the SPRR configuration to the Exclave view, and jumps to the  entry point (GL1).</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>The Upcall (Exclave → XNU):</strong>\nExclaves rely on XNU for file system I/O or networking.</p><ul><li>The Exclave writes a request to the outbound ring buffer.</li><li>It triggers an interrupt or executes a  yield.</li><li> receives the notification, reads the request, performs the operation via standard VFS calls, and returns the result via a Downcall.</li></ul></li></ol><p><strong>Memory Loaning (The \"DART\" Window):</strong>\nWhile control messages go through ring buffers, large data transfers occur via .  pins a userland page and passes its physical address to the Exclave via Tightbeam. The Exclave requests the SPTM to map this specific PPN into its address space. This \"Loaned Memory\" mechanism is a prime target for <strong>TOCTOU (Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use)</strong> attacks, as the ownership transitions are complex and mediated by the SPTM state machine.</p><h4>5.3.3 Use Case: Secure Control of Privacy Indicators and Passkeys</h4><p>The \"Killer App\" for Exclaves in macOS Tahoe is the hardware-enforced privacy indicator (the green/orange dots).</p><p>Reverse engineering of current macOS Tahoe builds strongly suggests that these indicators are implemented using an Exclave-controlled overlay path along the following lines:</p><ol><li> The physical framebuffer region corresponding to the status bar indicators is, in current implementations,  in the XNU domain. It appears to be owned exclusively by a specific  (GL0), so that only secure-world code can directly address the pixels used for the indicators.</li><li> The Display Coprocessor's IOMMU (DART) is configured under SPTM control such that the main display pipe used by XNU and WindowServer cannot write to the indicator pixels. Only a secure overlay pipe, controlled by the Exclave domain, is allowed to source scanout data for that region.</li><li> Under this design, XNU cannot map the physical memory backing the secure overlay, and it cannot reconfigure the relevant DART contexts without going through SPTM policy. As a result, a compromised kernel is effectively unable to erase or suppress the indicator once the secure pipeline has decided it should be visible.</li></ol><p>\nSimilarly, passkey operations are increasingly implemented inside Exclave-backed services.</p><ul><li> The key material for Passkeys is generated and stored in hardware-isolated domains (SEP plus, on newer platforms, Exclave-backed services), with XNU only ever handling opaque identifiers or tokens rather than raw private keys.</li><li> Even if malware injects code into the  daemon or the kernel, it cannot extract the private key material, because it resides in a memory domain that the Normal World cannot directly address.</li></ul><h2>6.0 The Mach Subsystem: The Nervous System</h2><p>While the SPTM and Exclaves represent the new fortress walls of the Apple Silicon architecture, the  subsystem remains the internal nervous system that coordinates activity within the XNU kernel. Originating from the NeXTSTEP era, Mach provides the fundamental primitives for Inter-Process Communication (IPC), thread scheduling, and virtual memory management.</p><p>For the reverse engineer, Mach is the primary vector for local privilege escalation (LPE). Despite decades of hardening, the complexity of state management in Mach messaging remains a fertile ground for logic bugs, race conditions, and reference counting errors. In the Tahoe era, Mach has been retrofitted with heavy PAC enforcement to protect its object graph.</p><h3>6.1 Mach Ports &amp; IPC Primitives</h3><p>At the conceptual level, Mach is an object-oriented kernel. The fundamental unit of addressing is the . To a userland process, a port is merely a 32-bit integer handle (). To the kernel, it is a complex, reference-counted data structure () that acts as a unidirectional communication channel.</p><h4>6.1.1 Port Rights: Receive, Send, Send-Once, and Dead Names</h4><p>The security model of Mach is capability-based. Possessing a port name is meaningless without the associated . The kernel tracks these rights in the process's IPC space.</p><ul><li> The ownership right. Only one task can hold the Receive right for a specific port at any given time. This task is the destination for messages sent to the port.\n<ul><li> The  struct contains a pointer () to the  of the task holding this right.</li></ul></li><li> The ability to queue messages into the port. Multiple tasks can hold send rights to the same port. This is the standard \"client\" handle.</li><li><strong><code>MACH_PORT_RIGHT_SEND_ONCE</code>:</strong> A \"fire-and-forget\" right that vanishes after a single message is sent. This is critical for the Request/Reply pattern (RPC). When a client sends a message, it typically includes a  right to its own reply port. The server uses this to send exactly one reply, preventing the server from spamming the client later.</li><li><strong><code>MACH_PORT_RIGHT_DEAD_NAME</code>:</strong> If the task holding the Receive right dies or destroys the port, all outstanding Send rights in other tasks are instantly transmuted into Dead Names. Any attempt to send a message to a dead name returns .</li></ul><p><strong>RE Focus: The  Structure and PAC:</strong>\nIn previous generations, a common exploit technique involved \"Fake Ports\"—spraying the heap with crafted data that looked like an  struct and then tricking the kernel into using it.</p><p>In the arm64e/Tahoe architecture, the  structure is heavily fortified:</p><ol><li> The base header of the port.</li><li> A pointer to the underlying kernel object (e.g., a task, a thread, or a user-client). <strong>This pointer is PAC-signed.</strong></li><li> A 64-bit context value, also PAC-signed.</li></ol><p>If an attacker attempts to forge a port, they must generate a valid signature for the  pointer. Without the  (Data Key A), the kernel will panic upon  execution during message delivery.</p><h4>6.1.2 The IPC Space () and the Global Name Server</h4><p>Every task (process) in macOS has an associated  (). This structure acts as the translation layer between userland integer handles () and kernel objects (, , etc.).</p><p><strong>The Translation Table ():</strong>\nEach IPC space is backed by a dynamically sized array of  (), commonly referred to as the  / .</p><ul><li><p>\nThe userland handle (e.g. ) encodes:</p><ul><li>A  into the , and</li><li><strong>High-order generation bits</strong> used to detect stale handles.</li></ul></li><li><p>\nEach entry contains (simplified):</p><ul><li><p>: A pointer to the underlying  or . On arm64e/Tahoe, this pointer is protected with pointer authentication (PAC) so that corruption of the raw bits does not yield a usable kernel pointer.</p></li><li><p>: A bitfield encoding:</p><ul><li>Rights (send, receive, send-once, etc.).</li><li>The generation count for that slot.</li><li>Additional flags (e.g. dead-name state).</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>The Lookup Process ():</strong>\nWhen a thread executes  to send to some :</p><ol><li><p>The kernel retrieves the current task’s IPC space:<code>ipc_space_t space = current_task()-&gt;itk_space;</code></p></li><li><p>It decodes the  to obtain the index and generation and indexes into .</p></li><li><ul><li>Generation matches the high bits of the name?</li><li>Required right present (e.g.  for a send).</li></ul></li><li><p>On arm64e, it authenticates the  pointer using the appropriate kernel PAC key and context.</p></li><li><p>If all checks succeed, it obtains the  and proceeds with message delivery.</p></li></ol><p>This indirection is what allows the kernel to revoke or recycle ports while making stale userland handles harmless: the generation mismatch will cause lookups to fail instead of returning the wrong object.</p><p>\nMach itself does  implement a string-based global namespace in the kernel. The kernel only knows about ports and rights; it does not know what  means.</p><p>The mapping from <strong>string service names → </strong> is implemented entirely in userland by the , which on macOS is .</p><ul><li><p>\nThe kernel does maintain a small set of “special ports” on host and task objects. Relevant here:</p><ul><li>: A send right representing the host ().</li><li>: The privileged host port (see Section 6.2).</li><li>: The task’s handle to the bootstrap server (typically a port managed by  for that task’s domain).</li></ul></li></ul><pre><code>bootstrap_look_up(bootstrap_port, \"com.apple.foo\", &amp;service_port);\n</code></pre><p>or uses the XPC equivalent, it is really sending a Mach message to whatever port is stored in its  slot.  receives that message and resolves  into a Mach port according to its internal job graph and policy.</p><h4>6.1.3 Copy-on-Write (CoW) optimizations in Out-of-Line (OOL) message passing</h4><p>Mach messages are not limited to small scalars. They can transfer massive amounts of data using  descriptors. This mechanism relies on Virtual Memory (VM) tricks rather than data copying, making it highly efficient but historically dangerous.</p><ol><li> Includes a <code>mach_msg_ool_descriptor_t</code> in the message, pointing to a buffer in its address space (e.g., 100MB of data).</li><li> The kernel does  copy the 100MB. Instead, it walks the sender's VM map.</li><li> The kernel marks the physical pages backing that buffer as  in the sender's map.</li><li> The kernel maps those  into the receiver's address space, also as .</li><li> If either the sender or receiver tries to write to the buffer, the MMU triggers a fault. The kernel catches this, allocates a new physical page, copies the data, and updates the mapping for the writer. This preserves the illusion of a copy.</li></ol><p><strong>The Tahoe/SPTM Intersection:</strong>\nIn the Tahoe architecture, this VM manipulation is complicated by the SPTM.</p><ul><li> When the kernel marks the pages as CoW (Read-Only), it cannot simply update the PTEs. It must issue a  call ( or ) to the SPTM to downgrade the permissions of the physical pages in the sender's address space.</li><li> This complexity introduces a race window. If the kernel logic fails to correctly lock the VM map object before requesting the SPTM update, or if the SPTM state machine has a logic flaw regarding shared pages (), it might be possible to modify the physical page  the message has been \"sent\" but before the receiver reads it. This is known as a  or <strong>Physically-Backed-Virtually-Disjoint</strong> attack.</li></ul><p>\nAnalyze  and  in the XNU source (or binary). Look for how  structures are flagged with  and how these flags translate into SPTM calls. The interaction between Mach IPC (which assumes it controls VM) and the SPTM (which actually controls VM) is the friction point where new bugs will likely emerge.</p><p>In the lexicon of XNU exploitation, the  () has historically been synonymous with “Game Over.” It is  the kernel task port itself; rather, it is a privileged Mach port on the global  () that unlocks host-level operations and special ports. In older exploitation chains,  was often the stepping stone to obtain a send right to  (TFP0) via interfaces such as  or .</p><h4>6.2.1 The “God Mode” Handle: Generation and Restriction</h4><p>The  port is backed by the kernel’s global  (). Unlike a task port, which maps to a , the  port is a privileged view of the host object that unlocks host-level operations (for example, access to special ports and certain system configuration controls).</p><p>During early bootstrap in , XNU initializes the host subsystem:</p><ol><li><p>\nAllocates and initializes the  structure.</p></li><li><p>\nCalls  (or equivalent helpers) to create the Mach port for the host.</p></li><li><p>\nAssociates the  pointer with the port’s  / context fields.</p></li></ol><ul><li>The  (or related kobject pointer) is stored as a <strong>PAC-signed kernel pointer</strong>, using one of the kernel’s data-pointer keys with the port address (or similar) as context.</li><li>This prevents simple “write some other kernel address into ” attacks, even given a raw kernel read/write primitive: tampered pointers will not authenticate when used.</li></ul><p>The system is conservative about who gets . Typical holders are:</p><ul><li><p>\nOwns the receive right for the host-privileged port.</p></li><li><p><strong>Privileged daemons (for example, , ):</strong>\nObtain send rights to  via <code>host_get_host_priv_port()</code> or the special-port mechanism, so they can:</p><ul><li>manage special ports (, ), and</li><li>perform host-level operations on behalf of the rest of the system.</li></ul></li></ul><p>The exact set of daemons that receive  can vary by OS release, but it is a very small, explicitly entitled group.</p><p><strong>The “TFP0” chain in Tahoe</strong></p><p>Historically, a common pattern was:</p><pre><code>host_get_host_priv_port(mach_host_self(), &amp;host_priv);\ntask_for_pid(mach_task_self(), 0, &amp;kernel_task_port);\n</code></pre><p>On modern macOS / Tahoe, several layers weaken this chain:</p><ol><li><p><strong> and SIP:</strong>\nEven if a caller presents ,  is gated by <strong>System Integrity Protection (SIP)</strong> and related policy hooks.

These ports are accessed via  and .</p><p>Internally, the  structure maintains an array such as:</p><pre><code>ipc_port_t special[HOST_MAX_SPECIAL_PORT + 1];\n</code></pre><p>where specific indices are reserved for particular subsystems.</p><p><strong>Critical special ports (by name)</strong></p><p>A non-exhaustive set of important host special ports:</p><ul><li><p>\nPort used by the kernel to talk to the automounter () to initiate filesystem mounts.</p></li><li><p>\nControl port for the sandbox subsystem ( / ).

For most reverse-engineering and exploitation work, the symbolic names and behaviors matter more than the concrete index values.</p><p><strong>RE Focus: The  trap</strong></p><p>A classic post-exploitation idea is:</p><blockquote><p>Overwrite a host special port (e.g. the KEXTD port) with a port you control, so you can intercept kernel upcalls intended for that subsystem.</p></blockquote><ul><li><p>If an attacker can get  and then call:</p><pre><code>host_set_special_port(host_priv,\n                      HOST_KEXTD_PORT,\n                      attacker_port);\n</code></pre><p>the kernel will now send all “kextd” notifications to  instead.</p></li></ul><p>Mitigations in modern macOS include:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Entitlement and policy gating:</strong> is restricted:</p><ul><li>It requires a host-privileged port.</li><li>It is further gated by entitlements and code-signing checks; in practice, only  and a very small number of highly privileged system daemons are allowed to call it successfully.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Confused-deputy / race hardening:</strong>\nAttackers therefore look for:</p><ul><li>Bugs that allow racing or bypassing entitlement checks.</li><li>Confused-deputy situations where a daemon that  have the entitlement can be coerced into calling  with an attacker-controlled port name.</li></ul></li></ul><p>From a reversing perspective, mapping which daemons hold both  and the relevant private entitlements is a critical part of understanding the real attack surface around .</p><h4>6.2.3  Fuzzing Mach Message Parsing (MIG)</h4><p>Since  exposes a wide attack surface via the Mach IPC interface, it is a primary target for fuzzing. The kernel handles these messages using the <strong>Mach Interface Generator (MIG)</strong>.</p><p><strong>The  Routine:</strong>\nWhen a message is sent to , the kernel's IPC dispatcher calls . This is an auto-generated function that deserializes the Mach message and dispatches it to the implementation (e.g., ).</p><p><strong>Vulnerability Classes in MIG:</strong></p><ol><li> MIG relies on the message header to define the size and type of arguments. If the userland client sends a malformed message (e.g., claiming a descriptor is OOL memory when it is actually inline data), the kernel's unmarshaling logic might misinterpret the data, leading to heap corruption.</li><li><strong>Reference Counting Leaks:</strong> If a MIG routine returns an error (e.g., )  it has incremented the reference count on a port or VM object but  it consumes it, the object leaks. In the kernel, this can lead to a refcount overflow (though 64-bit refcounts make this hard) or a Use-After-Free if the cleanup logic is flawed.</li><li> As discussed in Section 6.1.3, if the message includes Out-of-Line memory, the kernel maps it Copy-on-Write. If the MIG handler verifies the content of the memory and then uses it later, the userland process might be able to race the kernel and modify the physical page (via a side-channel or SPTM state confusion) between the check and the use.</li></ol><p>\nIn the Tahoe kernel, MIG-generated code has been hardened with .</p><ul><li> The dispatch tables used by  are signed.</li><li> The  structure (representing the message in flight) is heavily protected to prevent modification of the message contents after validation but before processing.</li></ul><p>However, logic bugs in the  of the host calls (the C functions called by MIG) remain reachable. For example,  allows manipulating CPU sets. If the logic fails to account for a processor being in a low-power state or being managed by an Exclave, it could trigger an inconsistent state in the scheduler.</p><h2>7.0 IOKit &amp; Driver Architecture</h2><p>While the Mach subsystem provides the primitives for IPC and scheduling,  provides the object-oriented framework for device drivers. Historically, IOKit has been the \"soft underbelly\" of the XNU kernel. Written in a restricted subset of C++, it relies heavily on virtual function dispatch, complex inheritance hierarchies, and manual reference counting (/).</p><p>In the Tahoe architecture, IOKit has undergone a radical hardening process. The transition to Apple Silicon has allowed Apple to enforce strict Control Flow Integrity (CFI) on C++ objects using PAC, while <strong>Kernel Integrity Protection (KIP)</strong> enforces the immutability of the driver code itself, with the  protecting the page tables that describe those regions.</p><p>The initialization of IOKit is the bridge between the static hardware description provided by iBoot (the Device Tree) and the dynamic, runtime object graph that constitutes the macOS driver environment.</p><h4>7.1.1 The IORegistry: Populating the Device Tree into C++ Objects</h4><p>When the kernel boots, the hardware topology is described by the Flattened Device Tree (FDT). Unlike previous architectures where the FDT pointer might have been passed in a raw register, in the current XNU ABI, the FDT pointer is stored in the  field of the  structure, which is passed in  to the kernel entry point . IOKit's first major task is to hydrate this binary blob into a live graph of  objects.</p><p>\nThe bootstrap process is driven by the  class (specifically  on Apple Silicon).</p><ol><li> The kernel parses the FDT. For every node in the tree (e.g., , , ), it instantiates an .</li><li> These objects are attached to the  plane of the Registry. This plane represents the physical topology as reported by iBoot.</li><li> Properties from the FDT (like , , ) are converted into , , or  objects and attached to the registry entries.</li></ol><p><strong>Matching and Driver Loading:</strong>\nOnce the Registry is populated, IOKit begins the  phase ().</p><ol><li> IOKit iterates over the registry entries. It compares the  property (e.g., ) against the  dictionary defined in the  of every loaded driver.</li><li><strong>The Probe/Start Lifecycle:</strong> When a match is found, the driver's C++ class is instantiated.\n<ul><li>: The driver verifies the hardware is actually present (rarely used on SoCs where hardware is static).</li><li>: The driver initializes the hardware, maps MMIO regions, and registers interrupts.</li></ul></li></ol><p><strong>RE Focus: The \"Missing\" Hardware:</strong>\nOn Tahoe systems, empirical observation reveals gaps in the IORegistry compared to the raw Device Tree.</p><ul><li> The SPTM and TXM reserve specific hardware blocks (e.g., the Secure Storage controller or specific GPIO banks for privacy LEDs).</li><li> While not explicitly documented as an SPTM feature, reverse engineering suggests that during the unflattening process, nodes corresponding to physical ranges reserved by the SPTM are omitted from the . This effectively makes secure hardware invisible to the OS, preventing the kernel from even attempting to map the MMIO registers for these protected blocks.</li></ul><h4>7.1.2 Boot, System, and Auxiliary Kernel Collections</h4><p>Gone are the days of loading individual  bundles directly from <code>/System/Library/Extensions</code> at boot.

In C++, dynamic dispatch is handled via —arrays of function pointers.

This prevents moving entries between vtables.</li></ul><p>\nWhen the kernel calls a virtual function (e.g., ), the compiler emits a specialized instruction sequence:</p><pre><code>LDR     x0, [x20]       ; Load the object pointer\nLDR     x16, [x0]       ; Load the signed vtable pointer\nAUTDA   x16, xzr        ; Authenticate Data Key A, Context = 0 (per docs)\nLDR     x10, [x16, #0x18] ; Load the target function pointer from the vtable\nBLRAA   x10, x16        ; Branch with Link, Authenticating Key A, Context = Vtable Address\n</code></pre><p>Note the two-stage authentication:</p><ol><li> Authenticates that the vtable pointer is valid. If the pointer was overwritten,  becomes a canonical non-valid pointer.</li><li> The function pointers  the vtable are also signed. The  instruction authenticates the function pointer (using the vtable address as context) and branches.</li></ol><p>\nThis creates a chain of trust:</p><ul><li>The Object trusts the Vtable Pointer (via ).</li><li>The Vtable trusts the Function Pointers (via ).</li><li>KIP/SPTM trusts the Vtable Memory (via code immutability).</li></ul><p>For a reverse engineer, this means that patching a vtable in memory is impossible (KIP/SPTM), and forging an object requires the ability to sign pointers with the —a capability that requires a \"Signing Oracle\" gadget, which BTI aims to eliminate.</p><p>The introduction of DriverKit represents a strategic retreat for the XNU kernel. For decades, the kernel’s attack surface was effectively the sum of the core kernel plus every third-party driver loaded into the address space. A vulnerability in a Wacom tablet driver or a USB-to-Serial adapter was functionally identical to a vulnerability in the scheduler: both yielded  code execution.</p><p>DriverKit bifurcates this model by moving hardware drivers into userland, executing as <strong>System Extensions ()</strong>. While they look and feel like drivers to the developer (using a C++ subset similar to Embedded C++), architecturally they are unprivileged processes. In the Tahoe architecture, this isolation is not merely a sandbox; it is a hardware-enforced chasm guarded by the TXM and SPTM.</p><h4>7.2.1 Moving drivers to userland:  and Entitlement Checks</h4><p>A  is an ordinary userland process (usually running as root but confined by a dedicated sandbox and entitlements). It has no direct access to the kernel’s task port and can only exercise kernel functionality via  interfaces that the kernel explicitly exposes.</p><p>\nWhen a  is matched and loaded (managed by ), the kernel instantiates a shadow object known as . This kernel-side object acts as the proxy for the userland driver.</p><ul><li> When the kernel needs to call a function in the driver (e.g., ), it calls a method on .</li><li> serializes the arguments into a specialized Mach message format (distinct from standard MIG).</li><li> The message is sent to the  process. The DriverKit runtime (linked into the ) deserializes the message and invokes the implementation of the  subclass in userland.</li></ul><p><strong>The  Interface:</strong>\nConversely, when the  needs to talk to the kernel (e.g., to register an interrupt handler or map memory), it cannot call kernel APIs directly. It uses .</p><ul><li> The  can only invoke a specific subset of kernel functionality exposed via  traps. These traps are heavily scrutinized.</li><li> Interrupts are no longer handled via ISRs (Interrupt Service Routines) in the driver. Instead, the kernel handles the physical IRQ, masks it, and dispatches an  event to the  via a Mach notification. This eliminates the entire class of vulnerabilities related to interrupt context safety and spinlock deadlocks in third-party code.</li></ul><p><strong>Entitlements as the Gatekeeper (TXM Enforcement):</strong>\nIn Tahoe, the ability of a  to bind to specific hardware is governed by .</p><ul><li> A  cannot simply  any MMIO region. It must possess specific entitlements (e.g., <code>com.apple.developer.driverkit.transport.usb</code>) to access specific device families.</li><li> When  launches a , the system verifies its signature and entitlements against LocalPolicy and trust caches. On SPTM/TXM-equipped systems, these checks are enforced below XNU, so a compromised  cannot bypass them. If the TXM returns a failure, the kernel refuses to establish the  link, and the driver fails to start.</li></ul><p><strong>RE Focus: The  Metaclass:</strong>\nReverse engineering a  requires understanding the  infrastructure in userland. The  binary contains  information that describes the RPC interface. By parsing the  sections, one can reconstruct the vtables and the mapping between the kernel-side dispatch IDs and the userland C++ methods.</p><h4>7.2.2 Memory Mapping Constraints and IOMMU (DART) Protection</h4><p>The most dangerous capability of a driver is <strong>Direct Memory Access (DMA)</strong>. A malicious or buggy driver could program a peripheral (like a GPU or Network Card) to write data to physical address  (or wherever the kernel text resides), bypassing CPU-enforced protections like KTRR.</p><p>To mitigate this, Apple Silicon employs a pervasive IOMMU architecture known as <strong>DART (Device Address Resolution Table)</strong>.</p><p>\nEvery DMA-capable peripheral on the SoC sits behind a DART. The device does not see Physical Addresses (PA); it sees <strong>I/O Virtual Addresses (IOVA)</strong>. The DART translates IOVA → PA, enforcing permissions (Read/Write) at the page level.</p><ol><li> When a  allocates a buffer for DMA, it creates an .</li><li> The  calls <code>IOMemoryDescriptor::CreateMapping</code>. This triggers a call into the kernel.</li><li> The kernel allocates physical pages () and pins them.</li><li> The kernel programs the DART associated with the specific hardware device controlled by the . It maps the physical pages to an IOVA range visible to that device.</li></ol><p><strong>The Tahoe/SPTM Enforcement:</strong>\nIn the Tahoe architecture, the kernel is no longer trusted to program the DARTs directly. If the kernel could write to DART registers, it could map the kernel's own text segment as writable to the GPU, then tell the GPU to overwrite it (a DMA attack).</p><ul><li> The physical pages containing the DART translation tables (or the MMIO registers controlling the DART) are typed as  or a specific hardware-protected type in the Frame Table.</li><li><strong>The  Selector:</strong> When the kernel needs to map a buffer for a , it issues a  call to the SPTM.</li><li> The SPTM verifies that the physical pages being mapped are  by the  (or are valid shared memory). It strictly forbids mapping any page typed , , or  into a DART.</li><li> The SPTM performs the write to the DART hardware.</li></ul><p><strong>MMIO Mapping Restrictions:</strong>\nSimilarly, when a  needs to control hardware registers (MMIO), it requests a mapping.</p><ul><li>The kernel cannot simply map physical device memory into the 's address space.</li><li> The SPTM only honors MMIO mapping requests that target ranges it recognizes as device registers for the given driver or device; ranges associated with secure components (SEP, KTRR controller) are excluded.</li><li>This ensures that a USB driver can  map the USB controller's registers, and cannot map the registers for the Secure Enclave Mailbox or the KTRR controller.</li></ul><p>\nExploiting a  to gain kernel privileges is exponentially harder in Tahoe. Even if you gain code execution in the  (Userland), you cannot issue arbitrary syscalls (sandbox), you cannot map kernel memory (VM isolation), and you cannot use the hardware device to perform DMA attacks against the kernel (SPTM-enforced DART). The attacker is contained within a hardware-enforced cage, limited to the specific capabilities of that one peripheral.</p><h3>7.3 The Graphics Stack (AGX)</h3><p>If the XNU kernel is the central nervous system, the  stack is a secondary, alien brain grafted onto the SoC. On M-series silicon, the GPU is not merely a peripheral; it is a massive, autonomous compute cluster running its own proprietary operating system, managing its own memory translation, and executing a command stream that is almost entirely opaque to the main OS.</p><p>For the reverse engineer, AGX represents the largest and most complex attack surface in the kernel. The driver () is enormous, the firmware is encrypted (until load), and the hardware interface is undocumented. In the Tahoe architecture, Apple has moved to aggressively sandbox this beast, wrapping the GPU's memory access in strict <strong>DART (Device Address Resolution Table)</strong> policies enforced by the SPTM to prevent DMA-based kernel compromises.</p><h4>7.3.1 RTKit: The Proprietary RTOS running on the GPU Coprocessor (ASC)</h4><p>The GPU does not execute driver commands directly. Instead, the M-series SoC includes a dedicated <strong>Apple Silicon Coprocessor (ASC)</strong>—typically a hardened ARMv8-R or Cortex-M class core—that manages the GPU hardware. This coprocessor runs , Apple’s proprietary Real-Time Operating System.</p><p>\nThe kernel driver does not contain the logic to drive the GPU hardware registers directly. Instead, upon initialization (), it loads a firmware payload from a firmware bundle on disk or embedded in the kext.</p><ul><li> The firmware is a standard Mach-O binary, often multi-architecture.</li><li> It contains  and  segments just like a userland program.</li><li> Reverse engineering the firmware reveals a microkernel architecture. It has a scheduler, an IPC mechanism, and a set of \"Endpoints\" (services).</li></ul><p>\nCommunication between the XNU kernel () and the ASC () occurs via a shared memory mailbox protocol.</p><ol><li> The AP writes to a specific MMIO register to ring the doorbell of the ASC.</li><li> The message payload is placed in a shared memory ring buffer.</li><li> The protocol is endpoint-based. Reverse engineering identifies specific service IDs running on the ASC, such as:\n<ul><li> Power Management (Voltage/Clock gating).</li><li> Graphics Rendering (Command submission).</li><li> Compute (GPGPU/Metal).</li></ul></li></ol><p><strong>RE Focus: The  State Machine:</strong>\nThe  contains extensive logging strings and state tracking for RTKit. By analyzing the  class in the kext, one can reconstruct the message structures.</p><ul><li> When the GPU hangs, RTKit writes a \"Coredump\" to a shared buffer. The kernel captures this. Analyzing these logs reveals the internal memory layout of the ASC and the state of the GPU pipeline at the time of the crash.</li><li> Historically, vulnerabilities existed where the kernel could send malformed IPC messages to the ASC, causing memory corruption  the GPU firmware. While this doesn't directly yield Kernel R/W, compromising the ASC allows an attacker to use the GPU as a confused deputy for DMA attacks (see 7.3.3).</li></ul><p>While  handles rendering, <strong> (IOMFB)</strong> handles the display controller (DCP). This driver is responsible for the \"Swap Chain\"—taking the rendered frames and scanning them out to the display panel.</p><p><strong>The Unified Memory Architecture (UMA):</strong>\nOn Apple Silicon, the Framebuffer is just a region of system DRAM.  (userland) renders into an . The physical pages backing this surface are passed to IOMFB, which programs the Display Coprocessor (DCP) to read from them.</p><p><strong>The Security Criticality:</strong>\nIOMFB is a high-value target because it handles complex shared memory structures () mapped into both the kernel and userland ().</p><ul><li> The  method and external methods of <code>IOMobileFramebufferUserClient</code> have historically been riddled with race conditions and bounds-checking errors.</li></ul><p><strong>Tahoe and the \"Secure Overlay\":</strong>\nIn the Tahoe architecture, IOMFB's control over the display is no longer absolute. To support the <strong>Hardware Privacy Indicators</strong> (Green/Orange dots), reverse engineering suggests the display pipeline has been bifurcated.</p><ol><li> Managed by IOMFB/WindowServer. Draws the desktop/apps.</li><li> Managed by an . Draws the privacy indicators.</li></ol><p>\nThe compositing of these two pipes happens in the display hardware, not in memory.</p><ul><li>The Exclave owns a small, reserved framebuffer region.</li><li>The Display Controller overlays this region on top of the standard framebuffer .</li><li> Because the Secure Pipe's framebuffer memory is owned by the Exclave (and protected by the SPTM), neither the kernel nor the GPU can write to it. This guarantees that if the camera is on, the green dot  be visible, even if the kernel is compromised.</li></ul><h4>7.3.3 DART: The IOMMU Wall and DMA Containment</h4><p>The GPU is effectively a DMA engine with the capability to read and write vast swathes of system memory. Without restriction, a compromised GPU firmware (or a malicious shader exploiting a GPU hardware bug) could overwrite kernel text or page tables.</p><p>To prevent this, the AGX hardware—and indeed every DMA-capable peripheral on the Apple Silicon SoC—sits behind a strict IOMMU known as the <strong>DART (Device Address Resolution Table)</strong>.</p><p><strong>DART Architecture and Stream IDs (SIDs):</strong>\nThe DART translates <strong>Device Virtual Addresses (DVA)</strong> used by the peripheral into  in DRAM. However, the translation is not monolithic; it is segmented by the source of the traffic.</p><ul><li> Every transaction on the SoC's Network-on-Chip (NoC) carries a hardware-generated Stream ID identifying the initiator (e.g., GPU Firmware, Vertex Fetcher, Display Controller).</li><li> The DART maintains multiple translation contexts (similar to distinct  roots).</li><li> The DART hardware is configured to map specific SIDs to specific Context Banks. This allows isolation between different workloads on the same peripheral (e.g., isolating  rendering commands from a background compute shader).</li></ul><p><strong>The Tahoe Enforcement (SPTM):</strong>\nIn pre-Tahoe systems, the kernel ( or ) managed the DART page tables and the SID configuration registers directly. This meant a kernel attacker could disable DART, remap SIDs to privileged contexts, or map kernel memory into the GPU's address space to bypass KTRR.</p><p>In Tahoe, <strong>DART management is privileged to the SPTM.</strong></p><ol><li> The physical pages containing the DART translation tables (L1/L2 TTEs) and the MMIO registers controlling SID configuration are typed as  (or a specific IOMMU_TABLE type) in the Frame Table.</li><li> When  needs to map a user's  for GPU access:\n<ul><li>It issues a  call (Selector ).</li><li>It passes the DART ID, the Context ID, the DVA, and the PA.</li></ul></li><li> The SPTM verifies:\n<ul><li>The PA is valid  (not Kernel Text, not Page Tables).</li><li>The DART ID corresponds to the GPU.</li><li> Crucially, the SPTM enforces the immutable binding between SIDs and Contexts. It ensures that the kernel cannot reconfigure the DART to allow an untrusted SID (e.g., the Neural Engine) to write to a Context Bank reserved for the Secure Enclave or Display Pipe.</li></ul></li><li> The SPTM writes the DART PTE.</li></ol><p><strong>RE Focus: The \"GART\" Attack Surface:</strong>\nDespite SPTM protection, the logic  the mapping still resides in the kernel.</p><ul><li> Can the kernel trick the SPTM into mapping the same physical page to two different DART contexts with different permissions?</li><li> Does the SPTM correctly flush the DART TLB () immediately after unmapping? If not, the GPU might retain access to a page that has been freed and reallocated to the kernel, leading to a Use-After-Free via DMA.</li><li> The DART configuration registers (e.g., , , and SID match registers) are trapped by the hardware to GL2. Attempting to write to the DART control base address from EL1 should trigger a synchronous exception. Reverse engineering the  class in IOKit will reveal the specific  trampolines used to bridge these operations.</li></ul><h2>8.0 Userland Bootstrap: The Birth of PID 1</h2><p>The initialization of the XNU kernel culminates in mounting the root filesystem (the Signed System Volume) and creating the first userland process.

Its successful launch marks the handoff from the measured, firmware-controlled boot world to the userland environment.</p><h3>8.1 : The Mach Port Broker</h3><p>The transition from kernel mode to user mode is effectively one-way for the thread that becomes PID 1: once it crosses into userland, it never returns to the kernel in its original identity.</p><p>After early initialization in  (mounting root, bringing up the BSD subsystem), the kernel:</p><ul><li><p>Spawns a special kernel thread (often referred to conceptually as the ).</p></li><li><p>Uses  to:</p><ul><li>Allocate  (PID 1) and its backing .</li><li>Load the  Mach-O binary into that task via .</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> becomes the root of the userland process tree.</li><li>All subsequent processes are, ultimately, descendants of PID 1.</li><li>’s management of Mach ports and bootstrap namespaces becomes the primary mechanism by which services discover each other and enforce IPC-based policy.</li></ul><h4>8.1.1 Transition from Kernel to Userland: The First </h4><p>The kernel routine  (in ) orchestrates the end of early boot:</p><ol><li><p>\nIt ensures the Signed System Volume is mounted and ready.</p></li><li><p><strong>PID 1 construction ( / ):</strong>\nThe kernel:</p><ul><li>Creates  as PID 1 by cloning from the kernel’s internal template process, with special flags ().</li><li>Allocates the corresponding  and thread structures.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong> – kernel-side  of :</strong>\nInstead of a user process calling <code>execve(\"/sbin/launchd\", ...)</code>, the kernel:</p><ul><li><p>Loads the Mach-O for  (backed in modern systems by the OS Cryptex, even though the path appears as ).</p></li><li><p>Constructs the initial user address space:</p><ul></ul></li><li><p>Sets up the initial user thread state (PC, stack, registers) as if an  had just succeeded.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Trust and integrity checks (conceptual model):</strong>\nOn Tahoe systems:</p><ul><li><p>The code signature and CDHash of  are validated against the Static Trust Cache and platform policy.</p></li><li><p>TXM/SPTM participate in ensuring that:</p><ul><li>Only a measured, signed  binary becomes PID 1.</li><li>Its text pages are mapped in a way that respects kernel integrity protection (no ad-hoc remapping to writable/executable later without violating SPTM policy).</li></ul></li></ul></li></ol><p>The exact firmware call sequence is implementation detail, but the net effect is: <strong>if  is not exactly the expected, signed binary, the system does not proceed into userland.</strong></p><p>As part of bringing up the userland environment:</p><ul><li><p>The system needs a trusted process that can:</p><ul><li>Talk to host-level interfaces (, etc.).</li><li>Manage systemwide services and kext/kc configuration.</li></ul></li></ul><p> is that process.

Name→port mappings are implemented in userland by the bootstrap server, which on macOS is .</p><p><strong>Bootstrap port assignment</strong></p><p>Every task in XNU has a special port slot, . For PID 1:</p><ul><li><p>When  is created, the kernel associates a bootstrap server port with ’s .</p></li><li><p>For child processes spawned by , this slot is:</p><ul><li>Inherited from the parent, or</li><li>Replaced with a more restricted bootstrap port representing a subset namespace (e.g. per-user or per-session domain).</li></ul></li></ul><p>From userland’s perspective:</p><ul><li> in the  APIs (and the default XPC bootstrap connection) is whatever send right is stored in .</li></ul><p><strong>Namespace hierarchy (domains)</strong></p><p>Modern  organizes the bootstrap namespace into ,

Dynamic Linker ()</h3><p>If  is the architect of the userland process hierarchy,  (the dynamic linker) is the component that materializes each process image.

It is a massive, pre-linked binary (often &gt;4 GiB) that merges the text and data segments of most system frameworks (, , , etc.).</p><p>To optimize memory and TLB usage, the kernel reserves a  in every process:</p><ul><li>On arm64, this region typically begins at a high canonical address (e.g., around  in current releases).</li><li>The DSC is mapped into this region, and the backing physical pages are shared across all processes.</li></ul><p>To satisfy  and fine-grained data protection, the DSC is split into multiple mappings:</p><ol><li><p>\nImmutable code and constant data that must never be written at runtime.</p></li><li><p>\nRead-only data that can be pre-relocated at build time and never changes at runtime (e.g., constant pointers, vtables).</p></li><li><p>\nData that must diverge per process (e.g., Objective-C class realization state, global variables).</p></li></ol><p><strong>The Tahoe/SPTM Constraint:</strong></p><p>On Tahoe systems, the mapping of the DSC is mediated by SPTM:</p><ol><li><p>\nThe DSC binaries and associated metadata reside in the , typically under:</p><pre><code>/System/Cryptexes/OS/System/Library/dyld/\n</code></pre></li><li><p>\nWhen XNU initializes the shared region, it installs page tables for the DSC segments in each process’s address space. On SPTM-enabled systems:</p><ul><li>Each PTE change for DSC pages is vetted by SPTM.</li><li>The physical frames backing  are associated with a “immutable code” state; once mapped, they are not permitted to transition to writable mappings under EL1 control alone.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Immutable Code under a Compromised Kernel:</strong>\nBecause SPTM operates at a higher privilege level than the kernel:</p><ul><li>Arbitrary EL1 writes cannot simply flip the DSC  pages to .</li><li>Any attempt to create new executable mappings for code that has not been validated by TXM can be blocked by SPTM when the Execute bit is requested.</li></ul></li></ol><p>Practically, this means traditional techniques that patch system libraries in-place from a kernel exploit are structurally constrained. Attackers must rely on indirection (e.g., hooks via , PLT-style trampolines, or userland injecting new, separately validated images) rather than overwriting shared-cache code directly.</p><h4>8.2.2  Code Signature Validation () and the Call to TXM</h4><p> is the primary enforcer of  for userland.

From the perspective of , the observable behaviour is that  can succeed or fail, and that executing unblessed code results in immediate termination, independent of kernel cooperation.</p><p>\nWhen a process dies immediately after  or after loading a plugin/framework, and  reports code-signature errors, the proximate userland symptom is often a failed <code>fcntl(F_ADDFILESIGS_RETURN)</code> or an immediate crash on first execution into the library. The authoritative reason (revoked certificate, missing trust-cache entry, policy violation) lives in TXM/SPTM logs and kernel log events, which may be partially redacted on production builds.</p><h4>8.2.3 ASLR in Userland: Chained Fixups and the Death of </h4><p>Modern  (dyld 4.x and later) on Apple Silicon has effectively deprecated the legacy  rebasing/binding opcodes in favour of  ().

However, this immutability created an operational problem: patching a single high-level component (for example,  or WebKit) would require resealing and redistributing the entire SSV.</p><p>To resolve the tension between  and , Apple introduced  (Cryptographic Extensions). A Cryptex is a cryptographically sealed, versioned filesystem image that can be mounted and “grafted” into the system hierarchy at boot or runtime. In the Tahoe architecture, Cryptexes are the primary mechanism for the  design, decoupling the kernel/BSD and low-level system from rapidly evolving userland components.</p><h4>8.3.1 The “Split OS” Architecture: </h4><p>In modern macOS, the logical root filesystem () is effectively a skeleton:</p><ul><li>it contains the sealed snapshot of the kernel and core boot artifacts on the SSV, and</li><li>it carries just enough structure to support bootstrapping.</li></ul><p>The bulk of high-level userland—, , system frameworks, many daemons—resides in the .</p><p>A Cryptex is distributed as an :</p><ul><li><p>\nA disk image (typically APFS) containing a filesystem hierarchy.</p></li><li><p>\nA signed metadata blob that binds the payload to Apple’s root keys. For some Cryptexes, the manifest can be  (tied to ECID, board, and security domain), preventing naive replay of mismatched OS components onto other devices.</p></li></ul><p>Cryptexes are not mounted via a user-visible  call. They are integrated into the system by early boot code and the APFS driver:</p><ol><li><p>\nWhile iBoot verifies and loads the Boot Kernel Collection (which uses Cryptex architecture), the Userland “OS Cryptex” (containing dyld and frameworks) is typically located, verified, and mounted by the Kernel and Trusted Execution Monitor (TXM) during the kernel bootstrapping phase, rather than directly by iBoot.</p></li><li><p>\nInside the Cryptex, a binary trust cache (for example, ) lists CDHashes for all executable content in that Cryptex.</p></li><li><p>\nBefore the filesystem is grafted, this trust cache is provided to TXM. TXM verifies its signature and, on success, merges the hashes into the platform’s Static Trust Cache for that boot.</p></li><li><p><strong>APFS grafting / firmlinks:</strong>\nThe APFS driver performs a graft operation that logically attaches the Cryptex under:</p><p>and uses  or equivalent redirections so that paths like:</p><pre><code>/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib\n/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreFoundation.framework/...\n</code></pre><p>are transparently resolved into the OS Cryptex, even though the SSV copy of  and  is skeletal.</p></li></ol><p>From a reverse-engineering perspective, the “real” binaries of interest (current , system frameworks, many daemons) live under . Paths under  or  may be firmlinked views pointing back into this Cryptex.</p><h4>8.3.2 Rapid Security Response (RSR): Patching via Overlay Cryptexes</h4><p>The Cryptex mechanism enables <strong>Rapid Security Response (RSR)</strong>: security updates that patch critical userland components residing in the OS Cryptex (e.g., WebKit, dyld) without requiring a full OS update or resealing of the SSV. Updating the kernel itself (Boot Kernel Collection) via RSR is architecturally constrained and typically requires a full OS update, as RSRs function as overlays on the userland filesystem.</p><p>An RSR is delivered as an additional Cryptex:</p><ul><li>it usually contains only the components that changed (for example, updated dyld shared caches or WebKit frameworks),</li><li>it ships with its own Image4 manifest and trust cache, validated similarly to the base OS Cryptex.</li></ul><ol><li><p>\nThe  daemon orchestrates download, local verification, and placement of the new Cryptex image (typically onto the Preboot volume), and updates boot policy so early boot components know it exists.</p></li><li><p><strong>Verification and trust cache update:</strong>\nDuring boot, the RSR Cryptex’s manifest is verified. Its embedded trust cache is ingested by TXM so that binaries from the RSR are eligible for execution.</p></li><li><p><strong>Overlaying the OS Cryptex:</strong>\nThe kernel overlays the RSR Cryptex on top of the base OS Cryptex using a union-style strategy:</p><ul><li>if a path exists in the RSR Cryptex, that version takes precedence;</li><li>otherwise, the VFS falls back to the underlying base OS Cryptex content.</li></ul></li></ol><p>The effective runtime view is:</p><pre><code>SSV  +  OS Cryptex  +  (optional) RSR Cryptex overlay\n</code></pre><p>with VFS and firmlink logic ensuring a coherent  and  layout.</p><p><strong>Reversibility and Failure Handling</strong></p><p>RSRs are designed to be reversible:</p><ul><li><p>\nBoot policy ensures the system is either fully in “base OS” state or in “base OS + specific RSR overlay” state. Partial application is not supported.</p></li><li><p>\nIf repeated boots under a given RSR Cryptex fail (for example, due to a regression), the boot chain can mark that RSR as inactive and revert to the base OS Cryptex on subsequent boots, without modifying the SSV.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Security and RE Implications</strong></p><ul><li><p>\nBecause Cryptexes and their trust caches are verified via Image4 and TXM, replaying older Cryptexes or RSRs is constrained by the same personalization and policy rules as the base OS.</p></li><li><p>\nRSRs live outside the SSV (typically on Preboot), but they remain in the verified boot chain via their manifests and trust caches.</p></li><li><p>\nTo understand an RSR, you extract the RSR Cryptex image from the update payload, mount it, and diff its contents against the base OS Cryptex. The semantic delta is “what the RSR changed.” The live system view is the union of SSV + base OS Cryptex + any active RSR overlays, subject to SPTM/TXM integrity constraints.</p></li></ul><h2>9.0 The Security Daemon Hierarchy</h2><p>While the kernel and the hardware monitors (SPTM/TXM) enforce the immutable laws of the system physics (memory protections, page table integrity, executable mappings), the complex, mutable business logic of macOS security is delegated to a hierarchy of userland daemons. These daemons operate with high privileges, often holding special ports or entitlements that allow them to influence kernel policy. For the reverse engineer, these daemons represent the “Policy Engine” of the OS—and historically, the most fertile ground for logic bugs and sandbox escapes.</p><h3>9.1  (Apple Mobile File Integrity Daemon)</h3><p>The <strong>Apple Mobile File Integrity Daemon ()</strong> is the userland arbiter of code execution policy. While the  enforces code-execution policy and manages trust caches for platform binaries in the guarded world, it lacks the context to evaluate the complex web of third-party provisioning profiles, developer certificates, notarization state, and MDM constraints.</p><p>In the Tahoe architecture,  functions as the <strong>Policy Decision Point (PDP)</strong> for non-platform code, while the kernel and TXM act as the <strong>Policy Enforcement Points (PEP)</strong> that ultimately decide whether pages become executable.</p><h4>9.1.1 The Interaction between , the Kernel (MACF), and </h4><p> does not poll for binaries; it is driven by the kernel via the <strong>Mandatory Access Control Framework (MACF)</strong> hooks in the AMFI/AppleMobileFileIntegrity path.</p><p> is a critical system daemon launched by  early in the boot process.

Originating from TrustedBSD, the macOS sandbox is a <strong>Mandatory Access Control (MAC)</strong> mechanism that restricts a process’s access to resources—files, sockets, Mach ports, IOKit drivers—regardless of the user’s UID.</p><p>In the Tahoe architecture, the sandbox has evolved from a predominantly path-based filter into a semantic, metadata-driven enforcement layer, tightly coupled with the kernel’s VFS and process credential machinery and integrated with new  primitives.</p><p>Sandbox profiles are expressed in <strong>SBPL (Sandbox Policy Language)</strong>, a Scheme-like (LISP) dialect.

In the Tahoe architecture,  has evolved from a simple “prompt and remember” component into a complex attribution engine that must defend against consent hijacking and attribution spoofing.</p><h4>9.3.1 The TCC Database: Schema, Integrity, and SIP</h4><p>TCC persists user consent state in SQLite databases. There is a split between system-wide and per-user state:</p><ul><li><code>/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db</code> — root-owned, stores system-wide decisions such as Full Disk Access.</li><li><code>~/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db</code> — user-owned, stores per-user decisions such as Camera/Microphone access.</li></ul><p>The core table is .

Up to this point, the system has operated primarily in the  domain, managed by the root  context. The instantiation of a user session requires the creation of a new security context—the —and the decryption of user-specific cryptographic material anchored in the Secure Enclave.</p><p>In the Tahoe architecture, this process is no longer a simple comparison of a password hash against a file. It is a hardware-mediated ceremony involving:</p><ul><li>Evaluation of the user’s credentials via  and the  store.</li><li>Unlocking of a SEP-protected per-user secret that underpins the  / FileVault authorization model.</li><li>Derivation or unwrapping of the  inside the SEP.</li><li>Establishment of a local Kerberos identity (via the Local KDC / LKDC) for those services that participate in single sign-on, with the initial credentials ultimately rooted in secrets that are only accessible after the SEP has accepted the login.</li></ul><p>Biometrics (Touch ID, Face ID, Optic ID) do not replace the password; they conditionally authorize the Secure Enclave to perform cryptographic operations—such as unwrapping key material—that would otherwise require manual secret entry.</p><h3>10.1  &amp; </h3><p>The graphical login experience is orchestrated by two primary userland components:</p><ul><li> – Manages the session lifecycle and login UI, coordinates shield windows, and drives the state machine for login / logout / fast user switching.</li><li> – Provides the abstraction layer for authentication and identity services, loading plugins to speak to local, LDAP, and Active Directory nodes.</li></ul><p>Both components have lineage back to NeXTSTEP, but their internals have been aggressively refactored to support the hardware-backed security model of Apple Silicon and the Tahoe boot chain.</p><h4>10.1.1 The Audit Session ID (ASID) and Kernel Tracking</h4><p>In XNU, the concept of a “User” in the sense of a  is tracked via the . This is distinct from the UNIX UID/GID:</p><ul><li> – Identify principals in the traditional POSIX sense.</li><li> – Identifies a specific authenticated session (e.g. physical console login, fast user switch slot, SSH login, screen sharing session).</li></ul><p>Every process in the system carries an  which encodes, among other fields, the ASID of the session under which it is running.</p><p>When  successfully authenticates a user, it does not simply . It calls into the BSM audit stack via the  syscall (typically through  wrappers):</p><ul><li> The syscall populates the  state, from which  values are derived for that process.</li><li> Children inherit their parent’s ASID in much the same way they inherit UID/GID.</li><li> Changing an ASID after it has been established is tightly controlled. In practice, only a small set of privileged components (e.g. , ) can create or reassign audit sessions, and they do so under private entitlements discovered via reverse engineering rather than public API.</li></ul><p>For almost all processes, the ASID behaves as a write-once attribute: it is set when the session is created and then propagated down the process tree.</p><p><strong>ASID as a Console Ownership signal</strong></p><p>The ASID acts as a primary signal for “Console Ownership” in several subsystems:</p><ul><li><p>\nAccess-control decisions for sensors such as Camera and Microphone are made in the context of an audit token. When a process requests, for example, Camera access,  evaluates whether the request comes from the ASID associated with the active graphical console. Foreground sessions see prompts; non-console sessions (e.g. SSH) are generally denied or handled differently.</p></li><li><p>\nOnly processes that belong to the active console ASID are permitted to establish the full, interactive connection to the WindowServer required to draw on the screen. Other ASIDs may be confined to offscreen rendering, remote sessions, or be blocked entirely.</p></li></ul><p>This makes the ASID a crucial anchor for reasoning about which processes are “actually in front of the user” in the Tahoe user-session model.</p><p><strong>RE Focus:  and launchd domains</strong></p><p>Historically, the transition from the  context (running as root) to the user context involved a setuid helper binary, , which mediated the handoff of credentials and environment to a <strong>per-user  process</strong>.

Apple does not publish the internal structure of , but reverse engineering strongly indicates that the blob contains more than a conventional hash.</p><p><strong>Verification Flow ()</strong></p><p>When  submits a password to  for a local account, the flow roughly looks like this:</p><ol><li><p> uses its Local Node plugin to locate the user record and retrieve the associated  blob.</p></li><li><p>\nThe SALTED-SHA512-PBKDF2 component can be verified locally to confidently reject obviously wrong passwords without involving the SEP.</p></li><li><p><strong>Secure Enclave mediation:</strong>\nFor FileVault-enabled accounts and for modern secure-token flows,  (via lower layers in the stack) invokes the  interface in the kernel:</p><ul><li><p>The candidate password and the relevant wrapped secret(s) derived from  are marshalled to the kernel.</p></li><li><p>The kernel forwards this to the SEP over the mailbox channel.</p></li><li><ul><li>The device’s  (fused in hardware, never leaving the SEP).</li><li>A KDF over the password and salt.</li><li>Policy- and measurement-dependent state (e.g. SKP).</li></ul></li><li><p>The SEP attempts to “unwrap” the per-user secret and, if successful, signals success and may derive additional keys for keybag and FileVault operations.</p></li></ul></li><li><p> treats SEP success as authoritative for those modern flows. A failure at this stage typically manifests as an authentication error even if the legacy PBKDF2 hash alone would have been satisfied.</p></li></ol><p>This architecture has two important consequences:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Password hashes vs. device-bound keys:</strong>\nExtracting  allows offline cracking of the PBKDF2-SHA512 password hash, but recovering the password does  by itself reconstruct the FileVault Volume Encryption Key (VEK) or class keys. Those require the SEP, UID key, and SKP-bound material.</p></li><li><p>\nThe secrets that actually unlock user data are bound to the specific Secure Enclave instance that created them. Moving Shadow Hash material to another Mac does not make that user’s FileVault-protected data decryptable without further compromise.</p></li></ul><p>From a red-team perspective, this forces attacks toward live credential interception (before the password is sent into the verification pipeline) or SEP compromise, rather than traditional offline hash cracking for disk decryption.</p><h4>10.1.4 Kerberos and the Local KDC (Heimdal)</h4><p>Modern macOS systems ship with a  stack and, by default, support a <strong>Local Key Distribution Center (LKDC)</strong>. The LKDC provides Kerberized identities for local services and is integrated with Open Directory.</p><p><strong>Why Kerberos on a standalone Mac?</strong></p><p>Kerberos avoids passing plaintext passwords around systemwide. Instead:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Initial login (when Kerberos is configured):</strong>\nOnce the user’s credentials have been accepted (potentially via SEP-mediated verification), the system can obtain a <strong>Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT)</strong> from the LKDC corresponding to that account.

Architecturally, it is a :</p><ul><li>Biometrics never replace the underlying secret; they authorize the Secure Enclave to perform a cryptographic operation that would otherwise require manual entry of that secret.</li><li>The SEP decides whether biometric factors are currently acceptable (policy, backoff, recent passcode use, secure intent).</li><li>On success, the SEP unlocks or derives specific keys and returns opaque handles or tokens to the OS.</li></ul><p>In the Tahoe architecture, the biometric stack is an interplay between:</p><ul><li>Userland daemons (, ).</li><li>Kernel drivers (, Local Authentication hooks).</li><li>For Face ID and Optic ID: the <strong>Secure Neural Engine (SNE)</strong>.</li></ul><h4>10.2.1 The Daemon Hierarchy:  →  → SEP</h4><p>The implementation is split across two main daemons to enforce separation of concerns:</p><ul><li><p>\nLocated at<code>/System/Library/Frameworks/LocalAuthentication.framework/Support/coreauthd</code>,\nit implements the system’s Local Authentication policy engine:</p><ul><li>Manages  instances and associates them with PIDs, ASIDs, and calling processes.</li><li>Parses Keychain Access Control Lists (ACLs), evaluating requirements such as “biometry OR passcode” vs “biometry AND device unlock”.</li><li>Implements the <strong>Access Control Module (ACM)</strong> logic that mirrors SEP-side decision structures: it constructs and validates the requests that will eventually be sent to the Secure Enclave.</li></ul></li><li><p>\nLocated at <code>/usr/libexec/biometrickitd</code>, it manages the physical biometric sensors:</p><ul><li> Loads device-specific plugins (e.g. Mesa for Touch ID, Pearl for Face ID, Jade for Optic ID).</li><li><strong>Power / state management:</strong> Controls sensor power, exposure, illumination hardware, and readiness.</li><li> Sets up shared buffers or DMA configurations between the sensor hardware and the Secure Enclave via the kernel.

On Apple Silicon, this layering has collapsed into a unified  model:</p><ul><li>Every file on the APFS volume is encrypted with a per-file key.</li><li>Per-file keys are wrapped by .</li><li>Class keys are stored in  that are managed by the Secure Enclave.</li><li>“Turning on FileVault” primarily changes how the <strong>Volume Encryption Key (VEK)</strong> is protected: from “effectively UID-only” to “UID plus user secret (password) and system measurement (SKP).”</li></ul><p>In macOS Tahoe, the Data Protection model from iOS is carried over almost verbatim and extended with Mac-specific SKP and policy machinery.</p><h4>10.3.1 Unwrapping the User Keybag: The Class Key Hierarchy</h4><p>The central on-disk structure for Data Protection is the :</p><ul><li>A binary property list stored in system-managed locations (paths vary with OS releases and boot volume layout).</li><li>Contains  and metadata.</li><li>Is always consumed by the SEP; the kernel never sees cleartext class keys.</li></ul><ol><li><p>\nA device-unique AES key, fused into the Secure Enclave and never exposed outside it.</p></li><li><p><strong>User password / passcode:</strong>\nThe logical secret known to the user and entered at login or unlock time.</p></li><li><p><strong>Passcode-derived key (PDK):</strong>\nThe SEP mixes:</p><ul><li>A KDF over the password plus salt (PBKDF2-like).</li><li>Policy-dependent inputs (e.g. SKP measurement).\nConceptually:</li></ul><pre><code>PDK = Tangle( UID, PBKDF2(password, salt), measurement, policy )\n</code></pre><p>The exact KDF and tangling function are implementation details, but the key property is: PDK cannot be derived off-device.</p></li><li><p>\nThe keybag stores wrapped class keys corresponding to the Data Protection classes:</p><ul><li><strong>Class A (“Complete Protection”):</strong>\nData only accessible while the device is unlocked.

FileVault’s VEK is conceptually associated with this class on Apple Silicon Macs.</li><li><strong>Class D (“No User Secret” / “UID-only”):</strong>\nKeys wrapped solely by the UID (and SKP where applicable). Used for data that must be accessible before user login (e.g. some system daemons and metadata). On Apple Silicon, user data is generally not assigned to Class D.</li></ul></li></ol><p>When a user logs in on a FileVault-enabled Apple Silicon Mac:</p><ol><li><p> submits the password through the authentication pipeline; upon acceptance, the kernel passes:</p><ul><li>The supplied password (or a derivative).\nto the SEP via AppleSEPKeyStore.</li></ul></li><li><ul><li>The password is run through the configured KDF.</li><li>The UID key and measurement inputs are combined via the tangling function to derive the PDK.</li><li>The keybag’s wrapped class keys are unwrapped using the PDK and UID.</li></ul></li><li><p>The unwrapped class keys remain resident only inside SEP-protected memory.</p></li><li><p>The SEP returns  (numeric identifiers or similar) for the class keys to the kernel rather than the keys themselves.</p></li></ol><p>Subsequent file I/O and volume operations refer to class keys by these handles, never by raw key bits.</p><h4>10.3.2 Sealed Key Protection (SKP): Binding Data to Measurement</h4><p>Tahoe introduces and extends <strong>Sealed Key Protection (SKP)</strong> as a defense against “Evil Maid” scenarios where an attacker boots a compromised or downgraded OS to attack the disk encryption keys.</p><ol><li><p>The Secure Enclave’s  verifies and measures .</p></li><li><ul><li>The LocalPolicy describing boot and security configuration (e.g. SIP, boot policy, secure boot level).</li></ul></li><li><p>These measurements are accumulated into internal registers within the SEP (conceptually similar to TPM PCRs, but not exposed as such).</p></li></ol><p>When the Volume Encryption Key (VEK) and class keys are created (e.g. at install or FileVault enablement time), they are wrapped under a key derived from:</p><ul><li>The passcode-derived material (PDK).</li><li>The current boot-chain measurement.</li></ul><pre><code>KEK = KDF( UID, PDK, Measurement )\nWrappedVEK = Encrypt( VEK, KEK )\n</code></pre><ul><li>The same derivation is repeated inside the SEP using the current Measurement.</li><li>If the OS, LocalPolicy, or relevant firmware has changed in a way that alters the Measurement beyond allowed ranges, the derived KEK will be different and the unwrap will fail—even if the correct password is supplied.</li></ul><p>To successfully decrypt the data volume, an attacker must:</p><ul><li>Possess the user’s secret (or otherwise satisfy SEP policy).</li><li>Boot into an OS configuration that produces an acceptable Measurement (signed, authorized kernel + LocalPolicy consistent with SKP policy).</li><li>Run on the original or equivalently provisioned hardware (UID key, SEP state).</li></ul><p>Downgrades to vulnerable kernels, custom kernels, or off-device keybag attacks are blocked at the SKP layer.</p><h4>10.3.3 The Hardware AES Engine &amp; the Wrapped-Key Path</h4><p>A common misconception is that the macOS kernel decrypts file contents.

For Tahoe and Apple Silicon, this binary is the focal point for understanding the proprietary AP ↔ SEP protocol.</p><p><strong>Key responsibilities (RE-derived)</strong></p><p>Typical symbols and responsibilities observed across releases include:</p><ul><li><p> / related functions:</p><ul><li>Accept wrapped keys (e.g. from keybags, per-file metadata).</li><li>Prepare and send unwrap requests to the SEP.</li><li>Return handles or status to callers in the kernel.</li></ul></li><li><p> / equivalents:</p><ul><li>Query the SEP for the current lock / unlock state and biometric backoff state.</li><li>Update kernel-side views of whether user data should be considered accessible.</li></ul></li><li><p>Message demultiplexers (e.g. <code>sep_key_store_client_handle_message</code>):</p><ul><li>Parse TLV-encoded responses from the SEP.</li><li>Dispatch them to the correct waiters in the kernel or userland.</li></ul></li></ul><p>From a reverse-engineering and exploitation perspective, several patterns emerge:</p><ul><li><p>\nKeys are referred to by relatively small integer handles in the kernel. Bugs that cause handles to be mis-associated across security domains (system vs. user, different users, different contexts) could allow an attacker to induce the SEP to use a more privileged key than intended.</p></li><li><p> maintains shadow state about lock status, key availability, and pending operations. Any discrepancy between this state and the SEP’s internal view could create TOCTOU-style conditions where:</p><ul><li>The kernel believes an operation is permitted, but the SEP does not (and vice versa).</li><li>A key handle is assumed valid when the SEP has already invalidated it.</li></ul></li><li><p>\nThe AP-side parser for SEP messages handles complex TLV structures. Memory-safety bugs or logic errors here represent a classic attack surface, albeit one increasingly hardened by modern CFI, PAC, and mitigation layers.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Tahoe hardening (observed)</strong></p><p>On Tahoe-era builds, interactions between  and higher-privilege operations (e.g., enabling FileVault, changing recovery keys, altering LocalPolicy-bound state) show evidence of:</p><ul><li>Additional checks that correlate key operations with TXM / GL1 policy decisions.</li><li>Stricter coupling between “is this operation permitted under the current Measurement and LocalPolicy?” and “should this unwrap / key creation be forwarded to the SEP?”</li></ul><p>Public documentation does not yet spell out this coupling, but runtime traces and binary analysis strongly suggest that Apple is moving more of the authorization logic  the kernel and into the measured, SEP-adjacent policy domain.</p><h2>11.0 Conclusion: The Attack Surface Landscape</h2><p>The architectural transformation introduced with macOS Tahoe and the M3/M4 silicon generation signifies the end of the \"Kernel is King\" era. We have moved from a monolithic trust model, where  and  were the ultimate objectives, to a federated security model where the kernel is merely a highly privileged, yet strictly supervised, tenant within a hardware-enforced hypervisor.</p><p>For the vulnerability researcher, this necessitates a shift in methodology. Fuzzing syscalls is no longer sufficient to compromise the system's root of trust. The new frontier lies in the —the specific, hardware-mediated bridges that allow data and execution flow to traverse the isolated domains.</p><h3>11.1 Summary of Boundary Crossings</h3><p>The following matrix details the architectural boundaries, the mechanisms used to traverse them, and the specific attack surface exposed at each junction.</p><h4>11.1.1 Userland (EL0) ↔ Kernel (EL2/VHE)</h4><p><em>The Traditional Boundary, Hardened by Silicon.</em></p><ul><li><ul><li> (Supervisor Call) instruction triggering a synchronous exception to the kernel exception vector (, or the EL2 alias under VHE on macOS).</li><li> (Exception Return) restoring  and  from / and / (depending on the concrete VHE configuration).</li></ul></li><li><ul><li> Entry points are signed. The kernel verifies the thread state signature () on return, ensuring return-address and register integrity.</li><li> The kernel cannot modify its own text or page tables to disable SMEP/SMAP equivalents (/). Page-table integrity and code immutability are ultimately enforced by the SPTM rather than by EL2 alone.</li></ul></li><li><ul><li><p>The kernel is no longer the final arbiter of virtual memory. When a user process requests , the kernel cannot simply write to the translation tables; it must request the  to map the page.</p></li><li><ul><li> Standard memory corruption (UAF, heap overflow) in kernel extensions still yields privileged kernel execution in the EL2/VHE context.</li><li> Forging pointers to survive the  path or function-pointer authentication (return addresses, vtables, dispatch tables).</li><li> The kernel must sanitize user pointers and lengths before passing them to the SPTM. A \"Confused Deputy\" attack where the kernel is tricked into asking the SPTM to map a privileged page into user space is the new .</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h4>11.1.2 Kernel (EL2) ↔ Secure Page Table Monitor (GL2)</h4><p><em>The \"Mechanism\" Boundary: The New Hypervisor.</em></p><ul><li><ul><li> (Opcode ) with the  in  (encoding Domain + Dispatch Table ID + Endpoint). The 5-bit immediate in the  instruction selects the GXF entry stub and is recorded in .</li><li> (Opcode ), returning from GL2 to the kernel’s EL2/VHE context.</li></ul></li><li><ul><li> Hardware context switch of / →  and the corresponding GL2 state (, , ).</li><li> Atomic switch of permission views. Kernel text becomes RO/NX from the GL2 perspective; SPTM text/data become RX/RW as configured for GL2 and remain inaccessible from EL2.</li></ul></li><li><ul><li>– carry arguments (physical page numbers, ASIDs, permission bitmasks, context IDs).  carries the dispatch target ( + table + endpoint).</li><li> None in the normal call path. The SPTM reads and writes physical memory directly via its own linear map and page-table view.</li></ul></li><li><ul><li> The SPTM enforces a Finite State Machine (FSM) on every physical page (Frame Table). The primary attack vector is finding a sequence of // calls that desynchronizes the SPTM’s view of a page from the hardware’s actual usage (e.g., aliasing a  frame as ).</li><li> Passing invalid physical addresses, truncated ranges, or edge-case permission combinations to //, especially under high contention or refcounted/shared-frame scenarios.</li><li> Because invalid or inconsistent requests cause the SPTM to return fatal errors that XNU treats as unrecoverable and converts into kernel panics, timing side-channels or fault-injection during the  window are potential vectors to infer GL2 layout and state (e.g., distinguishing “valid but denied” vs “structurally impossible” transitions via differing panic paths or latencies).</li></ul></li></ul><h4>11.1.3 Kernel (EL2) ↔ Trusted Execution Monitor (TXM)</h4><p><em>The “Policy” Boundary: Code-Signing and Entitlement Authority.</em></p><ul><li><ul><li> XNU invokes TXM through  and related wrappers. These routines set up a dedicated TXM stack, marshal a call descriptor (selector, argument vector, return buffer), and then perform the CPU sequence required to enter the TXM context. On current iOS releases, reverse-engineering shows that TXM itself uses  to perform in-monitor calls; regarding the XNU-to-TXM interface on Tahoe, initial implementations (e.g., iOS 17) utilized raw  stubs, while the explicit  kernel APIs were introduced in later iterations (iOS 18) to wrap these calls.</li><li> TXM writes its result into the call descriptor, updates a status field, and returns to XNU, which interprets the status. Depending on selector and flags, some TXM failures are converted into kernel panics.</li></ul></li><li><ul><li> TXM resides in a region whose code and data are owned and typed by SPTM. XNU has no direct write access to TXM text or critical data; changes must go through SPTM retyping and mapping operations.</li><li> Apple’s OS integrity documentation describes TXM as a lower-privilege component used by SPTM to enforce code-signing and integrity policy. Even if TXM were compromised, SPTM still mediates page-table updates and frame typing; memory integrity does not collapse automatically.</li></ul></li><li><ul><li> XNU passes pointers (or physical addresses) to Code Directories, CMS blobs, trust caches, and entitlement structures, along with lengths and flags. TXM interprets these structures and returns accept/deny decisions plus auxiliary metadata.</li><li><strong>Dynamic Trust Cache Operations:</strong> TXM selectors cover registration and removal of trust-cache entries, enabling or disabling specific code-signing relaxations, and managing development/debug modes.</li></ul></li><li><ul><li> TXM must parse Mach-O headers, CodeDirectories, CMS/ASN.1, entitlements, and various policy structures. Bugs in these parsers can yield powerful policy-manipulation primitives (for example, arbitrary trust-cache entries or coerced acceptance of malformed signatures), but SPTM still constrains what memory mappings are possible.</li><li><strong>Policy Downgrade and LocalPolicy Handling:</strong> Incorrect handling of boot arguments and LocalPolicy data can cause persistent relaxation of code-signing or integrity checks. Exploits here influence what code TXM authorizes, but do not directly grant the ability to arbitrarily rewrite protected frames without also influencing SPTM.</li><li> If the buffers that TXM inspects are not retyped or otherwise shielded by SPTM, there is a window where DMA or kernel code could mutate them between TXM’s checks and subsequent use. Correct integration of SPTM retyping with TXM’s parsing determines how exploitable such races are.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>11.1.4 Kernel (EL1) ↔ Secure Enclave (SEP)</h4><p><em>The \"Air Gap\" Boundary: The Parallel Computer.</em></p><ul><li><ul><li> Mailbox Registers (Doorbell) + Shared Memory Buffers (DART-mapped).</li></ul></li><li><ul><li> Distinct CPU core, distinct MMU.</li><li><strong>Memory Protection Engine:</strong> SEP memory is encrypted/authenticated inline.</li></ul></li><li><ul><li> L4 IPC format (Endpoints, TLV payloads).</li><li> Keys are passed as opaque blobs; raw key material never crosses this boundary.</li></ul></li><li><ul><li> Fuzzing the  endpoint handlers (e.g., , ).</li><li> Modifying the contents of a DART-mapped buffer after the SEP has validated the header but before it processes the payload.</li><li> Attempting to rollback the  storage state to force the SEP to reuse old nonces or counters.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>11.1.5 Kernel (EL1) ↔ Exclaves (Secure Domain)</h4><p><em>The \"Microkernel\" Boundary: The RingGate.</em></p><ul><li><ul><li> kext marshals data →  (to Secure Kernel) → IPC to Conclave.</li></ul></li><li><ul><li> Enforces physical memory isolation between  and .</li></ul></li><li><ul><li> A strongly-typed IDL serialization format.</li></ul></li><li><ul><li> Exploiting  to route messages to the wrong Conclave.</li><li> Bugs in the Tightbeam generated code within the Exclave.</li><li> Flooding the Secure Kernel with Downcalls to starve secure workloads (DoS).</li></ul></li></ul><h3>11.2 The \"Intel Gap\": Security Disparities between x86 and Apple Silicon</h3><p>While macOS Tahoe presents a unified user experience across architectures, the underlying security reality is a tale of two operating systems. On Apple Silicon, macOS is a hypervisor-managed, hardware-attested fortress. On Intel (x86_64), it remains a traditional monolithic kernel relying on legacy protection mechanisms. This divergence has created a massive \"Intel Gap\"—a disparity in exploit mitigation so severe that the same vulnerability often yields a trivial root shell on Intel while resulting in a harmless panic on Apple Silicon.</p><p>For the reverse engineer, understanding this gap is essential for targeting. The Intel architecture represents the \"Soft Target,\" lacking the silicon-enforced boundaries of the SPTM, TXM, and PAC.</p><h4>11.2.1 Lateral Privilege: GL2 vs Ring 0</h4><p>The critical difference between Intel and Apple-silicon Tahoe systems is the existence, on Apple silicon, of a privilege layer  the kernel that continues to enforce memory-integrity invariants even after a kernel compromise.</p><ul><li><ul><li><p>XNU runs at EL2 under the supervision of SPTM in GL2. SPTM is the sole authority for page-table retyping and for managing frame types that correspond to kernel text, page tables, IOMMU tables, and other critical regions.</p></li><li><p>TXM executes in a lower-privilege domain than SPTM and provides code-signing and integrity policy decisions. SPTM calls into TXM to decide whether particular mappings or code images are acceptable, but SPTM remains the arbiter of what is actually mapped and how frames are typed.</p></li><li><p>A kernel exploit that yields KRW in XNU provides strong influence over control flow and data within EL2 and allows attempts to mis-use SPTM/TXM as confused deputies. However, the attacker must still either:</p><ul><li>Drive SPTM through an illegal but accepted state transition (retyping or mapping), or</li><li>Gain sufficient influence over TXM and then exploit the TXM–SPTM interface,\nto obtain equivalent authority over page tables and sealed code.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><ul><li>The kernel runs in Ring 0 and directly controls page tables, VT-d configuration, and most integrity mechanisms below the T2’s secure boot checks.</li><li>There is no SPTM-equivalent hypervisor above Ring 0 enforcing frame typing or page-table integrity at runtime. Once KRW is obtained and static KTRR is bypassed or worked around, the attacker can patch kernel text, alter page tables, and reconfigure DMA mappings with no higher-privilege arbiter.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Under this model, KRW on Apple silicon is an intermediate privilege level situated below SPTM/TXM, whereas KRW on Intel is much closer to the maximum privilege available to macOS.</p><h4>11.2.2 Static vs. Dynamic Kernel Integrity (KTRR vs. SPTM)</h4><p>Both architectures attempt to enforce <strong>Kernel Text Read-Only Region (KTRR)</strong>, but the implementation differs fundamentally in flexibility and robustness.</p><ul><li> On recent Intel Macs, KTRR is implemented via proprietary memory controller registers (configured via ).\n<ul><li> The firmware locks a physical range of memory as Read-Only/Executable.</li><li> This is . Once the range is locked at boot, it cannot change. This forces the kernel to fit all immutable code into a contiguous block. It cannot protect dynamically loaded drivers (KEXTs) with the same hardware rigor. KEXTs rely on software-managed page tables ( bit), which a compromised kernel can disable.</li></ul></li><li><ul><li> The SPTM manages the Frame Table.</li><li> This is . The kernel can load a new extension (AKC), link it, and then ask the SPTM to \"Seal\" it. The SPTM transitions those specific pages to . This allows the \"Immutable Kernel\" coverage to extend to late-loaded drivers, a feat impossible on the static Intel KTRR implementation.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>11.2.3 The CFI Chasm: PAC vs. CET</h4><p>Control Flow Integrity (CFI) is the primary defense against ROP/JOP.</p><ul><li><strong>Pointer Authentication (PAC)</strong> is ubiquitous. It protects return addresses (stack), function pointers (heap/data), and C++ vtables. It provides cryptographic diversity based on pointer context.</li><li> Intel Macs support <strong>Control-flow Enforcement Technology (CET)</strong>, specifically Shadow Stacks ( support is limited).\n<ul><li> CET Shadow Stacks protect return addresses effectively, but they do not protect  transfers (function pointers) with the same granularity as PAC.</li><li> Crucially, Intel has no equivalent to  (Data Key). An attacker on Intel can still perform <strong>Data-Oriented Programming (DOP)</strong>—swapping valid object pointers or corrupting decision-making flags—without triggering a hardware fault. On Apple Silicon, these pointers are signed; forging them requires a signing gadget.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>11.2.4 The Root of Trust: T2 vs. On-Die Boot ROM</h4><p>The boot chain trust anchor differs physically.</p><ul><li> The Root of Trust is the  (on models 2018-2020).\n<ul><li> The T2 is a discrete bridge. It verifies the  and kernelcache signature  the Intel CPU starts. However, once the Intel CPU is executing, the T2 is effectively a peripheral connected via USB/PCIe. It cannot introspect the Intel CPU's execution state. It cannot stop a runtime kernel exploit.</li></ul></li><li> The Root of Trust is the .\n<ul><li> The security logic (SEP, PKA, Boot Monitor) is on the . The Secure Enclave can monitor the power and clock lines of the AP. The SPTM (running on the AP) enforces the boot measurements continuously. The trust chain is not \"handed off\"; it is maintained throughout the runtime lifecycle.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>11.2.5 I/O Security: VT-d vs. DART</h4><p>DMA attacks are a classic method to bypass CPU memory protections.</p><ul><li> Uses  (Intel Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O).\n<ul><li> The kernel configures the IOMMU tables.</li><li> If the kernel is compromised, it can reconfigure VT-d to allow a malicious Thunderbolt device to overwrite kernel memory (unless strict \"DMA Protection\" is enabled and locked, which relies on the kernel's integrity).</li></ul></li><li> Uses  (Device Address Resolution Table).\n<ul><li> As detailed in Section 7.2.2, the kernel  write to DART registers. Only the SPTM can map I/O memory.</li><li> Even a compromised kernel cannot weaponize a peripheral to perform a DMA attack against the monitor or the kernel text, because the SPTM will reject the mapping request.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>11.2.6 Summary Table: Tahoe on Intel vs Apple Silicon</h4><table><thead><tr><th>Apple Silicon (arm64e, Tahoe)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Highest effective privilege</strong></td><td>Ring 0 kernel with static KIP/KTRR; no higher-privilege macOS component supervising runtime mappings</td><td>GL2 SPTM as top-level memory arbiter supervising EL2 XNU; TXM runs below SPTM and supplies code-signing and integrity policy that SPTM consumes for protected mappings</td></tr><tr><td>Memory-controller KIP + software-managed page tables; VT-d tables configured by the kernel</td><td>SPRR + SPTM-mediated retyping and mapping for page tables and DART; kernel cannot directly repoint protected frames</td></tr><tr><td>Static KTRR region for core kernel text; many KEXTs rely on page-table flags that the kernel can modify</td><td>Dynamic sealing of XNU text and AKCs via SPTM/KIP; additional code cannot be introduced as  after boot without passing SPTM’s frame-typing rules</td></tr><tr><td>CET (Shadow Stack + IBT) available in hardware; extent of macOS use is not publicly documented</td><td>PAC on kernel and userland code, including return addresses and many vtables</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Vtable / data-pointer protection</strong></td><td>No hardware authentication for data pointers or vtables</td><td>PAC on vtables and selected data pointers (DA/GA keys) constrains many forward-edge and DOP-style attacks</td></tr><tr><td>AMFI / CoreTrust in the kernel enforce policy; T2 participates in secure boot but does not supervise runtime kernel mappings</td><td>TXM, running in a domain protected by SPTM, evaluates signatures and integrity policy.

Exploits that require complex, multi-stage chains on M3 (e.g., bypassing PAC, confusing SPTM, racing TXM) can often be reduced to a single Use-After-Free and a ROP chain on Intel. As Apple phases out Intel support, the \"easy mode\" of macOS exploitation is rapidly vanishing.</p><h3>11.3 Future Trends: The expansion of Exclaves and the death of Kernel Extensions</h3><p>The trajectory of macOS security architecture is not asymptotic; it is directional. Apple is not merely patching vulnerabilities in XNU; they are actively architecting its obsolescence as a security boundary. The \"Tahoe\" architecture provides the silicon primitives (SPTM, TXM, GL2) required to execute a long-term strategy of .</p><p>The future of macOS exploitation lies in understanding two concurrent trends: the ossification of the XNU kernel into a static, immutable appliance, and the migration of high-value logic into the opaque, hardware-isolated world of Exclaves.</p><h4>11.3.1 The Deprecation of : The Static Kernel</h4><p>For decades, the ability to load Kernel Extensions (KEXTs) was a defining feature of macOS. It was also its Achilles' heel. KEXTs run at EL1, share the kernel's address space, and historically lacked the rigorous code review applied to the core kernel.</p><p>The mechanism for this—the  syscall (and the associated  traps)—represents a massive attack surface. It requires the kernel to possess a runtime linker (), capable of resolving symbols, applying relocations, and modifying executable memory.</p><p>\nApple has systematically introduced userland replacements for kernel drivers: , , , and .</p><ul><li> In Tahoe, third-party KEXTs are deprecated. The userland tool  manages the policy, but the actual loading still relies on the kernel's ability to link code. Loading a legacy KEXT now requires reducing system security (disabling SIP/Secure Boot) and interacting with the  via  to explicitly authorize the hash.</li></ul><p><strong>Future State: The Death of the Runtime Linker:</strong>\nWe are approaching a point where the kernel will effectively lose the ability to load dynamic code entirely in \"Full Security\" mode. The goal is to remove the  logic from the kernel entirely.</p><ul><li> The <strong>Boot Kernel Collection (BKC)</strong> (loaded by iBoot) and the <strong>Auxiliary Kernel Collection (AKC)</strong> (loaded early by ) will be the  permitted executable kernel code.</li><li> By moving all linking to build-time (kernelcache generation) or boot-time (iBoot verification), Apple can strip the dynamic linker logic () from the runtime kernel. If the kernel doesn't know how to link a Mach-O, it cannot load a rootkit.</li><li> The  already enforces that  is immutable. The logical next step is for the SPTM to reject  request that attempts to create new  pages after the initial boot sealing phase is complete.</li></ul><p>\nThe era of the \"Rootkit\" is ending. If you cannot introduce new code into EL1 via , and you cannot modify existing code due to KTRR/SPTM, persistence in the kernel becomes impossible. Attackers will be forced to live entirely within data-only attacks (DOP) or move their persistence to userland (which is easier to detect) or firmware (which is harder to achieve).</p><h4>11.3.2 Exclave Expansion: Eating the Monolith</h4><p>If XNU is the \"Insecure World,\" Exclaves are the \"Secure World.\" Currently, Exclaves are used for high-sensitivity, low-complexity tasks (Privacy Indicators, Passkeys). However, the architecture is designed to scale. Apple is effectively strangling the monolithic kernel by slowly migrating critical subsystems out of EL1 and into Exclaves.</p><p><strong>Candidates for Migration:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>The Network Stack ():</strong>\nApple has already introduced , a userland networking subsystem. The logical evolution is to move the TCP/IP stack and packet filtering logic into an Exclave.\n<ul><li> A remote code execution vulnerability in the Wi-Fi firmware or the TCP stack would compromise an isolated Exclave, not the entire kernel. The SPTM would prevent the compromised network stack from touching system memory.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Filesystem Encryption (APFS):</strong>\nCurrently,  handles key wrapping, but the bulk encryption happens via the AES Engine managed by the kernel. Moving the filesystem driver's cryptographic logic to an Exclave would ensure that even a kernel compromise cannot exfiltrate file keys, as the keys would exist only within the Exclave's memory domain.</li><li><strong>Audio and Media Processing:</strong>\nTo protect DRM content and prevent microphone eavesdropping, the entire CoreAudio engine could be moved to a \"Media Conclave.\"</li></ol><p>\nAs more logic moves to Exclaves, a significant portion of the OS execution flow becomes invisible to standard introspection tools.</p><ul><li> You cannot DTrace an Exclave.</li><li> Kernel tracing will show a \"black hole\" where the request enters  and vanishes until the result returns.</li><li> The memory of an Exclave is physically unmappable by the kernel. A kernel memory dump (coredump) will contain gaps where the Exclave memory resides.</li></ul><h4>11.3.3 The \"Hollow Kernel\" Hypothesis</h4><p>Extrapolating these trends leads to the .</p><p>In this future architecture, XNU (EL1) is demoted to a . Its primary role is to:</p><ol><li>Provide POSIX system call semantics for legacy userland applications.</li><li>Manage coarse-grained scheduling of CPU resources.</li><li>Act as a message bus (via ) between userland applications and the real system logic running in Exclaves.</li></ol><p>\nIn the traditional model, the Kernel protects the User. In the Hollow Kernel model, the <strong>Hardware (SPTM/TXM) protects the System from the Kernel.</strong></p><ul><li>The kernel is treated as untrusted code.</li><li>The TCB (Trusted Computing Base) shrinks from \"The entire Kernel\" to \"The SPTM, TXM, and specific Exclaves.\"</li><li>A kernel compromise becomes a \"Local DoS\" or \"Privacy Violation\" rather than a \"System Compromise.\"</li></ul><h4>11.3.4 The Visibility Gap: The End of Passive Analysis</h4><p>For the reverse engineer, this shift is catastrophic for visibility.</p><ul><li> The interface between XNU and Exclaves is defined by Tightbeam. Unlike MIG, which was relatively static, Tightbeam protocols can evolve rapidly. Reverse engineering the system will require constantly reconstructing these serialization formats.</li><li> As Apple phases out Intel support completely, they will likely remove the legacy code paths in XNU that supported the \"un-isolated\" model. This will make the kernel source code (if still released) increasingly divergent from the binary reality running on M-series chips.</li><li><strong>Hardware-Locked Debugging:</strong> Debugging an Exclave likely requires \"Red\" (Development) fused silicon. Researchers working on retail \"Green\" (Production) hardware will be effectively locked out of analyzing the internal logic of these secure subsystems, forced to treat them as black boxes and fuzz their inputs via .</li></ul><p>\nmacOS is no longer just a Unix system. It is a distributed system running on a single die, governed by a hypervisor that doesn't exist in software. The kernel is dead; long live the Monitor.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Hi HN! We're excited to release our VS Code/Cursor extension for marimo [1], an open-source, reactive Python notebook.</p><p>This extension provides a native experience for working with marimo notebooks, a long-requested feature that we’ve worked hard to get right.</p><p>An LSP-first architecture</p><p>The core of our extension is a marimo notebook language server (marimo-lsp [2]). As far as we know, it’s the first notebook runtime to take this approach. The Language Server Protocol (LSP) [3] offers a small but important set of notebook-related capabilities that we use for document and kernel syncing; everything else is handled through custom actions and messages.</p><p>By building on LSP, we aim to create a path to expose marimo capabilities in additional environments (beyond VS Code/Cursor). The notebook features in LSP are still limited, but as the protocol evolves, we’ll be able to shift more functionality out of the extension and into the language server, making it available to a wider range of editors and tools. For example, this could enable:</p><p>- structural edits to notebook documents (e.g., adding or removing cells) [4]</p><p>- editor hover information that reflects the live runtime values of variables</p><p>Deep uv integration with PEP 723</p><p>Because marimo notebooks are plain Python files, we adopt PEP 723-style inline metadata [5] to describe a notebook’s environment. Tools such as uv already support this format: they read the metadata block, build or update the corresponding environment, and run the script inside it.</p><p>The marimo CLI already integrates with uv in \"sandbox\" mode [6] to manage an isolated environment defined by PEP 723 metadata for a single notebook. In the extension, our uv-based “sandbox controller” manages multiple notebooks: each notebook gets its own isolated, cached environment. The controller keeps the environment aligned with the dependencies declared in the file and can update that metadata automatically when imports are missing.</p><p>uv normally syncs such environments whenever you run a script, ensuring it matches the dependencies declared in its metadata; we apply this concept at the cell level so the environment stays in sync whenever cells run. The same cached uv environment is reused if you run the notebook as a script via uv (e.g., uv run notebook.py).</p><p>This work has been a complete rewrite, and we're grateful to the community for early feedback. While VS Code and the LSP support a subset of notebook features, the ecosystem has been shaped heavily by Jupyter, and we’ve had to work around some assumptions baked into existing APIs. We’ve been coordinating with the VS Code team and hope our work can help broaden the conversation—pushing the LSP notebook model forward and making room for runtimes that aren’t Jupyter-based.</p><p>We'd love to hear your thoughts!</p>",

      "url": "https://mosaic.so/",
      "date": 1763566084,
      "author": "adishj",
      "guid": 34413,

      "content": "\n<p>Hey HN! We’re Adish & Kyle from Mosaic (<a href=\"https://edit.mosaic.so\">https://edit.mosaic.so</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.mosaic.so/\">https://docs.mosaic.so/</a>, <a href=\"https://mosaic.so\">https://mosaic.so</a>). Mosaic lets you create and run your own multimodal video editing agents in a node-based canvas. It’s different from traditional video editing tools in two ways: (1) the user interface and (2) the visual intelligence built into our agent.<p>We were engineers at Tesla and one day had a fun idea to make a YouTube video of Cybertrucks in Palo Alto. We recorded hours of cars driving by, but got stuck on how to scrub through all this raw footage to edit it down to just the Cybertrucks.<p>We got frustrated trying to accomplish simple tasks in video editors like DaVinci Resolve and Adobe Premiere Pro. Features are hidden behind menus, buttons, and icons, and we often found ourselves Googling or asking ChatGPT how to do certain edits.<p>We thought that surely now, with multimodal AI, we could accelerate this process. Better yet, an AI video editor could automatically apply edits based off what it sees and hears in your video. The idea quickly snowballed and we began our side quest to build “Cursor for Video Editing”.<p>We put together a prototype and to our amazement, it was able to analyze and add text overlays based on what it saw or heard in the video. We could now automate our Cybertruck counting with a single chat prompt. That prototype is shown here: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXr7q7Dl9X0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXr7q7Dl9X0</a>.<p>After that, we spent a chunk of time building our own timeline-based video editor and making our multimodal copilot powerful and stateful. In natural language, we could now ask chat to help with AI asset generation, enhancements, searching through assets, and automatically applying edits like dynamic text overlays. That version is shown here: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/X4ki-QEwN40\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/X4ki-QEwN40</a>.<p>After talking to users though, we realized that the chat UX has limitations for video: (1) the longer the video, the more time it takes to process. Users have to wait too long between chat responses. (2) Users have set workflows that they use across video projects. Especially for people who have to produce a lot of content, the chat interface is a bottleneck rather than an accelerant.<p>That took us back to first principles to rethink what a “non-linear editor” really means. The result: a node-based canvas which enables you to create and run your own multimodal video editing agents. <a href=\"https://screen.studio/share/SP7DItVD\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://screen.studio/share/SP7DItVD</a>.<p>Each tile in the canvas represents a video editing operation and is configurable, so you still have creative control. You can also branch and run edits in parallel, creating multiple variants from the same raw footage to A/B test different prompts, models, and workflows. In the canvas, you can see inline how your content evolves as the agent goes through each step.<p>The idea is that canvas will run your video editing on autopilot, and get you 80-90% of the way there. Then you can adjust and modify it in an inline timeline editor. We support exporting your timeline state out to traditional editing tools like DaVinci Resolve, Adobe Premiere Pro, and Final Cut Pro.<p>We’ve also used multimodal AI to build in visual understanding and intelligence. This gives our system a deep understanding of video concepts, emotions, actions, spoken word, light levels, shot types.<p>We’re doing a ton of additional processing in our pipeline, such as saliency analysis, audio analysis, and determining objects of significance—all to help guide the best edit. These are things that we as human editors internalize so deeply we may not think twice about it, but reverse-engineering the process to build it into the AI agent has been an interesting challenge.<p>Some of our analysis findings:\nOptimal Safe Rectangles: <a href=\"https://assets.frameapp.ai/mosaicresearchimage1.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://assets.frameapp.ai/mosaicresearchimage1.png</a>\nVideo Analysis: <a href=\"https://assets.frameapp.ai/mosaicresearchimage2.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://assets.frameapp.ai/mosaicresearchimage2.png</a>\nSaliency Analysis: <a href=\"https://assets.frameapp.ai/mosaicresearchimage3.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://assets.frameapp.ai/mosaicresearchimage3.png</a>\nMean Movement Analysis: <a href=\"https://assets.frameapp.ai/mosaicresearchimage4.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://assets.frameapp.ai/mosaicresearchimage4.png</a><p>Use cases for editing include: - Removing bad takes or creating script-based cuts from videos / talking-heads - Repurposing longer-form videos into clips, shorts, and reels (e.g. podcasts, webinars, interviews) - Creating sizzle reels or montages from one or many input videos - Creating assembly edits and rough cuts from one or many input videos - Optimizing content for various social media platforms (reframing, captions, etc.) - Dubbing content with voice cloning and lip syncing.<p>We also support use cases for generating content such as motion graphic animations, cinematic captions, AI UGC content, adding contextual AI-generated B-Rolls to existing content, or modifying existing video footage (changing lighting, applying VFX).<p>Currently, our canvas can be used to build repeatable agentic workflows, but we’re working on a fully autonomous agent which will be able to do things like: style transfer using existing video content, define its own editing sequence / workflow without needing a canvas, do research and pull assets from web references, and so on.<p>You can try it today at <a href=\"https://edit.mosaic.so\">https://edit.mosaic.so</a>. You can sign up for free and get started playing with the interface by uploading videos, making workflows on the canvas, and editing them in the timeline editor. We do paywall node runs to help cover model costs. Our API docs are at <a href=\"https://docs.mosaic.so\">https://docs.mosaic.so</a>.

      "content": "<p>Claude Code is great, but it’s focused on coding. The missing piece is a native way to build and run custom background agents for non-code tasks. We built RowboatX as a CLI tool modeled after Claude Code that lets you do that. It uses the file system and unix tools to create and monitor background agents for everyday tasks, connect them to any MCP server for tools, and reason over their outputs.</p><p>Because RowboatX runs locally with shell access, the agents can install tools, execute code, and automate anything you could do in a terminal with your explicit permission. It works with any compatible LLM, including open-source ones.</p><p>For example, you can connect RowboatX to the ElevenLabs MCP server and create a background workflow that produces a NotebookLM-style podcast every day from recent AI-agent papers on arXiv. Or you can connect it to Google Calendar and Exa Search to research meeting attendees and generate briefs before each event.</p><p>You can try these with: `npx @rowboatlabs/rowboatx`</p><p>We combined three simple ideas:</p><p>1. File system as state: Each agent’s instruction, memory, logs, and data are just files on disk, grepable, diffable, and local. For instance, you can just run: grep -rl '\"agent\":\"</p><p>2. The supervisor agent: A Claude Code style agent that can create and run background agents. It predominantly uses Unix commands to monitor, update, and schedule agents. LLMs handle Unix tools better than backend APIs [1][2], so we leaned into that. It can also probe any MCP server and attach the tools to the agents.</p><p>3. Human-in-the-loop: Each background agent can emit a human_request message when needed (e.g. drafting a tricky email or installing a tool) that pauses execution and waits for input before continuing. The supervisor coordinates this.</p><p>I started my career over a decade ago building spam detection models at Twitter, spending a lot of my time in the terminal with Unix commands for data analysis [0] and Vowpal Wabbit for modeling. When Claude Code came along, it felt familiar and amazing to work with. But trying to use it beyond code always felt a bit forced. We built RowboatX to bring that same workflow to everyday tasks. It is Apache-2.0 licensed and easily extendable.</p><p>While there are many agent builders, running on the user's terminal enables unique use cases like computer and browser automation that cloud-based tools can't match. This power requires careful safety design. We implemented command-level allow/deny lists, with containerization coming next. We’ve tried to design for safety from day one, but we’d love to hear the community’s perspective on what additional safeguards or approaches you’d consider important here.</p><p>We’re excited to share RowboatX with everyone here. We’d love to hear your thoughts and welcome contributions!</p>",

      "content": "<section><h3>What is the Three-Body Problem?</h3><p>\n                The three-body problem is one of the most famous challenges in classical physics and celestial\n                mechanics.\n                It asks: given the initial positions, masses, and velocities of three bodies in space, can we predict\n                their\n                future motion under mutual gravitational attraction?\n            </p></section><section><h3>N-Body Gravitational Simulation</h3><p>\n                This simulator uses Newton's law of universal gravitation to model the gravitational forces between\n                every pair of bodies:\n            </p><p>\n                F = G × m₁ × m₂ / (r² + ε²)\n            </p><p>\n                Each body experiences the <strong>sum of all pairwise gravitational forces</strong> from every other\n                body.\n                For N bodies, this requires calculating N(N-1)/2 force pairs each timestep. The ε² term is a softening\n                parameter that prevents numerical singularities when bodies pass very close together.\n            </p><p>\n                The simulation supports multiple integration methods. By default, it uses the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verlet_integration#Velocity_Verlet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Velocity Verlet integration method</a>, a symplectic\n                integrator that provides superior energy conservation compared to simpler methods like Euler\n                integration.\n                This makes it ideal for long-term orbital mechanics simulations.\n            </p><p>\n                Users can switch to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">4th-order Runge-Kutta (RK4)</a> method in the Advanced\n                Settings,\n                which offers higher accuracy per timestep and typically shows lower energy drift in short simulations.\n                However, RK4 is not symplectic and accumulates systematic phase errors over long simulation times,\n                causing orbits to gradually decay or expand. This makes RK4 better suited for short to medium duration\n                simulations where minimizing instantaneous error is the priority, while Verlet excels at maintaining\n                correct orbital shapes over extended periods.\n            </p></section><section><ul><li> Discovered by Cris Moore in 1993,\n                    where three equal masses chase each other along a figure-eight shaped path</li><li><strong>Lagrange triangular configuration:</strong> Equilateral triangle\n                    configuration with circular orbits.</li><li><strong>Butterfly, Broucke, Hénon, and Yarn:</strong>\n                    Periodic orbits from the Šuvakov-Dmitrašinović database of three-body choreographies, discovered\n                    through\n                    systematic numerical exploration of initial conditions</li></ul><p>\n                Three-dimensional periodic orbits from Li and Liao (2025), which discovered 10,059 new periodic\n                solutions\n                including 21 choreographic orbits and 273 \"piano-trio\" orbits (where two equal-mass bodies share one\n                orbit\n                while a third body follows another).\n                <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2508.08568v1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Paper</a> |\n                <a href=\"https://github.com/sjtu-liao/three-body\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub</a></p></section><section><ul><li> Experience gravitational dynamics in 3D with interactive\n                    controls</li><li><strong>Multiple Integration Methods:</strong> Choose between Velocity Verlet (energy-conserving)\n                    and RK4 (high accuracy).</li><li> Experiment with different initial conditions and masses</li><li> Scrub through simulation history to analyze orbital behavior\n                </li></ul></section><section><p> Use the preset configurations (Figure-8 or Lagrange) to see stable\n                three-body orbits, or generate random initial conditions to explore chaotic dynamics.\n            </p><p> Adjust body masses, simulation speed, and physics parameters.

However, numerical integration methods\n                introduce\n                small errors at each timestep. The energy drift indicator helps you evaluate simulation quality:\n            </p><ul><li> Excellent energy conservation - the\n                    simulation is highly accurate</li><li> Moderate drift - acceptable for most\n                    purposes but consider reducing timestep</li><li> Significant drift - simulation may be\n                    unreliable, reduce timestep or try other integration methods</li></ul><p>\n                The Velocity Verlet integration method is \"symplectic,\" meaning it preserves the phase-space structure\n                of Hamiltonian systems. While RK4 typically shows lower energy drift in short-term simulations (better\n                local accuracy), Verlet prevents systematic phase errors that accumulate over extended simulations.\n                This makes Verlet ideal for long-term orbital mechanics where maintaining orbital stability over\n                thousands of periods is more important than minimizing instantaneous error.\n            </p><p><strong>Why is Total Energy Negative?</strong> In gravitational systems, total energy is often negative,\n                and this is\n                perfectly normal! Gravitational potential energy is defined as zero at infinite separation and becomes\n                increasingly\n                negative as bodies move closer together (PE = -Gm₁m₂/r). When total energy is negative, it means the\n                system is\n                 - the bodies don't have enough kinetic energy to escape to infinity, so\n                they remain\n                in orbit. This is exactly what you see in stable orbital systems like planets around stars or the\n                choreographed\n                orbits in this simulator. A negative total energy that remains constant indicates a stable, bound\n                orbital system.\n            </p></section><section><p>\n                Have suggestions, found a bug, or want to share your thoughts?\n                <a href=\"https://trisolarchaos.com/?pr=O_8(0.6)&amp;n=3&amp;s=5.0&amp;so=0.00&amp;im=rk4&amp;dt=1.00e-4&amp;rt=1.0e-6&amp;at=1.0e-8&amp;bs=0.15&amp;sf=0&amp;sv=0&amp;cm=free&amp;kt=1&amp;st=1&amp;tl=1500&amp;cp=2.5208,1.5125,2.5208&amp;ct=0.0000,0.0000,0.1670#\" data-tally-open=\"444vod\" data-tally-emoji-animation=\"none\" data-tally-hide-title=\"1\">Give feedback</a>\n                and help improve this simulator!\n            </p></section>",

      "content": "<div> – In the cold season we tend to keep the windows closed. The air gets \"stale\": humidity often rises above 60 %, which can harm our wellbeing and promote mould. At the same time the CO₂ level in the air increases, which impacts our ability to concentrate. So I built a room air monitor that stays unobtrusive as long as everything is in the green zone, but becomes deliberately noticeable once thresholds are exceeded. For my personal love of statistics I also visualise the measurements in a clear dashboard.\n</div><p>When windows stay closed for longer periods, the air indoors quickly becomes “stale”. Both humidity and the CO₂ level rise. CO₂ is measured in parts per million (ppm) – essentially “CO₂ molecules per one million air molecules”. This makes it easy to compare how much more CO₂ is present indoors compared to fresh outdoor air. At elevated levels, the following issues can occur:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Meaning / possible effects</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>around 400-450 ppm (typical outdoor air)</td></tr><tr><td>Often used as an upper limit for good ventilation. Values above ~1 000 ppm indicate insufficient ventilation.</td></tr><tr><td>Concentration rises – reduced performance, concentration problems and tiredness become more likely.</td></tr><tr><td>Very poorly ventilated room. Health and comfort issues become more frequent.</td></tr><tr><td>Extreme values (e.g. &gt; 5 000 ppm)</td><td>Severe symptoms possible, e.g. shortness of breath or loss of consciousness. Very rare in normal indoor environments.</td></tr></tbody></table><p> ASHRAE (2022). <em>ASHRAE Position Document on Indoor Carbon Dioxide</em> – <a href=\"https://www.svlw.ch/images/aktuell/2022/pd_indoorcarbondioxide_2022.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PDF</a></p><p>Humidity that is too high or too low is also unhealthy. If it is too low, this leads to dry mucous membranes, irritated skin and a higher susceptibility to infections. If it is too high, it promotes mould growth, dust mites and other bio-organisms that can contribute to respiratory illnesses, allergies and asthma.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Meaning / possible effects</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Very dry: irritated mucous membranes, dry skin, eyes, possibly nosebleeds, increased susceptibility to respiratory infections.</td></tr><tr><td>Often quoted as the lower bound of the “healthy” range.</td></tr><tr><td>Frequently recommended ideal range for indoor spaces in terms of health and comfort.</td></tr><tr><td>Risk: increased mould and mite growth, damp rooms, uncomfortable indoor climate.</td></tr><tr><td>High humidity + poor ventilation = substantial health and building risks (mould, respiratory diseases).</td></tr></tbody></table><p> \nWang, W., Zhang, X., &amp; Li, W.

Building and Environment – <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352710223002188\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">article</a></p><p>All of this shows how important regular airing is. The e-paper room air monitor helps my flatmates and me to keep these values in check and maintain a healthy indoor climate.</p><p>The hardware is intentionally simple – mainly components I already had at home:</p><h2>The e-paper room air monitor</h2><p>The goal of the e-paper room air monitor is to stay unobtrusive as long as the air quality is within the green range, but to become clearly visible when defined thresholds are exceeded. This is achieved via the LED board, which starts blinking when values reach warning levels. The e-paper display always shows the current air quality plus a short recommendation of what to do.</p><p>The dashboard is there to help us understand how air quality develops over time and to keep us motivated to improve it. It shows interactive charts and a few easy-to-interpret metrics. The dashboard is meant to be a gentle nudge to keep an eye on indoor air quality in the long run. Here is a small preview:</p><p>Actively opening the dashboard and looking at graphs is a conscious decision that is easy to forget in everyday life. To counter that, I built a Telegram bot that posts a short summary of the previous day every morning at 7 a.m. into our flat’s group chat. This helps raise awareness and makes it easier to improve air quality habits.</p><p>In the second part of this blog series I want to dive deeper into the code and the implementation and talk about the challenges I ran into. I also plan to make the GitHub repository public by then, so interested readers can study the code, propose improvements or build their own version of the e-paper room air monitor.</p><p>The GitHub repository is not public yet. I will open it at the latest when part 2 of this series is published.</p><p>If you find the project interesting and would like to contribute, here are a few ideas:</p><ul><li>Contribute to the code in the GitHub repository (once it is public).</li><li>Do you have a 3D printer and experience designing 3D objects?\n    <ul><li>I would love a nice case design for the e-paper room air monitor.</li></ul></li><li>Do you have ideas for additional sensors?\n    <ul><li>Leave a comment and/or sponsor a sensor.</li></ul></li><li>Do you have hints, feedback or general comments?\n    <ul><li>Leave a comment or reach out to me directly.</li></ul></li></ul>",

      "content": "<img src=\"https://astral-os.org/images/posts/minecraft_ftw.png\" alt=\"Astral running Minecraft\"><p>\n\n    Being able to play games on your homebrew operating system is a big milestone to strive for. It shows that the system has enough implemented for a graphical application to run and get input, that it is fast enough for a game to be playable and that it is stable enough for the game to be played. Usually, the game of choice is Doom, as it has the reputation of being ported to everything under the sun, as well as being an FPS game that can demonstrate all of the points above about your operating system.</p><p>\n    Astral currently has some working game ports, which include Doom and Quake. However, as the capabilities of the operating system grow, so will the complexity of the games that can be played. I have been meaning to add a new game port for a while now, and I eventually decided on a game I had played a lot when I was younger: Minecraft.</p><h2>The challenges of running Minecraft</h2>\n    Minecraft is *not* an easy game to run. It is written in Java, so you need a working JVM. It uses OpenGL, so you also need a working OpenGL implementation. Additionally, it depends on many different Java libraries that you also have to port. Astral has had OpenJDK 17 and Mesa ported for a while now. The Mesa port works perfectly, but the OpenJDK port ended up bit-rotting and eventually stopped working due to a bug in mlibc.<h2>Choosing a version to run</h2>\n    The first step of this process was choosing which Minecraft version would run in Astral and then figuring out the Java command used to start it. I needed something simple and with as few dependencies as possible, so I picked version Alpha 1.2.0. This version only has one dependency, LWJGL2, reducing porting time and making debugging easier later on.<h2>Getting the JVM to work again</h2>\n\n  The next step was getting OpenJDK working in Astral again. As I mentioned earlier, it had bit-rotted and was now suffering from a segmentation fault when starting. The OpenJDK stack trace had given some important information: it was happening in  after OpenJDK called  with a big  specifier which had almost every value from 0 to 255.<p>\n  I eventually figured out that, due to the mlibc code using the </p> value from the format string, the values above 127 passed by OpenJDK would be handled as negative integers, which ended up causing <a href=\"https://github.com/managarm/mlibc/pull/1496\">accesses to negative array indexes and stack corruption</a>. With this fixed,  was able to run without issue, and I was ready to move on to the next part of this project.<a href=\"https://www.lwjgl.org/\">LWJGL</a> (Lightweight Java Game Library) is a Java library that is used to create cross-platform games in Java, providing access to APIs like OpenGL and abstractions for things like input. Up until Minecraft release 1.12, LWJGL 2 was used, which is no longer maintained as LWJGL 3 has been released. The version of Minecraft that will be run is Alpha 1.2.0, so LWJGL 2 will need to be ported.<p>\n  The process of porting LWJGL2 was quite painful. This mostly involved adding instructions to cross-compile the native libraries for Astral. LWJGL uses Apache Ant as the build system, which I have found to be very hostile to cross-compilation. Most of the patching effort was in the build system, as I did not need to modify any native C code and the only modification to Java code was adding Astral to the list of known OSes. You can find the patch file </p><a href=\"https://github.com/Mathewnd/Astral/blob/rewrite/patches/lwjgl/jinx-working-patch.patch\">here</a>, if you are interested.<h2>Running Minecraft and Debugging</h2>\n\nWith LWJGL ported, all that was left to do was boot Astral and debug any problems that end up happening. During this process, I was joined by <a href=\"https://github.com/Dennisbonke\">Dennis Bonke</a>, who maintains <a href=\"https://github.com/Managarm/Managarm\">Managarm's</a> ports collection. We worked together so we could eventually get Minecraft running on Managarm as well.<p>\nTo start minecraft I made a simple shell script. It switches to the directory where LWJGL is installed and calls java with all the nescessary arguments for it to start up. This is the version of the script that first got a working Minecraft:</p><code>/usr/lib/jvm/java-17/bin/java -Xint -Xmx1g -Djava.library.path=\"/usr/share/lwjgl\" -cp \"lwjgl.jar:lwjgl_util.jar:/home/astral/minecraft.jar\" net.minecraft.client.Minecraft</code><p>\n  In the first attempt, Java would run for a bit and then exit and mlibc would log about a missing </p> symbol. This is a symbol needed by  and defined by . Looking at rtld logs,  did get loaded by  (twice!), which means that there must have been a bug with mlibc. Eventually, we narrowed it down to the fact that OpenJDK first runs  for  with  and then again with , and the mlibc shared object promotion code was <a href=\"https://github.com/managarm/mlibc/pull/1498\">broken</a> for this case. After fixing this, we actually got a window out of Minecraft!<img src=\"https://astral-os.org/images/posts/minecraft_window.png\" alt=\"Astral getting a window out of Minecraft\"><p>\n\nHowever, it is clear it is still not working. The crash is an LWJGL error talking about an unknown platform. This was a missing piece of code in the LWJGL patch and was quick to fix. Next run, it went further but crashed with another missing symbol, </p>. We figured out this was a symbol that is not present in modern OpenJDK versions so this was clearly an issue with the cross-compilation.\nThis was a simple but annoying fix, I had to add specific variables to the  XML in LWJGL to make cross compilation easier and to use the proper headers, as it was still trying to use the host OpenJDK 8 headers. Now, LWJGL actually got further! Running it again, we hit another issue: an <code>ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</code> while initializing the display.<img src=\"https://astral-os.org/images/posts/minecraft_index.png\" alt=\"Astral running Minecraft (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException)\"><p>\n\nDiving into the LWJGL source code, we eventually figured out that the issue was in the </p> class  function, as the exception <code>Seek not possible (ESPIPE)</code> was happening while populating the screen hashmap. After adding a print to get the backtrace, we ended up at the native OpenJDK function , which returns the number of bytes left to read in a file. The issue here was that Astral did not implement  for pipe objects, causing it to fall back to seeking. Since seeking on a pipe is not possible, the  error is returned. After implementing it, Minecraft got into the menu screen!<img src=\"https://astral-os.org/images/posts/minecraft_menu.png\" alt=\"Astral running Minecraft (Menu screen)\">\n\nAfter that, it was smooth sailing. We were able to load into a world and verified that the game was working, from breaking blocks to saving. This was, to my knowledge, the first time a hobbyist OS ran Minecraft, which is a huge milestone not just for Astral but for the OSDev community as a whole, since it not only proves that it is possible, but also paves the way for others to do it as well with the open-source patches and mlibc fixes.<img src=\"https://astral-os.org/images/posts/minecraft_world.png\" alt=\"Astral running Minecraft\"><img src=\"https://astral-os.org/images/posts/minecraft_world_2.png\" alt=\"Astral running Minecraft\">\n\nA lot of the recent Astral work has been towards self-hosting, speed, stability and just general usability. There is now a working package manager (xbps) and all the necessary tools for a networked install to disk. This work will likely continue for the near future, and, after more improvements, I have plans of eventually releasing a sort of  guide to build an Astral distribution from inside another Astral distribution. There are also plans to revive the Wine port (which is still not fully functional) with Dennis for both Astral and Managarm, as well as a possible future WebKitGTK port.",

To obtain such a large medical database of the joints are risk factors. Therefore, the theory might be extended to describe the evolution of atherosclerosis and metabolic syndrome. For example, late‐stage type 2 diabetes is associated with collapse of beta‐cell function. This collapse has two parameters: the fraction of the senescent cells are predicted to affect disease threshold . For each individual, one simulates senescent‐cell abundance using the SR model has an approximately exponential incidence curve with a decline at old ages In this section, we simulated a wide range of age‐related incidence curves. The next sections provide examples of classes of diseases, which show improvement upon senolytic treatment tends to qualitatively support such a prediction. model different disease thresholds as values of the disease occurs when a physiological parameter ϕ increases due to the disease. Increasing susceptibility parameter s, which varies about 3‐fold between BMI below 25 (male) and 54 (female) are at least mildly age‐related and 25 (male) and 28 (female) are strongly age‐related, as defined above. Of these, we find that 66 are well described by the model as a wide range of feedback mechanisms that can provide homeostasis to a half‐life of days in young mice, but their removal rate slows down in old mice to a given type of cancer have strong risk factors should increase the removal rates of the joint that bears the most common biological process of aging that governs the onset of pathology in the records of at least 104 people, totaling 877 disease category codes (See SI section 9), increasing the range of 6–8% per year. The two‐parameter model describes well the strongly age‐related ICD9 codes: 90% of the codes show R 2 > 0.9) (Figure 4c). This agreement is similar to that of the previously proposed IMII model for cancer, major fibrotic diseases, and hundreds of other age‐related disease states obtained from 10−4 to lower cancer incidence. A better fit is achieved when allowing  to exceed its threshold mechanism for classes of disease, providing putative etiologies for diseases with unknown origin, such as bone marrow and skin. Thus, the sudden collapse of the alveoli at the outer parts of the immune removal capacity of cancer. For example, NK cells remove senescent cells also to other forms of age‐related damage and decline contribute (De Bourcy et al., 2017). There may be described as a first‐passage‐time problem, asking when mutated, impair particle removal by the bronchi and increase damage to alveolar cells (Yang et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2018), and immune therapy that causes T cells to target senescent cells (Amor et al., 2020). Since these treatments are predicted to have an exponential incidence curve that slows at very old ages. Interestingly, the main effects are opposite to the case of cancer growth rate to removal rate We next consider the case of frontline tissues discussed above.</i></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45958004\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45958004</a></p>\n<p>Points: 163</p>\n<p># Comments: 125</p>\n",

Each iteration creates a branch, applies a focused code change, generates a commit, opens a PR via GitHub's CLI, waits for required checks and reviews, merges if green, and records state into a shared notes file.</p><p>This avoids the typical stateless one-shot pattern of current coding agents and enables multi-step changes without losing intermediate reasoning, test failures, or partial progress.</p><p>The tool is useful for tasks that require many small, serial modifications: increasing test coverage, large refactors, dependency upgrades guided by release notes, or framework migrations.</p>",

It scans your repository, detects which jobs can be migrated, flags incompatible patterns, identifies missing commands, and can update only the safe workflows with a single command.</p><p>gh extension install fchimpan/gh-slimify\ngh slimfy      # Analyze workflows\ngh slimfy fix  # Update only jobs that are safe to migrate</p><p>It’s open source (MIT).\nAs a bonus: the README also includes an AI agent prompt that reproduces the same workflow-migration analysis—useful if you want to integrate the logic into an LLM agent or experiment with automated refactoring.</p><p>I’d love feedback—especially on edge cases, false positives/negatives, or patterns it should detect better.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Hi HN - I’m Peter, here with Harry (devhawk), and we’re building DBOS Java, an open-source Java library for durable workflows, backed by Postgres.</p><p>Essentially, DBOS helps you write long-lived, reliable code that can survive failures, restarts, and crashes without losing state or duplicating work. As your workflows run, it checkpoints each step they take in a Postgres database. When a process stops (fails, restarts, or crashes), your program can recover from those checkpoints to restore its exact state and continue from where it left off, as if nothing happened.</p><p>In practice, this makes it easier to build reliable systems for use cases like AI agents, payments, data synchronization, or anything that takes hours, days, or weeks to complete. Rather than bolting on ad-hoc retry logic and database checkpoints, durable workflows give you one consistent model for ensuring your programs can recover from any failure from exactly where they left off.</p><p>This library contains all you need to add durable workflows to your program: there's no separate service or orchestrator or any external dependencies except Postgres. Because it's just a library, you can incrementally add it to your projects, and it works out of the box with frameworks like Spring. And because it's built on Postgres, it natively supports all the tooling you're familiar with (backups, GUIs, CLI tools) and works with any Postgres provider.</p><p>If you want to try it out, check out the quickstart:</p><p>We'd love to hear what you think! We’ll be in the comments for the rest of the day to answer any questions.</p>",

      "content": "\n<p>Hey HN! We’re Jason & Matt and we’re building Tweeks (<a href=\"https://tweeks.io\">https://tweeks.io</a>), a browser extension that lets you modify any website in your browser to add functionality, filter/highlight, re-theme, reorganize, de-clutter, etc. If you’ve used Violentmonkey/Tampermonkey, Tweeks is like a next‑generation userscript manager. Instead of digging through selectors and hand‑writing custom JS/CSS, describe what you want in natural language and Tweeks plans + generates your edits and applies them.<p>The modern web is so full of clutter and junk (banners, modals, feeds, and recommendations you didn’t ask for). Even a simple google search is guarded by multiple ads, an AI overview, a trending searches module, etc. before you even see the first real blue link.<p>Every day there's a new Lovable-like product (make it simple to build your own website/app) or a new agentic browser (AI agents click around and browse the web for you), but we built Tweeks to serve the middle ground: most of our time spent on the web is on someone else's site (not our own), and we don't want to offload everything to an agentic browser. We want to be able to shape the entire web to our own preferences as we browse.<p>I spent years working on recommendation systems and relevance at Pinterest, and understand how well-meaning recommendations and A/B tests can lead to website enshittification. No one sets out to make UX worse, but optimizing for an “average” user is not the same as optimizing for each individual user.<p>I’ve also been hacking “page fixers” as long as I can remember: remove a login wall here, collapse cookie banners there, add missing filters/highlights (first with F12/inspect element and eventually graduated to advanced GreaseMonkey userscripts). Tweeks started as a weekend prototype that turned simple requests into page edits but unexpectedly grew into something people kept asking to share. We hope you’ll like it too!<p>How it works: Open the Tweeks extension, type your request (e.g. “hide cookie banners and add a price/quality score”), and submit. Upon submission, the page structure is captured, an AI agent reviews the structure, plans changes, and returns deterministic transformations (selectors, layout tweaks, styles, and small scripts) that run locally. Your modifications persist across page loads and can be enabled/disabled, modified, and shared.<p>Here are a bunch of one‑shot examples from early users:<p><i>Youtube</i>: Remove Youtube Shorts.

      "content": "\n<p>Hi HN, We’re Jamie & Dan, building JSX Tool (<a href=\"https://jsxtool.com\">https://jsxtool.com</a>) a new inspector/dev panel IDE that allows you to navigate to any line of your React project’s JSX with just a click and a command click to explore your render stack.<p>Demo video: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIIXvN7vhrs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIIXvN7vhrs</a><p>I’ve been writing React code for nearly a decade. Since I first saw source maps in the days of Babel and Redux, I’ve always wanted to be able to edit my code from the source maps. I’ve also always wanted to be able to inspect my JSX like it was HTML.<p>Last year, I found my first real use of AI was taking ad-hoc CSS changes in the Chrome element inspector, pasting them into ChatGPT, and asking for the equivalent in Tailwind. I’d then paste those changes into my React TSX files.<p>I wanted to streamline this process but came to the conclusion that to do so I needed to build a JSX inspector. I had to write a custom AST parser to create a mapping between the JSX and HTML. So I hacked on an inspector for a couple of months that connected JSX to the DOM in both directions.<p>The next feature was adding a CSS editor, like the one in the browser inspectors but for JSX. Unlike styling a piece of HTML I decided that any in memory style edits to a React fiber should be globally applied, as if you had tweaked that line of code in your codebase.<p>Finally, I was able to add the two AI features I really wanted: (1) prompt for in-memory styles for when I was pixel tweaking, and (2) save those temporary changes back to my codebase in the convention of the codebase I was working in.<p>To accomplish talking to the filesystem from the Chrome extension I built a little local server that mounts from the root of your project and allows the extension to send file-system commands back to your project root. We named this the “Dev Server”. (Note: You can fully use us as a JSX inspector without this server installed.)<p>After all that, I found that to convert myself as a user I needed it to be a pretty fully functional IDE. I needed vim bindings, I needed a typechecker, I needed auto-complete, I needed a linter, I needed code search and I needed a proper file explorer. Fortunately we were able to take advantage of the dev-server architecture we had stumbled onto in order to add an LSP server and Rip Grep. At this point, after months of dog fooding, I use JSX Tool for almost all of my website edits.<p>We’re still rough around the edges for mobile but we’re working on that.<p>All of the IDE stuff not involving AI is free and works fine without AI. We let you get a taste of the prompting stuff for free but apply some rate limits.<p>The extension itself is not open source but the dev server with the LSP is. It’s a great foundation if you want to build any sort of in-browser IDE and it's nearly React agnostic. Building the dev server was a big undertaking so I’d love to see someone fork it and find value in it.<p>In the future we want to start adding things that we are in a position to take advantage of over something like Cursor, such as letting AI give you code suggestions for runtime exceptions or work with the network logs. We think that the convenience of having your IDE in the dev panel gives us a leg up in convenience and workflow context.<p>Anyway, regardless of how you feel about AI coding, I wanted to make something that was useful with or without AI. We’d love it if you gave it a spin and we want to share anything we can about the technical side of the product that you might find interesting.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45903161\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45903161</a></p>\n<p>Points: 99</p>\n<p># Comments: 75</p>\n",

Here's the pink edition in action:\n</p><div><p>I'd like to make a small batch of these synths. Click the button below to stay updated.</p></div><p>My daughter received a Montessori activity board full of switches and LEDs for her first birthday. Watching her twist knobs and flip the switches reminded me of the control surface of a synth, and I wondered if I could build a musical version - something simple, tactile, and creative that didn’t require holding down buttons to keep the sound going. A year later I finally decided to build it. I had no prior hardware experience, so this became an excuse to learn about microcontrollers, CAD, PCB design, and 3D printing.</p><p>I started the project with a 15 year old Arduino Inventors Kit and only a vague idea about how to use it. The first goal was simple: build a basic MIDI controller on a breadboard. If I could get some potentiometer readings, map them to 12 discrete values - one for each note in an octave - and emit MIDI messages, I would have taken a small step in the right direction. Adding an onboard synth module and designing a pretty box to put it in could wait until later.</p><p>Reading the potentiometer inputs and turning them into the MIDI messages using the <a href=\"https://github.com/FortySevenEffects/arduino_midi_library\">Arduino MIDI</a> library was easy enough. To hear the output, I wrote a small Python script that intercepted the MIDI messages and forwarded them to my Mac’s default MIDI device, which Logic Pro could pick up. That let me “play” the breadboard through software instruments.</p><p>Once I had the hang of wiring up potentiometers and rotary encoders, the next step was to move the audio synthesis from Logic to my breadboard. For this I used a little $12.95 <a href=\"https://shop.m5stack.com/products/midi-synthesizer-unit-sam2695\">SAM2695 synthesiser module</a> with an integrated amplifier and speaker. Its inner workings remain a mystery to me but it does what I need it to and I was happy reduce the amount of time to get a functioning prototype into my daughter’s hands. I also moved to an Elegoo Nano here due to its low cost and increased number of analog pins.</p><p>Next, I added small OLED screen to provide some visual feedback and character and used the handy <a href=\"https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2\">u8g2 graphics library</a>. This was trickier than I expected: the Nano has so little RAM that I couldn’t buffer a full frame. I had to update the screen in small patches, and large updates were slow enough that they occasionally interfered with encoder reads, and caused laggy notes at faster tempos. I’ve still got some work to do to iron out blocking screen updates, but for now I pushed through and accepted a bit of lag. I added a little dancing panda that I adapted from one I found in a pixel art tutorial which I can no longer find - if you’re the original creator, please let me know so I can credit you!</p><p>For developing on-the-go, I discovered the <a href=\"https://wokwi.com/\">Wokwi￼microcontroller simulator</a>. It let me build a virtual schematic and test code without luggin around the my fragile prototype. They have a free online simulator and a paid VS Code plugin that lets you create your diagrams in the IDE.</p><p>The circuit drawn in Wokwi</p><p>Once I had a functional circuit it was time to move on to designing an enclosure and assembling a complete version of the synthesiser that my daughter could play with.</p><p>After wiring up the breadboard, the next hurdle was figuring out how to build a proper enclosure. I looked for off-the-shelf cases, but nothing matched the size I needed, and everything seemed to come in either black or beige. So I decided to learn some basic CAD and 3D-print the enclosure on a friend’s Bambu Labs A1 Mini.</p><p>I downloaded Fusion 360 and started following tutorials. With only an hour or two to spare in the evenings, progress was slow at first. I’d never used any CAD software before, so I was constantly switching between learning the software and trying to make actual progress on the design. For other beginners, I highly recommend Product Design Online’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3qGQ2utl2A\">Learn Fusion 360 in 30 Days</a> and this excellent <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hComh1hFzY\">video by wermy</a>.</p><p>After a few weeks of trial-and-error, I finally had a design I could print:</p><p>Thank you Tom for printing these! A year's supply of filament coming your way.</p><p>Moving the circuit to a proper PCB felt daunting, so for the first version I hand-wired everything on a solderable breadboard.  The good: hanging out and drinking some wine with my friend, who kindly offered to help with the soldering. The bad: when the time finally came to close the two halves of the enclosure, stuffing the rats nest of wires inside ended up putting pressure on a bunch of the delicate soldered joints and breaking them. My daughter could play around a bit with it - enough for me to convince myself that she’d genuinely enjoy using it - but it was fragile. I also wanted to make a few units for friends, which meant I needed something more robust and faster to assemble. Time to design a PCB.</p><p>Romain, I definitely owe you a bottle or two...</p><p>Once again I was back on YouTube and fumbling my way through an unfamiliar workflow, though I stuck with Fusion 360 which has its own electronics design suite. For my first attempt I decided that I’d focus on surface-mounting the various components and save integrating the microcontroller into the board for a future project. A large chunk of the time here was spent reading datasheets, sourcing parts and importing their footprints/models into Fusion 360. Once I had learned the basics, I was able to route the circuit on a 2-layer board. One of the nice things about Fusion is that you get a full 3D model of the assembled PCB, which makes designing the enclosure much easier.</p><p>When I was finished, I exported the PCB design file and uploaded it to <a href=\"https://jlcpcb.com/\">JLCPCB</a>. Five boards (the minimum order) cost £35.41 including shipping, and they arrived five days later. It blows my mind that this is possible.</p><p>For my first version I had decided to use 4 AA batteries and use the Arduino’s built-in voltage converter to provide a steady 5 volts. Something I overlooked, however, is that the Arduino’s VIN pin that provides a regulated 5V to the board requires 7-12V input, while my batteries will provide, at best, 6V when new. The board seemed to work OK at this voltage but it would be vulnerable to random resets as the voltage starts to sag and a short battery life.</p><p>For the next iteration I decided to get rid of one of the batteries and introduce an <a href=\"https://www.digikey.co.uk/en/products/detail/adafruit-industries-llc/4654/12697636\">Adafruit Miniboost</a> to provide a regulated 5V power supply to the Arduino from the combine 4.5V from the three AA batteries. This allowed me to reduce the weight a little bit and provide the synth with a stable supply of power for a longer duration.</p><p>Finally, I updated the enclosure so that I could securely attach the PCB and added a neat little battery compartment. I also added a small bezel to raise the height of OLED display.</p><p>It’s been just over a week since my daughter unwrapped her new synth. It now lives on the shelf with her other toys, and so far it gets regular use and is holding up well. One of my goals was to make something fun to fiddle with at a superficial level, but with enough depth to stay interesting as she gets older. The first part seems true, and I’ll see how the second plays out over the coming months. There are still a few kinks to iron out, such as the lag when updating the screen. I’m also planning to upgrade the Elegoo Nano to an ESP32, which should simplify the firmware and open up more options for fun display graphics.</p><p>After watching a few children and adults (musical and non-musical) play with it, I think there might be the germ of a real product here. With a better synth engine, audio outputs, and a way to chain multiple units together, it could be a playful introduction to electronic music for older kids - maybe even adults. However, adding features is one thing, but actually bringing a product to market is another. The challenges aren’t just technical: they’re regulatory and financial. Safety certification (UKCA/CE, and FCC in the US) can cost £5-10K or more. Manufacturing is another hurdle. A 3D-printed enclosure is fine for a prototype, but a real product likely needs injection-molded parts, which require expensive tooling. Even a small production run would need more upfront capital than I can sensibly invest right now.</p><p>For the moment I’m treating it as a learning project, but the response so far has been encouraging. A more polished open-source version for makers, or possibly a small Kickstarter campaign, might be viable next steps. If anyone reading this has experience bringing small-run hardware to market, <a href=\"mailto:ali.roberts3+synth@gmail.com\">I’d love to hear from you</a>.</p>",

      "content": "\n<p>Hi HN, we’re Sai and Aayush and we’re building Hypercubic (<a href=\"https://www.hypercubic.ai/\">https://www.hypercubic.ai/</a>)!<p>Hypercubic is an AI platform that helps Fortune 500 companies understand, preserve, and modernize their mainframe systems. These are the systems that run COBOL from the 1960s that still quietly power banking, insurance, airlines, and governments today.<p>70% of the Fortune 500 still run on mainframes, but the engineers who built and maintained them are retiring. Today, the average age of a COBOL/mainframe engineer is about 55 and rapidly increasing. What’s left behind are opaque, black box systems with almost no one who understands how they work. Modernization projects often fail, documentation is decades out of date, and critical institutional knowledge lives only in the minds of a few senior subject matter experts who are now leaving the workforce.<p>Current “AI for code” tools focus on codebases and repositories, so they miss the unwritten rules, historical context, and architectural reasoning that live in human minds. In the COBOL/mainframe world, that institutional knowledge is the key missing piece.<p>What we heard from modernization leaders is that the hard part is not the code analysis. The challenge is the institutional knowledge that never made it into code or documentation and has walked out the door. Modernization projects fail not because no one can parse COBOL, but because no one can answer “why was this billing edge case added in 1995 and what breaks if we remove it.”<p>Hypercubic is building an AI-native maintenance and modernization platform that learns how legacy mainframe systems actually work and captures the human reasoning behind operating them. We’re doing this with two initial tools, HyperDocs and HyperTwin.<p>HyperDocs ingests COBOL, JCL, and PL/I codebases to generate documentation, architecture diagrams, and dependency graphs. Enterprises currently spend months or years hiring contractors to reverse-engineer these systems; HyperDocs compresses that work to take much less time.<p>COBOL was designed to resemble English and business prose, making it a good fit for LLMs today. Mainframes have decades of consistent patterns (COBOL, JCL, CICS, batch jobs) and a finite set of recurring tasks (such as payroll, transaction processing, billing).<p>For example, here’s a billing fragment that would be run nightly in production at large insurance companies for moving money, closing accounts, and triggering downstream reports:<p><pre><code>  EVALUATE TRUE\n      WHEN PAYMENT-DUE AND NOT PAID\n          PERFORM CALCULATE-LATE-FEE\n          PERFORM GENERATE-NOTICE\n      WHEN PAYMENT-RECEIVED AND BALANCE-DUE = 0\n          MOVE \"ACCOUNT CLEAR\" TO STATUS\n          PERFORM ARCHIVE-STATEMENT\n      WHEN OTHER\n          PERFORM LOG-ANOMALY\n  END-EVALUATE.\n</code></pre>\nNow imagine thousands of these rules, each running payrolls, processing claims, or reconciling accounts, spread across millions of lines of code written over 40+ years. HyperDocs ingests that code and reconstructs it into readable, living documentation that shows how the black box system works.<p>Our other tool, HyperTwin, tackles the “tribal knowledge” problem. It learns directly from subject-matter experts, observing workflows, analyzing screen interactions, and conducting AI-driven interviews to capture how they debug and reason about their systems. The goal is to build digital “twins” of the experts on how they debug, architect, and maintain these systems in practice.<p>Together, HyperDocs and HyperTwin form a knowledge graph of legacy systems linking code, systems, and human reasoning.<p>Here’s a demo video of our HyperTwin product: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-tNtl9Z_jY\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-tNtl9Z_jY</a><p>You can explore our documentation platform, including examples from the AWS Card Demo (a widely used COBOL codebase example) and a dummy insurance project here:\n<a href=\"https://hyperdocs-public.onrender.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://hyperdocs-public.onrender.com/</a>.<p>e.g. Developer perspective docs - High level system architecture of credit card management: \n<a href=\"https://hyperdocs-public.onrender.com/docs/aws-carddemo-with-dev-docs/developer/architecture/system-architecture\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://hyperdocs-public.onrender.com/docs/aws-carddemo-with...</a><p>We’re curious to hear your thoughts and feedback, especially from anyone who’s worked with mainframes or tried to modernize legacy systems.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45877517\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45877517</a></p>\n<p>Points: 85</p>\n<p># Comments: 55</p>\n",

What suggestions do you have? What to install? Any mini “curriculums” or ideas?<p>Would love to hear your ideas and experiences.

      "content": "<p>The first tabular foundation model, TabPFN, and its successor TabPFNv2 have impacted tabular AI substantially, with dozens of methods building on it and hundreds of applications across different use cases.</p><p>This report introduces , the next generation of our tabular foundation model, scaling to 20× data cells compared to TabPFNv2. On industry standard benchmarks with up to 50,000 data points and 2,000 features, TabPFN-2.5 substantially outperforms tuned tree-based models and matches the accuracy of AutoGluon 1.4, a complex four-hour tuned ensemble that even includes the previous TabPFNv2.</p><p>For production use cases, we introduce a new distillation engine that converts TabPFN-2.5 into a compact MLP or tree ensemble, preserving most of its accuracy while delivering orders-of-magnitude lower latency and plug-and-play deployment.This new release will immediately strengthen the performance of the many applications andmethods already built on the TabPFN ecosystem.</p><p>This new release will substantially strengthen the performance of the many applications and methods already built on TabPFN.</p><p>Tabular data is ubiquitous, forming the backbone of decision-making in countless domains, from finance to healthcare. For decades, traditional tabular machine learning—built on gradient-boosted trees, random forests, and linear or additive models—has been the workhorse of applied data science. Yet these methods remain limited: they require extensive dataset-specific tuning, often provide uncalibrated or unreliable uncertainty estimates without significant modification, and lack the generalization and transferability of modern foundation models.</p><p><strong>Tabular foundation models (TFMs) offer a new paradigm.</strong> They address these limitations by pretraining on large synthetic distributions of tabular tasks and performing inference via in-context learning instead of gradient descent. They are training-free predictors meta-trained to yield strong calibration, without the need for time-consuming and labor-intensive hyperparameter tuning necessary for gradient-boosted trees. Their strong generalization makes them particularly attractive for data-scarce domains.</p><p>Our initial release, TabPFNv1, served as a proof-of-concept that a transformer could learn a Bayesian-like inference algorithm, though it was limited to small (up to 1,000 samples), clean, numerical-only data. Our successor, TabPFNv2, scaled this idea into a practical model for datasets up to 10,000 samples. TabPFNv2 handles the messy and heterogeneous data seen in the real world—including categorical features, missing values &amp; outliers.</p><p><strong>State-of-the-Art Performance</strong></p><p>In a forward pass, TabPFN-2.5 outperforms tuned tree-based models (like XGBoost and CatBoost) and matches the accuracy of AutoGluon 1.4 tuned for 4 hours—a complex ensemble that includes all previous methods, even TabPFNv2.</p><p>We scale the power of in-context learning to datasets of up to 50,000 samples (5× increase over TabPFNv2) and 2,000 features (4× increase), making TFMs viable for a much wider range of real-world problems.</p><p>We've dramatically improved inference latency. Our proprietary distillation engine converts TabPFN-2.5 into a compact MLP or tree ensemble, preserving most of its accuracy while delivering orders-of-magnitude lower latency and plug-and-play deployment.</p>",
