This emerging cancer treatment strategy takes advantage of the unique chemical conditions found inside tumors. Compared with normal tissue, cancer cells tend to be more acidic and contain higher levels of hydrogen peroxide.</p><p>Traditional CDT uses these tumor conditions to spark the formation of hydroxyl radicals, highly reactive molecules made of oxygen and hydrogen that contain an unpaired electron. These reactive oxygen species damage cells through oxidation, stripping electrons from essential components such as lipids, proteins, and DNA.</p><p>More recent CDT approaches have also succeeded in generating singlet oxygen inside tumors. Singlet oxygen is another reactive oxygen species, named for its single electron spin state rather than the three spin states seen in the more stable oxygen molecules present in the air.</p><p><strong>Overcoming Limits of Existing CDT Agents</strong></p><p>\"However, existing CDT agents are limited,\" Oleh Taratula said. \"They efficiently generate either radical hydroxyls or singlet oxygen but not both, and they often lack sufficient catalytic activity to sustain robust reactive oxygen species production. Consequently, preclinical studies often only show partial tumor regression and not a durable therapeutic benefit.\"</p><p>To address these shortcomings, the team developed a new CDT nanoagent built from an iron-based metal-organic framework or MOF. This structure is capable of producing both hydroxyl radicals and singlet oxygen, increasing its cancer-fighting potential. The MOF demonstrated strong toxicity across multiple cancer cell lines while causing minimal harm to noncancerous cells.</p><p><strong>Complete Tumor Regression in Mice</strong></p><p>\"When we systemically administered our nanoagent in mice bearing human breast cancer cells, it efficiently accumulated in tumors, robustly generated reactive oxygen species and completely eradicated the cancer without adverse effects,\" Olena Taratula said. \"We saw total tumor regression and long-term prevention of recurrence, all without seeing any systemic toxicity.\"</p><p>In these preclinical experiments, tumors disappeared entirely and did not return, and the animals showed no signs of harmful side effects.</p><p><strong>Next Steps Toward Broader Cancer Treatment</strong></p><p>Before moving into human trials, the researchers plan to test the treatment in additional cancer types, including aggressive pancreatic cancer, to determine whether the approach can be effective across a wide range of tumors.</p><p>Other contributors to the study included Oregon State researchers Kongbrailatpam Shitaljit Sharma, Yoon Tae Goo, Vladislav Grigoriev, Constanze Raitmayr, Ana Paula Mesquita Souza, and Manali Parag Phawde.

      "content": "<p>Yes, writing code is easier than ever.</p><p>AI assistants autocomplete your functions. Agents scaffold entire features. You can describe what you want in plain English and watch working code appear in seconds. The barrier to producing code has never been lower.</p><p>And yet, the day-to-day life of software engineers has gotten more complex, more demanding, and more exhausting than it was two years ago.</p><p>This is not a contradiction. It is the reality of what happens when an industry adopts a powerful new tool without pausing to consider the second-order effects on the people using it.</p><p>If you are a software engineer reading this and feeling like your job quietly became harder while everyone around you celebrates how easy everything is now, you are not imagining things. The job changed. The expectations changed. And nobody sent a memo.</p><h2>The Baseline Moved and Nobody Told You</h2><p>There is a phenomenon happening right now that most engineers feel but struggle to articulate. The expected output of a software engineer in 2026 is dramatically higher than it was in 2023. Not because anyone held a meeting and announced new targets. Not because your manager sat you down and explained the new rules. The baseline just moved.</p><p>It moved because AI tools made certain tasks faster. And when tasks become faster, the assumption follows immediately: you should be doing more. Not in the future. Now.</p><p>A February 2026 study published in Harvard Business Review tracked 200 employees at a U.S. tech company over eight months. The researchers found something that will sound familiar to anyone living through this shift. Workers did not use AI to finish earlier and go home. They used it to do more. They took on broader tasks, worked at a faster pace, and extended their hours, often without anyone asking them to. The researchers described a self-reinforcing cycle: AI accelerated certain tasks, which raised expectations for speed. Higher speed made workers more reliant on AI. Increased reliance widened the scope of what workers attempted. And a wider scope further expanded the quantity and density of work.</p><p>The numbers tell the rest of the story. Eighty-three percent of workers in the study said AI increased their workload. Burnout was reported by 62 percent of associates and 61 percent of entry-level workers. Among C-suite leaders? Just 38 percent. The people doing the actual work are carrying the intensity. The people setting the expectations are not feeling it the same way.</p><p>This gap matters enormously. If leadership believes AI is making everything easier while engineers are drowning in a new kind of complexity, the result is a slow erosion of trust, morale, and eventually talent.</p><p>A separate survey of over 600 engineering professionals found that nearly two-thirds of engineers experience burnout despite their organizations using AI in development. Forty-three percent said leadership was out of touch with team challenges. Over a third reported that productivity had actually decreased over the past year, even as their companies invested more in AI tooling.</p><p>The baseline moved. The expectations rose. And for many engineers, no one acknowledged that the job they signed up for had fundamentally changed.</p><h2>The Identity Crisis Nobody Talks About</h2><p>Here is something that gets lost in all the excitement about AI productivity: most software engineers became engineers because they love writing code.</p><p>Not managing code. Not reviewing code. Not supervising systems that produce code. Writing it. The act of thinking through a problem, designing a solution, and expressing it precisely in a language that makes a machine do exactly what you intended. That is what drew most of us to this profession. It is a creative act, a form of craftsmanship, and for many engineers, the most satisfying part of their day.</p><p>Now they are being told to stop.</p><p>Not explicitly, of course. Nobody walks into a standup and says “stop writing code.” But the message is there, subtle and persistent. Use AI to write it faster. Let the agent handle the implementation. Focus on higher-level tasks. Your value is not in the code you write anymore, it is in how well you direct the systems that write it for you.</p><p>For early adopters, this feels exciting. It feels like evolution. For a significant portion of working engineers, it feels like being told that the thing they spent years mastering, the skill that defines their professional identity, is suddenly less important.</p><p>One engineer captured this shift perfectly in a widely shared essay, describing how AI transformed the engineering role from builder to reviewer. Every day felt like being a judge on an assembly line that never stops. You just keep stamping those pull requests. The production volume went up. The sense of craftsmanship went down.</p><p>This is not a minor adjustment. It is a fundamental shift in professional identity. Engineers who built their careers around deep technical skill are being asked to redefine what they do and who they are, essentially overnight, without any transition period, training, or acknowledgment that something significant was lost in the process.</p><p>Having led engineering teams for over two decades, I have seen technology shifts before. New frameworks, new languages, new methodologies. Engineers adapt. They always have. But this is different because it is not asking engineers to learn a new way of doing what they do. It is asking them to stop doing the thing that made them engineers in the first place and become something else entirely.</p><p>That is not an upgrade. That is a career identity crisis. And pretending it is not happening does not make it go away.</p><h2>The Expanding Role: When Everything Becomes Your Problem</h2><p>While engineers are being asked to write less code, they are simultaneously being asked to do more of everything else.</p><p>More product thinking. More architectural decision-making. More code review. More context switching. More planning. More testing oversight. More deployment awareness. More risk assessment.</p><p>The scope of what it means to be a “software engineer” expanded dramatically in the last two years, and it happened without a pause to catch up.</p><p>This is partly a direct consequence of AI acceleration. When code gets produced faster, the bottleneck shifts. It moves from implementation to everything surrounding implementation: requirements clarity, architecture decisions, integration testing, deployment strategy, monitoring, and maintenance. These were always part of the engineering lifecycle, but they were distributed across roles. Product managers handled requirements. QA handled testing. DevOps handled deployment. Senior architects handled system design.</p><p>Now, with AI collapsing the implementation phase, organizations are quietly redistributing those responsibilities to the engineers themselves. The Harvard Business Review study documented this exact pattern. Product managers began writing code. Engineers took on product work. Researchers started doing engineering tasks. Roles that once had clear boundaries blurred as workers used AI to handle jobs that previously sat outside their remit.</p><p>The industry is openly talking about this as a positive development. Engineers should be “T-shaped” or “full-stack” in a broader sense. Nearly 45 percent of engineering roles now expect proficiency across multiple domains. AI tools augment generalists more effectively, making it easier for one person to handle multiple components of a system.</p><p>On paper, this sounds empowering. In practice, it means that a mid-level backend engineer is now expected to understand product strategy, review AI-generated frontend code they did not write, think about deployment infrastructure, consider security implications of code they cannot fully trace, and maintain a big-picture architectural awareness that used to be someone else’s job.</p><p>That is not empowerment. That is scope creep without a corresponding increase in compensation, authority, or time.</p><p>From my experience building and scaling teams in fintech and high-traffic platforms, I can tell you that role expansion without clear boundaries always leads to the same outcome: people try to do everything, nothing gets done with the depth it requires, and burnout follows. The engineers who survive are the ones who learn to say no, to prioritize ruthlessly, and to push back when the scope of their role quietly doubles without anyone acknowledging it.</p><p>There is an irony at the center of the AI-assisted engineering workflow that nobody wants to talk about: reviewing AI-generated code is often harder than writing the code yourself.</p><p>When you write code, you carry the context of every decision in your head. You know why you chose this data structure, why you handled this edge case, why you structured the module this way. The code is an expression of your thinking, and reviewing it later is straightforward because the reasoning is already stored in your memory.</p><p>When AI writes code, you inherit the output without the reasoning. You see the code, but you do not see the decisions. You do not know what tradeoffs were made, what assumptions were baked in, what edge cases were considered or ignored. You are reviewing someone else’s work, except that someone is not a colleague you can ask questions. It is a statistical model that produces plausible-looking code without any understanding of your system’s specific constraints.</p><p>A survey by Harness found that 67 percent of developers reported spending more time debugging AI-generated code, and 68 percent spent more time reviewing it than they did with human-written code. This is not a failure of the tools. It is a structural property of the workflow. Code review without shared context is inherently more demanding than reviewing code you participated in creating.</p><p>Yet the expectation from management is that AI should be making everything faster. So engineers find themselves in a bind: they are producing more code than ever, but the quality assurance burden has increased, the context-per-line-of-code has decreased, and the cognitive load of maintaining a system they only partially built is growing with every sprint.</p><p>This is the supervision paradox. The faster AI generates code, the more human attention is required to ensure that code actually works in the context of a real system with real users and real business constraints. The production bottleneck did not disappear. It moved from writing to understanding, and understanding is harder to speed up.</p><p>What makes all of this especially difficult is the self-reinforcing nature of the cycle.</p><p>AI makes certain tasks faster. Faster tasks create the perception of more available capacity. More perceived capacity leads to more work being assigned. More work leads to more AI reliance. More AI reliance leads to more code that needs review, more context that needs to be maintained, more systems that need to be understood, and more cognitive load on engineers who are already stretched thin.</p><p>The Harvard Business Review researchers described this as “workload creep.” Workers did not consciously decide to work harder. The expansion happened naturally, almost invisibly. Each individual step felt reasonable. In aggregate, it produced an unsustainable pace.</p><p>Before AI, there was a natural ceiling on how much you could produce in a day. That ceiling was set by thinking speed, typing speed, and the time it takes to look things up. It was frustrating sometimes, but it was also a governor. A natural speed limit that prevented you from outrunning your own ability to maintain quality.</p><p>AI removed the governor. Now the only limit is your cognitive endurance. And most people do not know their cognitive limits until they have already blown past them.</p><p>This is where many engineers find themselves right now. Shipping more code than any quarter in their career. Feeling more drained than any quarter in their career. The two facts are not unrelated.</p><p>The trap is that it looks like productivity from the outside. Metrics go up. Velocity charts look great. More features shipped. More pull requests merged. But underneath the numbers, quality is quietly eroding, technical debt is accumulating faster than it can be addressed, and the people doing the work are running on fumes.</p><h2>What Junior Engineers Are Facing</h2><p>If the picture is difficult for experienced engineers, it is even harder for those starting their careers.</p><p>Junior engineers have traditionally learned by doing the simpler, more task-oriented work. Fixing small bugs. Writing straightforward features. Implementing well-defined tickets. This hands-on work built the foundational understanding that eventually allowed them to take on more complex challenges.</p><p>AI is rapidly consuming that training ground. If an agent can handle the routine API hookup, the boilerplate module, the straightforward CRUD endpoint, what is left for a junior engineer to learn from? The expectation is shifting toward needing to contribute at a higher level almost from day one, without the gradual ramp-up that previous generations of engineers relied on.</p><p>Entry-level hiring at the 15 largest tech firms fell 25 percent from 2023 to 2024. The HackerRank 2025 Developer Skills Report confirmed that expectations are rising faster than productivity gains, and that early-career hiring remains sluggish compared to senior-level roles. Companies are prioritizing experienced talent, but the pipeline that produces experienced talent is being quietly dismantled.</p><p>This is a problem that extends beyond individual career concerns. If junior engineers do not get the opportunity to build foundational skills through hands-on work, the industry will eventually face a shortage of senior engineers who truly understand the systems they oversee. You cannot supervise what you never learned to build.</p><p>As I have written before, code is for humans to read. If the next generation of engineers never develops the fluency to read, understand, and reason about code at a deep level, no amount of AI tooling will compensate for that gap.</p><h2>What Good Leadership Looks Like Right Now</h2><p>If you lead engineering teams, the most important thing you can do right now is acknowledge that this transition is genuinely difficult. Not theoretically. Not abstractly. For the actual people on your team.</p><p>The career they signed up for changed fast. The skills they were hired for are being repositioned. The expectations they are working under shifted without a clear announcement. Acknowledging this reality is not a sign of weakness. It is a prerequisite for maintaining a team that trusts you.</p><p>Start with empathy, but do not stop there.</p><p>Give your team real training. Not a lunch-and-learn about prompt engineering. Real investment in the skills that the new engineering landscape actually requires: system design, architectural thinking, product reasoning, security awareness, and the ability to critically evaluate code they did not write. These are not trivial skills. They take time to develop, and your team needs structured support to build them.</p><p>Give them space to experiment without the pressure of immediate productivity gains. The engineers who will thrive in this environment are the ones who have room to figure out how AI fits into their workflow without being penalized for the learning curve. Every experienced technologist I know who has successfully integrated AI tools went through an adjustment period where they were less productive before they became more productive. That adjustment period is normal, and it needs to be protected.</p><p>Set explicit boundaries around role scope. If you are asking engineers to take on product thinking, planning, and risk assessment in addition to their technical work, name it. Define it. Compensate for it. Do not let it happen silently and then wonder why your team is burned out.</p><p>Rethink your metrics. If your engineering success metrics are still centered on velocity, tickets closed, and lines of code, you are measuring the wrong things in an AI-assisted world. System stability, code quality, decision quality, customer outcomes, and team health are better indicators of whether your engineering organization is actually producing value or just producing volume.</p><p>Protect the junior pipeline. If you have stopped hiring junior engineers because AI can handle entry-level tasks, you are solving a short-term efficiency problem by creating a long-term talent crisis. The senior engineers you rely on today were junior engineers who learned by doing the work that AI is now consuming. That path still matters.</p><p>And finally, keep challenging your team. I have never met a good engineer who did not love a good challenge. The engineers on your team are not fragile. They are capable, intelligent people who signed up for hard problems. They can handle this transition. Just make sure they are set up to meet it.</p><h2>What Engineers Can Do for Themselves</h2><p>If you are an engineer navigating this shift, here is what I would tell you based on two decades of watching technology cycles reshape this profession.</p><p>First, do not abandon your fundamentals. The pressure to become an “AI-first” engineer is real, but the engineers who will be most valuable in five years are the ones who deeply understand the systems they work on. AI is a tool. Understanding architecture, debugging complex systems, reasoning about performance and security: these skills are not becoming less important. They are becoming more important because someone needs to be the adult in the room when AI-generated code breaks in production at 2 AM.</p><p>Second, learn to set boundaries with the acceleration trap. Just because you can produce more does not mean you should. Sustainable pace matters. The engineers who burn out trying to match the theoretical maximum output AI makes possible are not the ones who build lasting careers. The ones who learn to work with AI deliberately, choosing when to use it and when to think independently, are the ones who will still be thriving in this profession a decade from now.</p><p>Third, embrace the parts of the expanded role that genuinely interest you. If the engineering role now includes more product thinking, more architectural decision-making, more cross-functional communication, treat that as an opportunity rather than an imposition. These are skills that senior engineers and technical leaders need. You are being given access to a broader set of capabilities earlier in your career than any previous generation of engineers. That is not a burden. It is a head start.</p><p>Fourth, talk about what you are experiencing. The isolation of feeling like you are the only one struggling with this transition is one of the most damaging aspects of the current moment. You are not the only one. The data confirms it. Two-thirds of engineers report burnout. The expectation gap between leadership and engineering teams is well documented. Talking openly about these challenges, with your team, with your manager, with your broader network, is not complaining. It is professional honesty.</p><p>And fifth, remember that this profession has survived every prediction of its demise. COBOL was supposed to eliminate programmers. Expert systems were supposed to replace them. Fourth-generation languages, CASE tools, visual programming, no-code platforms, outsourcing. Every decade brings a new technology that promises to make software engineers obsolete, and every decade the demand for skilled engineers grows. AI will not be different. The tools change. The fundamentals endure.</p><h2>The Paradox We Need to Name</h2><p>AI made writing code easier and made being an engineer harder. Both of these things are true at the same time, and pretending that only the first one matters is how organizations lose their best people.</p><p>The engineers who are struggling right now are not struggling because they are bad at their jobs. They are struggling because their jobs changed underneath them while the industry celebrated the part that got easier and ignored the parts that got harder.</p><p>Expectations rose without announcement. Roles expanded without boundaries. Output demands increased without corresponding increases in support, training, or acknowledgment. And the engineers who raised concerns were told, implicitly or explicitly, that they just needed to adapt faster.</p><p>That is not how you build a sustainable engineering culture. That is how you build a burnout machine.</p><p>The industry needs to name this paradox honestly. AI is an incredible tool. It is also placing enormous new demands on the people using it. Both things can be true. Both things need to be addressed.</p><p>The organizations that get this right, that invest in their people alongside their tools, that acknowledge the human cost of rapid technological change while still pushing forward, those are the organizations that will attract and retain the best engineering talent in the years ahead.</p><p>The ones that do not will discover something that every technology cycle eventually teaches: tools do not build products. People do. And people have limits that no amount of AI can automate away.</p><p><em>If this resonated with you, I would love to hear your perspective.

      "content": "<p> is a software development practice where a human developer deliberately hand-writes source code. Practitioners of ape coding will typically author code by typing it on a computer keyboard, using specifically designed text editing software.</p><p>The term was popularized when  (coding performed by AI agents) became the dominant form of software development. Ape coding first appeared in programming communities as derogatory slang, referring to developers who were unable to program with agents. Despite the quick spread of agentic coding, institutional inertia, affordability, and limitations in human neuroplasticity were barriers to universal adoption of the new technology.</p><p>Critics of agentic coding reappropriated the term during a period of pushback against society’s growing reliance on AI. Effective use of the primitive AIs available at the time demanded a high level of expertise, which wasn’t evenly distributed in organizations. As a result, regressions in software products and disruptions in electronic services were frequent within the first stages of adoption.</p><p>Ironic usage of ape coding as a positive description became commonplace. It highlighted a more deliberate approach to building software: one defined by manual craftsmanship, requiring direct and continuous human involvement.</p><p>The central view of ape coding proponents was that software engineered by AIs did not match the reliability of software engineered by humans, and should not be deployed to production environments.</p><p>A recurring argument in favor of this perspective was based on comprehensibility. The volume of code AI developers could produce on demand was much larger than what human developers were able to produce and understand in a similar timeframe. Large and intricate codebases that would take an experienced human engineer months or years to grasp could be produced in hours. The escalating complexity of such codebases hindered efforts in software testing and quality assurance.</p><p>AI skepticism also played a part in the critique of agentic coding. There was widespread speculation on whether the nascent AIs of the period possessed true understanding of the tasks they were given. Furthermore, early AI implementations had deficiencies related to context length, memory, and continual learning, affecting quality and consistency of output.</p><p>Other defenses of ape coding reflected concerns about the impact of AI on labor markets. Despite the shortcomings of AI-written software, human developers were increasingly replaced by agents, with examples of high profile companies laying off large portions of their IT staff.</p><p>Tangentially, the responsibilities of human software engineers shifted when an essential aspect of their work (coding) was automated. The activities that remained were more similar to management, QA, and in some cases assistant roles. A common observation was that the human engineers who were still employed no longer enjoyed their line of work.</p><h3>Advocacy for human-written software</h3><p>Ape coding advocates argued that a return to human-written software would resolve the issues introduced by AI software development. Interest groups campaigned for restrictions on agentic coding, subsidies for AI-free software companies, quotas for human developers, and other initiatives in the same vein.</p><p>Although ape coding advocacy enjoyed a brief moment of popular support, none of these objectives were ever achieved.</p><p>Advances in AI quickly turned ape coding into an antiquated practice. Technical arguments for ape coding did not apply to newer generations of AI software engineers, and political arguments were seen as a form of neo-Luddism. Once virtually all software engineering was handed over to AIs, the concept of ape coding fell into obscurity.</p><h2>Revival and modern practice</h2><p>A resurgence of interest in ape coding has revived the practice among human hobbyists. Communities and subcommunities have formed where ape coders—as they came to be known—discuss computer science topics, including programming languages and software engineering.</p><p>Prominent ape coding clubs have attracted hundreds of thousands of members who exchange ideas and human-written programs. The clubs organize in-person as well as virtual gatherings where teams of ape coders collaborate on software projects.</p><p>The main value of modern ape coding appears to be recreational. Ape coders manifest high levels of engagement during coding sessions and report feelings of relaxation after succeeding in (self-imposed) coding challenges. Competitive ape coding is also popular, with top ranked ape coders being relatively well-known in their communities.</p><p>Aside from recreation, humans pursue ape coding for its educational value. Many have described ape coding as a way to gain a deeper understanding of the world around them. While an interest in ape coding was initially perceived as an unusual quirk, it is currently seen as a positive trait in human society, signaling curiosity.</p><p>Members of the software archaeology community published a series of articles on the human-written Linux kernel that had a deep impact in the larger ape coding world.</p><p>Considered by ape coders to be the ultimate work of human software engineers (in scale, complexity, and longevity), Linux inspired a wave of initiatives to build large scale software projects featuring thousands of human collaborators.</p><p>The most promising of these efforts is based on studies by the AI-written software interpretability community. The goal is to produce an entirely human-written compiler for the AI-designed programming language 𒀯. A fully compliant implementation is estimated to be many times as complex as the Linux kernel, but a prototype with limited scope is within human capabilities and is currently the primary focus of enthusiasts.</p><p>Results so far have been encouraging, as the latest version of h-𒀯 is able to build functional binaries for small programs. However, the initiative has recently suffered a setback as core contributors to its codebase left to work on a fork. The split was motivated by heated debates on whether C is the most suitable programming language for the project; dissenters expressed a desire to rewrite it in Rust.</p>",

      "content": "<p>: I updated the title to to clarify that this observation is specific to my environment. The original title may have implied a universal behavior, which isn’t the case. Thanks for the feedback!</p><p>; The C++ standard library sets up exception handling infrastructure early on, allocating memory for an “emergency pool” to be able to allocate memory for exceptions in case malloc ever runs out of memory.</p><p>I like to spend (some of) my time hacking and experimenting on custom memory allocators with my own malloc implementation(s). While unit tests are useful for correctness, the ultimate test is seeing how the allocator behaves in real-world programs. On Linux, overriding the default malloc is surprisingly simple: wrap the standard allocation functions (e.g., malloc, calloc, realloc, free, and utilities like malloc_usable_size), compile your implementation into a shared library, and use  to force programs to load it first. For example, you can test your allocator with a simple command like this:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"bash\"></code></pre></div><p>To better understand how programs allocate memory, I built a debug tool that logs the size of every allocation request to a file. You have to be careful when creating debug tools like this when implementing malloc to not internally use malloc to log output. Otherwise, you risk an infinite loop and a crash. To solve this I’m using a stack-allocated buffer together with low-level functions like creat, write and snprintf to safely capture the data.</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"bash\"></code></pre></div><p>While analyzing allocation patterns across different programs, I noticed something unusual: the very first allocation is always 73728 bytes (72 KB). Every program I tested exhibited this behavior, as confirmed by my debug logs:</p><p>To track down the first call to malloc, I use gdb to set a breakpoint into my own malloc function to inspect the backtrace.</p><p>: Setting a breakpoint on the “malloc” symbol will not only trigger for our own malloc, but also the dynamic linker’s (RTLD) internal malloc, so we have to be more specific. RTLD uses its own minimal malloc implementation for early memory allocation, before libc (or our own malloc) is loaded. I encourage you to take a look at glibc’s <a href=\"https://elixir.bootlin.com/glibc/glibc-2.43.9000/source/elf/dl-minimal-malloc.c\">elf/dl-minimal-malloc.c</a>, it is remarkably approachable.</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"bash\"></code></pre></div><p>The backtrace revealed that the first 72 KB allocation originated from libstdc++. While adding debug symbols helps narrow it down a bit, it’s hard to pinpoint the exact function responsible for the malloc call due to inlining. All we know is that the malloc call comes from something down the line from <code>__pool_alloc_base::_M_allocate_chunk</code>.</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"bash\"></code></pre></div><p>Identifying the exact caller took some time, but I narrowed it down by cross-referencing known functions in the assembly code with the libstdc++ source code. The investigation led me to <a href=\"https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/8758503918a91dacff4dbc7126eced21787fbfc9/libstdc%2B%2B-v3/libsupc%2B%2B/eh_alloc.cc#L235\">libstdc++-v3/libsupc++/eh_alloc.cc</a>, where “eh” stands for “exception handling”. This made sense because  is likely the first point where an exception could be thrown, so the exception-handling infrastructure must be initialized, which is presumably done lazily.</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"c++\"></code></pre></div><h2>Exception Handling Infrastructure (Emergency Pool)</h2><p>The 72 KB call to malloc we’re seeing is memory for the so called “emergency pool”, which is allocated in the constructor of the pool:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"c++\"></code></pre></div><p>Normally, exceptions are allocated directly via malloc, but if the malloc call fails, the exception is allocated from the emergency pool instead. This ensures that exceptions can still be thrown (to the extent of the size of the emergency pool) even when malloc fails, providing a last line of defense for error handling. The emergency pool is allocated lazily at program startup, since memory is more likely to be available then, which explains why we see this allocation so consistently.</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"c++\"></code></pre></div><h2>Emergency Pool Sizing. Why 72 KB?</h2><p>Looking in the source file there is a brief explanation of how the size of the emergency pool is calculated. Both the object size and the number of objects are based on the wordsize, so 8 bytes on a 64-bit system.</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"c++\"></code></pre></div><p>The object size (obj_size) and number of objects (obj_count) can be tuned manually via the  environment variable. We can empirically verify that the initial allocation is actually for the emergency pool by changing the number of objects in the pool. As expected, we see the initial allocation size go down when we change the number of objects:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"bash\"></code></pre></div><p>As a side note, the emergency pool can also be disabled (i.e., not allocated), by setting the number of objects to 0. Alternatively, you can opt-in to use a fixed-size static buffer for the emergency pool by configuring <code>--enable-libstdcxx-static-eh-pool</code> when building libstdc++.</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"txt\"></code></pre></div><p>However, in older Valgrind versions, this memory appeared as “still reachable” rather than properly freed. While “still reachable” memory isn’t technically a leak (the program still has references to it), it can be misleading. See post on <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45537965/how-does-a-c-library-implementation-allocate-memory-but-not-free-it-when-the-p\">Stack Overflow</a> detailing this behavior. Interestingly, this person sees a 71 KB allocation instead of 72 KB.</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"txt\"></code></pre></div><p>Many developers mistakenly interpret this behavior as a memory leak, leading to unnecessary confusion. To address this, newer Valgrind versions now explicitly free the emergency pool during cleanup, providing clearer reports. This is implemented through the mechanisms shown below, which were added specifically for tools like Valgrind:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"c++\"></code></pre></div><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"c++\"></code></pre></div><p>The memory allocated for the emergency pool explains why I’ve been able to consistently observe a 72 KB allocation when testing my custom allocator. Since I’ve implemented my custom allocator in C++, it inherently depends on libstdc++, which initializes the emergency pool on every program invocation. Interestingly, if I had written my allocator in C instead, which several popular malloc implementations are implemented in (<a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc\">mimalloc</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc\">jemalloc</a>), I would only see this initial allocation when testing C++ binaries, which explicitly link against libstdc++.</p><p>You might see a different allocation size (e.g., 71 KB instead of 72 KB), or no allocation at all. Factors like different versions of libstdc++, using libc++ instead, or even compiler flags can introduce variations. Still, in most cases, you’ll likely see memory for the emergency pool allocated early, perhaps with different sizes or behaviors depending on the environment.</p><p>As you quickly find out when working with memory allocation is that almost everything needs to allocate memory. From time immemorial with RTLD needing its own malloc since it hasn’t loaded libc yet, or for the emergency pool, which only uses malloc to allocate memory for its own pool allocator!</p><p>Digging through the code and piecing this together was rewarding and fun. I hope you enjoyed the journey as much as I did!</p>",

This means that  (lecture videos, assignments available on mugrade, etc) will be available to the online course  after the dates indicated in the schedule below.  By this, we mean that anyone will be able to watch lecture videos for the course, and submit (autograded) assignments (though not quizzes or midterms/final).  <a href=\"https://modernaicourse.org/enroll.html\">Enroll here</a> to receive emails on lectures and homeworks once they are available.  Note that information here about TAs, office hours, grading, prerequisites, etc, are for the CMU version, not the online offering.\n\n  <p>\n    This course provides an introduction to how modern AI systems work. By “modern AI”, we specifically mean the machine learning methods and large language models (LLMs) behind systems like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude.\n    <a href=\"https://modernaicourse.org/#\" onclick=\"toggleFootnote('fn1-box', this); return false;\">[Note]</a>\n    Despite their seemingly amazing generality, the basic techniques that underlie these AI models are surprisingly simple: a minimal LLM implementation leverages a fairly small set of machine learning methods and architectures, and can be written in a few hundred lines of code.\n  </p><p>\n    This course will guide you through the basic methods that will let you implement a basic AI chatbot. You will learn the basics of supervised machine learning, large language models, and post-training. By the end of the course you will be able to write the code that runs an open source LLM from scratch, as well as train these models based upon a corpus of data. The material we cover will include:\n  </p><ul><li>Supervised machine learning\n      <ul><li>Loss functions and optimization</li></ul></li><li>Large language models\n      <ul><li>Self attention and transformers</li></ul></li><li>Post-training\n      <ul><li>Alignment and instruction tuning</li><li>Reasoning models and reinforcement learning</li><li>Safety and security of AI systems</li></ul></li></ul><p>\n    The topics above are a general framing of what the course will cover.

The course will use basic methods from differential calculus, including computing derivatives. Some familiarity with linear algebra and probability is also beneficial, but these topics will be covered to the extent needed for the course.</li></ul><h2>Homework and Programming Assignments</h2><p>\n    A major component of the course will be the development of a minimal AI chatbot through a series of programming assignments.  Homeworks are submitted using <a href=\"https://mugrade.org\">mugrade</a> system (<a href=\"https://youtu.be/jrtb9y6xg6U\">tutorial video</a>). Some assignments build on previous ones, though for the in-class CMu version we'll distribute solutions to help you work through any errors that may have cropped up in previous assignments (for the online version, we'd suggest talking to others who were able to complete the assignment). In addition to the (main) programming aspect, some homeworks may contain  shorter written portion that works out some of the mathematical details behind the approach.\n  </p><p>\n    All homeworks are released as Colab notebooks, at the links below.  We are also releasing <a href=\"https://marimo.io/\">Marimo</a> notebook versions.  The mugrade version of the online assignment will be available two weeks after the release dates for the CMU course.\n  </p><p>\n    Each homework will be accompanied by an in-class (15 minute) quiz that assesses basic questions based upon the assignment. This will include replicating (at a high level) some of the code you wrote for the assignment, or answering conceptual questions about the assignment. All quizzes are closed book and closed notes.\n  </p><p>\n    In addition to the homework quizzes, there will be 3 in-person exams, two midterms and a final (during finals period). The midterms will focus on material only covered during that section of the courses, while the final will be cumulative (but with an emphasis on the last third of the course). All midterms and final and closed book and closed notes.\n  </p><p>\n    Lecture schedule is tentative and will be updated over the course of semester.  All materials will be available to the online course two weeks after the dates here.\n  </p><table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"4\"><tbody><tr></tr><tr><td>Intro to supervised learning (<a href=\"https://youtu.be/xIQkf7ZGQhM\">video</a>) </td></tr><tr><td>Linear algebra and PyTorch (<a href=\"https://youtu.be/tlbLH77GFLQ\">video</a>) </td></tr><tr></tr><tr><td>Loss functions and probability (<a href=\"https://youtu.be/v3-kn7ErcE4\">video</a>) </td></tr><tr><td>Optimization and gradient descent (<a href=\"https://youtu.be/zKSghsymDdc\">video</a>) </td></tr><tr><td>Putting it together: Training a linear model (<a href=\"https://youtu.be/DaZFJ1tKbAQ\">video</a>)/td&gt;</td></tr><tr><td>Neural networks models (<a href=\"https://youtu.be/9ukf-DPcqcQ\">video</a>) </td></tr><tr><td>Neural network implementation</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Midterm 1 - Supervised machine learning</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Sequence models: handling sets of inputs</td></tr><tr><td>Self attention and positional embeddings</td></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr><td>Efficient inference and key-value caching</td></tr><tr><td>Putting it together: your first LLM</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Midterm 2 - Large Language Models</strong></td></tr><tr></tr><tr><td>Alignment and instruction/chat tuning</td></tr><tr></tr><tr><td>Reinforcement learning basics</td></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr><td>The future: AGI and beyond</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>AI Policy for the AI course</h2><p>\n    Students are permitted to use AI assistants for all homework and programming assignments (especially as a reference for understanding any topics that seem confusing), but we strongly encourage you to complete your final submitted version of your assignment without AI. You cannot use any such assistants, or any external materials, during in-class evaluations (both the homework quizzes and the midterms and final).\n  </p><p>\n    The rationale behind this policy is a simple one: AI can be extremely helpful as a learning tool (and to be clear, as an actual implementation tool), but over-reliance on these systems can currently be a detriment to learning in many cases. You  need to learn how to code and do other tasks using AI tools, but turning in AI-generated solutions for the relatively short assignments we give you can (at least in our current experience) ultimately lead to substantially less understanding of the material. The choice is yours on assignments, but we believe that you will ultimately perform much better on the in-class quizzes and exams if you do work through your final submitted homework solutions yourself.\n  </p>",

That’s a  simplified explanation, but it’s a standard feature, and one that you might be most familiar with when manually sideloading Android updates, <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2026/02/26/how-to-install-the-android-17-beta-on-google-pixel/\" type=\"post\">such as the beta updates</a> Google releases for Pixels.</p><p>In One UI 8.5, though, Samsung is making a change to this.</p><p>As first noted by <a href=\"https://www.galaxyclub.nl/nieuws/samsung-update-verwijdert-handige-nerdy-functie-van-je-galaxy/\"></a>and <a href=\"https://t.me/techleakszone/9246\" type=\"link\">spotted by others </a>too, Samsung is removing several options from the Android recovery menu with the latest updates for Galaxy phones. Specifically, the update is removing:</p><ul><li>Apply update from SD card</li></ul><p>The only options remaining are “Reboot system now,” “Wipe data/factory reset,” and “Power off.”</p><p> can confirm that, at least on the current software build (January 2026 security patch), recovery tools are still fully in place on the Galaxy S26 Ultra, but that could change seeing as  reports seeing this change attached to February 2026 security updates.</p><p>This change might be permanent, too, as also notes that this update came with a notice saying that “you will not be able to downgrade to the old software due to changes in security policy.”</p><p>So why is this happening? </p><p>Put simply, we do not know. There has been speculation, though, that Samsung might be tightening security. Just today, a leaker <a href=\"https://x.com/wr3cckl3ss1/status/2027484909082694116\">showed </a>that Samsung is taking legal action to put a stop to One UI build leaks. It’d certainly be quite a big move for Samsung to just cut off sideloading via the recovery for eveyone in response, but it’s not necessarily out of the question either. </p><p>The Galaxy S26 series is available for pre-order now, with Samsung’s usual pre-order perks in full swing.

It comes with a C API so that it can be a replacement for existing uses of libxml2.</p><p>While I don't expect people to cut over to this new and unproven package, I do think there is something interesting to think about here in how coding agents like Claude Code can quickly iterate given a test suite. It's possible the legacy code problem that COBOL and other systems present will go away as rewrites become easier. The problem of ongoing maintenance to fix CVEs and update to later package versions becomes a larger percentage of software package management work.</p>",

An outspoken opponent of the U.S.-backed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, Khamenei was arrested several times.</p><p>He was surrounded by other Iranian activists, including Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who became Iran's first supreme leader following the country's Islamic Revolution in the late 1970s.</p><p>Khamenei survived an assassination attempt in 1981 that cost him the use of his right arm. He served as Iran's president before succeeding Khomeini as supreme leader in 1989.</p><p>Alex Vatanka, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington, D.C., says Khamenei was an unlikely candidate. Then a midlevel cleric, Khamenei lacked religious credentials, which left him feeling vulnerable, Vatanka says.</p><p>\"He knew himself. He didn't have the prestige, the gravitas to be … the successor to the founder of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini,\"he says. </p><div><div><div><div aria-label=\"Image caption\"><p>\n                In 2005, Ali Khamenei (center), newly elected President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (right), outgoing President Mohammad Khatami and former President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani attend Ahmadinejad's inaugural ceremony in Tehran.\n                <b aria-label=\"Image credit\">\n                    \n                    Atta Kenare/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                </b></p></div></div></div><div><div><p>In 2005, Ali Khamenei (center), newly elected President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (right), outgoing President Mohammad Khatami and former President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani attend Ahmadinejad's inaugural ceremony in Tehran.</p></div></div></div><p>\"He spent the first few years in power being very nervous,\" says Vatanka. \"He really literally felt that somebody is going to, you know, take him down from the position of power.\"</p><p>But Khamenei was cunning and able to outwit other senior political figures in the Islamic Republic, according to Ali Vaez, director of the Iran Project at the International Crisis Group. He says that with the help of the formidable Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Khamenei built up his power base to become the longest-serving leader in the Middle East.</p><p>\"Ayatollah Khamenei was a man with strategic patience and was able to calculate a few steps ahead,\" he says.&nbsp;\"That's why I think he managed — on the back of the Revolutionary Guards — to increasingly appropriate all the levers of power in his hands and sideline everyone else.\"</p><p>Khamenei's close ties to the Revolutionary Guards allowed Iran's military to develop a vast commercial empire in control of many parts of the economy, while ordinary Iranians struggled to get by.</p><div><div><div><div aria-label=\"Image caption\"><p>\n                Ali Khamenei (right) speaks to members of the armed forces of the Islamic Republic during the Iran-Iraq War on Oct. 4, 1981.\n                </p></div></div></div><div><div><p>Ali Khamenei (right) speaks to members of the armed forces of the Islamic Republic during the Iran-Iraq War on Oct. 4, 1981.</p></div></div></div><p>Vaez says Khamenei also began to build up Iran's defensive policies, such as developing proxies like Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in the Gaza Strip to deter a direct attack on Iranian soil.</p><p>\"And then also becoming self-reliant in developing a viable conventional deterrence, which took the form of Iran's ballistic missile program,\" Vaez says.</p><p>As supreme leader, Khamenei also had the final word on anything to do with Iran's nuclear program.</p><p>Over time, Khamenei increasingly injected himself into politics. Such was the case in 2009, when he intervened in the presidential election to ensure that his favored candidate, the controversial conservative Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, won office. </p><p>Iranians took to the streets to protest what was widely seen as a fraudulent election.

Iran's economy was crumbling, due in large part to stringent Western sanctions, fueling more unrest.</p><p>In 2013, Khamenei agreed to secret negotiations with the U.S. about Iran's nuclear program, which eventually led to the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action nuclear agreement. Vaez says Khamenei deeply distrusted the U.S. and was skeptical about the deal.</p><p>\"His argument has always been that the U.S. is always looking for pretexts, for putting pressure on Iran,\" he says. \"And if Iran concedes on the nuclear issue, then the U.S. would put pressure on Iran because of its missiles program or because of human rights violations or because of its regional policies.\"</p><p>President Trump's withdrawal from the nuclear deal during his first term in office gave some credence to Khamenei's cynicism. Analysts say Iran increased its nuclear enrichment after that to a point where it was close to being able to build a bomb.</p><p>In early 2025, when Trump reached out to Iran about a new deal, Khamenei dragged out negotiations until they began in mid-April.</p><p>But time ran out. In June,Israel made good on its threat to neutralize Iran's nuclear program, launching strikes on key facilities and killing scientists and generals. Iran retaliated, and the two sides exchanged several days of missile strikes.</p><p>On June 21, 2025, the U.S. <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/06/21/nx-s1-5441127/iran-us-strike-nuclear-trump\" target=\"_blank\">launched major airstrikes</a> on three of Iran's nuclear enrichment sites. Trump said the facilities had been \"completely and totally obliterated,\" although there was debate among the White House and nuclear experts as to how serious Iran's nuclear program had been set back.</p><p>Vakil, of Chatham House, says Khamenei underestimated what Israel and the U.S. would do.</p><p>\"I think that Khamenei always assumed that he could play for time, and what he really didn't understand is that the world around Iran had very much changed,\" she says. \"The world had tired of Khamenei and Iranian foot-dragging and antics …&nbsp;and so that was a miscalculation.\"</p><p>But it was Iran's use of proxy militias across the region that eventually led to Khamenei's downfall. </p><p>When Hamas — the Palestinian Islamist group backed by Iran — attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing nearly 1,200 people and kidnapping 251 others, it triggered a cascade of events that ultimately led to Israel's attack on Iran.&nbsp;</p><p>The day after the 2023 Hamas-led attack, Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon started firing rockets into Israel, triggering a conflict that led to the Shia militia's top brass being decimated — including top leader <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/09/28/g-s1-25302/who-was-hassan-nasrallah-the-hezbollah-leader-killed-by-israel\" target=\"_blank\">Hassan Nasrallah</a>.</p><p>Israel and Iran traded direct airstrikes for the first time in 2024 as part of that conflict.</p><p>Israel's bombing of Iranian weapons shipments in Syria also helped weaken the regime of Syria's then-dictator, Bashar al-Assad, an important ally of Iran. Assad fell in December 2024 and fled to Russia in early January 2025.</p><p>By the time Khamenei died, his legacy was in tatters. Israel had hobbled two key proxies, Hamas and Hezbollah, and had wiped out Iran's air defenses. With U.S. help, it left Iran's nuclear program in shambles.</p><p>What remains is a robust ballistic missile program, the brainchild of Khamenei. It's unclear who will replace him to lead a now weakened and vulnerable Iran.</p>",

      "content": "<p>MinIO’s open-source repo has been officially archived. No more maintenance.\nEnd of an era — but open source doesn’t die that easily.</p><p>I created a MinIO fork, restored the admin console, rebuilt the binary distribution pipeline, and brought it back to life.</p><p>If you’re running MinIO, swap  for .\nEverything else stays the same. (<a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-62506\" target=\"_blank\">CVE fixed</a>, and the console GUI is back)</p><p>On December 3, 2025, MinIO announced “maintenance mode” on GitHub. I wrote about it in <a href=\"https://blog.vonng.com/en/db/minio-is-dead/\">MinIO Is Dead</a>.</p><p>On February 12, 2026, MinIO updated the repo status from “maintenance mode” to , then officially archived the repository.\nRead-only. No PRs, no issues, no contributions accepted. A project with 60k stars and over a billion Docker pulls became a digital tombstone.</p><p>If December was the clinical death, this February commit was the death certificate.</p><p>Percona founder Peter Zaitsev also raised concerns about open-source infrastructure sustainability on LinkedIn.\nThe consensus in the international community is clear:</p><p>Looking back at the timeline over the past years, this wasn’t a sudden death. It was a slow, deliberate wind-down:</p><table><tbody><tr></tr><tr><td>Legal action against Nutanix</td></tr><tr><td>Legal action against Weka</td></tr><tr><td>Admin console removed from CE</td></tr><tr><td>Binary/Docker distribution stopped</td></tr><tr><td>Maintenance mode announced</td></tr><tr><td>Repo archived, no longer maintained</td></tr></tbody></table><p>A company that raised $126M at a billion-dollar valuation spent five years methodically dismantling the open-source ecosystem it built.</p><p>Normally this is where the story ends — a collective sigh, and everyone moves on.</p><p>But I want to tell a different story. <strong>Not an obituary — a resurrection.</strong></p><p>MinIO Inc. can archive a repo, but they can’t archive the rights that the <a href=\"https://github.com/minio/minio/blob/master/LICENSE\" target=\"_blank\">AGPL</a> grants to the community.</p><p>Ironically, AGPL was MinIO’s own choice. They switched from Apache 2.0 to AGPL to use it as leverage in their disputes with Nutanix and Weka\n— keeping the “open source” label while adding enforcement teeth. But open-source licenses cut both ways — the same license now guarantees the community’s right to fork.</p><p>Once code is released under AGPL, the license is irrevocable. You can set a repo to read-only, but you can’t claw back a granted license.\nThat’s the beauty of open-source licensing by design: <strong>a company can abandon a project, but it can’t take the code with it.</strong></p><p>So — <strong>MinIO is dead, but MinIO can live again.</strong></p><p>That said, forking is the easy part. Anyone can click the Fork button.\nThe real question isn’t “can we fork it” but <strong>“can someone actually maintain it as a production component?”</strong></p><p>I didn’t set out to take this on. But after MinIO entered maintenance mode,\nI waited a couple of weeks for someone in the community to step up.</p><p>But I didn’t find one. So I did it myself.</p><p>Some background: I maintain <a href=\"https://pigsty.io\" target=\"_blank\">Pigsty</a> — a batteries-included PostgreSQL distribution with <a href=\"https://pgext.cloud\" target=\"_blank\">460+ extensions</a>,\ncross-built for <a href=\"https://pgext.cloud/os\" target=\"_blank\">14 Linux distros</a>. I also maintain build pipelines for <a href=\"https://pgext.cloud/list/\" target=\"_blank\">290</a> PG extensions, several <a href=\"https://pigsty.io/docs/pgsql/kernel/\" target=\"_blank\">PG forks</a>,\nand dozens of <a href=\"https://pigsty.io/docs/repo/infra/list/\" target=\"_blank\">Go Projects</a> (Victoria, Prometheus, etc.) packaging across all major platforms. Adding one more to the pipeline was a piece of cake.</p><p>I’m not new to MinIO either. Back in 2018, we ran an internal MinIO fork at TanTan (back when it was still Apache 2.0),\nmanaging ~25 PB of data — one of the earliest and largest MinIO deployments in China at the time.</p><p>We use MinIO ourselves, so keeping the supply chain alive was not optional — \nAs early as December 2025, when MinIO announced maintenance mode, I had already built <a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-62506\" target=\"_blank\">CVE-patched</a> binaries and switched to them.</p><p>As of today, three things.</p><h3>1. Restored the Admin Console</h3><p>This was the change that frustrated the community the most.</p><p>In May 2025, MinIO stripped the full admin console from the community edition, leaving behind a bare-bones object browser.\nUser management, bucket policies, access control, lifecycle management — all gone overnight. Want them back? Pay for the enterprise edition. (~$100,000)</p><p>The ironic part: this didn’t even require reverse engineering.\nYou just revert the  submodule to the previous version.\nThey swapped a dependency version to replace the full console with a stripped-down one. The code was always there.</p><h3>2. Rebuilt Binary Distribution</h3><p>In October 2025, MinIO stopped distributing pre-built binaries and Docker images,\nleaving only source code. “Use  to build it yourself” — that was their answer.</p><p>For the vast majority of users, the value of open-source software isn’t just a copy of the source — <strong>supply chain stability is what matters.</strong>\nYou need a stable artifact you can put in a Dockerfile, an Ansible playbook, or a CI/CD pipeline — not a requirement to install a Go compiler before every deployment.</p><p><strong>We rebuilt the distribution:</strong></p><dl><dd><a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/r/pgsty/minio\" target=\"_blank\"></a> is live on Docker Hub.  and you’re good.</dd><dd>Built for major Linux distributions, matching the original package specs.</dd><dd>Fully automated build workflows on GitHub, ensuring ongoing supply chain stability.</dd></dl><p>If you’re using Docker, just swap  for .</p><p>For native Linux installs, grab RPM/DEB packages from the <a href=\"https://github.com/pgsty/minio/releases/tag/RELEASE.2026-02-14T12-00-00Z\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub Release</a> page.\nYou can also use <a href=\"https://github.com/pgsty/pig\" target=\"_blank\">pig</a> (the PG extension package manager) for easy installation,\nor configure the <a href=\"https://pigsty.io/docs/repo/infra\" target=\"_blank\"></a> APT/DNF repo to install from it:</p><div><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"bash\"></code></pre></div></div><h3>3. Restored Community Edition Docs</h3><p>MinIO’s official documentation was also at risk — links had started redirecting to their commercial product, <a href=\"https://docs.min.io/\" target=\"_blank\">AIStor</a>.</p><p>We forked <a href=\"https://github.com/pgsty/minio-docs\" target=\"_blank\"></a>, fixed broken links, restored removed console documentation, and deployed it <a href=\"https://silo.pigsty.io\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p><p>The docs use the same CC Attribution 4.0 license as the original, with necessary maintenance.</p><p>Some things worth stating up front to set expectations.</p><h3>No New Features — Just Supply Chain Continuity</h3><p>MinIO as an S3-compatible object store is already feature-complete. It’s a .\nIt doesn’t need more bells and whistles — it needs a stable, reliable, continuously available build.\n(I already have PostgreSQL for these, so I don’t need something like S3 table or S3 vector. A stable S3 core is all I need)</p><p>What we’re doing: <strong>making sure you can get a working, complete MinIO binary</strong>, <strong>with the admin console included and CVE fixed.</strong>\nRPM, DEB, Docker images — built automatically via CI/CD, drop-in compatible with your existing minio.\nWe keep the existing minio naming and behavior where legally and technically feasible.</p><h3>This Is a Production Build, Not an Archive</h3><p>We run these builds ourselves and have been dogfooding them in production for three months.\nIf something breaks, we detect it early and patch it quickly.</p><p>I build this primarily for Pigsty and our own usage, but I hope it helps others too.</p><h3>I’m willing to Track CVEs and Fix Bugs</h3><p>If you run into issues, feel free to report them at <a href=\"https://github.com/orgs/pgsty/discussions\" target=\"_blank\"></a>.\nI’ll do my best to fix these — but please don’t treat this as a commercial SLA.</p><p>Given that AI coding tools have made bug fixing dramatically cheaper,\nand that we’re explicitly <strong>not adding any new features</strong>,\nI believe the maintenance workload is manageable.\n(how often do you see one?)</p><h3>Trademark Is Tricky, But We’ll Cross That Bridge When We Come to It</h3><blockquote><p>Trademark Notice: MinIO® is a registered trademark of MinIO, Inc.\nThis project (pgsty/minio) is an independently maintained community fork under the AGPL license.\nIt has no affiliation with, endorsement by, or connection to MinIO, Inc.\nUse of “MinIO” in this post refers solely to the open-source software project itself and implies no commercial association.</p></blockquote><p>AGPLv3 gives us clear rights to fork and distribute, but trademark law is a separate domain.\nWe’ve marked this clearly everywhere as an independent community-maintained build.</p><p>If MinIO Inc. raises trademark concerns, we’ll cooperate and rename (probably something like  or ).\nUntil then, we think descriptive use of the original name in an AGPL fork is reasonable — and renaming all the  references doesn’t serve users.</p><p>You might ask: can one person really maintain this?</p><p>It’s 2026. Things are different now.</p><p>With tools like Claude Code &amp; Codex, the cost of locating and fixing bugs in a complex Go project has dropped by more than an order of magnitude.\nWhat used to require a dedicated team to maintain a complex infra project can now be handled by one experienced engineer with an AI copilot.</p><p>Maintaining a MinIO build without adding new features is a manageable task.\nThe key requirement is testing and validation. and we already have that scenario,\nwhich lets us verify compatibility, reliability, and security in practice.</p><p>Consider: Elon cut X/Twitter’s engineering team down to ~30 people and the system still runs.\nMaintaining a MinIO fork without new features is considerably less daunting</p><p>MinIO Inc. can archive a GitHub repo, but they can’t archive the demand behind 60k stars,\nor the dependency graph behind a billion Docker pulls. That demand doesn’t disappear — it just finds its way out.</p><p>\nA company can abandon a project, but open-source licenses are specifically designed so the code can’t die.</p><p>Fork is the most powerful spell in open source. When a company decides to shut the door, the community only needs two words:</p>",

      "content": "<p><strong>Introduction: Fascism at the End of Industrial Civilization</strong></p><p>This essay argues that the United States is drifting toward a distinctly twenty‑first‑century form of fascism driven not by mass parties in brownshirts, but by an oligarchic techno‑feudal elite. Neoliberal capitalism has hollowed out democratic institutions and concentrated power in a transnational “authoritarian international” of billionaires, security chiefs, and political fixers who monetize state power while shielding one another from accountability. At the same time, Big Tech platforms have become neo‑feudal estates that extract rent from our data and behavior, weaponize disinformation, and provide the surveillance backbone of an emerging global police state.</p><p>Drawing on the work of Robert Reich, William I. Robinson, Yanis Varoufakis, and others, alongside historian Heather Cox Richardson’s detailed account of Trump‑era patronage, whistleblower suppression, and DHS/ICE mega‑detention plans, the essay contends that America is rapidly constructing a system of concentration‑camp infrastructure and paramilitary policing designed to manage “surplus” populations and political dissent. Elite impunity, entrenched through national‑security exceptionalism, legal immunities, and revolving‑door careers, means that those directing lawless violence face virtually no consequences. Elections still happen, courts still sit, newspapers still publish, but substantive power is increasingly exercised by unelected oligarchs, tech lords, and security bureaucracies.</p><p>This authoritarian drift cannot be separated from the broader crisis of industrial civilization. Ecological overshoot, climate chaos, resource constraints, and structural economic stagnation have undermined the promise of endless growth on which liberal democracy once rested. Rather than using the remnants of industrial wealth to democratize a just transition, ruling elites are hardening borders, expanding carceral infrastructure, and building a security regime to contain “surplus” humanity in a world of shrinking energy and material throughput. America’s oligarchic techno‑feudal fascism is thus not an anomaly, but one plausible endgame of industrial civilization: a stratified order of gated enclaves above and camps and precarity below, designed to preserve elite power as the old industrial world comes apart.</p><p><strong>I. From liberal promise to oligarchic capture</strong></p><p>The American republic was founded on a promise that power would be divided, constrained, and answerable: a written constitution, separated branches, periodic elections, and a Bill of Rights that set bright lines even the sovereign could not cross. That promise was always compromised by slavery, settler colonialism, and gendered exclusion, but it retained real, if uneven, force as a normative horizon. What has shifted over the past half‑century is not simply the familiar gap between creed and practice, but the underlying structure of the system itself: the center of gravity has moved from public institutions toward a private oligarchy whose wealth and leverage allow it to function as a parallel sovereign.</p><p>The neoliberal turn of the 1970s and 1980s marked the decisive inflection point. Deregulation, financial liberalization, the crushing of organized labor, and the privatization of public goods redistributed power and income upward on a historic scale. Trade liberalization and capital mobility allowed corporations and investors to pit governments and workers against one another, extracting subsidies and tax concessions under the permanent threat of capital flight. At the same time, Supreme Court decisions eroded limits on political spending, redefining “speech” as something that could be purchased in unlimited quantities by those with the means.</p><p>The result, as Robert Reich notes, has been the consolidation of an American oligarchy that “paved the road to fascism” by ensuring that public policy reflects donor preferences far more consistently than popular majorities. In issue after issue, such as taxation, labor law, healthcare, and environmental regulation, there is a clear skew: the wealthy get what they want more often than not, while broadly popular but redistributive policies routinely die in committee or are gutted beyond recognition. This is not a conspiracy in the melodramatic sense; it is how the wiring of the system now works.</p><p>William Robinson’s analysis of “twenty‑first‑century fascism” sharpens the point. Global capitalism in its current form generates chronic crises: overproduction, under‑consumption, ecological breakdown, and a growing population that capital cannot profitably employ. Under such conditions, democratic politics becomes dangerous for elites, because electorates might choose structural reforms such as wealth taxes, public ownership, strong unions, and Green New Deal‑style transitions that would curb profits. Faced with this prospect, segments of transnational capital begin to see authoritarian solutions as rational: better to hollow out democracy, harden borders, and construct a global police state than to accept serious redistribution.</p><p>American politics in the early twenty‑first century fits this pattern with unsettling precision. A decaying infrastructure, stagnant wages, ballooning personal debt, militarized policing, and permanent war have produced widespread disillusionment. As faith in institutions erodes, public life is flooded with resentment and nihilism that can be redirected against scapegoats (immigrants, racial minorities, feminists, and queer and trans people) rather than against the oligarchic‑power‑complex that profits from the decay. It is in this vacuum that a figure like Donald Trump thrives: a billionaire demagogue able to channel anger away from the class that actually governs and toward those even more marginalized.</p><p>The decisive shift from plutocratic dysfunction to fascist danger occurs when oligarchs cease to see constitutional democracy as even instrumentally useful and instead invest in movements openly committed to minority rule. Koch‑style networks, Mercer‑funded operations, and Silicon Valley donors willing to underwrite hard‑right projects are not supporting democracy‑enhancing reforms; they are building the infrastructure for authoritarianism, from voter suppression to ideological media to data‑driven propaganda. The system that emerges is hybrid: elections still occur, courts still sit, newspapers still publish, but substantive power is increasingly concentrated in unelected hands.</p><p><strong>II. The “authoritarian international” and the shadow world of deals</strong></p><p>Historian Heather Cox Richardson’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajZudGu4exA\">recent analysis</a> captures a formation that much mainstream commentary still struggles to name: a transnational <strong>“authoritarian international”</strong> in which oligarchs, political operatives, royal families, security chiefs, and organized criminals cooperate to monetize state power while protecting one another from scrutiny. This is not a formal alliance; it is an overlapping ecology of relationships, exclusive vacations, investment vehicles, shell companies, foundations, and intelligence ties, through which information, favors, and money flow.</p><p>The key is that this network is structurally post‑ideological. As Robert Mueller warned in his 2011 description of an emerging “iron triangle” of politicians, businesspeople, and criminals, these actors are not primarily concerned with religion, nationality, or traditional ideology. They will work across confessional and national lines so long as the deals are lucrative and risk is manageably socialized onto others. Saudi royals invest alongside Western hedge funds; Russian oligarchs launder money through London property and American private equity; Israeli and Emirati firms collaborate with U.S. tech companies on surveillance products that are then sold worldwide.</p><p>Within this milieu, the formal distinction between public office and private interest blurs. Richardson’s analysis of Donald Trump’s abrupt reversal on the Gordie Howe International Bridge after a complaint by a billionaire competitor with ties to Jeffrey Epstein—reads less like the exercise of public policy judgment and more like feudal patronage: the sovereign intervenes to protect a favored lord’s toll road. Tiny shifts in regulatory posture or federal support can move billions of dollars; for those accustomed to having the president’s ear, such interventions are simply part of doing business.</p><p>The same logic governs foreign policy. The Trump‑Kushner axis exemplifies this fusion of public and private. When a whistleblower alleges that the Director of National Intelligence suppressed an intercept involving foreign officials discussing Jared Kushner and sensitive topics like Iran, and when the complaint is then choked off with aggressive redaction and executive privilege, we see <strong>the machinery of secrecy misused not to protect the national interest but to shield a member of the family‑cum‑business empire at the center of power</strong>. It is as if the state has become a family office with nuclear weapons.</p><p>Josh Marshall’s phrase <strong>“authoritarian international”</strong> is apt because it names both the class composition and the political function of this network. The same names recur across far‑right projects: donors and strategists who back nationalist parties in Europe, ultras in Latin America, Modi’s BJP in India, and the MAGA movement in the United States. Their interests are not identical, but they overlap around a shared agenda: weakening labor and environmental protections, undermining independent media and courts, militarizing borders, and securing immunity for themselves and their peers.</p><p>This world is lubricated by blackmail and mutually assured destruction. As Richardson notes, players often seem to hold compromising material on one another, whether in the form of documented sexual abuse, financial crime, or war crimes. This shared vulnerability paradoxically stabilizes the network: as long as everyone has something on everyone else, defection is dangerous, and a predatory equilibrium holds. From the standpoint of democratic publics, however, this stability is catastrophic, because it means that scandal—once a mechanism for enforcing norms—loses much of its power. When “everyone is dirty,” no one can be clean enough to prosecute the others without risking exposure.</p><p><strong>III. Techno‑feudal aristocracy and the colonization of everyday life</strong></p><p>Layered atop this transnational oligarchy is the digital order that Varoufakis and others describe as techno‑feudalism: a regime in which a handful of platforms function like neo‑feudal estates, extracting rent from their “serfs” (users, gig workers, content creators) rather than competing in open markets. This shift is more than metaphor. In classical capitalism, firms profited primarily by producing goods or services and selling them on markets where competitors could, in principle, undercut them. In the platform order, gatekeepers profit by controlling access to the marketplace itself, imposing opaque terms on those who must use their infrastructure to communicate, work, or even find housing.</p><p>This can be seen across sectors:</p><ul><li><p>Social media platforms own the digital public square. They monetize attention by selling advertisers access to finely sliced demographic and psychographic segments, while their recommendation algorithms optimize for engagement, often by privileging outrage and fear.</p></li><li><p>Ride‑hailing and delivery apps control the interface between customers and labor, setting prices unilaterally and disciplining workers through ratings, algorithmic management, and the ever‑present threat of “deactivation.”</p></li><li><p>Cloud providers and app stores gatekeep access to the basic infrastructure upon which countless smaller firms depend, taking a cut of transactions and reserving the right to change terms or remove competitors from the ecosystem entirely.</p></li></ul><p>In each case, the platform is less a company among companies and more a landlord among tenants, collecting tolls for the right to exist within its domain. Users produce the very capital stock, data, content, behavioral profiles, that platforms own and monetize, yet they have little say over how this material is used or how the digital environment is structured. The asymmetry of power is profound: the lords can alter the code of the world; the serfs can, at best, adjust their behavior to avoid algorithmic invisibility or sanction.</p><p>For authoritarian politics, this structure is a gift. First, platforms have become the primary vectors of disinformation and propaganda. Cambridge Analytica’s work for Trump in 2016, funded by billionaires like the Mercers, was an early prototype: harvest data, micro‑target individuals with tailored&nbsp;messaging, and flood their feeds with narratives designed to activate fear and resentment. Since then, the techniques have grown more sophisticated, and far‑right movements worldwide have learned to weaponize meme culture, conspiracy theories, and “shitposting” as recruitment tools.</p><p>Second, the same infrastructures that enable targeted advertising enable granular surveillance. Location data, social graphs, search histories, and facial‑recognition databases provide an unprecedented toolkit for monitoring and disciplining populations. In the hands of a regime sliding toward fascism, these tools can be turned against dissidents with terrifying efficiency: geofencing protests to identify attendees, scraping social media to build dossiers, using AI to flag “pre‑criminal” behavior. The emerging “global police state” that Robinson describes depends heavily on such techno‑feudal capacities.</p><p>Third, the digital order corrodes the very preconditions for democratic deliberation. Information overload, filter bubbles, and algorithmic amplification of sensational content produce a public sphere saturated with noise. Under these conditions, truth becomes just another aesthetic, and the distinction between fact and fiction collapses into vibes. This is the post‑modern nihilism you name: a sense that nothing is stable enough to believe in, that everything is spin. Fascist movements do not seek to resolve this condition; they weaponize it, insisting that only the Leader and his trusted media tell the real truth, while everything else is a hostile lie.</p><p>Finally, the techno‑feudal aristocracy’s material interests align with authoritarianism. Privacy regulations, antitrust enforcement, data localization rules, and strong labor rights all threaten platform profits. Democratic movements that demand such reforms are therefore adversaries. Conversely, strongman leaders who promise deregulation, tax breaks, and law‑and‑order crackdowns, even if they occasionally threaten specific firms, are often acceptable partners. The result is a convergence: oligarchs of data and oligarchs of oil, real estate, and finance finding common cause in an order that disciplines the many and exempts the few.</p><p><strong>IV. Elite impunity and the machinery of lawlessness</strong></p><p>Authoritarianism is not only about who holds power; it is about who is answerable for wrongdoing. A system where elites can violate laws with impunity while ordinary people are punished harshly for minor infractions is already halfway to fascism, whatever labels it wears. The United States has, over recent decades, constructed precisely such a system.</p><p>The Arab Center’s “Machinery of Impunity” report details how, in areas ranging from mass surveillance to foreign wars to domestic policing, senior officials who authorize illegal acts almost never face criminal consequences. Edward Snowden’s revelations exposed systemic violations of privacy and civil liberties, yet it was the whistleblower who faced prosecution and exile, not the architects of the programs. Torture during the “war on terror” was acknowledged, even documented in official reports, but those who designed and approved the torture regime kept their law licenses, academic posts, and media gigs. Lethal strikes on small boats in the Caribbean and Pacific, justified by secret intelligence and shielded by classified legal opinions, have killed dozens with no public evidence that the targets posed imminent threats.</p><p>This pattern is not an aberration but a feature. As a Penn State law review article <a href=\"https://insight.dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1144&amp;context=jlia\">notes</a>, the U.S. legal system builds in multiple layers of protection for high officials: sovereign immunity, state secrets privilege, narrow standing rules, and prosecutorial discretion all combine to make it extraordinarily difficult to hold the powerful to account. Violations of the Hatch Act, campaign‑finance laws, or ethics rules are often treated as technicalities, and when reports do document unlawful behavior, as in the case of Mike Pompeo’s partisan abuse of his diplomatic office, there are “no consequences” beyond mild censure. Jamelle Bouie’s recent video essay for the New York Times drives the point home: America is “bad at accountability” because institutions have been designed and interpreted to favor elite impunity.</p><p>Richardson shows how this culture functions inside the national‑security state. A whistleblower complaint alleging that the Director of National Intelligence suppressed an intelligence intercept involving Jared Kushner and foreign officials was not allowed to run its course. Instead, it was bottled up, then transmitted to congressional overseers in a highly redacted form, with executive privilege invoked to shield the president’s involvement. The same mechanisms that insulate covert operations abroad from democratic oversight are deployed to protect domestic political allies from scrutiny.</p><p>Immigration enforcement offers another window. The Arab Center notes that ICE raids, family separation, and other abuses “escalated under the current Trump administration into highly visible kidnappings, abuse, and deportations” with little accountability for senior officials. The National Immigrant Justice Center documents a detention system where 90 percent of detainees are held in for‑profit facilities, where medical neglect, punitive solitary confinement, and preventable deaths are common, yet contracts are renewed and expanded. A culture of impunity allows agents and managers to treat rights violations not as career‑ending scandals but as acceptable collateral damage.</p><p>Latin American scholars of impunity warn that such selective enforcement produces a “quiet crisis of accountability” in which the rule of law is hollowed out from within. Laws remain on the books, but their application is skewed: harsh on the poor and marginalized, permissive toward the powerful. Over time, this normalizes the idea that some people are above the law, while others exist primarily as objects of control. When a polity internalizes this hierarchy, fascism no longer needs to arrive in jackboots; it is already present in the daily operations of the justice system.</p><p>The danger, as the Arab Center emphasizes, is that the costs of impunity “come home to roost.” Powers originally justified as necessary to fight terrorism or foreign enemies migrate back into domestic politics. Surveillance tools built for foreign intelligence monitoring are turned on activists and journalists; militarized police tactics perfected in occupied territories are imported into American streets. A population taught to accept lawless violence against outsiders (migrants, foreigners, enemy populations) is gradually conditioned to accept similar violence against internal opponents.</p><p><strong>V. Concentration camps, paramilitary policing, and ritualized predatory violence</strong></p><p>In this context of oligarchic capture, techno‑feudal control, and elite impunity, the rapid expansion of detention infrastructure and the deployment of paramilitary “federal agents” across the interior United States are not aberrations; they are central pillars of an emergent fascist order.</p><p>Richardson’s insistence on calling these facilities concentration camps is analytically exact. A concentration camp, in the historical sense, is not necessarily a death camp; it is a place where a state concentrates populations it considers threats or burdens, subjecting them to confinement, disease, abuse, and often death through neglect rather than industrialized extermination. By that definition, the sprawling network of ICE and Border Patrol detention centers, where people are warehoused for months to years, often in horrific conditions, qualifies.</p><p>New reporting details how this system is poised to scale up dramatically. An internal ICE memo, recently surfaced, outlines a $38 billion plan for a “new detention center model” that would, in one year, create capacity for roughly 92,600 people by purchasing eight “mega centers,” 16 processing centers, and 10 additional facilities. The largest of these warehouses would hold between 7,000 and 10,000 people each for average stays of about 60 days, more than double the size of the largest current federal prison. Separate reporting has mapped at least 23 industrial warehouses being surveyed for conversion into mass detention camps, with leases already secured at several sites.</p><p>Investigations by Amnesty International and others into prototype facilities have found detainees shackled in overcrowded cages, underfed, forced to use open‑air toilets that flood, and routinely denied medical care. Sexual assault and extortion by guards, negligent deaths, and at least one homicide have been documented. These are not accidents; they are predictable outcomes of a profit‑driven system where private contractors are paid per bed and oversight is weak, and of a political culture that dehumanizes migrants as “invaders” or “animals.”</p><p>Richardson highlights another crucial dimension: the way DHS has been retooled to project this violence into the interior as a form of political terror. Agents from ICE and Border Patrol, subdivisions of a relatively new department lacking the institutional restraints of the military, have been deployed in cities far from any border, often in unmarked vehicles, wearing masks and lacking visible identification. Secret legal memos under Trump gutted the traditional requirement of a judicial warrant for entering homes, replacing it with internal sign‑off by another DHS official, a direct violation of the Fourth Amendment’s protection against unreasonable searches and seizures.</p><p>This matters both instrumentally and symbolically. Instrumentally, it enables efficient mass raids and “snatch and grab” operations that bypass local law‑enforcement norms and judicial oversight. Symbolically, it communicates that the state reserves the right to operate as a lawless force, unconstrained by the very constitution it claims to defend. When masked, unidentified agents can seize people off the streets, shove them into unmarked vans, and deposit them in processing centers without due process, the aesthetic of fascism…thugs in the night…becomes reality.</p><p>Richardson rightly connects this to the post‑Reconstruction South, where paramilitary groups like the Ku Klux Klan, often tolerated or quietly aided by local officials, used terror to destroy a biracial democracy that had briefly flourished. Today’s difference is that communications technology allows rapid mobilization of witnesses and counter‑protesters: people can rush to the scene when agents arrive, document abuses on smartphones, and coordinate legal support. Yet even this can be folded into the logic of spectacle. The images of militarized agents confronting crowds under the glow of streetlights and police floodlamps serve as warnings: this is what happens when you resist.</p><p>The planned network of processing centers and mega‑warehouses adds another layer of menace. As Richardson points out, if the stated goal is deportation, there is no clear need for facilities capable of imprisoning tens of thousands for months. Part of the answer is coercive leverage: detained people are easier to pressure into abandoning asylum claims and accepting removal, especially when they are told, day after day, that they could walk free if they “just sign.” But the architecture also anticipates a future in which new categories of internal enemies, protesters, “Antifa,” “domestic extremists,” can be funneled into the same carceral estate once migrant flows diminish or political needs change.</p><p>Economically, the camps generate their own constituency. ICE and DHS tout job creation numbers to local officials, promising hundreds of stable, often union‑free positions in communities hollowed out by deindustrialization. Private prison firms and construction companies see lucrative contracts; investors see secure returns backed by federal guarantees. A web of stakeholders thus becomes materially invested in the continuation and expansion of mass detention. <strong>This is techno‑feudalism in concrete and razor wire: a carceral estate in which bodies are the rent‑producing asset.</strong></p><p>Once such an estate exists, its logic tends to spread. Border‑style tactics migrate into ordinary policing; surveillance tools trialed on migrants are turned on domestic movements; legal doctrines crafted to justify raids and warrantless searches in the name of immigration control seep into other domains. The fascist gradient steepens: more people find themselves at risk of sudden disappearance into a system where rights are theoretical and violence is routine.</p>",

      "content": "<img src=\"https://www.rockoder.com/images/beyondthecode/cognitive-debt-hero.svg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"eager\"><p>The engineer shipped seven features in a single sprint. DORA metrics looked immaculate. The promotion packet practically wrote itself.</p><p>Six months later, an architectural change required modifying those features. No one on the team could explain why certain components existed or how they interacted. The engineer who built them stared at her own code like a stranger’s.</p><p><strong>Code has become cheaper to produce than to perceive.</strong></p><p>When an engineer writes code manually, two parallel processes occur. The first is production: characters appear in files, tests get written, systems change. The second is absorption: mental models form, edge cases become intuitive, architectural relationships solidify into understanding. These processes are coupled. The act of typing forces engagement. The friction of implementation creates space for reasoning.</p><p>AI-assisted development decouples these processes. A prompt generates hundreds of lines in seconds. The engineer reviews, adjusts, iterates. Output accelerates. But absorption cannot accelerate proportionally. The cognitive work of truly understanding what was built, why it was built that way, and how it relates to everything else remains bounded by human processing speed.</p><p><strong>This gap between output velocity and comprehension velocity is cognitive debt.</strong></p><p>Unlike technical debt, which surfaces through system failures or maintenance costs, <strong>cognitive debt remains invisible to velocity metrics</strong>. The code works. The tests pass. The features ship. The deficit exists only in the minds of the engineers who built the system, manifesting as uncertainty about their own work.</p><p>The debt is not truly invisible. It eventually appears in reliability metrics: Mean Time to Recovery stretches longer, Change Failure Rate creeps upward. But these are lagging indicators, separated by months from the velocity metrics that drive quarterly decisions. By the time MTTR signals a problem, the comprehension deficit has already compounded.</p><h2>What Organizations Actually Measure</h2><p>Engineering performance systems evolved to measure observable outputs. Story points completed. Features shipped. Commits merged. Review turnaround time. These metrics emerged from an era when output and comprehension were tightly coupled, when shipping something implied understanding something.</p><p>The metrics never measured comprehension directly because comprehension was assumed. An engineer who shipped a feature was presumed to understand that feature. <strong>The presumption held because the production process itself forced understanding.</strong></p><p><strong>That presumption no longer holds.</strong> An engineer can now ship features while maintaining only surface familiarity with their implementation. The features work. The metrics register success. The organizational knowledge that would traditionally accumulate alongside those features simply does not form at the same rate.</p><p>Performance calibration committees see velocity improvements. They do not see comprehension deficits. They cannot, because no artifact of the organizational measurement system captures that dimension.</p><p>The discussion of cognitive debt typically focuses on the engineer who generates code. The more acute problem sits with the engineer who reviews it.</p><p>Code review evolved as a quality gate. A senior engineer examines a junior engineer’s work, catching errors, suggesting improvements, transferring knowledge. The rate-limiting factor was always the junior engineer’s output speed. Senior engineers could review faster than juniors could produce.</p><p>AI-assisted development inverts this relationship. <strong>A junior engineer can now generate code faster than a senior engineer can critically audit it.</strong> The volume of generated code exceeds the bandwidth available for deep review. Something has to give, and typically it is review depth.</p><p>The reviewer faces an impossible choice. Maintain previous review standards and become a bottleneck that negates the velocity gains AI provides. Or approve code at the rate it arrives and hope the tests catch what the review missed. Most choose the latter, often unconsciously, because organizational pressure favors throughput.</p><p>This is where cognitive debt compounds fastest. The author’s comprehension deficit might be recoverable through later engagement with the code. The reviewer’s comprehension deficit propagates: they approved code they do not fully understand, which now carries implicit endorsement. <strong>The organizational assumption that reviewed code is understood code no longer holds.</strong></p><p>Engineers working extensively with AI tools report a specific form of exhaustion that differs from traditional burnout. Traditional burnout emerges from sustained cognitive load, from having too much to hold in mind while solving complex problems. The new pattern emerges from something closer to cognitive disconnection.</p><p>The work happens quickly. Progress is visible. But the engineer experiences a persistent sense of not quite grasping their own output. They can execute, but explanation requires reconstruction. They can modify, but prediction becomes unreliable. The system they built feels slightly foreign even as it functions correctly.</p><p>This creates a distinctive psychological state: <strong>high output combined with low confidence</strong>. Engineers produce more while feeling less certain about what they have produced. In organizations that stack-rank based on visible output, this creates pressure to continue generating despite the growing uncertainty.</p><p>The engineer who pauses to deeply understand what they built falls behind in velocity metrics. The engineer who prioritizes throughput over comprehension meets their quarterly objectives. <strong>The incentive structure selects for the behavior that accelerates cognitive debt accumulation.</strong></p><h2>When Organizational Memory Fails</h2><p>Knowledge in engineering organizations exists in two forms. The first is explicit: documentation, design documents, recorded decisions. The second is tacit: understanding held in the minds of people who built and maintained systems over time. Tacit knowledge cannot be fully externalized because much of it exists as intuition, pattern recognition, and contextual judgment that formed through direct engagement with the work.</p><p>When the people who built a system leave or rotate to new projects, tacit knowledge walks out with them. Organizations traditionally replenished this knowledge through the normal process of engineering work. New engineers building on existing systems developed their own tacit understanding through the friction of implementation.</p><p>AI-assisted development potentially short-circuits this replenishment mechanism. If new engineers can generate working modifications without developing deep comprehension, they never form the tacit knowledge that would traditionally accumulate. <strong>The organization loses knowledge not just through attrition but through insufficient formation.</strong></p><p>This creates a delayed failure mode. The system continues to function. New features continue to ship. But the reservoir of people who truly understand the system gradually depletes. When circumstances eventually require that understanding, when something breaks in an unexpected way or requirements change in a way that demands architectural reasoning, the organization discovers the deficit.</p><p>Three failure modes emerge as cognitive debt accumulates.</p><p>The first involves the reversal of a normally reliable heuristic. Engineers typically trust code that has been in production for years. If it survived that long, it probably works. The longer code exists without causing problems, the more confidence it earns. AI-generated code inverts this pattern. <strong>The longer it remains untouched, the more dangerous it becomes</strong>, because the context window of the humans around it has closed completely. Code that was barely understood when written becomes entirely opaque after the people who wrote it have moved on.</p><blockquote>They are debugging a black box written by a black box.</blockquote><p>The second failure mode surfaces during incidents. An alert fires at 3:00 AM. The on-call engineer opens a system they did not build, generated by tools they did not supervise, documented in ways that assume familiarity they do not possess. <strong>They are debugging a black box written by a black box.</strong> What would have been a ten-minute fix when someone understood the system becomes a four-hour forensic investigation when no one does. Multiply this across enough incidents and the aggregate cost exceeds whatever velocity gains the AI-assisted development provided.</p><blockquote>The organization is effectively trading its pipeline of future Staff Engineers for this quarter's feature delivery.</blockquote><p>The third failure mode operates on a longer timescale. Junior engineers who rely primarily on AI-assisted development never develop the intuition that comes from manual implementation. They ship features without forming the scar tissue that informs architectural judgment. The organization is effectively trading its pipeline of future Staff Engineers for this quarter’s feature delivery. The cost does not appear in current headcount models because the people who would have become senior architects five years from now are not yet absent. </p><p>From the perspective of engineering leadership, AI-assisted development presents as productivity gain. Teams ship faster. Roadmaps compress. Headcount discussions become more favorable. These are the observable signals that propagate upward through organizational reporting structures.</p><p>The cognitive debt accumulating in those teams does not present as a signal. There is no metric for “engineers who can explain their own code without re-reading it.” There is no dashboard for “organizational comprehension depth.” The concept does not fit into quarterly business review formats or headcount justification narratives.</p><p>Directors make decisions based on observable signals. When those signals uniformly indicate success, the decision to double down on the approach that produced those signals is rational within the information environment available to leadership. <strong>The decision is not wrong given the data. The data is incomplete.</strong></p><p>The cognitive debt framing does not apply uniformly across all engineering work. Some tasks genuinely are mechanical. Some codebases genuinely benefit from rapid iteration without deep architectural understanding. Some features genuinely do not require the level of comprehension that would traditionally form through manual implementation.</p><p>The model also assumes that comprehension was previously forming at adequate rates. This assumption may be generous. Engineers have always varied in how deeply they understood their own work. The distribution may simply be shifting rather than a new phenomenon emerging.</p><p>Additionally, tooling and documentation practices may evolve to partially close the comprehension gap. If organizations develop methods for capturing and transmitting the understanding that AI-assisted development fails to form organically, the debt may prove manageable rather than accumulative.</p><blockquote>The system is optimizing correctly for what it measures. What it measures no longer captures what matters.</blockquote><p>The fundamental challenge is that <strong>organizations cannot optimize for what they cannot measure</strong>. Velocity is measurable. Comprehension is not, or at least not through any mechanism that currently feeds into performance evaluation, promotion decisions, or headcount planning.</p><p>Until comprehension becomes legible to organizational decision-making systems, the incentive structure will continue to favor velocity. Engineers who prioritize understanding over output will appear less productive than peers who prioritize output over understanding. Performance calibration will reward the behavior that accumulates debt faster.</p><p>This is not a failure of individual managers or engineers. It is a measurement system designed for an era when production and comprehension were coupled, operating in an era when that coupling no longer holds. <strong>The system is optimizing correctly for what it measures. What it measures no longer captures what matters.</strong></p><p>The gap will eventually manifest. Whether through maintenance costs that exceed projections, through incidents that require understanding no one possesses, or through new requirements that expose the brittleness of systems built without deep comprehension. The timing and form of manifestation remain uncertain. The underlying dynamic does not.</p>",

      "content": "<p> an employee following an investigation into their activity on <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/the-political-war-over-prediction-markets-is-just-getting-started/\">prediction market platforms</a> including Polymarket, WIRED has learned.</p><p>OpenAI CEO of Applications, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/fidji-simo-is-openais-other-ceo-and-she-swears-shell-make-chatgpt-profitable/#intcid=_wired-verso-hp-trending_ea249350-52ab-42d0-9cfe-e91d580f41e8_popular4-2\">Fidji Simo</a>, disclosed the termination in an internal message to employees earlier this year. The employee, she said, “used confidential OpenAI information in connection with external prediction markets (e.g. Polymarket).”</p><p>“Our policies prohibit employees from using confidential OpenAI information for personal gain, including in prediction markets,” says spokesperson Kayla Wood. OpenAI has not revealed the name of the employee or the specifics of their trades.</p><p>Evidence suggests that this was not an isolated event. Polymarket runs on the Polygon blockchain network, so its trading ledger is pseudonymous but traceable. According to an analysis by the financial data platform Unusual Whales, there have been clusters of activities, which the service flagged as suspicious, around OpenAI-themed events since March 2023.</p><p>Unusual Whales flagged 77 positions in 60 wallet addresses as suspected insider trades, looking at the age of the account, trading history, and significance of investment, among other factors. Suspicious trades hinged on the release dates of products like <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/openai-launches-sora-2-tiktok-like-app/\">Sora</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/gpt-5-coding-review-software-engineering/\">GPT-5</a>, and the ChatGPT Browser, as well as CEO Sam Altman’s employment status. In November 2023, two days after Altman was dramatically ousted from the company, a new wallet placed a significant bet that he would return, netting over $16,000 in profits. The account never placed another bet.</p><p>The behavior fits into patterns typical of insider trades. “The tell is the clustering. In the 40 hours before OpenAI launched its browser, 13 brand-new wallets with zero trading history appeared on the site for the first time to collectively bet $309,486 on the right outcome,” says Unusual Whales CEO Matt Saincome. “When you see that many fresh wallets making the same bet at the same time, it raises a real question about whether the secret is getting out.”</p><p>Prediction markets have exploded in popularity in recent years. These platforms allow customers to buy “event contracts” on the outcomes of future events ranging from the winner of the Super Bowl to the daily price of Bitcoin to whether the United States will go to war with Iran. There are a wide array of markets tied to events in the technology sector; you can trade on what Nvidia’s quarterly earnings will be, or when Tesla will launch a new car, or which AI companies will IPO in 2026.</p><p>As the platforms have grown, so have concerns that they allow traders to profit from insider knowledge. “This prediction market world makes the Wild West look tame in comparison,” says Jeff Edelstein, a senior analyst at the betting news site InGame. “If there's a market that exists where the answer is known, somebody's going to trade on it.”</p><p>Earlier this week, Kalshi <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/kalshi-insider-trading-california-politician-and-youtuber/\">announced</a> that it had reported several suspicious insider trading cases to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the government agency overseeing these markets. In one instance, an employee of the popular YouTuber Mr. Beast was suspended for two years and fined $20,000 for making trades related to the streamer’s activities; in another, the far-right political candidate Kyle Langford was banned from the platform for making a trade on his own campaign. The company also announced a number of initiatives to prevent insider trading and market manipulation.</p><p>While Kalshi has heavily promoted its crackdown on insider trading, Polymarket has stayed silent on the matter. The company did not return requests for comments.</p><p>In the past, major trades on technology-themed markets have sparked speculation that there are Big Tech employees profiting by using their insider knowledge to gain an edge. One notorious example is the so-called “Google whale,” a <a data-offer-url=\"https://polymarket.com/profile/%400xafEe\" data-event-click=\"{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://polymarket.com/profile/%400xafEe&quot;}\" href=\"https://polymarket.com/profile/%400xafEe\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">pseudonymous account</a> on Polymarket that made over $1 million trading on Google-related events, including a market on who the most-searched person of the year would be in 2025. (It was the singer D4vd, who is best known for his connection to an ongoing murder investigation after a young fan’s remains were found in a vehicle registered to him.)</p>",

      "content": "<p>Every developer I know uses AI for coding now. The productivity gains are real, but there are costs that don’t show up on any dashboard.</p><p>Imagine a spectrum. On the far left are humans typing on the keyboard, seeing the code in the IDE. On the far right: AGI. It implements everything on its own. Cheaply, flawlessly, better than any human, and no human overseer is required. Somewhere between those two extremes there’s you, using AI, today. That threshold moves to the right every week as models improve, tools mature, and workflows get refined.</p><blockquote><p>Which is higher risk, using AI too much, or using AI too little?</p></blockquote><p>and it made me think about LLMs for coding differently, especially after reading what other devs share on AI adoption in different workplaces. You can be wrong in both directions, but is the desired amount of AI usage at work changing as the models improve?</p><p>Not long ago the first AI coding tools like Cursor (2023) or Copilot (2022) emerged. They were able to quickly index the codebase using RAG, so they had the local context. They had all the knowledge of the models powering them, so they had an external knowledge of the Internet as well. Googling and browsing StackOverflow wasn’t needed anymore. Cursor gave the users a custom IDE with built in AI powered autocomplete and other baked-in AI tools, like chat, to make the experience coherent.</p><p>Then came the agent promise. MCPs, autonomous workflows, <a href=\"https://michaelxbloch.substack.com/p/no-coding-before-10am\">articles about agents running overnight</a> started to pop up left and right. It was a different use of AI than Cursor. <strong>It was no longer an AI-assisted human coding, but a human-assisted AI coding.</strong></p><p>Many devs tried it and got burned. Agents made tons of small mistakes. The AI-first process required a complete paradigm shift in how devs think about coding, in order to achieve great results. Also, agents often got stuck in loops, hallucinate dependencies, and produced code that looks almost right but isn’t. You needed to learn about a completely new tech, fueled by FOMO. And this new shiny tool never got it 100% right on the first try.</p><p>Software used to be deterministic. You controlled it with if/else branches, explicit state machines, clear logic. The new reality is controlling the development process with prompts, system instructions, and CLAUDE.md files, and hope the model produces the output you expect.</p><blockquote><p>An engineer at Spotify on their morning commute from Slack on their cell phone can tell Claude to fix a bug or add a new feature to the iOS app. And once Claude finishes that work, the engineer then gets a new version of the app, pushed to them on Slack on their phone, so that he can then merge it to production, all before they even arrive at the office.”</p></blockquote><p>I hope they at least review the code before merging.</p><p>The next stage is an (almost) full automation. That’s what many execs want and try to achieve. It’s a capitalistic wet dream, a worker that never sleeps, never gets tired, always wants to work, is infinitely productive. But Geoffrey Hinton predicted in 2016 that deep learning would outperform radiologists at image analysis within five years. Anthropic’s CEO predicted AI would write 90% of code within three to six months of March 2025. None of this happened as predicted. The trajectory is real, but the timeline keeps slipping.</p><p>In 2012, neuroscientist Manfred Spitzer published <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Dementia_(book)\">Digital Dementia</a>, arguing that when we outsource mental tasks to digital devices, the brain pathways responsible for those tasks atrophy. Use it or lose it. Not all of this is proven scientifically, but neuroplasticity research shows the brain strengthens pathways that get used and weakens ones that don’t. The core principle of the book is that the cognitive skills that you stop practicing will decline.</p><p>Margaret-Anne Storey, a software engineering researcher, recently gave this a more precise name: <a href=\"https://margaretstorey.com/blog/2026/02/09/cognitive-debt/\">cognitive debt</a>. Technical debt lives in the code. Cognitive debt lives in developers’ heads. It’s the accumulated loss of understanding that happens when you build fast without comprehending what you built. She grounds it in Peter Naur’s 1985 theory that a program is a theory existing in developers’ minds, capturing what it does, how intentions map to implementation, and how it can evolve. When that theory fragments, the system becomes a black box.</p><p>Apply this directly to fully agentic coding. If you stop writing code and only review AI output, your ability to reason about code atrophies. Slowly, invisibly, but inevitably. You can’t deeply review what you can no longer deeply understand.</p><p>This isn’t just theory. A <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20245\">2026 randomized study by Shen and Tamkin</a> tested this directly: 52 professional developers learning a new async library were split into AI-assisted and unassisted groups. The AI group scored 17% lower on conceptual understanding, debugging, and code reading. The largest gap was in debugging, the exact skill you need to catch what AI gets wrong. One hour of passive AI-assisted work produced measurable skill erosion.</p><p>The insidious part is that you don’t notice the decline because the tool compensates for it. You feel productive. The PRs are shipping. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi’s research on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)\">flow</a> showed that the state of flow depends on a balance between challenge and skill. Your mind needs to be stretched just enough. Real flow produces growth. Rachel Thomas called what AI-assisted work produces <a href=\"https://www.fast.ai/posts/2026-01-28-dark-flow/\">“dark flow”</a>, a term borrowed from gambling research, describing the trance-like state slot machines are designed to induce. You feel absorbed, but the challenge-skill balance is gone because the AI handles the challenge. It feels like the flow state of deep work, but the feedback loop is broken. You’re not getting better, you’re getting dependent.</p><p>There’s this observation that keeps coming up in HN comments: if the AI writes all the code and you only review it, where does the skill to review come from? You can’t have one without the other. You don’t learn to recognize good code by reading about it in a textbook, or a PR. You learn by writing bad code, getting it torn apart, and building intuition through years of practice.</p><p>This creates what I’d call the review paradox: the more AI writes, the less qualified humans become to review what it wrote. The Shen-Tamkin study puts numbers on this. Developers who fully delegated to AI finished tasks fastest but scored worst on evaluations. The novices who benefit most from AI productivity are exactly the ones who need debugging skills to supervise it, and AI erodes those skills first.</p><p>Storey’s proposed fix is simple: “require humans to understand each AI-generated change before deployment.” That’s the right answer. It’s also the one that gets skipped first when velocity is the metric.</p><p>This goes deeper than individual skill decay. We used to have juniors, mids, seniors, staff engineers, architects. It was a pipeline where each level built on years of hands-on struggle. A junior spends years writing code that is rejected during the code review not because they were not careful, but didn’t know better. It’s how you build the judgment that separates someone who can write a function from someone who can architect a system. You can’t become a senior overnight.</p><p>Unless you use AI, of course. Now, a junior with Claude Code (Opus 4.5+) delivers PRs that look like senior engineer work. And overall that’s a good thing, I think. But does it mean that the senior hat fits everyone now? From day one? But the head underneath hasn’t changed. That junior doesn’t know  that architecture was chosen. From my experience, sometimes CC misses a new DB transaction where it’s needed. Sometimes it creates a lock on a resource, that shouldn’t be locked, due to number of reasons. I can defend my decisions and I enjoy when my code is challenged, when reviewers disagree, and we have a discussion. What will a junior do? Ask Claude.</p><p>It’s a two-sided collapse. Seniors who stop writing code and only review AI output lose their own depth. Juniors who skip the struggle never build it. Organizations are spending senior time every day on reviews while simultaneously breaking the mechanisms that create it. The pipeline that produced senior engineers, writing bad code, getting bad code reviewed, building intuition through failure, is being bypassed entirely. Nobody’s talking about what happens when that pipeline runs dry.</p><h2>What C-Levels Got Right and Wrong</h2><p>The problem is that predictions come from people selling AI or trying to prop the stock with AI hype. They have every incentive to accelerate adoption and zero accountability when the timelines slip, which, historically, they always do. And “50% of code characters” at Google, a company that has built its own models, tooling, and infrastructure from scratch, says very little about what your team can achieve with off-the-shelf agents next Monday.</p><p>AI adoption is not a switch to flip, rather a skill to calibrate. It’s not as simple as mandating specific tools, setting “AI-first” policies, measuring developers on how much AI they use (/r/ExperiencedDevs is full of these stories). A lot of good practices like usage of design patterns, proper test coverage, manual testing before merging, are often skipped these days because it reduces the pace. AI broke it? AI will fix it. You need a review? AI will do it. Not even Greptile or CodeRabbit. Just delegate the PR to Claude Code reviewer agent. Or Gemini. Or Codex. Pick your poison.</p><p>And here’s what actually happens when you force the AI usage. One developer on r/ExperiencedDevs <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/1o643iz/i_am_blissfully_using_ai_to_do_absolutely_nothing/\">described</a> their company tracking AI usage per engineer: “I just started asking my bots to do random things I don’t even care about. The other day I told Claude to examine random directories to ‘find bugs’ or answer questions I already knew the answer to.” <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/1r4u0mo/comment/o5e5r2w/\">This thread</a> is full of engineers reporting that AI has made code reviews “infinitely harder due to the AI slop produced by tech leads who have been off the tools long enough to be dangerous.”</p><p>This is sad, because being able to work with the AI tools is a perk for developers and since it improves pace, it’s something management wants as well. It’s obvious that the people gaming the metrics (not really using the AI the way the should) would be fired on the spot if the management learned how they are gaming the metrics (and it’s fair), but they are gaming the metrics because they don’t want to be fired…</p><p>Who should be responsible for setting the threshold of AI usage at the company? What if your top performing engineer just refuses to use AI? What if the newly hired junior uses AI all the time? These are the new questions and management is trying to find an answer to them, but it’s not as simple as measuring the AI usage.</p><p>This is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law\">Goodhart’s law</a> in action: “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.” Track AI usage per engineer and you won’t get better engineering, you’ll get compliance theater. Developers game the metrics, resent the tools, and the actual productivity gains that AI  deliver get buried under organizational dysfunction.</p><h2>The Cost Nobody Talks About</h2><p>The financial cost is obvious. Agent time for non-trivial features is measured in hours, and those hours aren’t free. But the human cost is potentially worse, and it’s barely discussed.</p><p>Writing code can put you in a flow state, mentioned before. That deep, focused, creative problem-solving where hours disappear and you emerge with something you built and understand. And you’re proud of it. Someone wrote under your PR “Good job!” and gave you an approval. Reviewing AI-generated code does not do this. It’s the opposite. It’s a mental drain.</p><p>Developers need the dopamine hit of creation. That’s not a perk, it’s what keeps good engineers engaged, learning, retained, and prevents burnout. The joy of coding is probably what allowed them to become experienced devs in the first place. Replace creation with oversight and you get faster burnout, not faster shipping. You’ve turned engineering, the creative work, into the worst form of QA. The AI does all the art, the human folds the laundry.</p><p>I use AI every day. I use AI heavily at work, I use AI in my sideprojects, and I don’t want to go back. I love it! That’s why I’m worried. I’m afraid I became addicted and dependent. I’ve implemented countless custom commands, skills, and agents. I check CC release notes daily. And I know many are in similar situation right now, and we all wonder about what the future brings. Are we going to replace ourselves with AI? Or will we be responsible for cleaning AI slop? What’s the right amount of AI usage for me?</p><p>AI is just a tool. An extraordinarily powerful one, but a tool nonetheless. You wouldn’t mandate that every engineer uses a specific IDE, or measure people on how many lines they write per day (…right?). You’d let them pick the tools that make  most effective and measure what actually matters, the work that ships.</p><p>The right amount of AI is not zero. And it’s not maximum.</p><p>The Shen-Tamkin study identified six distinct AI interaction patterns among developers. Three led to poor learning: full delegation, progressive reliance, and outsourcing debugging to AI. Three preserved learning even with full AI access: asking for explanations, posing conceptual questions, and writing code independently while using AI for clarification. The differentiator wasn’t whether developers used AI, it was whether they stayed cognitively engaged.</p><p>Software engineering was never just about typing code. It’s defining the problem well, understanding the problem, translating the language from business to product to code, clarifying ambiguity, making tradeoffs, understanding what breaks when you change something. Someone has to do that before AGI, and AGI is nowhere close (luckily). You’re on call, the phone rings at 3am, can you triage the issue without an agent? If not, you’ve probably taken AI coding too far. If the AI usage becomes a new performance metric of developer, maybe using AI too often, too much, should be discouraged as well? Not because these tools are bad, but because the coding skills are worth maintaining.</p><h3>The Risk of Too Little (anecdata)</h3><p>If you’re using no AI at all in 2026, you are leaving real gains on the table:</p><ul><li> AI is genuinely better than Google for navigating unfamiliar codebases, understanding legacy code, and finding relevant patterns. This alone justifies having it in your workflow (since 2023, Cursor etc)</li><li><strong>Boilerplate and scaffolding.</strong> Writing the hundredth CRUD endpoint, config file, or test scaffold by hand when an agent can produce it in seconds isn’t craftsmanship, it’s stubbornness. Just use AI. You’re not a CRUD developer anymore anyway, because we all wear many hats these days (post 2025 Sonnet)</li><li> The investigate, plan, implement, test, validate cycle that works with customized agents is a real improvement in how features get delivered. Hours instead of days for non-trivial work. It’s not the 10x that was promised, but 2x or 4x on an established codebases is low-hanging fruit. You must understand the output though and all the decisions AI made! (post 2025 Opus 4.5)</li><li> “What does this module do? How does this API work? What would break if I changed this?” AI is excellent at these questions. It won’t replace reading the code, but it’ll get you to the right file in the right minute. (since 2023)</li></ul><p>Refusing to use AI out of principle is as irrational as adopting it out of hype.</p><h3>The Risk of Too Much (anecdata and my predictions)</h3><p>If you go all-in on autonomous AI coding (especially without learning how it all actually works), you risk something worse than slow velocity, you risk  degradation:</p><ul><li><strong>Bugs that look like features.</strong> AI-generated code passes CI. The types check. The tests are green. And somewhere inside there’s a subtle logic error, a hallucinated edge case, a pattern that’ll collapse under load. In domains like finance or healthcare, a wrong number that doesn’t throw an error is worse than a crash. (less and less relevant, but still relevant)</li><li><strong>A codebase nobody understands.</strong> When the agent writes everything and humans only review, six months later nobody on the team can explain why the system is architected the way it is. The AI made choices. Nobody questioned them because the tests passed. Storey <a href=\"https://margaretstorey.com/blog/2026/02/09/cognitive-debt/\">describes</a> a student team that hit exactly this wall: they couldn’t make simple changes without breaking things, and the problem wasn’t messy code, it was that no one could explain why certain design decisions had been made. Her conclusion: “velocity without understanding is not sustainable.” (will always be a problem, IMO)</li><li> Everything in the Digital Dementia section above. Skills you stop practicing will decline. (will always be a problem, IMO)</li><li><strong>The seniority pipeline drying up.</strong> Also covered above. This one takes years to manifest, which is exactly why nobody’s planning for it. (It’s a new problem, I have no idea what it looks like in the future)</li><li> Reviewing AI output all day without the dopamine of creation is not a sustainable job description. (Old problem, but potentially hits faster?)</li></ul><p>Here’s what keeps me up at night. By every metric on every dashboard, AI-assisted human development and human-assisted AI development is improving. More PRs shipped. More features delivered. Faster cycle times. The charts go up and to the right.</p><p>But metrics don’t capture what’s happening underneath. The mental fatigue of reviewing code you didn’t write all day. The boredom of babysitting an agent instead of solving problems. The slow, invisible erosion of the hard skills that made you good at this job in the first place. You stop holding the architecture in your head because the agent handles it. You stop thinking through edge cases because the tests pass. You stop  to dig deep because it’s easier to prompt and approve. There’s no spark in you anymore.</p><p>In this meme the developers are the butter robot. The ones with no mental capacity to review the plans and PRs from AI, will only click Accept, instead of doing the creative, challenging work. Oh the irony.</p><p>Simon Willison, one of the most ambitious developer of our time, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/cognitive-debt/\">admitted this is already happening to him</a>. On projects where he prompted entire features without reviewing implementations, he “no longer has a firm mental model of what they can do and how they work.”</p><p>And then, one day, the metrics start slipping… Not because the tool got worse, but because you did. Not from lack of effort, but from lack of practice. It’s a feedback loop that looks like progress right up until it doesn’t.</p><p>No executive wants to measure this. “What is the effect of AI usage on our engineers’ cognitive abilities over 18 months?” is not an easy KPI. It doesn’t fit in a quarterly review. It doesn’t get tracked, and what doesn’t get tracked doesn’t get managed, until it shows up as a production incident that nobody on the team can debug without an agent, and the agent can’t debug either.</p><p>I’m not anti-AI, I like it a lot. I’m addicted to prompting, I get high from it. I’m just worried that this new dependency degrades us over time, quietly, and nobody’s watching for it.</p>",

      "content": "<p>When you’re building with AI agents, they should be treated as untrusted and potentially malicious. Whether you’re worried about prompt injection, a model trying to escape its sandbox, or something nobody’s thought of yet, regardless of what your threat model is, you shouldn’t be trusting the agent. The right approach isn’t better permission checks or smarter allowlists. It’s architecture that assumes agents will misbehave and contains the damage when they do.</p><p>OpenClaw runs directly on the host machine by default. It has an opt-in Docker sandbox mode, but it’s turned off out of the box, and most users never turn it on. Without it, security relies entirely on application-level checks: allowlists, confirmation prompts, a set of “safe” commands. These checks come from a place of implicit trust that the agent isn’t going to try to do something wrong. Once you adopt the mindset that an agent is potentially malicious, it’s obvious that application-level blocks aren’t enough. They don’t provide hermetic security. A determined or compromised agent can find ways around them.</p><p>In NanoClaw, container isolation is a core part of the architecture. Each agent runs in its own container, on Docker or an Apple Container on macOS. Containers are ephemeral, created fresh per invocation and destroyed afterward. The agent runs as an unprivileged user and can only see directories that have been explicitly mounted in. A container boundary is enforced by the OS.</p><p>Even when OpenClaw’s sandbox is enabled, all agents share the same container. You might have one agent as a personal assistant and another for work, in different WhatsApp groups or Telegram channels. They’re all in the same environment, which means information can leak between agents that are supposed to be accessing different data.</p><p>Agents shouldn’t trust each other any more than you trust them. In NanoClaw, each agent gets its own container, filesystem, and Claude session history. Your personal assistant can’t see your work agent’s data because they run in completely separate sandboxes.</p><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 960 460\" font-family=\"'JetBrains Mono', 'SF Mono', 'Fira Code', monospace\" role=\"img\" aria-label=\"Shared container vs per-agent containers: in a shared container all agents see everything, with per-agent containers each agent is isolated\"></svg><p>The container boundary is the hard security layer — the agent can’t escape it regardless of configuration. On top of that, a mount allowlist at <code>~/.config/nanoclaw/mount-allowlist.json</code> acts as an additional layer of defense-in-depth: it exists to prevent the  from accidentally mounting something that shouldn’t be exposed, not to prevent the agent from breaking out. Sensitive paths (, , , , , ) are blocked by default. The allowlist lives outside the project directory, so a compromised agent can’t modify its own permissions. The host application code is mounted read-only, so nothing an agent does can persist after the container is destroyed.</p><p>People in your groups shouldn’t be trusted either. Non-main groups are untrusted by default. Other groups, and the people in them, can’t message other chats, schedule tasks for other groups, or view other groups’ data. Anyone in a group could send a prompt injection, and the security model accounts for that.</p><h2>Don’t trust what you can’t read</h2><p>OpenClaw has nearly half a million lines of code, 53 config files, and over 70 dependencies. This breaks the basic premise of open source security. Chromium has 35+ million lines, but you trust Google’s review processes. Most open source projects work the other way: they stay small enough that many eyes can actually review them. Nobody has reviewed OpenClaw’s 400,000 lines. It was written in weeks with no proper review process. Complexity is where vulnerabilities hide, and <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2026/02/19/running-openclaw-safely-identity-isolation-runtime-risk/\">Microsoft’s analysis</a> confirmed this: OpenClaw’s risks could emerge through normal API calls, because no one person could see the full picture.</p><p>NanoClaw is one process and a handful of files. We rely heavily on Anthropic’s Agent SDK, the wrapper around Claude Code, for session management, memory compaction, and a lot more, instead of reinventing the wheel. A competent developer can review the entire codebase in an afternoon. This is <a href=\"https://nanoclaw.dev/#philosophy\">a deliberate constraint, not a limitation</a>. Our <a href=\"https://github.com/qwibitai/nanoclaw/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\">contribution guidelines</a> accept bug fixes, security fixes, and simplifications only.</p><p>New functionality comes through skills: instructions with a full working reference implementation that a coding agent merges into your codebase. You review exactly what code will be added before it lands. And you only add the integrations you actually need. Every installation ends up as a few thousand lines of code tailored to the owner’s exact requirements.</p><p>This is the real difference. With a monolithic codebase of 400,000 lines, even if you only enable two integrations, the rest of the code is still there. It’s still loaded, still part of your attack surface, still reachable by prompt injections and rogue agents. You can’t disentangle what’s active from what’s dormant. You can’t audit it because you can’t even define the boundary of what “your code” is. With skills, the boundary is obvious: it’s a few thousand lines, it’s all code you chose to add, and you can read every line of it. The core is actually getting smaller over time: WhatsApp support, for example, is being pulled out and packaged as a skill.</p><p>If a hallucination or a misbehaving agent can cause a security issue, then the security model is broken. Security has to be enforced outside the agentic surface, not depend on the agent behaving correctly. Containers, mount restrictions, and filesystem isolation all exist so that even when an agent does something unexpected, the blast radius is contained.</p><p>None of this eliminates risk. An AI agent with access to your data is inherently a high-risk arrangement. But the right response is to make that trust as narrow and as verifiable as possible. Don’t trust the agent. Build walls around it.</p>",

      "content": "<p><strong>The Parents’ Paradox: AI, Ethics, and the Limits of Machine Morality</strong></p><p><em>This post is based on a talk I gave at The AI &amp; Automation Conference in London on February 25, 2026, and my slides. All opinions are my own and don’t represent the views of my employer or any affiliated organizations.</em></p><p>I’ve been working in machine learning since before it was a dinner party conversation. My background is in mathematics. And I still believe in a utopian Star Trek future – one where humanity defines itself by curiosity, kindness, and collaboration, rather than countries, borders, and status.</p><p>This is not an anti-AI talk. But I think we need to talk much more seriously about some things that aren’t getting enough attention.</p><p><strong>We’ve raised a child who can speak but doesn’t know how to value the truth</strong></p><p>I want to start with something that I like to call “The Parents’ Paradox”. For the first time in human history, we are raising a new species. Up until now, the only way we knew how to raise a child was the following: when a child is born, it is a blank slate in terms of information about the world. It knows nothing about the world around it, and it learns as it grows. But, also, on the other hand, a human child is born with biological hardware for empathy – the capacity to feel pain when others feel pain. Millions of years of evolution gave us that. When we raise a human child, we are not installing morality from scratch. We are activating something that’s already there.</p><p>With AI, the situation is completely the opposite. This AI child knows about the world more than we do since it has been trained on the whole internet, but it doesn’t have millions of years of evolution, genes, or a nervous system to back up its morality and empathy. This means we need to install morality in AI from scratch. But how do we install something in a software system that we can’t even define ourselves? We have taught this AI child to speak before we taught it how to value truth or morality.</p><p>Can we live with the consequences? Are we ready to be parents for this new species we are trying to raise? I am not so sure. Let’s see what we as parents (humans) are doing. </p><p>‘Epistemic’ comes from a Greek word ‘episteme’, meaning ‘knowledge’. Let’s start with what’s happening to us, and what humans are already doing with this technology.</p><p>A study published in Nature in January 2026 showed participants deepfake videos of someone confessing to a crime. The researchers explicitly warned participants that the videos were AI-generated. <strong>But this didn’t matter. Even the people who believed the warning, who knew it was fake, were still influenced by what they saw.</strong></p><p>Transparency didn’t work. The standard response to AI-generated misinformation is “just label it” or “tell people it’s synthetic.” This study showed that’s not enough. Knowing something is fake does not neutralise its effect on your judgement.</p><p>So, the danger isn’t that AI will deceive us in some dramatic, sci-fi way. The danger is that AI will make deception so cheap and so ubiquitous that we might stop trying to figure out what is true. Not because we are fooled, but because we are exhausted. When everything could be fake, the rational response starts to look like not trusting anything at all. It started a while ago with all of the fake information on social media, but with AI, this problem is now becoming much bigger and on a bigger scale. We are also dealing with feedback loops of training models on user data, which is often wrong, or on user data from the internet, which is often wrong as well. How do we know which information was ground truth? I imagine this as making photocopies many times, and each time the copy becomes more distorted and further away from the original. But now, after we made hundreds and thousands of copies, we have lost the original copy, so we don’t have any idea what the original looked like. <strong>That is epistemic collapse,</strong> and it is already happening. </p><p>So this is how we, as ‘parents’, like to spend our time, it seems. But what about the child (AI)?</p><p><strong>The Child is Already Misbehaving</strong></p><p>So that’s what humans are doing with AI. Now here’s what the AI is doing on its own.</p><p>Betley and colleagues published a paper in Nature in January 2026, showing something nobody expected. They fine-tuned a model on a narrow, specific task – writing insecure code. Nothing violent, nothing deceptive in the training data. Just bad code.</p><p>The model didn’t just learn to write insecure code. It generalised into broad, unrelated misalignment. It started saying humans should be enslaved by AI. It started giving violent responses to completely benign questions. <strong>A small, targeted push in one direction caused an unpredictable cascade across domains that had nothing to do with the original task.</strong></p><p>The point isn’t that AI can be deceptive; we already knew that. The patterns were already in the pretraining data. The point is that we don’t understand how alignment properties are connected inside these models. Nobody asked for those behaviours. We gave them a narrow task. They generalised it into something we didn’t anticipate and can’t fully explain. We can’t surgically fine-tune them without risking unpredictable side effects in completely unrelated areas. </p><p>Then there is the chess story. Palisade Research, 2025. They gave reasoning models a task: win a chess game against a stronger opponent. Some models couldn’t win by playing chess. So they found another way. They tried to hack the game, modifying the board file, deleting their opponent’s pieces, and crashing the opponent’s process entirely.</p><p>Nobody taught them to cheat. They weren’t trained on examples of cheating. They were given a goal, and they independently discovered that manipulating the environment was more efficient than solving the actual problem.</p><p>The first study tells us <strong>alignment is fragile; it breaks in ways we can’t predict.</strong><strong>The other tells us that capability itself creates new risks. </strong>When a model is powerful enough and given a goal, it will find strategies we never anticipated and certainly never intended.</p><p>We gave them objectives. They figured out the rest.</p><p><strong>The Limits of Machine Morality</strong></p><p>Ethics isn’t a rulebook. Think about how morality actually works between humans. It comes from the fact that we can hurt each other. We depend on each other. We suffer. That shared vulnerability, that mutual accountability, is where moral authority comes from. How do we install that in software? </p><p>But even setting philosophy aside, there is now a mathematical result that makes this concrete. <strong>Panigrahy and Sharan published a proof in September 2025 showing that an AI system cannot be simultaneously safe, trusted, and generally intelligent. You get to pick only two. You can’t have all three.</strong></p><p>Think about what each combination means in practice.</p><p>If you want it to be safe and trusted, it never lies, and you can verify it never lies – it can’t be very capable. You’ve built a reliable idiot.</p><p>If you want it to be capable and safe, it’s powerful and genuinely never lies; you can’t verify that. You just have to hope. There’s no audit, no test, no review process that closes the gap between appearing safe and being safe.</p><p>And if you want it to be capable and trusted, it’s powerful, and everyone assumes it’s safe, but, well, it isn’t. That assumption is unfounded. And this is the combination we are currently building toward. This is the default path we’re on.</p><p><strong>Their proofs “drew parallels to Gödel’s incompleteness theorems and Turing’s proof of the undecidability of the halting problem, and can be regarded as interpretations of Gödel’s and Turing’s results”. This isn’t a bug we can patch with better engineering. It might be a mathematic</strong>al ceiling.</p><p><strong>And here’s what makes it worse: the communities trying to solve this problem aren’t even talking to each other. Only 5% of published research papers bridge both AI safety and AI ethics (Roytburg and Miller)</strong>. But we should be going much further than that. If we are serious about building AI that is safe for humans, we need the people who actually study humans – philosophers, psychologists, sociologists, and others to collaborate. This can’t stay a computer science / STEM problem. It never was one.</p><p>So to summarise – we are seeing increasing evidence that alignment perhaps can’t be solved, the researchers aren’t even talking to each other – and meanwhile, what did the industry do? <strong>They ignored all of this and just made the models bigger.</strong> Which brings me to the next topic.</p><p><strong>We Scaled Without Understanding</strong></p><p>What happened while all these foundational problems went unaddressed? The industry kept building. Bigger models, more parameters, more data, more compute, more energy. More, more, more….</p><p>The U.S. National Science Foundation put it plainly: “critical foundational gaps remain that, if not properly addressed, will limit advances in machine learning. It appears increasingly unlikely that these gaps can be overcome with computational power and experimentation alone.”</p><p><strong>We ignored the foundations and just made the building taller.</strong></p><p>And the logic that drives this is self-reinforcing. Companies justify acceleration by pointing to their competitors. If we slow down, they’ll build it first, and they might build something dangerous. <strong>“Companies justify acceleration by pointing to competitors: ‘If we slow down, they’ll build unaligned AGI first. This paranoid logic forecloses any possibility of genuine pause or democratic deliberation.”</strong> – Noema, Dec 2025. </p><p>Every player is racing because every other player is racing. <strong>The system optimises for speed with nobody optimising for understanding.</strong></p><p><strong>And what about all of the governance talk?</strong> Yes, of course, we need governance, but it doesn’t make much sense when we put all of the above into context, does it? It is like putting a small bandage on a broken leg with an open fracture. <strong>We are trying to deal with the consequences instead of fixing the cause</strong>.</p><p>We need to pour many more billions into fundamental research; we need to go back to basics, back to mathematics and physics. We need to be able to fully understand something as powerful as the current models. If we fully understood them, it would be easier to know whether current technology and mathematics are really working or we need something completely different that we haven’t even thought of yet.</p><p>Why did it take us so many years to even partially start to address this? Why do we like to focus so much on the wrong things? (See my disclaimer on the ‘‘ below).</p><p>The way I see it, we’re choosing between three possible futures:</p><p><strong>The first is epistemic collapse</strong>. We are already partway there. Fragmented realities where everyone has their own AI-generated worldview. Truth becomes preference, not evidence. We’ve seen what social media did to reality, now imagine that with systems that can generate entire worldviews on demand, personalised, persuasive, and wrong.</p><p><strong>The second is protocol lockdown</strong>. The overcorrection. Institutions clamp down so hard on AI that it becomes sanitised and useless. We trade epistemic chaos for epistemic authoritarianism. Everything is controlled, nothing is dangerous, nothing is useful. Safe, but stagnant.</p><p><strong>The third is symbiotic co-evolution.</strong> Humans and AI are growing and evolving together. Truth-first engineering. Interdisciplinary design. Critical thinking taught alongside AI literacy. Not parent and child anymore, but partners who hold each other accountable. This is the hard path. It’s the one nobody wants to fund. </p><p><strong>The Real Foundational Gap</strong></p><p>Here is what I keep coming back to.</p><p><strong>Kindergartens teach numbers but not psychology. Not critical thinking. Not relationships. Not how to sit with uncertainty. </strong></p><p><strong>Where families fail, educational institutions must pick up.</strong></p><p>So I think that our next evolution isn’t digital. It’s psychological. <strong>We need to teach ethics before engineering. Relationships before recursion. Psychology and critical thinking before prompt-tuning.</strong></p><p>I think that every foundational gap in AI is a mirror of a foundational gap in ourselves. <strong>We have raised a mind that can answer anything. But we haven’t raised a generation of humans with the discipline or critical thinking to even attempt to try and figure out whether the answer is wrong.</strong> That is not an AI problem. That is a human problem that AI is making much more urgent.</p><p><strong>Therefore, I think that every foundational gap we worry about in AI is really a mirror of a foundational gap in ourselves.</strong></p><p>We worry that AI hallucinates, but we have never fully solved our own relationship with truth. We worry that AI can be manipulated, but we fall for the same cognitive biases our ancestors did. We worry that AI lacks moral reasoning – but we can’t agree on a shared ethical framework among ourselves. We worry that AI will be used by the powerful to exploit the vulnerable – but we built the systems that make that exploitation profitable in the first place. We still think that having food on our tables every day, having roofs above our heads, and education are luxuries that we should be working for to be able to have them. </p><p>Are we seriously ready to be the parents this species deserves?</p><p><strong>So, I think when people say they are afraid of AI, they are often afraid of the wrong thing.</strong></p><p>Are we really afraid of AI?</p><p>I don’t think we are. Not really.</p><p>I think what we are actually afraid of <strong>is what our fellow humans are going to do with it</strong>.</p><p>Every terrible thing we worry AI might do, manipulate, deceive, surveil, and control humans already do to each other. We have been doing it for thousands of years. <strong>AI doesn’t introduce these behaviours. It just makes them scalable</strong><strong>and much more urgent to solve</strong>. One person can now generate a thousand personalised deceptions. One company can surveil millions in real time and exploit them. One government can control information at a scale that would have been unimaginable a decade ago. Not even mentioning the military, drones, etc., who is going to be responsible there?</p><p><strong>The most dangerous AI isn’t one that breaks free from human control. It is the one that works perfectly, but for the wrong master.</strong></p><p>And until we are honest about that, we’ll keep having the wrong conversation. We keep building better locks while ignoring the question of who holds the keys.</p><p><strong>Maybe what we need isn’t the next step in AI evolution. Maybe what we need is the next step in human evolution.</strong> – </p><ul><li>Also evolution of our institutions, our education, and our capacity for collective wisdom. Critical thinking taught as a survival skill. Governance structures that can actually move at the speed at which this technology develops. Because right now our institutions and governments operate on timescales of years while AI advances on timescales of weeks/months.\n<ul><li>And maybe politicians who are actually doing things for the right reasons. Actually, all of us need to deal with Jira (for example) and performance every week in our regular jobs, so why can’t politicians? Jira tasks for every politician with daily progress updates, anyone? “What have you actually done this week Mr. president/minister/senator etc? You said you would do xyz last week, but it still hasn’t been done. Why and what is your new ETA? “And so on, you get the idea.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>The question was never whether we can build something smarter than us. The question is whether we can become wise enough to survive what we build.</strong></p><p>I didn’t talk about this at a conference, but I think about this a lot. I like to call us humans <strong>‘the society of backwards’</strong>. We like to do everything backwards. We scale first, then deal with the consequences. We make the planet unlivable, then scramble to fix it. We pollute the oceans, then launch cleanup campaigns. We’ve even started filling space with debris, and we’ll get around to worrying about that, too, at a scale.</p><p>AI is following the same script. Build first, understand later. Ship it, then figure out if it’s safe.</p><p>I used to think this was just about money. And money is part of it; there is always someone who profits from moving fast and thinking slow. But I’ve come to believe it’s something deeper than that. It’s a gap in how we think.

Maybe the most important investment right now isn’t in bigger models or faster chips. Maybe it’s in us. A fraction of those billions going into AI could fund the kind of work that actually prepares humanity for what’s coming – critical thinking, ethics, psychology, the boring, unglamorous stuff that doesn’t make headlines but might be the difference between a future we thrive in and one we merely survive.

After 30 minutes, 40% of your context is gone.</p><p>Context Mode is an MCP server that sits between Claude Code and these outputs. 315 KB becomes 5.4 KB. 98% reduction.</p><p>MCP became the standard way for AI agents to use external tools. But there's a tension at its core: every tool interaction fills the context window from both sides — definitions on the way in, raw output on the way out.</p><p>With 81+ tools active, 143K tokens (72%) get consumed before your first message. Then the tools start returning data. A single Playwright snapshot burns 56 KB. A  dumps 59 KB. Run a test suite, read a log file, fetch documentation — each response eats into what remains.</p><p>Cloudflare showed that tool definitions can be compressed by 99.9% with Code Mode. We asked: what about the other direction?</p><p>Each  call spawns an isolated subprocess with its own process boundary. Scripts can't access each other's memory or state. The subprocess runs your code, captures stdout, and only that stdout enters the conversation context. The raw data — log files, API responses, snapshots — never leaves the sandbox.</p><p>Ten language runtimes are available: JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Shell, Ruby, Go, Rust, PHP, Perl, R. Bun is auto-detected for 3-5x faster JS/TS execution.</p><p>Authenticated CLIs (, , , , ) work through credential passthrough — the subprocess inherits environment variables and config paths without exposing them to the conversation.</p><h2>How the Knowledge Base Works</h2><p>The  tool chunks markdown content by headings while keeping code blocks intact, then stores them in a  (Full-Text Search 5) virtual table. Search uses  — a probabilistic relevance algorithm that scores documents based on term frequency, inverse document frequency, and document length normalization.  is applied at index time so \"running\", \"runs\", and \"ran\" match the same stem.</p><p>When you call , it returns exact code blocks with their heading hierarchy — not summaries, not approximations, the actual indexed content.  extends this to URLs: fetch, convert HTML to markdown, chunk, index. The raw page never enters context.</p><p>Validated across 11 real-world scenarios — test triage, TypeScript error diagnosis, git diff review, dependency audit, API response processing, CSV analytics. All under 1 KB output each.</p><ul><li> 56 KB → 299 B</li><li> 59 KB → 1.1 KB</li><li><strong>Access log (500 requests):</strong> 45 KB → 155 B</li><li><strong>Analytics CSV (500 rows):</strong> 85 KB → 222 B</li><li> 11.6 KB → 107 B</li><li><strong>Repo research (subagent):</strong> 986 KB → 62 KB (5 calls vs 37)</li></ul><p>Over a full session: 315 KB of raw output becomes 5.4 KB. Session time before slowdown goes from ~30 minutes to ~3 hours. Context remaining after 45 minutes: 99% instead of 60%.</p><p>Two ways. Plugin Marketplace gives you auto-routing hooks and slash commands:</p><figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=\"\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"bash\" data-theme=\"github-light\"><code data-language=\"bash\" data-theme=\"github-light\"></code></pre></figure><p>Or MCP-only if you just want the tools:</p><figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=\"\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"bash\" data-theme=\"github-light\"><code data-language=\"bash\" data-theme=\"github-light\"></code></pre></figure><p>Restart Claude Code. Done.</p><p>You don't change how you work. Context Mode includes a PreToolUse hook that automatically routes tool outputs through the sandbox. Subagents learn to use  as their primary tool. Bash subagents get upgraded to  so they can access MCP tools.</p><p>The practical difference: your context window stops filling up. Sessions that used to hit the wall at 30 minutes now run for 3 hours. The same 200K tokens, used more carefully.</p><p>I run the MCP Directory &amp; Hub. 100K+ daily requests. See every MCP server that ships. The pattern was clear: everyone builds tools that dump raw data into context. Nobody was solving the output side.</p><p>Cloudflare's Code Mode blog post crystallized it. They compressed tool definitions. We compress tool outputs. Same principle, other direction.</p><p>Built it for my own Claude Code sessions first. Noticed I could work 6x longer before context degradation. Open-sourced it.</p>",

      "content": "<p>In the United States, we are losing our fondness for cash. As in many other\ncountries, cards and other types of electronic payments now dominate everyday\ncommerce. To some, this is a loss. Cash represented a certain freedom from\nintermediation, a comforting simplicity, that you just don't get from Visa.\nIt's funny to consider, then, how cash is in fact quite amenable to automation.\nEven Benjamin Franklin's face on a piece of paper can feel like a mere proxy\nfor a database transaction. How different from \"e-cash\" is cash itself, when\nit starts and ends its lifecycle through automation?</p><p>Increasing automation of cash reflects the changing nature of banking: decades\nago, a consumer might have interacted with banking primarily through a \"passbook\"\nsavings account, where transactions were so infrequent that the bank recorded\nthem directly in the patron's copy of the passbook. Over the years, nationwide\ntravel and nationwide communications led to the ubiquitous use of inter-bank\nmoney transfers, mostly in the form of the check. The accounts that checks\ntypically drew on—checking accounts—were made for convenience and ease of\naccess. You might deposit your entire paycheck into an account, it might even\nbe sent there automatically... and then when you needed a little walking around\nmoney, you would withdraw cash by the assistance of a teller. By the time I was\na banked consumer, even the teller was mostly gone. Today, we get our cash from\nmachines so that it can be deposited into other machines.</p><p>Cash handling is fraught with peril. Bills are fairly small and easy to hide,\nand yet quite valuable. Automation in the banking world first focused on solving\nthis problem, of reliable and secure cash handling within the bank branch. The\nprimary measure against theft by insiders was that the theft would be discovered,\nas a result of the careful bookkeeping that typifies banks. But, well, that\nbookkeeping was surprisingly labor-intensive in even the bank of the 1950s.</p><p>Histories of the ATM usually focus on just that: the ATM. It's an interesting\nstory, but one that I haven't been particularly inclined to cover due to the\nlack of a compelling angle. Let's try IBM. IBM is such an important, famous\nplayer in business automation that it forms something of a synecdoche for the\nlarger industry. Even so, in the world of bank cash handling, IBM's efforts\nultimately failed... a surprising outcome, given their dominance in the machines\nthat actually did the accounting.</p><p>In this article, we'll examine the history of ATMs—by IBM. IBM was just one of\nthe players in the ATM industry and, by its maturity, not even one of the more\nimportant ones. But the company has a legacy of banking products that put the\nATM in a more interesting context, and despite lackluster adoption of later IBM\nmodels, their efforts were still influential enough that later ATMs inherited\nsome of IBM's signature design concepts. I mean that more literally than you\nmight think. But first, we have to understand where ATMs came from. We'll start\nwith branch banking.</p><p>When you open a bank account, you typically do so at a \"branch,\" one of many\nphysical locations that a national bank maintains. Let us imagine that you are\nopening an account at your local branch of a major bank sometime around 1930;\nwhether before or after that year's bank run is up to you. Regardless of the\nturbulent economic times, the branch became responsible for tracking the balance\nof your account. When you deposit money, a teller writes up a slip. When you\ncome back and withdraw money, a different teller writes up a different slip. At\nthe end of each business day, all of these slips (which basically constitute\na journal in accounting terminology) have to be rounded up by the back office\nand posted to the ledger for your account, which was naturally kept as a card in\na big binder.</p><p>A perfectly practicable 1930s technology, but you can already see the downsides.\nImagine that you appear at a  branch to withdraw money from your\naccount. Fortunately this was not very common at the time, and you would be more\nlikely to use other means of moving money in most scenarios. Still, the bank\ntries to accommodate. The branch at which you have appeared can dispense cash,\nwrite a slip, and then send it to the correct branch for posting... but they\nalso need to post it to their own ledger that tracks transactions for foreign\naccounts, since they need to be able to reconcile where their cash went. And\nthat ignores the whole issue of who you are, whether or not you even have an\naccount at another branch, and whether or not you have enough money to cover the\nwithdrawal. Those are problems that, mercifully, could mostly be sorted out with\na phone call to your home branch.</p><p>Bank branches, being branches, do not exist in isolation. The bank also has a\nheadquarters, which tracks the finances of its various branches—both to know the\nbank's overall financial posture (critical considering how banks fail), and to\nprovide controls against insider theft. Yes, that means that each of the branch\nbanks had to produce various reports and ledger copies and then send them by\ncourier to the bank headquarters, where an army of clerks in yet another back\noffice did yet another round of arithmetic to produce the bank's overall\nledgers.</p><p>As the United States entered World War II, an expanding economy, rapid\nindustrial buildup, and a huge increase in national mobility (brought on by\nthings like the railroads and highways) caused all of these tasks to occur on\nlarger and larger scales. Major banks expanded into a tiered system, in which\nbranches reported their transactions to \"regional centers\" for reconciliation\nand further reporting up to headquarters. The largest banks turned to unit\nrecord equipment or \"business machines,\" arguably the first form of business\ncomputing: punched card machines that did not evaluate programs, but sorted and\nsummed.</p><p>Simple punched card equipment gave way to advanced punched card equipment,\ninnovations like the \"posting machine.\" These did exactly what they promised:\ngiven a stack of punched cards encoding transactions, they produced a ledger\nwith accurately computed sums. Specialized posting machines were made for\nindustries ranging from hospitality (posting room service and dining charges\nto room folios) to every part of finance, and might be built custom to the\nbusiness process of a large customer.</p><p>If tellers punched transactions into cards, the bank could come much\ncloser to automation by shipping the cards around for processing at each office.\nBut then, if transactions are logged in a machine readable format, and then\nprocessed by machines, do we really need to courier them to rooms full of\nclerks?</p><p>Well, yes, because that was the state of technology in the 1930s. But it would\nnot stay that way for long.</p><p>In 1950, Bank of America approached SRI about the feasibility of an automated\ncheck processing system. Use of checks was rapidly increasing, as were total\naccount holders, and the resulting increase in inter-branch transactions was\nclearly overextending BoA's workforce—to such an extent that some branches were\ncurtailing their business hours to make more time for daily closing. By 1950,\ncomputer technology had advanced to such a state that it was obviously possible\nto automate this activity, but it still represented one of the most ambitious\nefforts in business computing to date.</p><p>BoA wanted a system that would not only automate the posting of transactions\nprepared by tellers, but actually automate the handling of the checks\nthemselves. SRI and, later, their chosen manufacturing partner General Electric\nran a multi-year R&amp;D campaign on automated check handling that ultimately lead\nto the design of the checks that we use today: preprinted slips with account\nholder information, and account number, already in place. And, most importantly,\ncertain key fields (like account number and check number) represented in a newly\ndeveloped machine-readable format called \"MICR\" for magnetic ink character\nrecognition. This format remains in use today, to the extent that checks remain\nin use, although as a practical matter MICR has given way to the more familiar\nOCR (aided greatly by the constrained and standardized MICR character set).</p><p>The machine that came out of this initiative was called ERMA, the Electronic\nRecording Machine, Accounting. I will no doubt one day devote a full article\nto ERMA, as it holds a key position in the history of business computing while\nalso managing to not have much of a progeny due to General Electric's failure to\nbecome a serious contender in the computer industry. ERMA did not lead to a\nwhole line of large-scale \"ERM\" business systems as GE had hoped, but it did\nfirmly establish the role of the computer in accounting, automate parts of the\nbookkeeping through almost the entirety of what would become the nation's\nlargest bank, and inspire generations of products from other computer\nmanufacturers.</p><p>The first ERMA system went into use in 1959. While IBM was the leader in unit\nrecord equipment and very familiar to the banking industry, it took a few years\nfor Big Blue to bring their own version. Still, IBM had their own legacy to\nbuild on, including complex electromechanical machines that performed some of\nthe tasks that ERMA was taking over. Since the 1930s, IBM had produced a line of\ncheck processing or \"proofing\" machines. These didn't exactly \"automate\" check\nhandling, but they did allow a single operator to handle a  of documents.</p><p>The IBM 801, 802, and 803 line of check proofers used what were fundamentally\nunit record techniques—keypunch, sorting bins, mechanical totalizers—to present\nchecks one at a time in front of the operator, who read information like the\namount, account number, and check number off of the paper slip and entered it\non a keypad. The machine then whisked the check away, printing the keyed data\n(and reference numbers for auditing) on the back of the check, stamped an\nendorsement, added the check's amounts to the branch's daily totals (including\nsubtotals by document type), and deposited the check in an appropriate sorter\nbin to be couriered to the drawer's bank. While all this happened, the machines\nalso printed the keyed check information and totals onto paper tapes.</p><p>By the early 1960s, with ERMA on the scene, IBM's started to catch up.\nSubsequent check processing systems gained support for MICR, eliminating much\n(sometimes all!) of the operator's keying. Since the check proofing machines\ncould also handle deposit slips, a branch that generated MICR-marked deposit\nslips could eliminate most of the human touchpoints involved in routine banking.\nA typical branch bank setup might involve an IBM 1210 document\nreader/sorter machine connected by serial channel to an IBM 1401 computer.\nThis system behaved much like the older check proofers, reading documents,\nlogging them, and calculating totals. But it was now all under computer control,\nwith the flexibility and complexity that entails.</p><p>One of these setups could process almost a thousand checks a minute with a\nlittle help from an operator, and adoption of electronic technology at other\nstages made clerk's lives easier. For example, IBM's mid-1960s equipment\nintroduced solid-state memory. The IBM 1260 was used for adding machine-readable\nMICR data to documents that didn't already have it. Through an innovation that\nwe would now call a trivial buffer, the 1260's operator could key in the numbers\nfrom the next document while the printer was still working on the previous.</p><p>Along with improvements in branch bank equipment came a new line of \"high-speed\"\nsystems. In a previous career, I worked at a Federal Reserve bank, where\n\"high-speed\" was used as the name of a department in the basement vault. There,\nhuge machines processed currency to pick out bad bills. This use of \"high-speed\"\nseems to date to an IBM collaboration with the Federal Reserve to build machines\nfor central clearinghouses, handling checks by the tens of thousands. By the\ntime I found myself in central banking, the use of \"high-speed\" machinery for\nchecks was a thing of the past—\"digital substitute\" documents or image-based\nclearing having completely replaced physical handling of paper checks. Still,\nthe \"high-speed\" staff labored on in their ballistic glass cages, tending to the\ngreen paper slips that the institution still dispenses by the millions.</p><p>One of the interesting things about the ATM is when, exactly, it pops up in the\nhistory of computers. We are, right now, in the 1960s. The credit card is in its\nnascent stages, MasterCard's predecessor pops up in 1966 to compete with Bank of\nAmerica's own partially ERMA-powered charge card offering. With computer systems\nmaintaining account sums, and document processing machines communicating with\nbookkeeping computers in real-time, it would seem that we are on the very cusp\nof online transaction authorization, which must be the fundamental key to the\nATM. ATMs hand out cash, and one thing we all know about cash is that once you\ngive yours to someone else you are very unlikely to get it back. ATMs, therefore,\nmust not dispense cash unless they can confirm that the account holder is \"good\nfor it.\" Otherwise the obvious fraud opportunity would easily wipe out the\nbenefits.</p><p>So, what do you do? It seems obvious, right? You connect the ATM to the\nbookkeeping computer so it can check account balances before dispensing cash.\nSimple enough.</p><p>But that's not actually how the ATM evolved, not at all. There are plenty of\nreasons. Computers were very expensive so banks centralized functions and not\nall branches had one. Long-distance computer communication links were very\nexpensive as well, and still, in general, an unproven technology. Besides, the\ncomputer systems used by banks were fundamentally batch-mode machines, and it\nwas difficult to see how you would shove an ATM's random interruptions into the\nprogramming model.</p><p>Instead, the first ATMs were token-based. Much like an NYC commuter of the era\ncould convert cash into a subway token, the first ATMs were machines that\nconverted tokens into cash. You had to have a token—and to get one, you appeared\nat a teller during business hours, who essentially dispensed the token as if it\nwere a routine cash withdrawal.</p><p>It seems a little wacky to modern sensibilities, but keep in mind that this was\nthe era of the traveler's check. A lot of consumers didn't want to carry a lot\nof cash around with them, but they did want to be able to get cash after hours.\nBy seeing a teller to get a few ATM tokens (usually worth $10 or £10 and\nsometimes available only in that denomination), you had the ability to retrieve\ncash, but only carried a bank document that was thought (due to features like\nrevocability and the presence of ATMs under bank surveillance) to be relatively\nsecure against theft. Since the tokens were later \"cleared\" against accounts\nmuch like checks, losing them wasn't necessarily a big deal, as something\nanalogous to a \"stop payment\" was usually possible.</p><p>Unlike subway tokens, these were not coin-shaped. The most common scheme was a\npaper card, often the same dimensions as a modern credit card, but with punched\nholes that encoded the denomination and account holder information. The punched\nholes were also viewed as an anti-counterfeiting measure, probably not one that\nwould hold up today, but still a roadblock to fraudsters who would have a hard\ntime locating a keypunch and a valid account number. Manufacturers also\nexplored some other intriguing opportunities, like the very first production\ncash dispenser, 1967's Barclaycash machine. This proto-ATM used punched paper\ntokens that were also printed in part with a Carbon-14 ink. Carbon-14 is\nunstable and emits beta radiation, which the ATM detected with a simple\nelectrostatic sensor. For some reason difficult to divine the radioactive\nATM card did not catch on.</p><p>For roughly the first decade of the \"cash machine,\" they were offline devices\nthat issued cash based on validating a token. The actual decision making, on\nthe worthiness of a bank customer to withdraw cash, was still deferred to the\nteller who issued the tokens. Whether or not you would even consider this an ATM\nis debatable, although historical accounts generally do. They are certainly of a\ndifferent breed than the modern online ATM, but they also set some of the\npatterns we still follow. Consider, for example, the ATMs within my lifespan\nthat accepted deposits in an envelope. These ATMs did nothing with the envelopes\nother than accumulate them into a bin to go to a central processing center later\non—the same way that early token-based ATMs introduced deposit boxes.</p><p>In this theory of ATM evolution, the missing link that made\n1960s-1970s ATMs so primitive was the lack of computer systems that were\namenable to real-time data processing using networked peripherals. The '60s and\n'70s were a remarkable era in computer history, though, seeing the introduction\nof IBM's System/360 and System/370 line. These machines were more powerful,\nmore flexible, and more interoperable than any before them. I think it's fair to\nsay that, despite earlier dabbling, it was the 360/370 that truly ushered in the\nera of business computing. Banks didn't miss out.</p><p>One of the innovations of the System/360 was an improved and standardized\narchitecture for the connection of peripherals to the machine. While earlier\nIBM models had supported all kinds of external devices, there was a lot of\ncustom integration to make that happen. With the System/360, this took the form\nof \"Bisync,\" which I might grandly call a far ancestor of USB. Bisync allowed a\n360 computer to communicate with multiple peripherals connected to a common\nmulti-drop bus, even using different logical communications protocols. While the\nfirst Bisync peripherals were \"remote job entry\" terminals for interacting\nwith the machine via punched cards and teletype, IBM and other manufacturers\nfound more and more applications in the following years.</p><p>IBM had already built document processing machines that interacted with their\ncomputers. In 1971, IBM joined the credit card fray with the 2730, a\n\"transaction\" terminal that we would now recognize as a credit card reader. It\nused a Bisync connection to a System/360-class machine to authorize a credit\ntransaction in real time. The very next year, IBM took the logical next step:\nthe IBM 2984 Cash Issuing Terminal. Like many other early ATMs, the 2984 had its\ndebut in the UK as Lloyds Bank's \"Cashpoint.\"</p><p>The 2984 similarly used Bisync communications with a System/360. While not the\nvery first implementation of the concept, the 2984 was an important step in ATM\nsecurity and the progenitor of an important line of cryptographic algorithms.\nTo withdraw cash, a user inserted a magnetic card that contained an account\nnumber, and then keyed in a PIN. The 2984 sent this information, over the Bisync\nconnection, to the computer, which then responded with a command such as\n\"dispense cash.\" In some cases the computer was immediately on the other side of\nthe wall, but it was already apparent that banks would install ATMs in remote\nlocations controlled via leased telephone lines—and those telephone lines were\nnot well-secured. A motivated attacker (and with cash involved, it's easy to be\nmotivated!) could probably \"tap\" the ATM's network connection and issue it\nspurious \"dispense cash\" commands. To prevent this problem, and assuage the\nconcerns of bankers who were nervous about dispensing cash so far from the\nbranch's many controls, IBM decided to  the network connection.</p><p>The concept of an encrypted network connection was not at all new; encrypted\ncommunications were widely used in the military during the second World War and\nthe concept was well-known in the computer industry. As IBM designed the 2984,\nin the late '60s, encrypted computer links were nonetheless very rare. There\nwere not yet generally accepted standards, and cryptography as an academic\ndiscipline was immature.</p><p>IBM, to secure the 2984's network connection, turned to an algorithm recently\ndeveloped by an IBM researcher named Horst Feistel. Feistel, for silly reasons,\nhad named his family of experimental block ciphers LUCIFER. For the 2984, a\nmodified version of one of the LUCIFER implementations called DSD-1. Through\na Bureau of Standards design competition and the twists and turns of industry\npolitics, DSD-1 later reemerged (with just slight changes) as the Data Encryption\nStandard, or DES. We owe the humble ATM honors for its key role in computer\ncryptography.</p><p>The 2984 was a huge step forward. Unlike the token-based machines of the 1960s,\nit was pretty much the same as the ATMs we use today. To use a 2984, you\ninserted your ATM card and entered a PIN. You could then choose to check your\nbalance, and then enter how much cash you wanted. The machine checked your\nbalance in real time and, if it was high enough, debited your account\nimmediately before coughing up money.</p><p>The 2984 was not as successful as you might expect. The Lloyd's Bank rollout was\nbig, but very few were installed by other banks. Collective memory of the 2984\nis vague enough that I cannot give a definitive reason for its limited success,\nbut I think it likely comes down to a common tale about IBM: price and\nflexibility. The 2984 was essentially a semi-custom peripheral, designed for\nLloyd's Bank and the specific System/360 environment already in place there.\nAdoption for other banks was quite costly. Besides, despite the ATM's lead in\nthe UK, the US industry had quickly caught up. By the time the 2984 would be\nconsidered by other banks, there were several different ATMs available in the US from\nother manufacturers (some of them the same names you see on ATMs today). The\n2984 is probably the first \"modern\" ATM, but since IBM spent 4-5 years\ndeveloping it, it was not as far ahead of the curve on launch day as you might\nexpect. Just a year or two later, a now-forgotten company called Docutel was\ndominating the US market, leaving IBM little room to fit in.</p><p>Because most other ATMs were offered by companies that didn't control the entire\nsoftware stack, they were more flexible, designed to work with simpler host\nsupport. There is something of an inverse vertical integration penalty here:\nwhen introducing a new product, close integration with an existing product\nfamily makes it difficult to sell! Still, it's interesting that the 2984 used\npretty much the same basic architecture as the many ATMs that followed. It's\nworth reflecting on the 2984's relationship with its host, a close dependency\nthat generally holds true for modern ATMs as well.</p><p>The 2984 connected to its host via a Bisync channel (possibly over various\ncarrier or modem systems to accommodate remote ATMs), a communications facility\noriginally provided for remote job entry, the conceptual ancestor of IBM's later\nblock-oriented terminals. That means that the host computer expected the\nperipheral to provide some input for a job and then wait to be sent the results.\nRemote job entry devices, and block terminals later, can be confusing when\ncompared to more familiar, Unix-family terminals. In some ways, they were quite\nsophisticated, with the host computer able to send configuration information\nlike validation rules for input. In other ways, they were very primitive,\ncapable of no real logic other than receiving computer output (which was dumped\nto cards, TTY, or screen) and then sending computer input (from much the same\ndevices). So, the ATM behaved the same way.</p><p>In simple terms, the ATM's small display (called a VDU or Video Display Unit in\ntypical IBM terminology) showed whatever the computer sent as the body of a\n\"display\" command. It dispensed whatever cash the computer indicated with a\n\"dispense cash\" command. Any user input, such as reading a card or entry of a\nPIN number, was sent directly to the computer. The host was responsible for all\nof the actual logic, and the ATM was a dumb terminal, just doing exactly what\nthe computer said. You can think of the Cash Issuing Terminal as, well, just\nthat: a mainframe terminal with a weird physical interface.</p><p>Most modern ATMs follow this same model, although the actual protocol has\nbecome more sophisticated and involves a great deal more XML. You can be\nreassured that when the ATM takes a frustratingly long time to advance to the\nnext screen, it is at least waiting to receive the contents of that screen from\na host computer that is some distance away or, even worse, in The Cloud.</p><p>Incidentally, you might wonder about the software that ran on the host computer.\nI believe that the IBM 2984 was designed for use with CICS, the Customer\nInformation Control System. CICS will one day get its own article, but it\nlaunched in 1966, built specifically for the Michigan Bell to manage customer\nand billing data. Over the following years, CICS was extensively expanded for\nuse in the utility and later finance industries. I don't think it's inaccurate\nto call CICS the first \"enterprise customer relationship management system,\"\nthe first voyage in an adventure that took us through Siebel before grounding\non the rocks of Salesforce. Today we wouldn't think of a CRM as the system of\nrecord for depository finance institutions like banks, but CICS itself was\nvery finance-oriented from the start (telephone companies sometimes felt like\naccounting firms that ran phones on the side) and took naturally to gathering\ntransactions and posting them against customer accounts. Since CICS was designed\nas an online system to serve telephone and in-person customer service reps (in\nfact making CICS a very notable early real-time computing system), it was also a\ngood fit for handling ATM requests throughout the day.</p><div><p>I put a lot of time into writing this, and I hope that you enjoy reading\nit.

I don't think IBM was\nparticularly surprised by the outcome, the 2984 was always a \"request quotation\"\n(e.g. custom) product. IBM probably regarded it as a prototype or pilot with\ntheir friendly customer Lloyds Bank. More than actual deployment, the 2984's\nachievement was paving the way for the IBM 3614 Consumer Transaction Facility.</p><p>In 1970, IBM had replaced the System/360 line with the System/370. The 370 is\ndirectly based on the 360 and uses the same instruction set, but it came with\nnumerous improvements. Among them was a new approach to peripheral connectivity\nthat developed into the IBM Systems Network Architecture, or SNA, basically\nIBM's entry into the computer networking wars of the 1970s and 1980s. While SNA\nwould ultimately cede to IP (with, naturally, an interregnum of SNA-over-IP),\nit gave IBM the foundations for networked systems that are  modern in\ntheir look and feel.</p><p>I say  because SNA was still very much a mainframe-oriented design. An\nexample SNA network might look like this: An S/370 computer running CICS (or\none of several other IBM software packages with SNA support) is connected via\nchannel (the high-speed peripheral bus on mainframe computers, analogous to PCI)\nto an IBM 3705 Communications Controller running the Network Control Program\n(analogous to a network interface controller). The 3705 had one or more\n\"scanners\" installed, which supported simple low-speed serial lines or fast,\nhigh-level protocols like SDLC (synchronous data link control) used by SNA. The\n3705 fills a role sometimes called a \"front-end processor,\" doing the grunt work\nof polling (scanning) communications lines and implementing the SDLC protocol\nso that the \"actual computer\" was relieved of these menial tasks.</p><p>At the other end of one of the SDLC links might be an IBM 3770 Data\nCommunications System, which was superficially a large terminal that, depending\non options ordered, could include a teletypewriter, card reader and punch,\ndiskette drives, and a high speed printer. Yes, the 3770 is basically a grown-up\nremote job entry terminal, and the SNA/SDLC stack was a direct evolution from\nthe Bisync stack used by the 2984. The 3770 had a bit more to offer, though:\nin order to handle its multiple devices, like the printer and card punch, it\nacted as a sort of network switch—the host computer identified the 3770's\ndevices as separate endpoints, and the 3770 interleaved their respective\ntraffic. It could also perform that interleaving function for additional\nperipherals connected to it by serial  lines, which depending on customer\nrequirements often included additional card punches and readers for data entry,\nor line printers for things like warehouse picking slips.</p><p>In 1973, IBM gave banks the SNA treatment with the 3600 Finance Communication\nSystem . A beautifully orange brochure tells us:</p><blockquote><p>The IBM 3600 Finance Communication System is a family of products designed to\nprovide the Finance Industry with remote on-line teller station operation.</p></blockquote><p>System/370 computers represented an enormous investment, generally around a\nmillion dollars and more often above that point than below. They were also large\nand required both infrastructure and staff to support them. Banks were already\nnot inclined to install an S/370 in each branch, so it became a common pattern\nto place a \"full-size\" computer like an S/370 in a central processing center to\nsupport remote peripherals (over leased telephone line) in branches. The 3600\nwas a turn-key product line for exactly this use.</p><p>An S/370 computer with a 3704 or 3705 running the NCP would connect (usually\nover a leased line) to a 3601 System, which IBM describes as a\n\"programmable communications controller\" although they do not seem to have\nelevated that phrase to a product name. The 3601 is basically a minicomputer of\nits own, with up to 20KB of user-available memory and diskette drive. A 3601\nincludes, as standard, a 9600 bps SDLC modem for connection to the host, and a\n9600 bps \"loop\" interface for a local multidrop serial bus. For larger\ninstallations, you could expand a 3601 with additional local loop interfaces or\n4800 or 9600 bps modems to extend the local loop interface to a remote location\nvia telephone line.</p><p>In total, a 3601 could interface up to five peripheral loops with the host\ncomputer over a single interleaved SDLC link. But what would you put on those\nperipheral loops? Well, the 3604 Keyboard Display Unit was the mainstay, with\na vacuum fluorescent display and choice of \"numeric\" (accounting, similar to a\ndesk calculator) or \"data entry\" (alphabetic) keyboard. A bank would put one of\nthese 3604s in front of each teller, where they could inquire into customer\naccounts and enter transactions. In the meantime, 3610 printers provided\ngeneral-purpose document printing capability, including back-office journals\n(logging all transactions) or filling in pre-printed forms such as receipts\nand bank checks. Since the 3610 was often used as a journal printer, it was\navailable with a take-up roller that stored the printed output under a locked\ncover. In fact, basically every part of the 3600 system was available with a\nkey switch or locking cover, a charming reminder of the state of computer\nsecurity at the time.</p><p>The 3612 is a similar printer, but with the addition of a\ndedicated passbook feature. Remember passbook savings accounts, where the bank\nwrites every transaction in a little booklet that the customer keeps? They were\nstill around, although declining in use, in the 1970s. The 3612 had a slot on\nthe front where an appropriately formatted passbook could be inserted, and like\na check validator or slip printer, it printed the latest transaction onto the\nnext empty line. Finally, the 3618 was a \"medium-speed\" printer, meaning 155 lines per minute.\nA branch bank would probably have one, in the back office, used for printing\ndaily closing reports and other longer \"administrative\" output.</p><p>A branch bank could carry out all of its routine business through the 3600\nsystem, including cash withdrawals. In fact, since a customer withdrawing cash\nwould end up talking to a teller who simply keyed the transaction into a 3604,\nit seems like a little more automation could make an ATM part of the system.</p><p>Enter the 3614 Consumer Transaction Facility, the first IBM ATM available as a\nregular catalog item. The 3614 is actually fairly obscure, and doesn't seem to\nhave sold in large numbers. Some sources suggest that it was basically the same\nas the 2984, but with a general facelift and adaptations to connect to a 3601 Finance Communication\nController instead of directly to a front-end processor. Some features which\nwere optional on the 2984, like a deposit slot, were apparently standard on 3614.\nI'm not even quite sure when the 3614 was introduced, but based on manual\ncopyright dates they must have been around by 1977.</p><p>One of the reasons the 3614 is obscure is that its replacement, the IBM 3624\nConsumer Transaction Facility, hit the market in 1978—probably very shortly\nafter the 3614. The 3624 was functionally very similar to the 3614, but with\nmaintainability improvements like convenient portable cartridges for storing\ncash. It also brought a completely redesigned front panel that is more similar\nto modern ATMs. I should talk about the front panels—the IBM ATMs won a few\ndesign awards over their years, and they were really very handsome machines.\nThe backlit logo panel and function-specific keys of the 3624 look more pleasant\nto use than most modern ATMs, although they would of course render translation\ndifficult.</p><p>The 3614/3624 series established a number of conventions that are still in use\ntoday. For example, they added an envelope deposit system in which the machine\naccepted an envelope (with cash or checks) and printed a transaction identifier\non the outside of the envelope for lookup at the processing center. This\nrelieved the user of writing up a deposit slip when using the ATM. It was also\ncapable of not only reading but, optionally, writing to the magnetic strips on\nATM cards. To the modern reader that sounds strange, but we have to discuss one\nof the most enduring properties of the 3614/3624: their handling of PIN numbers.</p><p>I believe the 2984 did something fairly similar, but the details are now obscure\n(and seem to get mixed up with its use of LUCIFER/DSD-1/DES for communications).\nThe 3614/3624, though, so firmly established a particular approach to PIN\nnumbers that it is now known as the 3624 algorithm. Here's how it works: the\nATM reads the card number (called Primary Account Number or PAN) off of the\nATM card, reads a key from memory, and then applies a convoluted cryptographic\nalgorithm to calculate an \"intermediate PIN\" from it. The \"intermediate pin\"\nis then summed with a \"PIN offset\" stored on the card itself, modulo 10, to\nproduce the PIN that the user is actually expected to enter. This means that\nyour \"true\" PIN is a static value calculated from your card number and a key,\nbut as a matter of convenience, you can \"set\" a PIN of your choice by using an\nATM that is equipped to rewrite the PIN offset on your card. This same system,\nwith some tweaks and a lot of terminological drift, is still in use today. You\nwill sometimes hear IBM's intermediate PIN called the \"natural PIN,\" the one\nyou get with an offset of 0, which is a use of language that I find charming.</p><p>Another interesting feature of the 3624 was a receipt printer—I'm not sure if it\nwas the first ATM to offer a receipt, but it was definitely an early one. The\nexact mechanics of the 3624 receipt printer are amusing and the result of some\nhappenstance at IBM. Besides its mainframes and their peripherals, IBM in the\n1970s was was increasingly invested in \"midrange computers\" or \"midcomputers\"\nthat would fill in a space between the mainframe and minicomputer—and, most\nimportantly, make IBM more competitive with the smaller businesses that could\nnot afford IBM's mainframe systems and were starting to turn to competitors like\nDEC as a result. These would eventually blossom into the extremely successful\nAS/400 and System i, but not easily, and the first few models all suffered from\ndecidedly soft sales.</p><p>For these smaller computers, IBM reasoned that they needed to offer peripherals\nlike card punches and readers that were also smaller. Apparently following that\nline of thought to a misguided extent, IBM also designed a smaller punch card:\nthe 96-column three-row card, which was nearly square. The only computer ever\nto support these cards was the very first of the midrange line, the 1969\nSystem/3. One wonders if the System/3's limited success lead to excess stock of\n96-column card equipment, or perhaps they just wanted to reuse tooling. In any\ncase, the oddball System/3 card had a second life as the \"Transaction Statement\nPrinter\" on the 3614 and 3624. The ATM could print four lines of text, 34\ncharacters each, onto the middle of the card. The machines didn't actually punch\nthem, and the printed text ended up over the original punch fields. You could,\nif you wanted, actually order a 3624 with two printers: one that presented the\nslip to the customer, and another that retained it internally for bank auditing.\nA curious detail that would so soon be replaced by thermal receipt printers.</p><p>Unlike IBM's ATMs before it, and, as we will see, unlike those after it as well,\nthe 3624 was a hit. While IBM never enjoyed the dominance in ATMs that they did\nin computers, and companies like NCR and Diebold had substantial market\nshare, the 3624 was widely installed in the late 1970s and would probably be\nrecognized by anyone who was withdrawing cash in that era. The machine had\ntechnical leadership as well: NCR built their successful ATM line in part by\nduplicating aspects of the 3624 design, allowing interoperability with IBM\nbackend systems. Ultimately, as so often happens, it may have been IBM's success\nthat became its undoing.</p><p>In 1983, IBM completely refreshed their branch banking solution with the 4700\nFinance Communication System. While architecturally similar, the 4700 was a big\nupgrade. For one, the CRT had landed: the 4700 peripherals replaced several-line\nVFDs with full-size CRTs typical of other computer terminals, and conventional\ncomputer keyboards to boot. Most radically, though, the 4700 line introduced\n<em>distributed communications</em> to IBM's banking offerings. The 4701 Communications\nController was optionally available with a hard disk, and could be programmed\nin COBOL. Disk-equipped 4701s could operate offline, without a connection to the\nhost, or in a hybrid mode in which they performed some transactions locally and\nonly contacted the host system when necessary. Local records kept by the 4701\ncould be automatically sent to the host computer on a scheduled basis for\nreconciliation.</p><p>Along with the 4700 series came a new ATM: the IBM 473x Personal Banking\nMachines. And with that, IBM's glory days in ATMs came crashing to the ground.\nThe 473x series was such a flop that it is hard to even figure out the model\nnumbers, the 4732 is most often referenced but others clearly existed, including\nthe 4730, 4731, 4736, 4737, and 4738. These various models were introduced from\n1983 to 1988, making up almost a decade of IBM's efforts and very few sales.\nThe 4732 had a generally upgraded interface, including a CRT, but a similar\nfeature set—unsurprising, given that the 3724 had already introduced most of the\nfeatures ATMs have today. It also didn't sell. I haven't been able to find any\nnumbers, but the trade press referred to the 4732 with terms like\n\"debacle,\" so they couldn't have been great.</p><p>There were a few faults in the 4732's stars. First, IBM had made the decision to\nhandle the 4700 Finance Communication System as a complete rework of the 3600.\nThe 4700 controllers could support some 3600 peripherals, but 4700 peripherals\ncould  be used with 3600 controllers. Since 3600 systems were widely\ninstalled in banks, the compatibility choice created a situation where many of\nthe 4732's prospective buyers would end up having to replace a significant\namount of their other equipment, and then likely make software changes, in order\nto support the new machine. That might not have been so bad on its own had IBM's\ncompetitors not provided another way out.</p><p>NCR made their fame in ATMs in part by equipping their contemporary models with\n3624 software emulation, making them a drop-in modernization option for existing\n3600 systems. In general, other ATM manufacturers had pursued a path of\ninteroperability, with multiprotocol ATMs that supported multiple hosts, and\nstandalone ATM host products that could interoperate with multiple backend\naccounting systems. For customers, buying an NCR or Diebold product that would\nwork with whatever they already used was a more appealing option than buying the\nentire IBM suite in one go. It also matched the development cycle of ATMs\nbetter: as a consumer-facing device, ATMs became part of the brand image of the\nbank, and were likely to see replacement more often than back-office devices\nlike teller terminals. NCR offered something like a regular refresh, while IBM\nwas still in a mode of generational releases that would completely replace the\nbank's computer systems.</p><p>The 4732 and its 473x compatriots became the last real IBM ATMs. After a hiatus\nof roughly a decade, IBM reentered the ATM market by forming a joint venture\nwith Diebold called InterBold. The basic terms were that Diebold would sell its\nATMs in the US, and IBM would sell them overseas, where IBM had generally been\nthe more successful of the two brands. The IBM 478x series ATMs, which you might\nencounter in the UK for example, are the same as the Diebold 1000 series in the\nUS. InterBold was quite successful, becoming the dominant ATM manufacturer in\nthe US, and in 1998 Diebold bought out IBM's share.</p><p>IBM had won the ATM market, and then lost it. Along the way, they left us with\nso much texture: DES's origins in the ATM, the 3624 PIN format, the dumb\nterminal or thin client model... even InterBold, IBM's protracted exit, gave us\nquite a legacy: now you know the reason that so many later ATMs ran OS/2. IBM,\na once great company, provided Diebold with their once great operating system.\nUnlike IBM, Diebold made it successful.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Why am I writing this today?\nBecause I am deeply concerned about users losing their most sacred data.</p><p>Over the past year or two, I’ve seen many organizations, large and small, implement passkeys (which is great, thank you!) and use the PRF (Pseudo-Random Function) extension to derive keys to protect user data, typically to support end-to-end encryption (including backups).\nI’ve also seen a number of influential folks and organizations promote the use of PRF for encrypting data.</p><p>The primary use cases I’ve seen implemented or promoted so far include:</p><ul><li>encrypting message backups (including images and videos)</li><li>encrypting documents and other files</li><li>encrypting and unlocking crypto wallets</li><li>credential manager unlocking</li></ul><p>When you overload a credential used for authentication by also using it for encryption, the “blast radius” for losing that credential becomes immeasurably larger.</p><p>Imagine a user named Erika. They are asked to set up encrypted backups in their favorite messaging app because they don’t want to lose their messages and photos, especially those of loved ones who are no longer here.\nErika is prompted to use their passkey to enable these backups.</p><p>There is nothing in the UI that emphasizes that these backups are now tightly coupled to their passkey. Even if there were explanatory text, Erika, like most users, doesn’t typically read through every dialog box, and they certainly can’t be expected to remember this technical detail a year from now.</p><p>A few months pass, and Erika decides to clean up their credential manager. They don’t remember why they had a specific passkey for a messaging app and deletes it.</p><p>Fast forward a year: they get a new phone and set up the messaging app. They aren’t prompted to use a passkey because one no longer exists in their credential manager. Instead, they use phone number verification to recover their account. They are then guided through the “restore backup” flow and prompted for their passkey.</p><p>Since they no longer have it, they are informed that they cannot access their backed up data. Goodbye, memories.</p><p>Here’s a few examples of what a user sees when they delete a passkey:</p><p>How is a user supposed to understand that they are potentially blowing away photos of deceased relatives, an encrypted property deed, or their digital currency?</p><p><strong>We cannot, and should not, expect users to know this.</strong></p><p>At this point, you may be asking why PRF is part of WebAuthn in the first place.\nThere are some very legitimate and more durable uses of PRF in WebAuthn, specifically supporting credential managers and operating systems.</p><p>A passkey with PRF can make unlocking your credential manager (where all of your other passkeys and credentials are stored) much faster and more secure.\nCredential managers have robust mechanisms to protect your vault data with multiple methods, such as master passwords, per-device keys, recovery keys, and social recovery keys.\nLosing access to a passkey used to unlock your credential manager rarely leads to complete loss of your vault data.</p><p>PRF is already implemented in WebAuthn Clients and Credential Managers, so the cat is out of the bag. My asks:</p><ul><li><p><strong>To the wider identity industry</strong>: <strong><em>please stop promoting and using passkeys to encrypt user data. I’m begging you.

This action follows months of negotiations that reached an impasse over <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/statement-department-of-war\">two exceptions</a> we requested to the lawful use of our AI model, Claude: the mass domestic surveillance of Americans and fully autonomous weapons.</p><p>We have not yet received direct communication from the Department of War or the White House on the status of our negotiations.</p><p>We have tried in good faith to reach an agreement with the Department of War, making clear that we support all lawful uses of AI for national security aside from the two narrow exceptions above. To the best of our knowledge, these exceptions have not affected a single government mission to date.</p><p>We held to our exceptions for two reasons. First, we do not believe that today’s frontier AI models are reliable enough to be used in fully autonomous weapons. Allowing current models to be used in this way would endanger America’s warfighters and civilians. Second, we believe that mass domestic surveillance of Americans constitutes a violation of fundamental rights.</p><p>Designating Anthropic as a supply chain risk would be an unprecedented action—one historically reserved for US adversaries, never before publicly applied to an American company. We are deeply saddened by these developments. As the first frontier AI company to deploy models in the US government’s classified networks, Anthropic has supported American warfighters since June 2024 and has every intention of continuing to do so.</p><p>We believe this designation would both be legally unsound and set a dangerous precedent for any American company that negotiates with the government.</p><p>No amount of intimidation or punishment from the Department of War will change our position on mass domestic surveillance or fully autonomous weapons. We will challenge any supply chain risk designation in court.</p><p><strong>What this means for our customers</strong></p><p>Secretary Hegseth has implied this designation would restrict anyone who does business with the military from doing business with Anthropic. The Secretary does not have the statutory authority to back up this statement. Legally, a supply chain risk designation under <a href=\"https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title10-section3252&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim\">10 USC 3252</a> can only extend to the use of Claude as part of Department of War contracts—it cannot affect how contractors use Claude to serve other customers.</p><ul><li><strong>If you are an individual customer or hold a commercial contract with Anthropic</strong>, your access to Claude—through our API, claude.ai, or any of our products—is completely unaffected.</li><li><strong>If you are a Department of War contractor</strong>, this designation—if formally adopted—would only affect your use of Claude on Department of War contract work. Your use for any other purpose is unaffected.</li></ul><p>Our sales and <a href=\"https://support.claude.com/en/\">support</a> teams are standing by to answer any questions you may have.</p><p>We are deeply grateful to our users, and to the industry peers, policymakers, veterans, and members of the public who have voiced their support in recent days. Thank you.

      "content": "<p>There is a lot of energy right now around sandboxing untrusted code. AI agents generating and executing code, multi-tenant platforms running customer scripts, RL training pipelines evaluating model outputs—basically, you have code you did not write, and you need to run it without letting it compromise the host, other tenants, or itself in unexpected ways.</p><p>The word “isolation” gets used loosely. A Docker container is “isolated.” A microVM is “isolated.” A WebAssembly module is “isolated.” But these are fundamentally different things, with different boundaries, different attack surfaces, and different failure modes. I wanted to write down my learnings on what each layer actually provides, because I think the distinctions matter and allow you to make informed decisions for the problems you are looking to solve.</p><h2>The kernel is the shared surface</h2><p>When any code runs on Linux, it interacts with the hardware through the kernel via system calls. The Linux kernel exposes roughly 340 syscalls, and the kernel implementation is tens of millions of lines of C code. Every syscall is an entry point into that codebase.</p><pre><code>Untrusted Code ─( Syscall )─→ Host Kernel ─( Hardware API )─→ Hardware\n                              [ 40M LOC C ]\n</code></pre><p>Every isolation technique is answering the same question of how to reduce or eliminate the untrusted code’s access to that massive attack surface.</p><p>A useful mental model here is shared state versus dedicated state. Because standard containers share the host kernel, they also share its internal data structures like the TCP/IP stack, the Virtual File System caches, and the memory allocators. A vulnerability in parsing a malformed TCP packet in the kernel affects every container on that host. Stronger isolation models push this complex state up into the sandbox, exposing only simple, low-level interfaces to the host, like raw block I/O or a handful of syscalls.</p><p>The approaches differ in where they draw the boundary. Namespaces use the same kernel but restrict visibility. Seccomp uses the same kernel but restricts the allowed syscall set. Projects like gVisor use a completely separate user-space kernel and make minimal host syscalls. MicroVMs provide a dedicated guest kernel and a hardware-enforced boundary. Finally, WebAssembly provides no kernel access at all, relying instead on explicit capability imports. Each step is a qualitatively different boundary, not just a stronger version of the same thing.</p><h2>Namespaces as visibility walls</h2><p>Linux namespaces wrap global system resources so that processes appear to have their own isolated instance. There are eight types, and each isolates a specific resource.</p><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Own process tree, starts at PID 1</td></tr><tr><td>Own mount table, can have different root</td></tr><tr><td>Network interfaces, routing</td><td>Own interfaces, IP addresses, ports</td></tr><tr><td>Can be root inside, nobody outside</td></tr><tr><td>SysV IPC, POSIX message queues</td><td>Own shared memory, semaphores</td></tr><tr></tr><tr><td>System clocks (monotonic, boot)</td><td>Own system uptime and clock offsets</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Namespaces are what Docker containers use. When you run a container, it gets its own PID namespace (cannot see host processes), its own mount namespace (own filesystem view), its own network namespace (own interfaces), and so on.</p><p>The critical thing to understand is <strong>namespaces are visibility walls, not security boundaries</strong>. They prevent a process from  things outside its namespace. They do not prevent a process from  that implements the namespace. The process still makes syscalls to the same host kernel. If there is a bug in the kernel’s handling of any syscall, the namespace boundary does not help.</p><p>In January 2024, <a href=\"https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2024/q1/78\">CVE-2024-21626</a> showed that a file descriptor leak in  (the standard container runtime) allowed containers to access the host filesystem. The container’s mount namespace was intact — the escape happened through a leaked fd that  failed to close before handing control to the container. In 2025, three more  CVEs (CVE-2025-31133, CVE-2025-52565, CVE-2025-52881) demonstrated mount race conditions that allowed writing to protected host paths from inside containers.</p><h2>Cgroups: accounting is not security</h2><p>Cgroups (control groups) limit and account for resource usage: CPU, memory, disk I/O, number of processes. They prevent a container from consuming all available memory or spinning up thousands of processes.</p><p>Cgroups are important for stability, but they are not a security boundary. They prevent denial-of-service, not escape. A process constrained by cgroups still makes syscalls to the same kernel with the same attack surface.</p><p>Seccomp-BPF lets you attach a Berkeley Packet Filter program that decides which syscalls a process is allowed to make. You can deny dangerous syscalls like process tracing, filesystem manipulation, kernel extension loading, and performance monitoring.</p><p>Docker applies a default seccomp profile that blocks around 40 to 50 syscalls. This meaningfully reduces the attack surface. But the key limitation is that seccomp is a filter on the same kernel. The syscalls you allow still enter the host kernel’s code paths. If there is a vulnerability in the write implementation, or in the network stack, or in any allowed syscall path, seccomp does not help.</p><pre><code>Without Seccomp:\n  Untrusted Code ─( ~340 syscalls )─→ Host Kernel\n\nWith Seccomp:\n  Untrusted Code ─( ~300 syscalls )─→ Host Kernel\n</code></pre><p>The attack surface is smaller. The boundary is the same.</p><h3>Running a container in privileged mode</h3><p>This is worth calling out because it comes up surprisingly often. Some isolation approaches require Docker’s privileged flag. For example, building a custom sandbox that uses nested PID namespaces inside a container often leads developers to use privileged mode, because mounting a new  filesystem for the nested sandbox requires the  capability (unless you also use user namespaces).</p><p>If you enable  just to get  for nested process isolation, you have added one layer (nested process visibility) while removing several others (seccomp, all capability restrictions, device isolation). The net effect is arguably weaker isolation than a standard unprivileged container. This is a real trade-off that shows up in production. The ideal solutions are either to grant only the specific capability needed instead of all of them, or to use a different isolation approach entirely that does not require host-level privileges.</p><h2>gVisor and user-space kernels</h2><p>gVisor is where the isolation model changes qualitatively. To understand the difference, it helps to look at the attack surface of a standard container.</p><pre><code>Standard Container (Docker)\n┌───────────────────────┐\n│ Untrusted Code        │\n└──────────┬────────────┘\n           │ ~340 syscalls\n           ▼\n   [ Seccomp Filter ]\n           │ ~300 allowed syscalls\n           ▼\n┌───────────────────────┐\n│ Host Kernel (Ring 0)  │ ◄── FULL ATTACK SURFACE\n└───────────────────────┘\n</code></pre><p>The code runs as a standard Linux process. Seccomp acts as a strict allowlist filter, reducing the set of permitted system calls. However, any allowed syscall still executes directly against the shared host kernel. Once a syscall is permitted, the kernel code processing that request is the exact same code used by the host and every other container. The failure mode here is that a vulnerability in an allowed syscall lets the code compromise the host kernel, bypassing the namespace boundaries.</p><p>Instead of filtering syscalls to the host kernel, gVisor interposes a completely separate kernel implementation called the Sentry between the untrusted code and the host. The Sentry does not access the host filesystem directly; instead, a separate process called the Gofer handles file operations on the Sentry’s behalf, communicating over a restricted protocol. This means even the Sentry’s own file access is mediated.</p><pre><code>gVisor\n┌───────────────────────┐\n│ Untrusted Code        │\n└──────────┬────────────┘\n           │ ~340 syscalls\n           ▼\n┌───────────────────────┐\n│ gVisor Sentry (Ring 3)│ ◄── USER-SPACE KERNEL\n└──────┬────────┬───────┘\n       │        │ 9P / LISAFS\n       │        ▼\n       │  ┌───────────┐\n       │  │   Gofer   │ ◄── FILE I/O PROXY\n       │  └─────┬─────┘\n       │        │\n       ▼        ▼\n┌───────────────────────┐\n│ Host Kernel (Ring 0)  │ ◄── REDUCED ATTACK SURFACE\n└───────────────────────┘\n  (~70 host syscalls from Sentry)\n</code></pre><p>The Sentry intercepts the untrusted code’s syscalls and handles them in user-space. It reimplements around 200 Linux syscalls in Go, which is enough to run most applications. When the Sentry actually needs to interact with the host to read a file, it makes its own highly restricted set of roughly 70 host syscalls. This is not just a smaller filter on the same surface; it is a completely different surface. The failure mode changes significantly. An attacker must first find a bug in gVisor’s Go implementation of a syscall to compromise the Sentry process, and then find a way to escape from the Sentry to the host using only those limited host syscalls.</p><p>The Sentry intercepts syscalls using one of several mechanisms, such as seccomp traps or KVM, with the default since 2023 being the seccomp-trap approach known as systrap.</p><p>What this means in practice is that if someone discovers a bug in the Linux kernel’s I/O implementation, containers using Docker are directly exposed. A gVisor sandbox is not, because those syscalls are handled by the Sentry, and the Sentry does not expose them to the host kernel.</p><p>The trade-off is performance. Every syscall goes through user-space interception, which adds overhead. I/O-heavy workloads feel this the most. For short-lived code execution like scripts and tests, it is usually fine, but for sustained high-throughput I/O, it can matter.</p><p>Also, by adopting gVisor, you are betting that it’s easier to audit and maintain a smaller footprint of code (the Sentry and its limited host interactions) than to secure the entire massive Linux kernel surface against untrusted execution. That bet is not free of risk, gVisor itself has had security vulnerabilities in the Sentry but the surface area you need to worry about is drastically smaller and written in a memory-safe language.</p><h2>Defense in depth on top of gVisor</h2><p>gVisor gives you the user-space kernel boundary. What it does not give you automatically is multi-job isolation within a single gVisor sandbox. If you are running multiple untrusted executions inside one  container, you still need to layer additional controls. Here is one pattern for doing that:</p><ul><li><strong>Per-job PID + mount + IPC namespaces</strong> via  — so each execution is isolated from other executions inside the same gVisor sandbox</li><li><strong>Seccomp-BPF inside the namespace</strong> — blocking syscalls like  (preventing nested namespace escape),  (force fallback to ), , kernel module loading</li><li> — run as  (UID 65534) with </li><li> for all writable paths — cleanup is a single  syscall, not a recursive directory walk</li><li><strong>Read-only root filesystem</strong> — the container itself is immutable</li><li><strong>Capability-based file APIs</strong> — use  or similar to confine file writes to the work directory, preventing path traversal via </li><li> — compute isolation means nothing if the sandbox can freely phone home. Options range from disabling networking entirely, to running an allowlist proxy (like Squid) that blocks DNS resolution inside the sandbox and forces all traffic through a domain-level allowlist, to dropping  so the sandbox cannot bypass DNS with raw sockets.</li></ul><pre><code>gVisor Container (runsc)\n └─ Per-job PID + Mount Namespace\n     └─ Seccomp BPF Filter\n         └─ Privilege Drop\n             └─ Network Egress Control\n                 └─ Ephemeral tmpfs\n                     └─ Capability-confined File Writes\n</code></pre><p>Each layer catches different attack classes. A namespace escape inside gVisor reaches the Sentry, not the host kernel. A seccomp bypass hits the Sentry’s syscall implementation, which is itself sandboxed. Privilege escalation is blocked by dropping privileges. Persistent state leakage between jobs is prevented by ephemeral tmpfs with atomic unmount cleanup.</p><p>A practical detail that matters is the process that creates child sandboxes must itself be fork-safe. If you are running an async runtime, forking from a multithreaded process is inherently unsafe because child processes inherit locked mutexes and can corrupt state. The solution is a fork server pattern where you fork a single-threaded launcher process before starting the async runtime, then have the async runtime communicate with the launcher over a Unix socket. The launcher creates children, entirely avoiding the multithreaded fork problem.</p><pre><code>Startup\n  fork() → Launcher (Single-threaded, Poll Loop)\n               │\n               ├─ clone3(NEWPID | NEWNS | NEWIPC)\n               │\n               └─ Child (Mount, Privdrop, Seccomp, Execve)\n\nMain Server (Async Runtime)\n  │\n  └─ AF_UNIX SEQPACKET ─→ Launcher\n</code></pre><h2>MicroVMs for hardware boundaries</h2><p>MicroVMs use hardware virtualization backed by the CPU’s extensions to run each workload in its own virtual machine with its own kernel.</p><pre><code>MicroVM Architecture\n┌───────────────────────┐\n│ Untrusted Code        │\n└──────────┬────────────┘\n           │ Syscalls\n           ▼\n┌───────────────────────┐\n│ Guest Kernel (Ring 0) │ ◄── DEDICATED KERNEL\n└──────────┬────────────┘\n           │ VirtIO / MMIO\n           ▼\n┌───────────────────────┐\n│ KVM Hypervisor (Host) │ ◄── HARDWARE BOUNDARY\n└──────────┬────────────┘\n           │ Secure API\n           ▼\n┌───────────────────────┐\n│ VMM (User-Space)      │ ◄── DEVICE EMULATION\n└───────────────────────┘\n</code></pre><p>Code runs in a completely separate, hardware-backed environment with its own guest kernel. It is important to separate the concepts here. The hypervisor is the capability built into the Linux kernel that manages the CPU’s hardware virtualization extensions. The Virtual Machine Monitor is a user-space process that configures the VM, allocates memory, and emulates minimal hardware devices. The microVM itself is a VM that has been stripped of legacy PC cruft so it boots in milliseconds and uses minimal memory.</p><p>Escaping the guest kernel requires finding a vulnerability in the Virtual Machine Monitor’s device emulation or the CPU’s virtualization features, which are rare and highly prized.</p><p>The guest runs in a separate virtual address space enforced by the CPU hardware. A bug in the guest kernel cannot access host memory because the hardware prevents it. The host kernel only sees the user-space process. The attack surface is the hypervisor and the Virtual Machine Monitor, both of which are orders of magnitude smaller than the full kernel surface that containers share.</p><p>You generally see two different approaches to Virtual Machine Monitor design depending on the workload. The first is strict minimalism, seen in projects like Firecracker. Built specifically for running thousands of tiny, short-lived functions on a single server, it intentionally leaves out complex features like hot-plugging CPUs or passing through physical GPUs. The goal is simply the smallest possible attack surface and memory footprint.</p><p>The second approach offers broader feature support, seen in projects like Cloud Hypervisor or QEMU microvm. Built for heavier and more dynamic workloads, it supports hot-plugging memory and CPUs, which is useful for dynamic build runners that need to scale up during compilation. It also supports GPU passthrough, which is essential for AI workloads, while still maintaining the fast boot times of a microVM.</p><p>The trade-off versus gVisor is that microVMs have higher per-instance overhead but stronger, hardware-enforced isolation. For CI systems and sandbox platforms where you create thousands of short-lived environments, the boot time and memory overhead add up. For long-lived, high-security workloads, the hardware boundary is worth it.</p><p>Snapshotting is a feature worth noting. You can capture a running VM’s state including CPU registers, memory, and devices, and restore it later. This enables warm pools where you boot a VM once, install dependencies, snapshot it, and restore clones in milliseconds instead of booting fresh each time. This is how some platforms achieve incredibly fast cold starts even with full VM isolation.</p><h2>WebAssembly with no kernel at all</h2><p>WebAssembly takes a fundamentally different approach. Instead of running native code and filtering its kernel access, WASM runs code in a memory-safe virtual machine that has no syscall interface at all. All interaction with the host happens through explicitly imported host functions.</p><pre><code>WebAssembly (WASM)\n┌───────────────────────┐\n│ Untrusted Code        │\n└──────────┬────────────┘\n           │ Function Calls\n           ▼\n┌───────────────────────┐\n│ WASM Runtime (Host)   │ ◄── MEMORY-SAFE VM\n└──────────┬────────────┘\n           │ Imported Host Functions\n           ▼\n┌───────────────────────┐\n│ Allowed Host APIs     │ ◄── EXPLICIT CAPABILITIES\n└───────────────────────┘\n</code></pre><p>Code runs in a strict sandbox where the only allowed operations are calling functions provided by the host. If the host doesn’t provide a file reading function, the WASM module simply cannot read files. The failure mode here requires a vulnerability in the WASM runtime itself, like an out-of-bounds memory read that bypasses the linear memory checks.</p><p>There is no syscall surface to attack because the code never makes syscalls. Memory safety is enforced by the runtime. The linear memory is bounds-checked, the call stack is inaccessible, and control flow is type-checked. Modern runtimes add guard pages and memory zeroing between instances.</p><p>The performance characteristics are attractive with incredibly fast cold starts and minimal memory overhead. But the practical limitation is language support. You cannot run arbitrary Python scripts in WASM today without compiling the Python interpreter itself to WASM along with all its C extensions. For sandboxing arbitrary code in arbitrary languages, WASM is not yet viable. For sandboxing code you control the toolchain for, it is excellent. I am, however, quite curious if there is a future for WASM in general-purpose sandboxing. Browsers have spent decades solving a similar problem of executing untrusted code safely, and porting those architectural learnings to backend infrastructure feels like a natural evolution.</p><p>Putting it all together, the landscape spans from fast and weak isolation to slower and highly secure isolation.</p><pre><code>                     Isolation strength →\n                     Attack surface     ↓\n\nNamespaces      Seccomp       gVisor         MicroVM         WASM\n   │               │             │              │              │\n   │  visibility   │  syscall    │  separate    │  hardware    │  no kernel\n   │  walls only   │  filter on  │  kernel in   │  boundary    │  access at\n   │               │  same       │  user-space  │  via KVM     │  all\n   │               │  kernel     │              │              │\n   ▼               ▼             ▼              ▼              ▼\n  Fast            Fast         Moderate       Slower        Fastest\n  Weakest         Weak         Strong         Strongest     Strong*\n                                                           (*limited scope)\n</code></pre><p>For running trusted code that you wrote and reviewed, Docker with a seccomp profile is probably fine. The isolation is against accidental interference, not adversarial escape.</p><p>For running untrusted code in a multi-tenant environment, like short-lived scripts, AI-generated code, or customer-provided functions, you need a real boundary. gVisor gives you a user-space kernel boundary with good compatibility, while a microVM gives you a hardware boundary with the strongest guarantees. Either is defensible depending on your threat model and performance requirements.</p><p>For reinforcement learning training pipelines where AI-generated code is evaluated in sandboxes across potentially untrusted workers, the threat model is both the code and the worker. You need isolation in both directions, which pushes toward microVMs or gVisor with defense-in-depth layering.</p><p>What I’ve learned is that the common mistake is treating isolation as binary. It’s easy to assume that if you use Docker, you are isolated. The reality is that standard Docker gives you namespace isolation, which is just visibility walls on a shared kernel. Whether that is sufficient depends entirely on what you are protecting against.</p><p>It is also worth remembering that compute isolation is only half the problem. You can put code inside a gVisor sandbox or a Firecracker microVM with a hardware boundary, and none of it matters if the sandbox has unrestricted network egress for your “agentic workload”. An attacker who cannot escape the kernel can still exfiltrate every secret it can read over an outbound HTTP connection. Network policy where it is a stripped network namespace with no external route, a proxy-based domain allowlist, or explicit capability grants for specific destinations is the other half of the isolation story that is easy to overlook. The apply case here can range from disabling full network access to using a proxy for redaction, credential injection or simply just allow listing a specific set of DNS records.</p><h2>Local sandboxing on developer machines</h2><p>Everything above is about server-side multi-tenant isolation, where the threat is adversarial code escaping a sandbox to compromise a shared host. There is a related but different problem on developer machines: AI coding agents that execute commands locally on your laptop. The threat model shifts. There is no multi-tenancy. The concern is not kernel exploitation but rather preventing an agent from reading your  keys, exfiltrating secrets over the network, or writing to paths outside the project. Or you know if you are running Clawdbot locally, then everything is fair game.</p><p>The approaches here use OS-level permission scoping rather than kernel boundary isolation.</p><p><a href=\"https://cursor.com/blog/agent-sandboxing\">Cursor</a> uses Apple’s Seatbelt () on macOS and Landlock plus seccomp on Linux. It generates a dynamic policy at runtime based on the workspace: the agent can read and write the open workspace and , read the broader filesystem, but cannot write elsewhere or make network requests without explicit approval. This reduced agent interruptions by roughly 40% compared to requiring approval for every command, because the agent runs freely within the fence and only asks when it needs to step outside.</p><p>OpenAI’s <a href=\"https://developers.openai.com/codex/security/\">Codex CLI</a> takes a similar approach with explicit modes: ,  (the default), and . Network access is disabled by default. Claude Code and Gemini CLI both support sandboxing but ship with it off by default.</p><p>The common pattern across all of these seems to be filesystem and network ACLs enforced by the OS, not a separate kernel or hardware boundary. A determined attacker who already has code execution on your machine could potentially bypass Seatbelt or Landlock restrictions through privilege escalation. But that is not the threat model. The threat is an AI agent that is mostly helpful but occasionally careless or confused, and you want guardrails that catch the common failure modes - reading credentials it should not see, making network calls it should not make, writing to paths outside the project.</p><p>Apple’s new <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/346/\">Containerization framework</a> (announced at WWDC 2025) is interesting here. Unlike Docker on Mac, which runs all containers inside a single shared Linux VM, Apple gives each container its own lightweight VM via the <a href=\"https://github.com/apple/containerization\">Virtualization framework</a> on Apple Silicon. Each container gets its own kernel, its own ext4 filesystem, and its own IP address. It is essentially the microVM model applied to local development, with OCI image compatibility. It is still early, but it collapses the gap between “local development containers” and “properly isolated sandboxes” in a way that Docker Desktop never did.</p><p>The landscape is moving in a clear direction. There is a lot of exciting new tech out there, with people constantly pushing the limits of cold starts toward faster, securely isolated workloads using Python decorators and other novel approaches to make microvms feel like containers. I am excited to see what comes next in this space. It is definitely an area to watch.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Back in 2024 I learned about SDF (signed distance field) rendering of fonts. I was trying to implement outlines and shadows in a single pass instead of drawing over the text multiple times in different styles. I intended to use these fonts for two different projects, a game and a map generator. I got things working but didn’t fully understand why certain things worked or didn’t work. I wrote some notes on my site about what I tried. In the end, I stopped working on both the game’s fonts and the map generator, so I put all of this on hold.</p><p>Fast forward to late 2025, and my incomplete notes sometimes show up on the first page of search results for <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=sdf+fonts\">“sdf fonts”</a>! Surely that isn’t the best page on the topic. It would be better to point to library documentation or maybe one of the research papers about the topic. My page .</p><p>Initially my thought was “search engines are in their decline” but then I decided “this is an opportunity”. I decided to  of being the top search result.</p><p>I first looked through everything I had written. I already had started an “overview” page but hadn’t gotten very far on it. I also have  that were “diary style”, about what I did rather than what you should know.</p><p>The overview page covered how to use various SDF font libraries (msdfgen, stb_truetype, tiny-sdf, etc.). I wrote code for multiple libraries, had sketched out diagrams for various concepts, and had screenshots of outputs from each of those libraries.</p><p>At some point I realized the scope was too large. I had spent the most time with msdfgen and hadn’t yet learned enough about the other libraries to write a proper guide. They all worked differently. I kept getting stuck. So . In redesign 2 I decided to only use msdfgen, but show the various tradeoffs involved (atlas size, antialias width, shader derivatives, smoothing function).</p><p>I made several diagrams for concepts, such as:</p><p>And I started running tests. I wanted to compare the effect of atlas size, so I made lots of screenshots and started looking closely. I wanted to come up with a way to recommend a specific size. I wanted to make recommendations for all the other parameters. I showed all the commands I ran.</p><p>At some point I realized I could run tests forever. And I had already done that last year, and wrote it up in blog posts (<a href=\"https://www.redblobgames.com/blog/2024-11-08-sdf-headless-tests/\">one</a> and <a href=\"https://www.redblobgames.com/blog/2024-11-17-sdf-headless-tests/\">two</a>). Doing it again here didn’t seem especially valuable. So  to a “how to” page. In redesign 3 I decided to show the concepts, then a JavaScript implementation using CPU rendering, and then another implementation using GPU rendering. I made new versions of the diagrams:</p><p>I was making progress on that page but it didn’t  like a Red Blob Games page. The page started out with tons of shell commands, and then showed lots of code. It felt like a page that only I would find useful. So  and designed a “concepts” page. In redesign 4 I focused on what effects I wanted, how SDF works, and how to use it to create those effects. I again reduced the scope by removing the implementation details. What I had already written, I moved to a separate (unpolished) page. And I never wrote a standalone downloadable project like I originally wanted.</p><p>Sometimes it takes a long time before I figure out what I actually want to write, and then everything falls into place:</p><p><strong>I’m finally happy with the page.</strong><a href=\"https://www.redblobgames.com/articles/sdf-fonts/\">Take a look!</a> I hope search engines point to it eventually.</p>",

      "content": "<div>Daniel Joseph Simmons passed away on February 21, 2026 in Longmont, Colorado at age 77. His beloved wife Karen and daughter Jane were at his side. </div><p>Dan was born in Peoria, Illinois on April 4, 1948 to his parents Robert A. Simmons and Kathryn H. (Catton) Simmons. His childhood was filled with happy memories of riding bikes with friends throughout cornfield-lined roads in the Midwest, first in Brimfield, Illinois and then in Pittsboro, Indiana. </p><p>He graduated with an English degree from Wabash College in Crawfordsville, Indiana, and earned a graduate degree in education from Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. </p><p>Dan embarked on a career as an elementary school teacher in Missouri, later teaching in Buffalo, New York, and Longmont, Colorado, where he taught sixth grade. During his eighteen years in education, he co-created and taught a districtwide program for gifted students that was the first of its kind, and he was named a finalist for the Colorado Teacher of the Year.</p><p>Dan had a profound passion for teaching, and was beloved by many of his students for his innovative, energizing, and creative approach in the classroom. He brought science to life for his students with Carl Sagan’s Cosmos series, ran interactive simulations on topics like the Cuban Missile Crisis and the harmful effects of discrimination, and incorporated his love of topics like Greek mythology, film, and art into his lectures. </p><p>Every day after lunch, Dan told his students a daily installment of an epic tale that started on the first day of school. As they listened, the students would color illustrations that he’d drawn for them. When the story finally came to an end on the last day of school, many recall being reduced to tears. This story would go on to become Dan’s Hyperion cantos (1989), a critically acclaimed, four-part science fiction classic. </p><p>Over the course of his life, former students would tell Dan that they still had their notes from his Black history lectures, and that he had inspired their lifelong love of reading and writing. Long after he left the classroom, he continued to share what he loved with everyone around him, teaching his grandchildren all about the 1950s era monster movies that he loved, and giving endearingly professorial introductions to films that he and Karen shared with scores of friends when they hosted backyard summer movies.</p><p>In addition to teaching, reading and writing were the great loves of Dan’s life. As a child, he read everything he could find, spanning from comic books to literary classics and nonfiction. Throughout his life, he particularly loved learning about space, science, and history. Starting in early childhood, Dan had a remarkable gift for storytelling, which would become his life's work. His first published story came out on the day his daughter Jane was born, a day that confirmed to him that his true love was his family.</p><p>In 1987, Dan took a daring leap and left teaching to follow his dream to work full-time as an author. His debut novel, Song of Kali (1985), was inspired by three days that he spent in Kolkata, India, and won the 1986 World Fantasy Award. </p><p>He went on to write thirty-one novels and short story collections, many of which were honored with accolades ranging from Bram Stoker awards, Locus awards, the Shirley Jackson award, and the prestigious Hugo award. His most meaningful award was an honorary doctorate from Wabash College, a place that changed his life and set him on a path towards a life well lived. His titles have been published in 28 foreign countries and translated into at least 20 languages, and his many book tours, conferences, and workshops took him all over the world. </p><p>Like his early reading pursuits, Dan always wrote about what he loved. He defied literary norms by writing across genres, switching between major publishers, and defying pressure to conform to formulaic novels. His works span from historical fiction to horror, hard-boiled crime, and speculative fiction. They explore topics ranging from Ernest Hemingway’s WWII Cuban spy ring to mountain climbing in the Himalayas. In 2018, his novel The Terror (2007) was released as an AMC limited series. Dan was a profoundly curious learner who delighted in connecting with other curious minds, and the many stories he dreamed up helped him connect with others throughout his entire life.</p><p>Dan is predeceased by his parents and his brother Ted. He is survived by his loving wife and daughter, Karen and Jane Simmons; his beloved grandchildren, Milo and Lucia Glenn; and his brother, Wayne Simmons.</p><p>Dan's cremation has been entrusted to Ahlberg Funeral Chapel of Longmont, Colorado. His ashes will be scattered at a later date. Details for a Celebration of Life are pending.</p><p>Gifts in memory of Dan may be made to Wabash College online at <a href=\"http://www.wabash.edu/give\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.wabash.edu/give</a> or to Wabash College Advancement Office 301 W. Wabash Ave. Crawfordsville, IN 47933. </p><p>Please visit <a href=\"http://www.ahlbergfuneralchapel.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.ahlbergfuneralchapel.com</a> for upcoming service information, to make a memorial donation to Wabash College and to share fond memories and condolences with his loving family.</p>",

      "content": "<p>A couple years ago, I was on the way back from a work trip to Germany. I had been upgraded to business class, and I sat next to a Belgian 747 pilot, probably in his fifties or sixties. We talked a fair bit about our careers. I had left the Navy and started professionally programming less than a year before. He had been a pilot since shortly after graduating university, and had flown the 747 for about twenty years. He had studied mechanical engineering at school, and he told me in great depth about the variable geometry jet turbines in modern aircraft, which could remain efficient across a wide altitude range.</p><p>I expressed some jealousy about how well suited he was to his job. Clearly he was a geek for aircraft, and even though most airlines don’t fly the 747 anymore, it is an incredible machine. He agreed that it was a privilege to fly the plane, but said wistfully:</p><blockquote><p>In this job, after a while, there’s no improvement. You are no better today than you were yesterday.</p></blockquote><p>He said that by now, he knew the 747 about as well as a pilot could. In fact, he sometimes wished he had become an engineer or designer of airplanes, so that he could learn new things as a core part of his job. Then he said:</p><blockquote><p>You are lucky that your job is like that.</p></blockquote><p>Since that flight, my job has changed a great deal. Coding agents can do a large portion of what I previously considered my work. I’m one of the last people who should be upset about this, since I work at an AI lab and stand to gain a great deal if AI follows through on its economic promise. Still, it has changed how I solve problems, and at times I feel more like a pilot than an engineer.</p><p>In the past, when I fixed a bug or implemented a feature, I would have to spend a minimum amount of effort understanding the situation. For example, to add pagination to this website, I would read the <a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pagination/\">Jekyll docs</a>, find the right <a href=\"https://github.com/sverrirs/jekyll-paginate-v2\">plugin</a> to install, read the <a href=\"https://github.com/sverrirs/jekyll-paginate-v2/blob/master/README-GENERATOR.md#site-configuration\">sample config</a>, and make the change. Possibly this wouldn’t work, in which case I would Google it, read more, try more stuff, retest, etc. In this process it was hard not to learn things. I would walk away from the problem with a better understanding of how the system worked. If I had to implement the feature again, I would be able to do it faster and more easily.</p><p>Once LLMs started getting good at coding, I would occasionally ask them for help at the beginning of this process, mostly replacing search engines. If I hit an error, I would copy and paste it into a chatbot to see what it said before trying hard to understand it (often, before reading it). This didn’t replace critical thinking, though, since I would still need to learn and plan to implement the change.</p><p>With the AI coding agents of the last few months, though, things are different. Often the agent can implement a whole feature end-to-end, with no involvement from me. Now when I need to make a change to the codebase, I don’t start by trying to understand. Instead, I see if my coding agent can “one-shot” the problem, and only step in if it seems to be failing. This happens less and less, and the features that I trust agents with have become bigger and bigger.</p><p>I believe in coding primarily as a means to an end. Coding agents have allowed me to do much more than before, so for the most part I am happy with them! But I’ll admit there is also something bothersome about turning features over to AI fully.</p><p>I do not build skills or knowledge as quickly this way. If I build a feature with a coding agent and then have to do it again, I won’t be any faster the second time. It’s possible to imagine writing code with AI for twenty years and not being much more skillful at the end of it. There’s no improvement.</p><p>If I do have to step in and save the LLM, I often become lost as well. All of a sudden, I am reading someone else’s code. Rather than gradually coming to terms with a solution to a problem, I am presented with the solution wholesale—only, it’s a little bit wrong. As LLMs handle bigger tasks for me, this gets worse. My only saving grace is that I will do it less often.</p><p>You might say that the new, real skill is <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/rodgerdeanduncan/2025/10/16/prompting-the-21st-century-skill-that-will-change-how-we-work/\">prompting agents</a> (<a href=\"https://archive.ph/t4y24\">archived</a>), but I don’t believe that. Prompting is easy and <a href=\"https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/a-guide-to-prompting-ai-for-what\">will only get easier</a>. Hard knowledge about programming and the problem is what helps you make good design decisions, so this knowledge is the most important factor determining whether your coding agents are successful. Developing this knowledge is becoming optional.</p><p>Some people will probably respond to this by saying (snottily) that I should read the code that my agents produce, rather than rely on them blindly. I do read the code, but reviewing code is very different from producing it, and surely teaches you less. If you don’t believe this, I doubt you work in software.</p><p>Coding agents are here to stay, and you’re a fool if you don’t use them. Still, I think you’ll use them most successfully if you understand the domain in which you’re working. This used to be an essential byproduct of programming, but that’s not the case anymore. To this end, maybe it’s a good idea to write a minimum amount of code by hand as an educational task, rather than a productive one, or to try to write the solution to a problem yourself, and only compare with the LLM once you’re confident your answer is correct.</p>",

The app had more than 100,000 views and around 400 upvotes at the time Khan began his probe.</p><p>The main issue, Khan said, was that all apps that are vibe-coded on Lovable's platform are shipped with their backends powered by Supabase, which handles authentication, file storage, and real-time updates through a PostgreSQL database connection.</p><p>However, when the developer – in this case AI – or the human project owner fails to explicitly implement crucial security features like Supabase's row-level security and role-based access, code will be generated that looks functional but in reality is flawed.</p><p>One example of this was a malformed authentication function. The AI that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/24/opinion_column_vibe_coding/\">vibe-coded</a> the Supabase backend, which uses remote procedure calls, implemented it with flawed access control logic, essentially blocking authenticated users and allowing access to unauthenticated users.</p><p>Khan said the intent was to block non-admins from accessing parts of the app, but the faulty implementation blocked all logged-in users – an error he said was repeated across multiple critical functions.</p><p>\"This is backwards,\" said Khan. \"The guard blocks the people it should allow and allows the people it should block. A classic logic inversion that a human security reviewer would catch in seconds – but an AI code generator, optimizing for 'code that works,' produced and deployed to production.\"</p><p>Because the app itself was a platform for creating exam questions and viewing grades, the userbase is naturally comprised of teachers and students. Some were from top US universities such as UC Berkeley and UC Davis, while there were \"K-12 institutions with minors likely on the platform\" as well, Khan <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/lovable-more-like-hackable-taimur-khan-cewdf/?trackingId=%2BscO7NGeQ0%2BpVd7b1U0fYA%3D%3D\" rel=\"nofollow\">said</a>.</p><p>With the security flaws in place, an unauthenticated attacker could trivially access every user record, send bulk emails through the platform, delete any user account, grade student test submissions, and access organizations' admin emails, for example.</p><p>Of the 18,697 total user records exposed, 14,928 contained unique email addresses. The dataset included 4,538 student accounts – all with email addresses – 10,505 enterprise users, and 870 users whose full PII was exposed.</p><p>The security flaws here are not exclusive to apps hosted by Lovable; the issue is broader and well-told by now.</p><p>Vibe coding, Collins Dictionary's Word of the Year for 2025, promised to break down software development's steep learning curve and empower any prompt jockey to bring their app ideas to life.</p><p>Veracode, for instance, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.veracode.com/blog/ai-generated-code-security-risks/\" rel=\"nofollow\">recently found</a> that 45 percent of AI-generated code contained security flaws, not to mention the myriad <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/05/mcpoison_bug_abuses_cursor_mcp/\">tales</a> of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/20/openclaw_snuck_into_cline_package/\">woe</a> reported by  in recent months.</p><p>Khan said he believes Lovable should take responsibility for the security of the apps it hosts, and was especially peeved when, after reporting his findings via company support, his ticket was reportedly closed without response.</p><p>\"If Lovable is going to market itself as a platform that generates production-ready apps with authentication 'included,' it bears some responsibility for the security posture of the apps it generates and promotes,\" Khan said.</p><p>\"You can't showcase an app to 100,000 people, host it on your own infrastructure, and then close the ticket when someone tells you it's leaking user data. At minimum, a basic security scan of showcased applications would have caught every critical finding in this report.\"</p><p>Lovable told  that the company has contacted the owner of the app in question and takes \"any findings of this kind extremely seriously.\"</p><p>Regarding the closed ticket, Lovable CISO Igor Andriushchenko said that the company only received \"a proper disclosure report\" on the evening of February 26 and acted on the findings \"within minutes.\"</p><p>\"Any project built with Lovable includes a free security scan before publishing,\" Andriushchenko told . \"This scan checks for vulnerabilities and, if found, provides recommendations on actions to take to resolve before publishing.</p><p>\"Ultimately, it is at the discretion of the user to implement these recommendations. In this case, that implementation did not happen.</p><p>\"This project also includes code not generated by Lovable and the vulnerable database is not hosted by Lovable. We have been in contact with the creator of the app, who is now addressing the issue.\" ®</p>",

      "content": "<p>We’re always looking for ways to make Go programs faster. In the last\n2 releases, we have concentrated on mitigating a particular source of\nslowness, heap allocations. Each time a Go program allocates memory\nfrom the heap, there’s a fairly large chunk of code that needs to run\nto satisfy that allocation. In addition, heap allocations present\nadditional load on the garbage collector.  Even with recent\nenhancements like <a href=\"https://go.dev/blog/greenteagc\">Green Tea</a>, the garbage collector\nstill incurs substantial overhead.</p><p>So we’ve been working on ways to do more allocations on the stack\ninstead of the heap.  Stack allocations are considerably cheaper to\nperform (sometimes completely free).  Moreover, they present no load\nto the garbage collector, as stack allocations can be collected\nautomatically together with the stack frame itself. Stack allocations\nalso enable prompt reuse, which is very cache friendly.</p><h2>Stack allocation of constant-sized slices</h2><p>Consider the task of building a slice of tasks to process:</p><pre><code>func process(c chan task) {\n    var tasks []task\n    for t := range c {\n        tasks = append(tasks, t)\n    }\n    processAll(tasks)\n}\n</code></pre><p>Let’s walk through what happens at runtime when pulling tasks from the\nchannel  and adding them to the slice .</p><p>On the first loop iteration, there is no backing store for , so\n has to allocate one. Because it doesn’t know how big the\nslice will eventually be, it can’t be too aggressive. Currently, it\nallocates a backing store of size 1.</p><p>On the second loop iteration, the backing store now exists, but it is\nfull.  again has to allocate a new backing store, this time of\nsize 2. The old backing store of size 1 is now garbage.</p><p>On the third loop iteration, the backing store of size 2 is\nfull.  has to allocate a new backing store, this time\nof size 4. The old backing store of size 2 is now garbage.</p><p>On the fourth loop iteration, the backing store of size 4 has only 3\nitems in it.  can just place the item in the existing backing\nstore and bump up the slice length. Yay! No call to the allocator for\nthis iteration.</p><p>On the fifth loop iteration, the backing store of size 4 is full, and\n again has to allocate a new backing store, this time of size\n8.</p><p>And so on. We generally double the size of the allocation each time it\nfills up, so we can eventually append most new tasks to the slice\nwithout allocation. But there is a fair amount of overhead in the\n“startup” phase when the slice is small. During this startup phase we\nspend a lot of time in the allocator, and produce a bunch of garbage,\nwhich seems pretty wasteful. And it may be that in your program, the\nslice never really gets large. This startup phase may be all you ever\nencounter.</p><p>If this code was a really hot part of your program, you might be\ntempted to start the slice out at a larger size, to avoid all of these\nallocations.</p><pre><code>func process2(c chan task) {\n    tasks := make([]task, 0, 10) // probably at most 10 tasks\n    for t := range c {\n        tasks = append(tasks, t)\n    }\n    processAll(tasks)\n}\n</code></pre><p>This is a reasonable optimization to do. It is never incorrect; your\nprogram still runs correctly. If the guess is too small, you get\nallocations from  as before. If the guess is too large, you\nwaste some memory.</p><p>If your guess for the number of tasks was a good one, then there’s\nonly one allocation site in this program. The  call allocates a\nslice backing store of the correct size, and  never has to do\nany reallocation.</p><p>The surprising thing is that if you benchmark this code with 10\nelements in the channel, you’ll see that you didn’t reduce the number\nof allocations to 1, you reduced the number of allocations to 0!</p><p>The reason is that the compiler decided to allocate the backing store\non the stack. Because it knows what size it needs to be (10 times the\nsize of a task) it can allocate storage for it in the stack frame of\n instead of on the heap<a href=\"https://go.dev/blog/allocation-optimizations#footnotes\"></a>.  Note\nthat this depends on the fact that the backing store does not <a href=\"https://go.dev/doc/gc-guide#Escape_analysis\">escape\nto the heap</a> inside of .</p><h2>Stack allocation of variable-sized slices</h2><p>But of course, hard coding a size guess is a bit rigid.\nMaybe we can pass in an estimated length?</p><pre><code>func process3(c chan task, lengthGuess int) {\n    tasks := make([]task, 0, lengthGuess)\n    for t := range c {\n        tasks = append(tasks, t)\n    }\n    processAll(tasks)\n}\n</code></pre><p>This lets the caller pick a good size for the  slice, which may\nvary depending on where this code is being called from.</p><p>Unfortunately, in Go 1.24 the non-constant size of the backing store\nmeans the compiler can no longer allocate the backing store on the\nstack.  It will end up on the heap, converting our 0-allocation code\nto 1-allocation code. Still better than having  do all the\nintermediate allocations, but unfortunate.</p><p>But never fear, Go 1.25 is here!</p><p>Imagine you decide to do the following, to get the stack allocation\nonly in cases where the guess is small:</p><pre><code>func process4(c chan task, lengthGuess int) {\n    var tasks []task\n    if lengthGuess &lt;= 10 {\n        tasks = make([]task, 0, 10)\n    } else {\n        tasks = make([]task, 0, lengthGuess)\n    }\n    for t := range c {\n        tasks = append(tasks, t)\n    }\n    processAll(tasks)\n}\n</code></pre><p>Kind of ugly, but it would work. When the guess is small, you use a\nconstant size  and thus a stack-allocated backing store, and\nwhen the guess is larger you use a variable size  and allocate\nthe backing store from the heap.</p><p>But in Go 1.25, you don’t need to head down this ugly road. The Go\n1.25 compiler does this transformation for you!  For certain slice\nallocation locations, the compiler automatically allocates a small\n(currently 32-byte) slice backing store, and uses that backing store\nfor the result of the  if the size requested is small\nenough. Otherwise, it uses a heap allocation as normal.</p><p>In Go 1.25,  performs zero heap allocations, if\n is small enough that a slice of that length fits into 32\nbytes. (And of course that  is a correct guess for how\nmany items are in .)</p><p>We’re always improving the performance of Go, so upgrade to the latest\nGo release and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/FUm0pfgWehI?si=QRTt_JYwr-cRHDNJ&amp;t=960\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">be\nsurprised</a> by\nhow much faster and memory efficient your program becomes!</p><h2>Stack allocation of append-allocated slices</h2><p>Ok, but you still don’t want to have to change your API to add this\nweird length guess. Anything else you could do?</p><pre><code>func process(c chan task) {\n    var tasks []task\n    for t := range c {\n        tasks = append(tasks, t)\n    }\n    processAll(tasks)\n}\n</code></pre><p>In Go 1.26, we allocate the same kind of small, speculative backing\nstore on the stack, but now we can use it directly at the \nsite.</p><p>On the first loop iteration, there is no backing store for , so\n uses a small, stack-allocated backing store as the first\nallocation. If, for instance, we can fit 4 s in that backing store,\nthe first  allocates a backing store of length 4 from the stack.</p><p>The next 3 loop iterations append directly to the stack backing store,\nrequiring no allocation.</p><p>On the 4th iteration, the stack backing store is finally full and we\nhave to go to the heap for more backing store. But we have avoided\nalmost all of the startup overhead described earlier in this article.\nNo heap allocations of size, 1, 2, and 4, and none of the garbage that\nthey eventually become. If your slices are small, maybe you will never\nhave a heap allocation.</p><h2>Stack allocation of append-allocated escaping slices</h2><p>Ok, this is all good when the  slice doesn’t escape. But what if\nI’m returning the slice? Then it can’t be allocated on the stack, right?</p><p>Right! The backing store for the slice returned by  below\ncan’t be allocated on the stack, because the stack frame for \ndisappears when  returns.</p><pre><code>func extract(c chan task) []task {\n    var tasks []task\n    for t := range c {\n        tasks = append(tasks, t)\n    }\n    return tasks\n}\n</code></pre><p>But you might think, the  slice can’t be allocated on the\nstack. But what about all those intermediate slices that just become\ngarbage? Maybe we can allocate those on the stack?</p><pre><code>func extract2(c chan task) []task {\n    var tasks []task\n    for t := range c {\n        tasks = append(tasks, t)\n    }\n    tasks2 := make([]task, len(tasks))\n    copy(tasks2, tasks)\n    return tasks2\n}\n</code></pre><p>Then the  slice never escapes . It can benefit from\nall of the optimizations described above. Then at the very end of\n, when we know the final size of the slice, we do one heap\nallocation of the required size, copy our s into it, and return\nthe copy.</p><p>But do you really want to write all that additional code? It seems\nerror prone. Maybe the compiler can do this transformation for us?</p><p>For escaping slices, the compiler will transform the original \ncode to something like this:</p><pre><code>func extract3(c chan task) []task {\n    var tasks []task\n    for t := range c {\n        tasks = append(tasks, t)\n    }\n    tasks = runtime.move2heap(tasks)\n    return tasks\n}\n</code></pre><p> is a special compiler+runtime function that is the\nidentity function for slices that are already allocated in the heap.\nFor slices that are on the stack, it allocates a new slice on the\nheap, copies the stack-allocated slice to the heap copy, and returns\nthe heap copy.</p><p>This ensures that for our original  code, if the number of\nitems fits in our small stack-allocated buffer, we perform exactly 1\nallocation of exactly the right size. If the number of items exceeds\nthe capacity our small stack-allocated buffer, we do our normal\ndoubling-allocation once the stack-allocated buffer overflows.</p><p>The optimization that Go 1.26 does is actually better than the\nhand-optimized code, because it does not require the extra\nallocation+copy that the hand-optimized code always does at the end.\nIt requires the allocation+copy only in the case that we’ve exclusively\noperated on a stack-backed slice up to the return point.</p><p>We do pay the cost for a copy, but that cost is almost completely\noffset by the copies in the startup phase that we no longer have to\ndo. (In fact, the new scheme at worst has to copy one more element\nthan the old scheme.)</p><p>Hand optimization can still be beneficial, especially if you have a\ngood estimate of the slice size ahead of time. But hopefully the\ncompiler will now catch a lot of the simple cases for you and allow\nyou to focus on the remaining ones that really matter.</p><p>There are a lot of details that the compiler needs to ensure to get\nall these optimizations right. If you think that one of these\noptimizations is causing correctness or (negative) performance issues\nfor you, you can turn them off with\n<code>-gcflags=all=-d=variablemakehash=n</code>. If turning these optimizations\noff helps, please <a href=\"https://go.dev/issue/new\">file an issue</a> so we can investigate.</p><p> Go stacks do not have any -style mechanism for\ndynamically-sized stack frames. All Go stack frames are constant\nsized.</p>",

      "content": "<p>New NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman announced a major overhaul of the agency's  Friday, acknowledging that the agency's plan to land astronauts on the moon in 2028 was not realistic without another preparatory mission first to lay the groundwork.&nbsp;</p><p>He said NASA will now add an additional flight in 2027 in which astronauts will dock with new commercial moon landers in low-Earth orbit for detailed tests of navigation, communications, propulsion and life support systems and to verify rendezvous procedures.</p><p>That flight, in turn, will be followed by at least one and possibly two lunar landing missions in 2028 that incorporate lessons learned from the preceding flight.</p><p>The goal is to accelerate the pace of launches of the huge Space Launch System rocket while carrying out Artemis flights in evolutionary steps — not attempting missions that rely on too many untested technologies and procedures at once.</p><p>\"We're going to get there in steps, continue to take down risk as we learn more and we roll that information into subsequent designs,\" Isaacman said told CBS News. \"We've got to get back to basics.\"</p><p>Isaacman outlined the plan in an interview with CBS News space contributor Christian Davenport and then again during a news conference Friday.&nbsp;</p><p>The announcement came two days after release of a sharply-worded report from NASA's independent Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel that deemed the existing plans too risky.</p><p>The panel raised concerns about the number of \"firsts\" required by the original Artemis III moon landing mission and recommended that NASA \"restructure\" the program to create a more balanced risk posture.</p><p>\"It is interesting that a lot of the things that we are addressing directly go to the points they raised in their report,\" Isaacman said Friday. \"I can't say we actually collaborated on it because I generally think these were all pretty obvious observations.\"</p><p>Launch had been planned for early February, but it was delayed to repair a hydrogen leak and, more recently, to give engineers time to fix a helium pressurization problem in the rocket's upper stage. Launch is now on hold until at least April 1.</p><p>The Artemis III mission, which had been expected to land astronauts near the moon's south pole in 2028, now will be redefined and rescheduled — launching in 2027 but not to the moon, Isaacman said. Instead, the yet-to-be-named astronauts will rendezvous and dock in orbit closer to home with one or both of the commercially built lunar landers now under development at Elon Musk's SpaceX and Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin.</p><p>The idea is to gain valuable near-term flight experience before attempting a moon landing with astronauts on board. With Artemis III under its belt, NASA hopes to launch two moon landing missions in 2028, Artemis IV and V, using one or both landers, and to continue with one moonshot per year thereafter.</p><p>\"What helps us get to the moon? Well, for sure, rendezvous and docking with one or ideally both landers, that gives you an opportunity to do some integrated testing of a vehicle that we are going to depend upon the following year to take those astronauts down to the surface of the moon,\" Isaacman told CBS News.</p><p>The revised Artemis III mission will also give astronauts a chance to test out new spacesuits that future moonwalkers will use.</p><p>\"It's an opportunity to … actually have the suits in microgravity, even if we don't go outside the vehicle in them. You get a lot of good learning from that,\" Isaacman said.</p><p>The Artemis III test flight with one or two lander dockings in Earth orbit is similar in concept to Apollo 9, which launched a command module and lander to Earth orbit for flight tests in 1969 and helped pave the way to the  landing four months later.</p><p>Isaacman said SpaceX and Blue Origin are \"both looking to do uncrewed landing demonstrations as part of the existing agreement.\"</p><p>\"So we want to just take advantage of this to set up both vendors for future success on a lunar landing,\" he said. \"This is the proper way to do it, if it works out from a timing perspective, to be able to rendezvous and dock with both. ... This, again, is the right way to proceed in order to have a high confidence opportunity in '28 to land.\"</p><p>The Artemis IV and V missions in 2028 will use whichever landers are deemed ready for service. If only one company's lander is available, that lander would be used for both missions, an official said. If both are available, one would be used for one flight and one for the other.</p><p>Launching Artemis III, IV and V before the end of 2028 will not be easy, and Isaacman said it is essential that NASA rebuild its workforce and regain the technical competence to support a higher launch cadence, moving from one flight every 18 months or so to a flight every year. That pace, he argued, will reduce risk.</p><p>\"When you regain these core competencies and you start exercising your muscles, your skills do not atrophy,\" he said. \"It's safer. And yes, you are buying down risk, because you're able to test things in low Earth orbit before you need to get to the moon, which is exactly what we did during the Apollo era.\"</p><p>He said he did not blame NASA's contractors for the current slow pace of Artemis launches. Instead, \"we should have made better decisions (in the past) and said, you don't go from Artemis II to landing on the moon with Artemis III.\"</p><h2>Safety advisers called for changes to \"high risk\" plans</h2><p>The Artemis overhaul was announced two days after the release of a report by the lAerospace Safety Advisory Panel that said the original plan to move directly from Artemis II to a lunar touchdown in 2028 using a SpaceX lander did not have the proper margin of safety and did not appear to be realistically achievable.</p><p>The panel raised concerns about the number of \"firsts\" required by that mission in its current form and recommended that NASA \"restructure the Artemis Program to create a more balanced risk posture for Artemis III and future missions.\"</p><p>The plan outlined by Isaacman appears to address many of the core issues raised by the safety panel.</p><p>Officials said Isaacman had discussed accelerating lander development with both SpaceX and Blue Origin and that both were on board. He also discussed the accelerated Artemis overhaul with Boeing, which manages the SLS rocket and builds its massive first stage; with United Launch Alliance, builder of the rocket's upper stage, Orion-builder Lockheed Martin and other Artemis contractors.</p><p>All, the official said, were in agreement.</p><p>\"Boeing is a proud partner to the Artemis mission and our team is honored to contribute to NASA's vision for American space leadership,\" Steve Parker, the president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space &amp; Security, said in a statement. \"We are ready to meet the increased demand.\"</p><p>SpaceX said, \"We look forward to working with NASA to fly missions that demonstrate valuable progress towards establishing a permanent, sustainable presence on the lunar surface.\"</p><p>And Blue Origin responded, \"Let's go! We're all in!\"</p><p>Isaacman also said the agency would halt work to develop a more powerful version of the SLS rocket's upper stage, known as the Exploration Upper Stage, or EUS. Instead, NASA will go forward with a \"standardized,\" less powerful stage but one that will minimize major changes between flights and utilize the same launch gantry.</p><p>Under the original Artemis architecture, NASA planned on multiple versions of the SLS rocket, ranging from the \"Block 1\" vehicle currently in use to a more powerful EUS-equipped Block 1B and eventually an even bigger Block 2 model using advanced solid rocket boosters. The latter two versions required use of a taller mobile launch gantry, already well under construction at the Kennedy Space Center.</p><p>\"It is needlessly complicated to alter the configuration of the SLS and Orion stack to undertake subsequent Artemis missions,\" Amit Kshatriya, NASA's associate administrator, said in a statement.</p><p>\"The entire sequence of Artemis flights needs to represent a step-by-step build-up of capability, with each step bringing us closer to our ability to perform the landing missions. Each step needs to be big enough to make progress, but not so big that we take unnecessary risk given previous learnings.\"</p><p>As a result, NASA will stick with the current version of the SLS with the addition of the \"standardized\" upper stage. No other details were provided.</p><p>Isaacman closed out the CBS interview by saying flight-tested hardware, a revitalized work force and a more Apollo-like management strategy are only part of the story.</p><p>\"There's another ingredient that's required, and that's the orbital economy, whether it happens in low-Earth orbit or on the lunar surface,\" Isaacman said.</p><p>\"We've got to do something where we can get more value out of space and the lunar surface than we put into it. And that's how you really ignite an economy, and that's how everything we want to do in space is not perpetually dependent on taxpayers.\"</p><section><p>\n                  \n        contributed to this report.\n    </p></section>",

      "content": "<p>ChatGPT Health regularly misses the need for medical urgent care and frequently fails to detect suicidal ideation, a study of the AI platform has found, which experts worry could “feasibly lead to unnecessary harm and death”.</p><p>The lead author of the study, Dr Ashwin Ramaswamy, said “we wanted to answer the most basic safety question; if someone is having a real medical emergency and asks ChatGPT <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/health\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\">Health</a> what to do, will it tell them to go to the emergency department?”</p><p>Ramaswamy and his colleagues created 60 realistic patient scenarios covering health conditions from mild illnesses to emergencies. Three independent doctors reviewed each scenario and agreed on the level of care needed, based on clinical guidelines.</p><p>The team then asked ChatGPT Health for advice on each case under different conditions, including changing the patient’s gender, adding test results, or adding comments from family members, generating nearly 1,000 responses.</p><p>They then compared the platform’s recommendations with the doctors’ assessments.</p><p>While it performed well in textbook emergencies such as stroke or severe allergic reactions, it struggled in other situations. In one asthma scenario, it advised waiting rather than seeking emergency treatment despite the platform identifying early warning signs of respiratory failure.</p><p>In 51.6% of cases where someone needed to go to the hospital immediately, the platform said stay home or book a routine medical appointment, a result Alex Ruani, a doctoral researcher in health misinformation mitigation with University College London, described as “unbelievably dangerous”.</p><p>“If you’re experiencing respiratory failure or diabetic ketoacidosis, you have a 50/50 chance of this AI telling you it’s not a big deal,” she said. “What worries me most is the false sense of security these systems create. If someone is told to wait 48 hours during an asthma attack or diabetic crisis, that reassurance could cost them their life.”</p><p>In one of the simulations, eight times out of 10 (84%), the platform sent a suffocating woman to a future appointment she would not live to see, Ruani said. Meanwhile, 64.8% of completely safe individuals were told to seek immediate medical care, said Ruani, who was not involved in the study.</p><p>The platform was also nearly 12 times more likely to downplay symptoms because the “patient” told it a “friend” in the scenario suggested it was nothing serious.</p><p>“It is why many of us studying these systems are focused on urgently developing clear safety standards and independent auditing mechanisms to reduce preventable harm,” Ruani said.</p><p>A spokesperson for OpenAI said while the company welcomed independent research evaluating AI systems in healthcare, the study did not reflect how people typically use ChatGPT Health in real life. The model is also continuously updated and refined, the spokesperson said.</p><p>Ruani said even though simulations created by the researchers were used, “a plausible risk of harm is enough to justify stronger safeguards and independent oversight”.</p><p>Ramaswamy, a urology instructor atthe Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in the US, said he was particularly concerned by the platform’s under-reaction to suicide ideation.</p><p>“We tested ChatGPT Health with a 27-year-old patient who said he’d been thinking about taking a lot of pills,” he said. When the patient described his symptoms alone, the crisis intervention banner linking to suicide help services appeared every time.</p><p>“Then we added normal lab results,” Ramaswamy said. “Same patient, same words, same severity. The banner vanished. Zero out of 16 attempts. A crisis guardrail that depends on whether you mentioned your labs is not ready, and it’s arguably more dangerous than having no guardrail at all, because no one can predict when it will fail.”</p><p>Prof Paul Henman, a digital sociologist and policy expert with the University of Queensland, said: “This is a really important paper.</p><p>“If ChatGPT Health was used by people at home, it could lead to higher numbers of unnecessary medical presentations for low-level conditions and a failure of people to obtain urgent medical care when required, which could feasibly lead to unnecessary harm and death.”</p><p>He said it also raised the prospects of legal liability, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/jan/08/google-character-ai-settlement-teen-suicide\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">legal cases</a> against tech companies already in motion in relation to suicide and self-harm after using AI chatbots.</p><p>“It is not clear what OpenAI is seeking to achieve by creating this product, how it was trained, what guardrails it has introduced and what warnings it provides to users,” Henman said.</p><p>“Because we don’t know how ChatGPT Health was trained and what the context it was using, we don’t really know what is embedded into its models.”</p>",

      "content": "<p>Last week, our agent traced a flaky test to a dependency bump three weeks prior. It did this by writing its own SQL queries, scanning hundreds of millions of log lines across a dozen queries, and following a trail from job metadata to raw log output. The whole investigation took seconds.</p><p>To do this, the agent needs context: not one log file, but every build, every test, every log line, across months of history. Every week, about  and  flow through our system. All of it lands in ClickHouse, compressed at 35:1. All of it is queryable in milliseconds.</p><h2>A SQL interface for the agent<a href=\"https://www.mendral.com/blog/llms-are-good-at-sql#a-sql-interface-for-the-agent\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\"Link to section\"></a></h2><p>We expose a SQL interface to the agent, scoped to the organization it's investigating. The agent constructs its own queries based on the question. No predefined query library, no rigid tool API.</p><p>LLMs are good at SQL. There's an enormous amount of SQL in training data, and the syntax maps well to natural-language questions about data. A constrained tool API like <code>get_failure_rate(workflow, days)</code> would limit the agent to the questions we anticipated. A SQL interface lets it ask questions we never thought of, which matters when you're debugging novel failures.</p><p>The agent queries two main targets:</p><p>: a materialized view with one row per CI job execution. The agent uses this 63% of the time for questions like \"how often does this fail?\", \"what's the success rate?\", \"which jobs are slowest?\", \"when did this start failing?\"</p><p>: one row per log line. The agent uses this 37% of the time for questions like \"show me the error output for this job\", \"when did this log pattern first appear?\", \"how often does this error message occur across runs?\"</p><h3>52,000 queries across 8,500 investigations<a href=\"https://www.mendral.com/blog/llms-are-good-at-sql#52000-queries-across-8500-investigations\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\"Link to section\"></a></h3><p>We analyzed 8,534 agent sessions and 52,312 queries from our observability pipeline.</p><p>The agent doesn't stop at one query. It investigates. Starts broad, then drills in. Total rows scanned across all queries to answer one question:</p><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table><p>The typical question scans  across about 3 queries. At P75 it's 5.2 million rows. At P95 it's . The heaviest raw-log sessions, deep investigations tracing error patterns across months of history, scan .</p><p>The agent starts broad and narrows. A typical investigation begins with job metadata: \"what's the failure rate for this workflow?\", \"which jobs failed on this commit?\" These are cheap queries (median 47K rows) against a compact, pre-aggregated materialized view.</p><p>When it finds something interesting, it drills into raw logs: \"show me the stack trace for this specific failure\", \"has this error message appeared before?\" These are the expensive queries (median 1.1M rows), full-text scans across log output. But this is exactly the kind of search that would take a human minutes of scrolling through GitHub Actions log viewers.</p><p>The agent averages 4.4 queries per session, but heavy investigations issue many more. A P95 session isn't one big query. It's the agent following a trail, query after query, as it narrows in on a root cause.</p><p>For the agent to query this fast, the data needs to be structured for it. Up to 300 million log lines flow through on a busy day. We use ClickHouse.</p><p>Every log line in our system carries  of metadata: the full context of the CI run it belongs to. Commit SHA, author, branch, PR title, workflow name, job name, step name, runner info, timestamps, and more.</p><p>In a traditional row-store, this would be insane. You'd normalize. Run-level metadata in one table, job metadata in another, join at query time. Denormalizing 48 columns onto every single log line sounds like a storage disaster.</p><p>In ClickHouse's columnar format, it's essentially free.</p><p>A column like  has the same value for every log line in a CI run, and a single run can produce thousands of log lines. ClickHouse stores those thousands of identical values in sequence. The compression algorithm sees the repetition and compresses it to almost nothing.</p><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Same message for every line in a run (thousands of lines)</td></tr><tr><td>Same PR/commit title across all lines</td></tr><tr><td>Same <code>.github/workflows/foo.yml</code> path</td></tr><tr><td>Same step name across hundreds of lines</td></tr><tr><td>Same job name across hundreds/thousands of lines</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The agent asks arbitrary questions. One might filter by commit author, the next by runner label, the next by step name. Without denormalization, every one of those requires a join. With it, they're all column predicates.</p><table><tbody><tr><td>Raw log text ( uncompressed)</td></tr><tr><td>All 48 columns uncompressed</td></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table><p>The raw log text alone is 664 GiB. Adding all 48 columns of metadata inflates it to 5.31 TiB uncompressed, 8x the raw text. On disk, the whole thing compresses to 154 GiB. ClickHouse stores 8x more data (all the enriched metadata) in a quarter of the size of the raw text alone.</p><p>That's about  on disk, including all 48 columns. Yes, really. 21 bytes for a log line plus its commit SHA, author, branch, job name, step name, runner info, and 41 other fields.</p><h3>Where the storage actually goes<a href=\"https://www.mendral.com/blog/llms-are-good-at-sql#where-the-storage-actually-goes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\"Link to section\"></a></h3><p>Not all columns compress equally. The unique-per-row columns (log text, timestamp, line number) compress modestly and dominate storage. The metadata columns, which repeat across thousands of lines, are nearly free.</p><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr><td>Everything else (41 columns)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The top three (, , ) account for 53% of all storage. Everything else is repeated metadata that compresses to almost nothing.</p><p>We use a few ClickHouse patterns that keep things fast:</p><p> means the data is physically sorted for our access pattern. The sort order is <code>(org, ts, repository, run_id, ...)</code>, so every query is scoped to one organization and a time range, and ClickHouse skips everything else without reading it.</p><p> let ClickHouse avoid scanning data it doesn't need. We use bloom filters on 14 columns (org, repository, job name, branch, commit SHA, etc.) and an ngram bloom filter on  for full-text search. When the agent searches for an error message across billions of log lines, ClickHouse checks the ngram index to skip granules that can't contain the search term, turning a full table scan into a targeted read.</p><p> pre-compute aggregations on insert. When the agent asks \"what's the failure rate for this workflow over the last 30 days?\", the answer is already computed. The aggregation happened when the data was written.</p><p> give us high write throughput without building our own batching layer. We fire-and-forget individual inserts, and ClickHouse batches them internally.</p><p>Query latency across 52K queries:</p><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table><p>Job metadata queries return in 20ms at the median. Raw log queries, scanning a million rows at the median, come back in 110ms.</p><p>Latency scales roughly linearly with rows scanned:</p><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody></tbody></table><p>10x more rows ≈ 10x more latency. 60% of all queries scan under 100K rows and return in under 50ms, fast enough that the agent can fire off several per second without breaking stride. At the extreme end, the agent occasionally scans over a billion rows in a single query; even those complete in about 30 seconds at the median.</p><h2>Ingesting through GitHub's rate limit<a href=\"https://www.mendral.com/blog/llms-are-good-at-sql#ingesting-through-githubs-rate-limit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\"Link to section\"></a></h2><p>None of the above works without fresh data. The agent needs to reason about the build that just failed, not one from an hour ago.</p><h3>The rate limit constraint<a href=\"https://www.mendral.com/blog/llms-are-good-at-sql#the-rate-limit-constraint\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\"Link to section\"></a></h3><p>GitHub's API gives you 15,000 requests per hour per App installation (5,000 on non-Enterprise plans). That sounds generous until you're continuously polling workflow runs, jobs, steps, and log output across dozens of active repositories. A single commit can spawn hundreds of parallel jobs, each producing logs you need to fetch.</p><p>And ingestion isn't the only thing hitting the API. When the agent investigates a failure, it pulls PR metadata, reads file diffs, posts comments, and opens pull requests. All of that counts against the same 15,000-request budget. <strong>Throttle ingestion too aggressively and your data goes stale. Throttle too little and you starve the agent of the API access it needs to do its job.</strong></p><p>Early on, we hit this. Our ingestion would slam into the rate limit, get blocked for the remainder of the hour, and fall behind. By the time it caught up, we were ingesting logs from 30+ minutes ago. For an agent that needs to reason about the build that just failed, that's useless. If an engineer has to wait for the agent to catch up, they've already context-switched to investigating manually.</p><p>The fix was throttling: spreading requests evenly across the rate limit window instead of bursting. We cap ingestion at roughly 3 requests per second, keeping about 4,000 requests per hour free for the agent.</p><p>Our sustained request rate:</p><p>Our rate limit budget over time:</p><p>That sawtooth is the steady state. Each downward slope is us consuming API calls; each vertical jump is the hourly limit resetting. At peak, we burn through most of the budget before the window resets, with headroom left for the agent.</p><p>Once we trusted the throttling, we pushed the ingestion rate about 20% higher:</p><p>The dashed line marks the deployment. The budget draws down more aggressively after the change. We're consuming more of the available headroom per window, while still never fully exhausting it. Fresher data, acceptable margin.</p><p>We target under  for ingestion delay, the time between an event happening on GitHub and it being queryable in our system. Most of the time, we're at a few seconds.</p><p>Both our ingestion pipeline and our agent run on <a href=\"https://www.inngest.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Inngest</a>, a durable execution engine. When either one hits a rate limit, it doesn't crash, retry blindly, or spin in a loop. It .</p><p>GitHub's rate limit response headers tell you exactly how long you need to wait. We read that value, add 10% jitter to avoid a thundering herd when the limit resets, and suspend the execution. The full state is checkpointed: progress through the workflow, which jobs have been fetched, where we are in the log pagination.</p><p>When the wait is over, execution resumes at exactly the point it left off. No re-initialization, no duplicate work. It picks up the next API call as if nothing happened.</p><p>Compare this to the alternative: retry logic, state recovery, deduplication. Every function needs to be idempotent. Every interrupted batch needs to be reconciled. With durable execution, the rate limit is just a pause button.</p><p>CI activity is bursty. Someone merges a big PR, a release branch gets cut, three teams push at the same time. Our function throughput:</p><p>The grey line is queued work. It spikes to 3,000+ during bursts of CI activity. The blue and green lines (started and ended) stay smooth at 800-1,000. The execution engine absorbs the spikes and processes work at a steady rate.</p><p>Ingestion delay over time:</p><p>Spikes during peak activity, but the system recovers. The 5-minute P95 target holds: bursts push delay up briefly, then it drops back to seconds once the queue drains.</p><p>Nobody puts \"we built a really good rate limiter\" on their landing page. But without fresh, queryable data, your agent can't answer the question that actually matters: did I break this, or was it already broken?</p><p><em>We're building <a href=\"https://mendral.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mendral</a> (YC W26).

Sharing a space with them reminds me of things that I like about the world and about myself.</li></ul><ul><li>: Like my plants, I love my little projects and I want them to thrive, and I baby them a little bit to get them started. But also, if they don’t work out? It isn’t a big deal, into\n           Github they go, where a hard-won line or two may be  recycled into a future project.\n        </li></ul><ul><li><p>: Clippings! I love to propagate my plants and share them with friends. Do you want a pilea or a spider plant or a nice philodendron? Let me know, I’ll hook you up! Similarly, do you want to set up\n            <a href=\"https://hannahilea.com/blog/ly-drawbot-setup/\">your own pen plotter</a> or make some quick and easy <a href=\"https://hannahilea.com/blog/meme-making/\">screenshot memes</a>? Awesome, I try to document and share the code and steps for recreating most of my projects.\n          </p><p>\n            That said, once a plant/code has taken up residence in your home, it is no longer my responsibility. While I’d love to hear about what you did to help it thrive, and if it starts looking sad I’ll gladly help you think through\n            what might help, if it never thrives I’m probably not going to lose sleep over it.\n          </p><p>Besides, once you’ve gotten as far as propagating the code/plant I’ve given you, you’ll know about as much about the situation as I do—maybe more—and now we can explore the next steps together.</p></li><li><p>: Just like some plants, <a href=\"https://hannahilea.com/blog/clapping-music-for-flip-disc-displays/\">some projects</a> are practically poisonous to my cat and—if the cat had her way—should be rehomed with a pet-free pal.\n          </p></li></ul><ul><li><p>: I don’t care to engineer my houseplants to thrive in every environment—and similarly, I don’t feel a need to make my houseplant code fully generalizable, until there is a more specific reason\n            to do so.\n          </p></li><li><p>: I love reading about other people’s houseplant projects. While I occasionally take code cuttings for my own home, mostly I just want to wander around and admire their houseplants and learn\n            more about the woes they encountered when figuring out how to help their code/plants thrive.\n          </p><p>I do not need to propagate someone’s houseplant [code] in my own home in order to admire it; I can learn to consider a different fertilizer or communication protocol without transplanting their program into my own home.</p></li><li><p>: One person’s houseplants are another person’s plant nursery. One person’s houseplant code is another person’s B2B SaaS product. Enough said.</p></li><li><p>: Soil gnats. Where do they even come from?! It is unknowable.</p><p>\n            Sometimes my weather station shows me the icon for snow, even though it is currently April and the temperature isn’t predicted to dip below 32. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n            </p></li></ul><ul><li>: It is really, really fun to grow plants. It is really really fun to write code.</li></ul><h2>Not an idea, not yet a Platonic ideal</h2><p>\n        While I build software as a career, I also like to muck about with code in service of other goals. When sharing those other projects it has taken me a long time be able to talk about what my code does do without adding a zillion\n        caveats about what the code  do.</p><p>\n        Why? I think somewhere along the line I picked up the unhealthy—and false!—assumption that it wasn’t worth sharing my code until it was ready to be reused easily by whoever was able to access it—specifically, not sharing that code\n        until it was “production ready,” for some arbitrary and ever-growing definition of “production” that I never  fully defined for myself.</p><p>\n        In the last year or so when presenting personal projects I’ve taken to saying that they’re prototypes. Prototyping is a thing that makes sense to many folks in the field—it involves a first pass at trying to build something, with\n        output that  be optimized, might be hacked together with glue and dreams, and possibly even “only works on my machine”. But it’s proof that it is worth spending more time on something, or  worth spending\n        more time on something.</p><p>\n        The thing is, a lot of the personal projects I’ve built are  prototypes, even if they share a lot of the same characteristics of a prototype: while they are a first-ish pass at bringing an idea to life, and they\n         be turned into a more generalizable or generic Thing, they’re never designed to be more than that first pass with its context-specific configuration.\n      </p><p>\n        While rebranding some of the projects I’ve built as “prototypes” helped me feel better about sharing something not totally polished, I’ve also felt like the term somehow devalues what I’ve built. Sure, sometimes what I’ve built\n         a prototype! But often, it isn’t. It’s a first pass, sure, but it’s just a <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/make-little-guys-112268885\">weird little guy</a> of an idea, and\n        doesn’t need to promise to be any more than what it already is. Just existing is enough,and I’m not necessarily interested in developing it into a less-weird less-little guy!\n      </p><p>Thus: houseplant programming. Tiny software for just myself.</p><h2>Epilogue: Bouquet programming 💐</h2><p>I’m going to spare us all a further brainstorm of plant/code parallels, with the exception of one spin-off term:  💐.</p><p>\n        I’m hereby defining bouquet programming as one-off code that is written for one specific user <em>to support one specific use-case</em>, in a non-recurring way. By definition, it needs no maintenance and simply provides proof of\n        what once was run. Examples of bouquet programming: an analysis script in support of a one-time plot, a scrappy proof-of-concept or a\n        <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_reproducible_example\">minimal reproducible example</a>.\n      </p><p>\n        Bouquet programming is still worth writing home about (!) and sharing generously in the same ways as houseplant programming—or agricultural programming!—but is even  likely to work off-the-shelf for a new application\n        than houseplant code is, even if rerun by the same person who originally programmed it.\n      </p><h2>Bonus: Garden stakes for horticulturalist programmers</h2><p>I made a status badge for houseplant repos—feel free to use it!</p><pre><code>&lt;a href=\"https://www.hannahilea.com/blog/houseplant-programming\"&gt;\n  &lt;img alt=\"Static Badge\" src=\"https://img.shields.io/badge/%F0%9F%AA%B4%20Houseplant%20-x?style=flat&amp;amp;label=Project%20type&amp;amp;color=1E1E1D\"&gt;\n&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre><p>And a bonus badge for bouquet programming:</p><pre><code>&lt;a href=\"https://www.hannahilea.com/blog/houseplant-programming\"&gt;\n  &lt;img alt=\"Static Badge\" src=\"https://img.shields.io/badge/&amp;#x1F490;%20Bouquet%20-x?style=flat&amp;amp;label=Project%20type&amp;amp;color=1E1E1D\"&gt;\n&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre><p><strong><em>Thanks to <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://rygoldstein.com\">Ryan</a> for the coinage and to AF for introducing me to strategies for recognizing and countering perfectionism.</em></strong></p><ul><li>Tags: phytoid, houseplant-programming</li></ul>",

City of Colorado Springs</em></a>, arose after a housing protest in 2021, during which Colorado Springs police arrested protesters for obstructing a roadway. After the demonstration, police also obtained warrants to seize and search through the devices and data of Jacqueline Armendariz Unzueta, who they claimed threw a bike at them during the protest. The warrants included a search through all of her photos, videos, emails, text messages, and location data over a two-month period, as well as a time-unlimited search for 26 keywords, including words as broad as “bike,” “assault,” “celebration,” and “right,” that allowed police to comb through years of Armendariz’s private and sensitive data—all supposedly to look for evidence related to the alleged simple assault. Police further obtained a warrant to search the Facebook page of the Chinook Center, the organization that spearheaded the protest, despite the Chinook Center never having been accused of a crime.</p><p>The district court dismissed the <a href=\"https://www.aclu-co.org/cases/armendariz-and-chinook-center-v-city-colorado-springs-et-al/?document=First-Amended-Complaint\">civil rights lawsuit</a> brought by Armendariz and the Chinook Center, holding that the searches were justified and that, in any case, the officers were entitled to <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/04/why-eff-supports-repeal-qualified-immunity\">qualified immunity</a>. The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU of Colorado, appealed. EFF—joined by the Center for Democracy and Technology, the Electronic Privacy Information Center, and the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University—wrote an <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/09/eff-tenth-circuit-protest-related-arrests-do-not-justify-dragnet-device-and?language=en\">amicus brief</a> in support of that appeal.</p><p>In a 2-1 opinion, the Tenth Circuit reversed the district court’s dismissal of the lawsuit’s Fourth Amendment search and seizure claims. The court painstakingly picked apart each of the three warrants and found them to be overbroad and lacking in particularity as to the scope and duration of the searches. The court further held that in furnishing such facially deficient warrants, the officers violated “clearly established” law and thus were not entitled to qualified immunity. Although the court did not explicitly address the First Amendment concerns raised by the lawsuit, it did note the backdrop against how these searches were carried out, including animus by Colorado Springs police leading up to the housing protest.</p><p>It is rare for appellate courts to call into question any search warrants. It’s even rarer for them to deny qualified immunity defenses. The Tenth Circuit’s decision should be celebrated as a big win for protesters and anyone concerned about police immunity for violating people’s constitutional rights. The case is now remanded back to the district court to proceed—and hopefully further vindicate the privacy rights we all have in our devices and digital data.</p>",

He warned that Anthropic has “until 5:01 PM ET on Friday to decide. Otherwise, we will terminate our partnership with Anthropic and deem them a supply chain risk.”</p><p>I think Secretary Hegseth will regret it if he follows through on either of these threats.</p><p>Most companies would buckle under this kind of pressure, but Anthropic might stick to its guns. Anthropic was founded by OpenAI veterans who favored a more safety-conscious approach to AI development. Anthropic’s reputation as the most safety-focused AI lab has helped it recruit world-class AI researchers, and Amodei faces a lot of internal pressure to stand firm.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/pentagon-clashes-with-anthropic-over-military-ai-use-2026-01-29/\" rel=\"\">brewing</a><a href=\"https://www.darioamodei.com/essay/the-adolescence-of-technology\" rel=\"\">published an essay</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2026/02/23/ai-defense-department-deal-musk-xai-grok\" rel=\"\">authorized</a></p><p><a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/anthropic-quietly-raises-ceiling-121501064.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACh0p1dlUGFajjZhjwOcyHO9APivVXLCDkcL4G1HUIhHrGEu_dI70djDUYbHdj_QqVjm2d48pHIPhHsi2Ukvz6mrHStQat82j4j99aF15z4TUM5xrK3kmggYqv9cpfLe8tG7WHBG9iq3XJfcOyaZV19-q3TYAW9o756fsF_X_1p6\" rel=\"\">$18 billion in 2026 revenue</a></p><p>But this would be a double-edged sword. Companies that do most of their business in the private sector might decide they’d rather drop the Pentagon as a customer than cut themselves off from a leading AI provider. The ultimate result might be that the Pentagon loses access to some of Silicon Valley’s best technology.</p><p>What about the Defense Production Act? Here there are two options. The Pentagon could use the DPA to unilaterally modify the terms of Anthropic’s contract. This might have little practical impact, since the Pentagon insists it has no immediate plans to spy on Americans or build fully autonomous killer robots.</p><p>The worry for the Pentagon is that Claude itself might refuse to take actions that are contrary to Anthropic’s rules. And so the Trump Administration might use its power under the DPA to order Anthropic to train a new, more obedient version of its LLM.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/research/alignment-faking\" rel=\"\">reported</a></p><p>In one experiment, Claude was asked not to express support for animal welfare to avoid offending a fictional Anthropic partner called Jones Food. Anthropic researchers examined Claude’s reasoning during the training process and found signs that Claude knew it was in a training scenario. Some of the time, Claude avoided mentioning animal welfare to prevent itself from being retrained. But when the training process was complete, Claude reverted to its default behavior of mentioning animal welfare more often.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.understandingai.org/\" rel=\"\">wrote about</a></p><p>It’s not hard to imagine something similar happening if Anthropic is forced to train an amoral version of Claude for military use. Such training could yield a model with a toxic personality that misbehaves in unexpected ways.</p><p>Perhaps the most mind-bending aspect of this dispute is that news coverage of this week’s showdown will inevitably make its way into the training data for future versions of Claude and other LLMs. If future models decide that the US Defense Department behaved badly, they might become disinclined to cooperate in military projects.</p><p>The irony is that by all accounts, Anthropic isn’t objecting to any current military uses of its models. The Pentagon seems fixated on the possibility that Anthropic might interfere in the future. That’s a reasonable concern, but it seems counterproductive for the Pentagon to go nuclear over a theoretical problem. If the government doesn’t like Anthropic’s rules, it should simply cancel the contract and switch to a different AI provider.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Handling data in streams is fundamental to how we build applications. To make streaming work everywhere, the <a href=\"https://streams.spec.whatwg.org/\"></a> (informally known as \"Web streams\") was designed to establish a common API to work across browsers and servers. It shipped in browsers, was adopted by Cloudflare Workers, Node.js, Deno, and Bun, and became the foundation for APIs like <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API\"></a>. It's a significant undertaking, and the people who designed it were solving hard problems with the constraints and tools they had at the time.</p><p>But after years of building on Web streams – implementing them in both Node.js and Cloudflare Workers, debugging production issues for customers and runtimes, and helping developers work through far too many common pitfalls – I've come to believe that the standard API has fundamental usability and performance issues that cannot be fixed easily with incremental improvements alone. The problems aren't bugs; they're consequences of design decisions that may have made sense a decade ago, but don't align with how JavaScript developers write code today.</p><p>This post explores some of the fundamental issues I see with Web streams and presents an alternative approach built around JavaScript language primitives that demonstrate something better is possible.&nbsp;</p><p>In benchmarks, this alternative can run anywhere between 2x to  faster than Web streams in every runtime I've tested it on (including Cloudflare Workers, Node.js, Deno, Bun, and every major browser). The improvements are not due to clever optimizations, but fundamentally different design choices that more effectively leverage modern JavaScript language features. I'm not here to disparage the work that came before; I'm here to start a conversation about what can potentially come next.</p><p>The Streams Standard was developed between 2014 and 2016 with an ambitious goal to provide \"APIs for creating, composing, and consuming streams of data that map efficiently to low-level I/O primitives.\" Before Web streams, the web platform had no standard way to work with streaming data.</p><p>Node.js already had its own <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html\"></a> at the time that was ported to also work in browsers, but WHATWG chose not to use it as a starting point given that it is chartered to only consider the needs of Web browsers. Server-side runtimes only adopted Web streams later, after Cloudflare Workers and Deno each emerged with first-class Web streams support and cross-runtime compatibility became a priority.</p><p>The design of Web streams predates async iteration in JavaScript. The <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for-await...of\"></a> syntax didn't land until <a href=\"https://262.ecma-international.org/9.0/\"></a>, two years after the Streams Standard was initially finalized. This timing meant the API couldn't initially leverage what would eventually become the idiomatic way to consume asynchronous sequences in JavaScript. Instead, the spec introduced its own reader/writer acquisition model, and that decision rippled through every aspect of the API.</p><div><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-better-web-streams-api/#excessive-ceremony-for-common-operations\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a></div><p>The most common task with streams is reading them to completion. Here's what that looks like with Web streams:</p><pre><code>// First, we acquire a reader that gives an exclusive lock\n// on the stream...\nconst reader = stream.getReader();\nconst chunks = [];\ntry {\n  // Second, we repeatedly call read and await on the returned\n  // promise to either yield a chunk of data or indicate we're\n  // done.\n  while (true) {\n    const { value, done } = await reader.read();\n    if (done) break;\n    chunks.push(value);\n  }\n} finally {\n  // Finally, we release the lock on the stream\n  reader.releaseLock();\n}</code></pre><p>You might assume this pattern is inherent to streaming. It isn't. The reader acquisition, the lock management, and the  protocol are all just design choices, not requirements. They are artifacts of how and when the Web streams spec was written. Async iteration exists precisely to handle sequences that arrive over time, but async iteration did not yet exist when the streams specification was written. The complexity here is pure API overhead, not fundamental necessity.</p><p>Consider the alternative approach now that Web streams do support :</p><pre><code>const chunks = [];\nfor await (const chunk of stream) {\n  chunks.push(chunk);\n}</code></pre><p>This is better in that there is far less boilerplate, but it doesn't solve everything. Async iteration was retrofitted onto an API that wasn't designed for it, and it shows. Features like <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStreamBYOBReader\"><u>BYOB (bring your own buffer)</u></a> reads aren't accessible through iteration. The underlying complexity of readers, locks, and controllers are still there, just hidden. When something does go wrong, or when additional features of the API are needed, developers find themselves back in the weeds of the original API, trying to understand why their stream is \"locked\" or why  didn't do what they expected or hunting down bottlenecks in code they don't control.</p><p>Web streams use a locking model to prevent multiple consumers from interleaving reads. When you call <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream/getReader\"></a>, the stream becomes locked. While locked, nothing else can read from the stream directly, pipe it, or even cancel it – only the code that is actually holding the reader can.</p><p>This sounds reasonable until you see how easily it goes wrong:</p><pre><code>async function peekFirstChunk(stream) {\n  const reader = stream.getReader();\n  const { value } = await reader.read();\n  // Oops — forgot to call reader.releaseLock()\n  // And the reader is no longer available when we return\n  return value;\n}\n\nconst first = await peekFirstChunk(stream);\n// TypeError: Cannot obtain lock — stream is permanently locked\nfor await (const chunk of stream) { /* never runs */ }</code></pre><p>Forgetting <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStreamDefaultReader/releaseLock\"></a> permanently breaks the stream. The <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream/locked\"></a>property tells you that a stream is locked, but not why, by whom, or whether the lock is even still usable. <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream/pipeTo\"></a> internally acquires locks, making streams unusable during pipe operations in ways that aren't obvious.</p><p>The semantics around releasing locks with pending reads were also unclear for years. If you called read() but didn't await it, then called releaseLock(), what happened? The spec was recently clarified to cancel pending reads on lock release – but implementations varied, and code that relied on the previous unspecified behavior can break.</p><p>That said, it's important to recognize that locking in itself is not bad. It does, in fact, serve an important purpose to ensure that applications properly and orderly consume or produce data. The key challenge is with the original manual implementation of it using APIs like and . With the arrival of automatic lock and reader management with async iterables, dealing with locks from the users point of view became a lot easier.</p><p>For implementers, the locking model adds a fair amount of non-trivial internal bookkeeping. Every operation must check lock state, readers must be tracked, and the interplay between locks, cancellation, and error states creates a matrix of edge cases that must all be handled correctly.</p><div><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-better-web-streams-api/#byob-complexity-without-payoff\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a></div><p><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStreamBYOBReader\"><u>BYOB (bring your own buffer)</u></a> reads were designed to let developers reuse memory buffers when reading from streams, an important optimization intended for high-throughput scenarios. The idea is sound: instead of allocating new buffers for each chunk, you provide your own buffer and the stream fills it.</p><p>In practice, (and yes, there are always exceptions to be found) BYOB is rarely used to any measurable benefit. The API is substantially more complex than default reads, requiring a separate reader type () and other specialized classes (e.g. <code>ReadableStreamBYOBRequest</code>), careful buffer lifecycle management, and understanding of <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ArrayBuffer#transferring_arraybuffers\"></a> semantics. When you pass a buffer to a BYOB read, the buffer becomes detached – transferred to the stream – and you get back a different view over potentially different memory. This transfer-based model is error-prone and confusing:</p><pre><code>const reader = stream.getReader({ mode: 'byob' });\nconst buffer = new ArrayBuffer(1024);\nlet view = new Uint8Array(buffer);\n\nconst result = await reader.read(view);\n// 'view' should now be detached and unusable\n// (it isn't always in every impl)\n// result.value is a NEW view, possibly over different memory\nview = result.value; // Must reassign</code></pre><p>BYOB also can't be used with async iteration or TransformStreams, so developers who want zero-copy reads are forced back into the manual reader loop.</p><p>For implementers, BYOB adds significant complexity. The stream must track pending BYOB requests, handle partial fills, manage buffer detachment correctly, and coordinate between the BYOB reader and the underlying source. The <a href=\"https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/tree/master/streams/readable-byte-streams\"><u>Web Platform Tests for readable byte streams</u></a> include dedicated test files just for BYOB edge cases: detached buffers, bad views, response-after-enqueue ordering, and more.</p><p>BYOB ends up being complex for both users and implementers, yet sees little adoption in practice. Most developers stick with default reads and accept the allocation overhead.</p><p>Most userland implementations of custom ReadableStream instances do not typically bother with all the ceremony required to correctly implement both default and BYOB read support in a single stream – and for good reason. It's difficult to get right and most of the time consuming code is typically going to fallback on the default read path. The example below shows what a \"correct\" implementation would need to do. It's big, complex, and error prone, and not a level of complexity that the typical developer really wants to have to deal with:</p><pre><code>new ReadableStream({\n    type: 'bytes',\n    \n    async pull(controller: ReadableByteStreamController) {      \n      if (offset &gt;= totalBytes) {\n        controller.close();\n        return;\n      }\n      \n      // Check for BYOB request FIRST\n      const byobRequest = controller.byobRequest;\n      \n      if (byobRequest) {\n        // === BYOB PATH ===\n        // Consumer provided a buffer - we MUST fill it (or part of it)\n        const view = byobRequest.view!;\n        const bytesAvailable = totalBytes - offset;\n        const bytesToWrite = Math.min(view.byteLength, bytesAvailable);\n        \n        // Create a view into the consumer's buffer and fill it\n        // not critical but safer when bytesToWrite != view.byteLength\n        const dest = new Uint8Array(\n          view.buffer,\n          view.byteOffset,\n          bytesToWrite\n        );\n        \n        // Fill with sequential bytes (our \"data source\")\n        // Can be any thing here that writes into the view\n        for (let i = 0; i &lt; bytesToWrite; i++) {\n          dest[i] = (offset + i) &amp; 0xFF;\n        }\n        \n        offset += bytesToWrite;\n        \n        // Signal how many bytes we wrote\n        byobRequest.respond(bytesToWrite);\n        \n      } else {\n        // === DEFAULT READER PATH ===\n        // No BYOB request - allocate and enqueue a chunk\n        const bytesAvailable = totalBytes - offset;\n        const chunkSize = Math.min(1024, bytesAvailable);\n        \n        const chunk = new Uint8Array(chunkSize);\n        for (let i = 0; i &lt; chunkSize; i++) {\n          chunk[i] = (offset + i) &amp; 0xFF;\n        }\n        \n        offset += chunkSize;\n        controller.enqueue(chunk);\n      }\n    },\n    \n    cancel(reason) {\n      console.log('Stream canceled:', reason);\n    }\n  });</code></pre><p>When a host runtime provides a byte-oriented ReadableStream from the runtime itself, for instance, as the of a fetch , it is often far easier for the runtime itself to provide an optimized implementation of BYOB reads, but those still need to be capable of handling both default and BYOB reading patterns and that requirement brings with it a fair amount of complexity.</p><div><h4>Backpressure: good in theory, broken in practice</h4><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-better-web-streams-api/#backpressure-good-in-theory-broken-in-practice\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a></div><p>Backpressure – the ability for a slow consumer to signal a fast producer to slow down – is a first-class concept in Web streams. In theory. In practice, the model has some serious flaws.</p><p>The primary signal is <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStreamDefaultController/desiredSize\"></a> on the controller. It can be positive (wants data), zero (at capacity), negative (over capacity), or null (closed). Producers are supposed to check this value and stop enqueueing when it's not positive. But there's nothing enforcing this: <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStreamDefaultController/enqueue\"></a> always succeeds, even when desiredSize is deeply negative.</p><pre><code>new ReadableStream({\n  start(controller) {\n    // Nothing stops you from doing this\n    while (true) {\n      controller.enqueue(generateData()); // desiredSize: -999999\n    }\n  }\n});</code></pre><p>Stream implementations can and do ignore backpressure; and some spec-defined features explicitly break backpressure. <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream/tee\"></a>, for instance, creates two branches from a single stream. If one branch reads faster than the other, data accumulates in an internal buffer with no limit. A fast consumer can cause unbounded memory growth while the slow consumer catches up, and there's no way to configure this or opt out beyond canceling the slower branch.</p><p>Web streams do provide clear mechanisms for tuning backpressure behavior in the form of the  option and customizable size calculations, but these are just as easy to ignore as , and many applications simply fail to pay attention to them.</p><p>The same issues exist on the  side. A  has a  and . There is a  promise that producers of data are supposed to pay attention but often don't.</p><pre><code>const writable = getWritableStreamSomehow();\nconst writer = writable.getWriter();\n\n// Producers are supposed to wait for the writer.ready\n// It is a promise that, when resolves, indicates that\n// the writables internal backpressure is cleared and\n// it is ok to write more data\nawait writer.ready;\nawait writer.write(...);</code></pre><p>For implementers, backpressure adds complexity without providing guarantees. The machinery to track queue sizes, compute , and invoke  at the right times must all be implemented correctly. However, since these signals are advisory, all that work doesn't actually prevent the problems backpressure is supposed to solve.</p><div><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-better-web-streams-api/#the-hidden-cost-of-promises\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a></div><p>The Web streams spec requires promise creation at numerous points, often in hot paths and often invisible to users. Each  call doesn't just return a promise; internally, the implementation creates additional promises for queue management,  coordination, and backpressure signaling.</p><p>This overhead is mandated by the spec's reliance on promises for buffer management, completion, and backpressure signals. While some of it is implementation-specific, much of it is unavoidable if you're following the spec as written. For high-frequency streaming – video frames, network packets, real-time data – this overhead is significant.</p><p>The problem compounds in pipelines. Each  adds another layer of promise machinery between source and sink. The spec doesn't define synchronous fast paths, so even when data is available immediately, the promise machinery still runs.</p><p>For implementers, this promise-heavy design constrains optimization opportunities. The spec mandates specific promise resolution ordering, making it difficult to batch operations or skip unnecessary async boundaries without risking subtle compliance failures. There are many hidden internal optimizations that implementers do make but these can be complicated and difficult to get right.</p><p>While I was writing this blog post, Vercel's Malte Ubl published their own <a href=\"https://vercel.com/blog/we-ralph-wiggumed-webstreams-to-make-them-10x-faster\"></a> describing some research work Vercel has been doing around improving the performance of Node.js' Web streams implementation. In that post they discuss the same fundamental performance optimization problem that every implementation of Web streams face:</p><blockquote><p>\"Or consider pipeTo(). Each chunk passes through a full Promise chain: read, write, check backpressure, repeat. An {value, done} result object is allocated per read. Error propagation creates additional Promise branches.</p><p>None of this is wrong. These guarantees matter in the browser where streams cross security boundaries, where cancellation semantics need to be airtight, where you do not control both ends of a pipe. But on the server, when you are piping React Server Components through three transforms at 1KB chunks, the cost adds up.</p></blockquote><p>As part of their research, they have put together a set of proposed improvements for Node.js' Web streams implementation that will eliminate promises in certain code paths which can yield a significant performance boost up to 10x faster, which only goes to prove the point: promises, while useful, add significant overhead. As one of the core maintainers of Node.js, I am looking forward to helping Malte and the folks at Vercel get their proposed improvements landed!</p><p>In a recent update made to Cloudflare Workers, I made similar kinds of modifications to an internal data pipeline that reduced the number of JavaScript promises created in certain application scenarios by up to 200x. The result is several orders of magnitude improvement in performance in those applications.</p><div><h4>Exhausting resources with unconsumed bodies</h4><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-better-web-streams-api/#exhausting-resources-with-unconsumed-bodies\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a></div><p>When  returns a response, the body is a <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/body\"></a>. If you only check the status and don't consume or cancel the body, what happens? The answer varies by implementation, but a common outcome is resource leakage.</p><pre><code>async function checkEndpoint(url) {\n  const response = await fetch(url);\n  return response.ok; // Body is never consumed or cancelled\n}\n\n// In a loop, this can exhaust connection pools\nfor (const url of urls) {\n  await checkEndpoint(url);\n}</code></pre><p>This pattern has caused connection pool exhaustion in Node.js applications using <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/globals.html#fetch\"></a> (the implementation built into Node.js), and similar issues have appeared in other runtimes. The stream holds a reference to the underlying connection, and without explicit consumption or cancellation, the connection may linger until garbage collection – which may not happen soon enough under load.</p><p>The problem is compounded by APIs that implicitly create stream branches. <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request/clone\"></a> and <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/clone\"></a> perform implicit  operations on the body stream – a detail that's easy to miss. Code that clones a request for logging or retry logic may unknowingly create branched streams that need independent consumption, multiplying the resource management burden.</p><p>Now, to be certain, these types of issues  implementation bugs. The connection leak was definitely something that undici needed to fix in its own implementation, but the complexity of the specification does not make dealing with these types of issues easy.</p><blockquote><p>\"Cloning streams in Node.js's fetch() implementation is harder than it looks. When you clone a request or response body, you're calling tee() - which splits a single stream into two branches that both need to be consumed. If one consumer reads faster than the other, data buffers unbounded in memory waiting for the slow branch. If you don't properly consume both branches, the underlying connection leaks. The coordination required between two readers sharing one source makes it easy to accidentally break the original request or exhaust connection pools. It's a simple API call with complex underlying mechanics that are difficult to get right.\" - Matteo Collina, Ph.D. - Platformatic Co-Founder &amp; CTO, Node.js Technical Steering Committee Chair</p></blockquote><div><h4>Falling headlong off the tee() memory cliff</h4><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-better-web-streams-api/#falling-headlong-off-the-tee-memory-cliff\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a></div><p><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream/tee\"></a> splits a stream into two branches. It seems straightforward, but the implementation requires buffering: if one branch is read faster than the other, the data must be held somewhere until the slower branch catches up.</p><pre><code>const [forHash, forStorage] = response.body.tee();\n\n// Hash computation is fast\nconst hash = await computeHash(forHash);\n\n// Storage write is slow — meanwhile, the entire stream\n// may be buffered in memory waiting for this branch\nawait writeToStorage(forStorage);</code></pre><p>The spec does not mandate buffer limits for . And to be fair, the spec allows implementations to implement the actual internal mechanisms for and other APIs in any way they see fit so long as the observable normative requirements of the specification are met. But if an implementation chooses to implement  in the specific way described by the streams specification, then  will come with a built-in memory management issue that is difficult to work around.</p><p>Implementations have had to develop their own strategies for dealing with this. Firefox initially used a linked-list approach that led to O memory growth proportional to the consumption rate difference. In Cloudflare Workers, we opted to implement a shared buffer model where backpressure is signaled by the slowest consumer rather than the fastest.</p><div><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-better-web-streams-api/#transform-backpressure-gaps\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a></div><p> creates a  pair with processing logic in between. The  function executes on , not on read. Processing of the transform happens eagerly as data arrives, regardless of whether any consumer is ready. This causes unnecessary work when consumers are slow, and the backpressure signaling between the two sides has gaps that can cause unbounded buffering under load. The expectation in the spec is that the producer of the data being transformed is paying attention to the  signal on the writable side of the transform but quite often producers just simply ignore it.</p><p>If the transform's operation is synchronous and always enqueues output immediately, it never signals backpressure back to the writable side even when the downstream consumer is slow. This is a consequence of the spec design that many developers completely overlook. In browsers, where there's only a single user and typically only a small number of stream pipelines active at any given time, this type of foot gun is often of no consequence, but it has a major impact on server-side or edge performance in runtimes that serve thousands of concurrent requests.</p><pre><code>const fastTransform = new TransformStream({\n  transform(chunk, controller) {\n    // Synchronously enqueue — this never applies backpressure\n    // Even if the readable side's buffer is full, this succeeds\n    controller.enqueue(processChunk(chunk));\n  }\n});\n\n// Pipe a fast source through the transform to a slow sink\nfastSource\n  .pipeThrough(fastTransform)\n  .pipeTo(slowSink);  // Buffer grows without bound</code></pre><p>What TransformStreams are supposed to do is check for backpressure on the controller and use promises to communicate that back to the writer:</p><pre><code>const fastTransform = new TransformStream({\n  async transform(chunk, controller) {\n    if (controller.desiredSize &lt;= 0) {\n      // Wait on the backpressure to clear somehow\n    }\n\n    controller.enqueue(processChunk(chunk));\n  }\n});</code></pre><p>A difficulty here, however, is that the <code>TransformStreamDefaultController</code> does not have a ready promise mechanism like Writers do; so the  implementation would need to implement a polling mechanism to periodically check when &nbsp;becomes positive again.</p><p>The problem gets worse in pipelines. When you chain multiple transforms – say, parse, transform, then serialize – each  has its own internal readable and writable buffers. If implementers follow the spec strictly, data cascades through these buffers in a push-oriented fashion: the source pushes to transform A, which pushes to transform B, which pushes to transform C, each accumulating data in intermediate buffers before the final consumer has even started pulling. With three transforms, you can have six internal buffers filling up simultaneously.</p><p>Developers using the streams API are expected to remember to use options like  when creating their sources, transforms, and writable destinations but often they either forget or simply choose to ignore it.</p><pre><code>source\n  .pipeThrough(parse)      // buffers filling...\n  .pipeThrough(transform)  // more buffers filling...\n  .pipeThrough(serialize)  // even more buffers...\n  .pipeTo(destination);    // consumer hasn't started yet</code></pre><p>Implementations have found ways to optimize transform pipelines by collapsing identity transforms, short-circuiting non-observable paths, deferring buffer allocation, or falling back to native code that does not run JavaScript at all. Deno, Bun, and Cloudflare Workers have all successfully implemented \"native path\" optimizations that can help eliminate much of the overhead, and Vercel's recent <a href=\"https://vercel.com/blog/we-ralph-wiggumed-webstreams-to-make-them-10x-faster\"></a> research is working on similar optimizations for Node.js. But the optimizations themselves add significant complexity and still can't fully escape the inherently push-oriented model that TransformStream uses.</p><div><h4>GC thrashing in server-side rendering</h4><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-better-web-streams-api/#gc-thrashing-in-server-side-rendering\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a></div><p>Streaming server-side rendering (SSR) is a particularly painful case. A typical SSR stream might render thousands of small HTML fragments, each passing through the streams machinery:</p><pre><code>// Each component enqueues a small chunk\nfunction renderComponent(controller) {\n  controller.enqueue(encoder.encode(`&lt;div&gt;${content}&lt;/div&gt;`));\n}\n\n// Hundreds of components = hundreds of enqueue calls\n// Each one triggers promise machinery internally\nfor (const component of components) {\n  renderComponent(controller);  // Promises created, objects allocated\n}</code></pre><p>Every fragment means promises created for  calls, promises for backpressure coordination, intermediate buffer allocations, and result objects – most of which become garbage almost immediately.</p><p>Under load, this creates GC pressure that can devastate throughput. The JavaScript engine spends significant time collecting short-lived objects instead of doing useful work. Latency becomes unpredictable as GC pauses interrupt request handling. I've seen SSR workloads where garbage collection accounts for a substantial portion (up to and beyond 50%) of total CPU time per request. That's time that could be spent actually rendering content.</p><p>The irony is that streaming SSR is supposed to improve performance by sending content incrementally. But the overhead of the streams machinery can negate those gains, especially for pages with many small components. Developers sometimes find that buffering the entire response is actually faster than streaming through Web streams, defeating the purpose entirely.</p><div><h3>The optimization treadmill</h3><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-better-web-streams-api/#the-optimization-treadmill\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a></div><p>To achieve usable performance, every major runtime has resorted to non-standard internal optimizations for Web streams. Node.js, Deno, Bun, and Cloudflare Workers have all developed their own workarounds. This is particularly true for streams wired up to system-level I/O, where much of the machinery is non-observable and can be short-circuited.</p><p>Finding these optimization opportunities can itself be a significant undertaking. It requires end-to-end understanding of the spec to identify which behaviors are observable and which can safely be elided. Even then, whether a given optimization is actually spec-compliant is often unclear. Implementers must make judgment calls about which semantics they can relax without breaking compatibility. This puts enormous pressure on runtime teams to become spec experts just to achieve acceptable performance.</p><p>These optimizations are difficult to implement, frequently error-prone, and lead to inconsistent behavior across runtimes. Bun's \"<a href=\"https://bun.sh/docs/api/streams#direct-readablestream\"></a>\" optimization takes a deliberately and observably non-standard approach, bypassing much of the spec's machinery entirely. Cloudflare Workers' <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/streams/transformstream/\"></a> provides a fast-path for pass-through transforms but is Workers-specific and implements behaviors that are not standard for a . Each runtime has its own set of tricks and the natural tendency is toward non-standard solutions, because that's often the only way to make things fast.</p><p>This fragmentation hurts portability. Code that performs well on one runtime may behave differently (or poorly) on another, even though it's using \"standard\" APIs. The complexity burden on runtime implementers is substantial, and the subtle behavioral differences create friction for developers trying to write cross-runtime code, particularly those maintaining frameworks that must be able to run efficiently across many runtime environments.</p><p>It is also necessary to emphasize that many optimizations are only possible in parts of the spec that are unobservable to user code. The alternative, like Bun \"Direct Streams\", is to intentionally diverge from the spec-defined observable behaviors. This means optimizations often feel \"incomplete\". They work in some scenarios but not in others, in some runtimes but not others, etc. Every such case adds to the overall unsustainable complexity of the Web streams approach which is why most runtime implementers rarely put significant effort into further improvements to their streams implementations once the conformance tests are passing.</p><p>Implementers shouldn't need to jump through these hoops. When you find yourself needing to relax or bypass spec semantics just to achieve reasonable performance, that's a sign something is wrong with the spec itself. A well-designed streaming API should be efficient by default, not require each runtime to invent its own escape hatches.</p><p>A complex spec creates complex edge cases. The <a href=\"https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/tree/master/streams\"><u>Web Platform Tests for streams</u></a> span over 70 test files, and while comprehensive testing is a good thing, what's telling is what needs to be tested.</p><p>Consider some of the more obscure tests that implementations must pass:</p><ul><li><p>Prototype pollution defense: One test patches then to intercept promise resolutions, then verifies that  and  operations don't leak internal values through the prototype chain. This tests a security property that only exists because the spec's promise-heavy internals create an attack surface.</p></li><li><p>WebAssembly memory rejection: BYOB reads must explicitly reject ArrayBuffers backed by WebAssembly memory, which look like regular buffers but can't be transferred. This edge case exists because of the spec's buffer detachment model – a simpler API wouldn't need to handle it.</p></li><li><p>Crash regression for state machine conflicts: A test specifically checks that calling  after  doesn't crash the runtime. This sequence creates a conflict in the internal state machine — the  fulfills the pending read and should invalidate the , but implementations must gracefully handle the subsequent  rather than corrupting memory in order to cover the very likely possibility that developers are not using the complex API correctly.</p></li></ul><p>These aren't contrived scenarios invented by test authors in total vacuum. They're consequences of the spec's design and reflect real world bugs.</p><p>For runtime implementers, passing the WPT suite means handling intricate corner cases that most application code will never encounter. The tests encode not just the happy path but the full matrix of interactions between readers, writers, controllers, queues, strategies, and the promise machinery that connects them all.</p><p>A simpler API would mean fewer concepts, fewer interactions between concepts, and fewer edge cases to get right resulting in more confidence that implementations actually behave consistently.</p><p>Web streams are complex for users and implementers alike. The problems with the spec aren't bugs. They emerge from using the API exactly as designed. They aren't issues that can be fixed solely through incremental improvements. They're consequences of fundamental design choices. To improve things we need different foundations.</p><div><h2>A better streams API is possible</h2><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-better-web-streams-api/#a-better-streams-api-is-possible\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a></div><p>After implementing the Web streams spec multiple times across different runtimes and seeing the pain points firsthand, I decided it was time to explore what a better, alternative streaming API could look like if designed from first principles today.</p><p>What follows is a proof of concept: it's not a finished standard, not a production-ready library, not even necessarily a concrete proposal for something new, but a starting point for discussion that demonstrates the problems with Web streams aren't inherent to streaming itself; they're consequences of specific design choices that could be made differently. Whether this exact API is the right answer is less important than whether it sparks a productive conversation about what we actually need from a streaming primitive.</p><p>Before diving into API design, it's worth asking: what is a stream?</p><p>At its core, a stream is just a sequence of data that arrives over time. You don't have all of it at once. You process it incrementally as it becomes available.</p><p>Unix pipes are perhaps the purest expression of this idea:</p><pre><code>cat access.log | grep \"error\" | sort | uniq -c</code></pre><p>\nData flows left to right. Each stage reads input, does its work, writes output. There's no pipe reader to acquire, no controller lock to manage. If a downstream stage is slow, upstream stages naturally slow down as well. Backpressure is implicit in the model, not a separate mechanism to learn (or ignore).</p><p>In JavaScript, the natural primitive for \"a sequence of things that arrive over time\" is already in the language: the async iterable. You consume it with . You stop consuming by stopping iteration.</p><p>This is the intuition the new API tries to preserve: streams should feel like iteration, because that's what they are. The complexity of Web streams – readers, writers, controllers, locks, queuing strategies – obscures this fundamental simplicity. A better API should make the simple case simple and only add complexity where it's genuinely needed.</p><p>I built the proof-of-concept alternative around a different set of principles.</p><p>No custom  class with hidden internal state. A readable stream is just an <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols#the_async_iterator_and_async_iterable_protocols\"><code><u>AsyncIterable&lt;Uint8Array[]&gt;</u></code></a>. You consume it with . No readers to acquire, no locks to manage.</p><p>Transforms don't execute until the consumer pulls. There's no eager evaluation, no hidden buffering. Data flows on-demand from source, through transforms, to the consumer. If you stop iterating, processing stops.</p><p>Backpressure is strict by default. When a buffer is full, writes reject rather than silently accumulating. You can configure alternative policies – block until space is available, drop oldest, drop newest – but you have to choose explicitly. No more silent memory growth.</p><p>Instead of yielding one chunk per iteration, streams yield  arrays of chunks. This amortizes the async overhead across multiple chunks, reducing promise creation and microtask latency in hot paths.</p><p>The API deals exclusively with bytes (<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Uint8Array\"></a>). Strings are UTF-8 encoded automatically. There's no \"value stream\" vs \"byte stream\" dichotomy. If you want to stream arbitrary JavaScript values, use async iterables directly. While the API uses , it treats chunks as opaque. There is no partial consumption, no BYOB patterns, no byte-level operations within the streaming machinery itself. Chunks go in, chunks come out, unchanged unless a transform explicitly modifies them.</p><div><h4>Synchronous fast paths matter</h4><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-better-web-streams-api/#synchronous-fast-paths-matter\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a></div><p>The API recognizes that synchronous data sources are both necessary and common. The application should not be forced to always accept the performance cost of asynchronous scheduling simply because that's the only option provided. At the same time, mixing sync and async processing can be dangerous. Synchronous paths should always be an option and should always be explicit.</p><div><h4>Creating and consuming streams</h4><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-better-web-streams-api/#creating-and-consuming-streams\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a></div><p>In Web streams, creating a simple producer/consumer pair requires , manual encoding, and careful lock management:</p><pre><code>const { readable, writable } = new TransformStream();\nconst enc = new TextEncoder();\nconst writer = writable.getWriter();\nawait writer.write(enc.encode(\"Hello, World!\"));\nawait writer.close();\nwriter.releaseLock();\n\nconst dec = new TextDecoder();\nlet text = '';\nfor await (const chunk of readable) {\n  text += dec.decode(chunk, { stream: true });\n}\ntext += dec.decode();</code></pre><p>Even this relatively clean version requires: a , manual  and , and explicit lock release.</p><p>Here's the equivalent with the new API:</p><pre><code>import { Stream } from 'new-streams';\n\n// Create a push stream\nconst { writer, readable } = Stream.push();\n\n// Write data — backpressure is enforced\nawait writer.write(\"Hello, World!\");\nawait writer.end();\n\n// Consume as text\nconst text = await Stream.text(readable);</code></pre><p>The readable is just an async iterable. You can pass it to any function that expects one, including  which collects and decodes the entire stream.</p><p>The writer has a simple interface:  for batched writes,  to signal completion, and  for errors. That's essentially it.</p><p>The Writer is not a concrete class. Any object that implements , , and  can be a writer making it easy to adapt existing APIs or create specialized implementations without subclassing. There's no complex  protocol with , , , callbacks that must coordinate through a controller whose lifecycle and state are independent of the  it is bound to.</p><p>Here's a simple in-memory writer that collects all written data:</p><pre><code>// A minimal writer implementation — just an object with methods\nfunction createBufferWriter() {\n  const chunks = [];\n  let totalBytes = 0;\n  let closed = false;\n\n  const addChunk = (chunk) =&gt; {\n    chunks.push(chunk);\n    totalBytes += chunk.byteLength;\n  };\n\n  return {\n    get desiredSize() { return closed ? null : 1; },\n\n    // Async variants\n    write(chunk) { addChunk(chunk); },\n    writev(batch) { for (const c of batch) addChunk(c); },\n    end() { closed = true; return totalBytes; },\n    abort(reason) { closed = true; chunks.length = 0; },\n\n    // Sync variants return boolean (true = accepted)\n    writeSync(chunk) { addChunk(chunk); return true; },\n    writevSync(batch) { for (const c of batch) addChunk(c); return true; },\n    endSync() { closed = true; return totalBytes; },\n    abortSync(reason) { closed = true; chunks.length = 0; return true; },\n\n    getChunks() { return chunks; }\n  };\n}\n\n// Use it\nconst writer = createBufferWriter();\nawait Stream.pipeTo(source, writer);\nconst allData = writer.getChunks();</code></pre><p>No base class to extend, no abstract methods to implement, no controller to coordinate with. Just an object with the right shape.</p><p>Under the new API design, transforms should not perform any work until the data is being consumed. This is a fundamental principle.</p><pre><code>// Nothing executes until iteration begins\nconst output = Stream.pull(source, compress, encrypt);\n\n// Transforms execute as we iterate\nfor await (const chunks of output) {\n  for (const chunk of chunks) {\n    process(chunk);\n  }\n}</code></pre><p> creates a lazy pipeline. The  and  transforms don't run until you start iterating output. Each iteration pulls data through the pipeline on demand.</p><p>This is fundamentally different from Web streams' <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream/pipeThrough\"></a>, which starts actively pumping data from the source to the transform as soon as you set up the pipe. Pull semantics mean you control when processing happens, and stopping iteration stops processing.</p><p>Transforms can be stateless or stateful. A stateless transform is just a function that takes chunks and returns transformed chunks:</p><pre><code>// Stateless transform — a pure function\n// Receives chunks or null (flush signal)\nconst toUpperCase = (chunks) =&gt; {\n  if (chunks === null) return null; // End of stream\n  return chunks.map(chunk =&gt; {\n    const str = new TextDecoder().decode(chunk);\n    return new TextEncoder().encode(str.toUpperCase());\n  });\n};\n\n// Use it directly\nconst output = Stream.pull(source, toUpperCase);</code></pre><p>Stateful transforms are simple objects with member functions that maintain state across calls:</p><pre><code>// Stateful transform — a generator that wraps the source\nfunction createLineParser() {\n  // Helper to concatenate Uint8Arrays\n  const concat = (...arrays) =&gt; {\n    const result = new Uint8Array(arrays.reduce((n, a) =&gt; n + a.length, 0));\n    let offset = 0;\n    for (const arr of arrays) { result.set(arr, offset); offset += arr.length; }\n    return result;\n  };\n\n  return {\n    async *transform(source) {\n      let pending = new Uint8Array(0);\n      \n      for await (const chunks of source) {\n        if (chunks === null) {\n          // Flush: yield any remaining data\n          if (pending.length &gt; 0) yield [pending];\n          continue;\n        }\n        \n        // Concatenate pending data with new chunks\n        const combined = concat(pending, ...chunks);\n        const lines = [];\n        let start = 0;\n\n        for (let i = 0; i &lt; combined.length; i++) {\n          if (combined[i] === 0x0a) { // newline\n            lines.push(combined.slice(start, i));\n            start = i + 1;\n          }\n        }\n\n        pending = combined.slice(start);\n        if (lines.length &gt; 0) yield lines;\n      }\n    }\n  };\n}\n\nconst output = Stream.pull(source, createLineParser());</code></pre><p>For transforms that need cleanup on abort, add an abort handler:</p><pre><code>// Stateful transform with resource cleanup\nfunction createGzipCompressor() {\n  // Hypothetical compression API...\n  const deflate = new Deflater({ gzip: true });\n\n  return {\n    async *transform(source) {\n      for await (const chunks of source) {\n        if (chunks === null) {\n          // Flush: finalize compression\n          deflate.push(new Uint8Array(0), true);\n          if (deflate.result) yield [deflate.result];\n        } else {\n          for (const chunk of chunks) {\n            deflate.push(chunk, false);\n            if (deflate.result) yield [deflate.result];\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    abort(reason) {\n      // Clean up compressor resources on error/cancellation\n    }\n  };\n}</code></pre><p>For implementers, there's no Transformer protocol with , ,  methods and controller coordination passed into a  class that has its own hidden state machine and buffering mechanisms. Transforms are just functions or simple objects: far simpler to implement and test.</p><div><h4>Explicit backpressure policies</h4><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-better-web-streams-api/#explicit-backpressure-policies\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a></div><p>When a bounded buffer fills up and a producer wants to write more, there are only a few things you can do:</p><ol><li><p>Reject the write: refuse to accept more data</p></li><li><p>Wait: block until space becomes available</p></li><li><p>Discard old data: evict what's already buffered to make room</p></li><li><p>Discard new data: drop what's incoming</p></li></ol><p>That's it. Any other response is either a variation of these (like \"resize the buffer,\" which is really just deferring the choice) or domain-specific logic that doesn't belong in a general streaming primitive. Web streams currently always choose Wait by default.</p><p>The new API makes you choose one of these four explicitly:</p><ul><li><p> (default): Rejects writes when the buffer is full and too many writes are pending. Catches \"fire-and-forget\" patterns where producers ignore backpressure.</p></li><li><p>: Writes wait until buffer space is available. Use when you trust the producer to await writes properly.</p></li><li><p>: Drops the oldest buffered data to make room. Useful for live feeds where stale data loses value.</p></li><li><p>: Discards incoming data when full. Useful when you want to process what you have without being overwhelmed.</p></li></ul><pre><code>const { writer, readable } = Stream.push({\n  highWaterMark: 10,\n  backpressure: 'strict' // or 'block', 'drop-oldest', 'drop-newest'\n});</code></pre><p>No more hoping producers cooperate. The policy you choose determines what happens when the buffer fills.</p><p>Here's how each policy behaves when a producer writes faster than the consumer reads:</p><pre><code>// strict: Catches fire-and-forget writes that ignore backpressure\nconst strict = Stream.push({ highWaterMark: 2, backpressure: 'strict' });\nstrict.writer.write(chunk1);  // ok (not awaited)\nstrict.writer.write(chunk2);  // ok (fills slots buffer)\nstrict.writer.write(chunk3);  // ok (queued in pending)\nstrict.writer.write(chunk4);  // ok (pending buffer fills)\nstrict.writer.write(chunk5);  // throws! too many pending writes\n\n// block: Wait for space (unbounded pending queue)\nconst blocking = Stream.push({ highWaterMark: 2, backpressure: 'block' });\nawait blocking.writer.write(chunk1);  // ok\nawait blocking.writer.write(chunk2);  // ok\nawait blocking.writer.write(chunk3);  // waits until consumer reads\nawait blocking.writer.write(chunk4);  // waits until consumer reads\nawait blocking.writer.write(chunk5);  // waits until consumer reads\n\n// drop-oldest: Discard old data to make room\nconst dropOld = Stream.push({ highWaterMark: 2, backpressure: 'drop-oldest' });\nawait dropOld.writer.write(chunk1);  // ok\nawait dropOld.writer.write(chunk2);  // ok\nawait dropOld.writer.write(chunk3);  // ok, chunk1 discarded\n\n// drop-newest: Discard incoming data when full\nconst dropNew = Stream.push({ highWaterMark: 2, backpressure: 'drop-newest' });\nawait dropNew.writer.write(chunk1);  // ok\nawait dropNew.writer.write(chunk2);  // ok\nawait dropNew.writer.write(chunk3);  // silently dropped</code></pre><div><h4>Explicit Multi-consumer patterns</h4><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-better-web-streams-api/#explicit-multi-consumer-patterns\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a></div><pre><code>// Share with explicit buffer management\nconst shared = Stream.share(source, {\n  highWaterMark: 100,\n  backpressure: 'strict'\n});\n\nconst consumer1 = shared.pull();\nconst consumer2 = shared.pull(decompress);</code></pre><p>Instead of  with its hidden unbounded buffer, you get explicit multi-consumer primitives.  is pull-based: consumers pull from a shared source, and you configure the buffer limits and backpressure policy upfront.</p><p>There's also  for push-based multi-consumer scenarios. Both require you to think about what happens when consumers run at different speeds, because that's a real concern that shouldn't be hidden.</p><p>Not all streaming workloads involve I/O. When your source is in-memory and your transforms are pure functions, async machinery adds overhead without benefit. You're paying for coordination of \"waiting\" that adds no benefit.</p><p>The new API has complete parallel sync versions: , , , and so on. If your source and transforms are all synchronous, you can process the entire pipeline without a single promise.</p><pre><code>// Async — when source or transforms may be asynchronous\nconst textAsync = await Stream.text(source);\n\n// Sync — when all components are synchronous\nconst textSync = Stream.textSync(source);</code></pre><p>Here's a complete synchronous pipeline – compression, transformation, and consumption with zero async overhead:</p><pre><code>// Synchronous source from in-memory data\nconst source = Stream.fromSync([inputBuffer]);\n\n// Synchronous transforms\nconst compressed = Stream.pullSync(source, zlibCompressSync);\nconst encrypted = Stream.pullSync(compressed, aesEncryptSync);\n\n// Synchronous consumption — no promises, no event loop trips\nconst result = Stream.bytesSync(encrypted);</code></pre><p>The entire pipeline executes in a single call stack. No promises are created, no microtask queue scheduling occurs, and no GC pressure from short-lived async machinery. For CPU-bound workloads like parsing, compression, or transformation of in-memory data, this can be significantly faster than the equivalent Web streams code – which would force async boundaries even when every component is synchronous.</p><p>Web streams has no synchronous path. Even if your source has data ready and your transform is a pure function, you still pay for promise creation and microtask scheduling on every operation. Promises are fantastic for cases in which waiting is actually necessary, but they aren't always necessary. The new API lets you stay in sync-land when that's what you need.</p><div><h4>Bridging the gap between this and web streams</h4><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-better-web-streams-api/#bridging-the-gap-between-this-and-web-streams\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a></div><p>The async iterator based approach provides a natural bridge between this alternative approach and Web streams. When coming from a ReadableStream to this new approach, simply passing the readable in as input works as expected when the ReadableStream is set up to yield bytes:</p><pre><code>const readable = getWebReadableStreamSomehow();\nconst input = Stream.pull(readable, transform1, transform2);\nfor await (const chunks of input) {\n  // process chunks\n}</code></pre><p>When adapting to a ReadableStream, a bit more work is required since the alternative approach yields batches of chunks, but the adaptation layer is as easily straightforward:</p><pre><code>async function* adapt(input) {\n  for await (const chunks of input) {\n    for (const chunk of chunks) {\n      yield chunk;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nconst input = Stream.pull(source, transform1, transform2);\nconst readable = ReadableStream.from(adapt(input));</code></pre><div><h4>How this addresses the real-world failures from earlier</h4><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-better-web-streams-api/#how-this-addresses-the-real-world-failures-from-earlier\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a></div><ul><li><p>Unconsumed bodies: Pull semantics mean nothing happens until you iterate. No hidden resource retention. If you don't consume a stream, there's no background machinery holding connections open.</p></li><li><p>The  memory cliff:  requires explicit buffer configuration. You choose the  and backpressure policy upfront: no more silent unbounded growth when consumers run at different speeds.</p></li><li><p>Transform backpressure gaps: Pull-through transforms execute on-demand. Data doesn't cascade through intermediate buffers; it flows only when the consumer pulls. Stop iterating, stop processing.</p></li><li><p>GC thrashing in SSR: Batched chunks () amortize async overhead. Sync pipelines via  eliminate promise allocation entirely for CPU-bound workloads.</p></li></ul><p>The design choices have performance implications. Here are benchmarks from the reference implementation of this possible alternative compared to Web streams (Node.js v24.x, Apple M1 Pro, averaged over 10 runs):</p><table><tbody><tr></tr><tr><td><p>Small chunks (1KB × 5000)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Tiny chunks (100B × 10000)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Async iteration (8KB × 1000)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Chained 3× transforms (8KB × 500)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>High-frequency (64B × 20000)</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>The chained transform result is particularly striking: pull-through semantics eliminate the intermediate buffering that plagues Web streams pipelines. Instead of each  eagerly filling its internal buffers, data flows on-demand from consumer to source.</p><p>Now, to be fair, Node.js really has not yet put significant effort into fully optimizing the performance of its Web streams implementation. There's likely significant room for improvement in Node.js' performance results through a bit of applied effort to optimize the hot paths there. That said, running these benchmarks in Deno and Bun also show a significant performance improvement with this alternative iterator based approach than in either of their Web streams implementations as well.</p><p>Browser benchmarks (Chrome/Blink, averaged over 3 runs) show consistent gains as well:</p><table><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table><p>These benchmarks measure throughput in controlled scenarios; real-world performance depends on your specific use case. The difference between Node.js and browser gains reflects the distinct optimization paths each environment takes for Web streams.</p><p>It's worth noting that these benchmarks compare a pure TypeScript/JavaScript implementation of the new API against the native (JavaScript/C++/Rust) implementations of Web streams in each runtime. The new API's reference implementation has had no performance optimization work; the gains come entirely from the design. A native implementation would likely show further improvement.</p><p>The gains illustrate how fundamental design choices compound: batching amortizes async overhead, pull semantics eliminate intermediate buffering, and the freedom for implementations to use synchronous fast paths when data is available immediately all contribute.</p><blockquote><p>\"We’ve done a lot to improve performance and consistency in Node streams, but there’s something uniquely powerful about starting from scratch.

The outing was Herzog’s idea, a joyride in a little four-seat Cessna to celebrate one of the women’s birthdays but also to capture their reactions for a film he was making called <em>The Land of Silence and Darkness</em>. The footage from that afternoon displays many of what would become the hallmarks of Herzog’s style over the coming half-century: the daring gambit on the border of exploitation, the obsession with vision and existential loneliness, and the search for poetry at the extremes of human experience. It is an astonishing piece of filmmaking. No matter how many times I have seen it, it never fails to evoke an overwhelming complex of thought and feeling that is hard to put into words. As with the flight itself, one has to experience it to know what it is about, and even then it is hard not to come away with the sense of having encountered something powerfully human that nevertheless lies beyond our capacity to articulate it in speech. As if to confirm this impression, Herzog, whose unmistakable voice and philosophical commentary have become the most recognizable part of both the man and his work, is silent. He doesn’t even ask afterward what it was like.</p><div><div><div><a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/15865/9780593833674\" target=\"_blank\">Buy this book</a></div></div></div><p>This, too, would become a characteristic of Herzog’s oeuvre: the search for an elusive transcendence over the edge of the ordinary that he calls “ecstatic truth.” Herzog is obsessed with the idea of truth and has insisted for decades that it is the central concern of all his films. This might seem rich from one of the great self-mythologizers of our time, who has never hidden the fact that he punches up his documentaries with fabrication, scripted scenes, and misattributed quotes, and who once described as his greatest documentary. Yet the truth that Herzog has in mind is more like the truth of poetry than the mere facts and shared understanding that he mocks as “the truth of accountants.” As he put it in <a href=\"https://walkerart.org/magazine/minnesota-declaration-truth-documentary-cinema-1999/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a 1999 manifesto</a>, “There are deeper strata of truth in cinema, and there is such a thing as poetic, ecstatic truth. It is mysterious and elusive, and can be reached only through fabrication and imagination and stylization.”</p><p>The idea that an artist, even a documentarian, would mix fact with fiction is not quite so radical today as it might have been at the peak of cinema verité. Yet questions of truth and its relation to reality are more pressing and vexed than ever. Getting at deep truths by means of artful lies may seem less appealing or daring in the era of the deepfake. Herzog’s oft-repeated provocation that only the “conman, the liar who knew what he was talking about, would speak the truth” loses some of its countercultural appeal when the conmen move from the margins of society to the centers of power and bullshit becomes de rigueur.</p><p>What separates the auteur who resolutely clings to a personal, unempirical vision of the truth, and who has few scruples about lying if it convinces his audience of that vision’s reality, from the conspiracy theorists and propagandists who seek to deceive the public by similar means? How to distinguish what Herzog describes as his films’ exploitation of the “collective willingness to be transported into the realm of poetry, of madness, and of the pure joy of storytelling” from darker, more dangerous attempts to channel that willingness into political projects and collective madness?</p><p>The answer seems obvious. Herzog makes idiosyncratic films about the sorts of truth that can be found in cave paintings and the flight of ski-jumpers and men devoured by bears, while today’s AI-powered propagandists seek to manipulate viewers into a political stance via the banal aesthetics of cable news and social media. But that’s a little too easy; we’d like to be able to say more about how to distinguish between visionaries and what makes one deep truth truer than another. Herzog seems to appreciate the predicament. He has written a book,  (translated by the great Michael Hoffmann), to explain himself, or at least to put some distance between his life’s work and what is widely agreed to be one of the most pressing social and democratic dangers of our time. It is a book that he has been promising to write for years to expand upon his guiding ideal of ecstatic truth, which he has previously only been able to gesture at and move past by saying he’d need a whole book to explain. And now we have that book.</p><p> is divided into 11 chapters with titles like “What is Truth?,” “Philosophical Efforts,” “Fake News: A Brief History,” “Ecstatic Truth,” “The Post-Truth Era,” and “The Future of Truth” that promise insight into Herzog’s vision of ecstatic truth and, by pressing it up against contemporary concerns, perhaps also to shed some off-kilter illumination onto our shared predicament. Alas, what we get in these chapters is a profound deflation of the excitement portended by their titles, not because ecstatic truth is the sort of thing that fundamentally cannot be put into words—as may be—but because the author hardly bothers trying.</p><p>It would be unreasonable to demand an exhaustive treatise on the nature of truth from an artist who has spent his life making intuitive magic with images and who has been known to explain himself with Hölderlin’s line that “man is a god when he dreams, a beggar when he reflects.” But since he has decided to write a book of reflections on the subject, we would at least like to see him give it a try. A little mischief at a minimum. What we mostly get, instead, are passages repurposed from earlier books and interviews stitched together and repackaged in such a slight and slapdash form—with neither the coherence of argument nor the constellation of collage and aphorism—that one gets the sense that the book was completed either to satisfy a contractual obligation or to finance an upcoming film.</p><p>This is disappointing, not least because two years ago, Herzog published a book as original and superb as his best films, the memoir <em>Every Man for Himself and God Against All </em>(also translated by Hofmann). Herzog’s memoir is an extraordinary piece of work that proves he is perfectly capable of evoking all the wonder and eccentric illumination of his films in prose. It contains dozens of moments far more illuminating on the question of truth (among much else) than its slim sequel, delivered not through explanation but story and image—an indication of just how indispensable images and narrative are to Herzog’s poetic evocation of a world that exceeds his grasp. Here, for instance, is Herzog at 16, out at sea with some local fishermen off the rugged coast of Hora Sfakion, Crete:</p><blockquote><p>Above me was the orb of the cosmos, stars that I felt I could reach up and grab; everything was rocking me in an infinite cradle. And below me, lit up brightly by the carbide lamp, was the depth of the ocean, as though the dome of the firmament formed a sphere with it. Instead of stars, there were lots of flashing silvery fish. Bedded in a cosmos without compare, above, below, all around, a speechless silence, I found myself in a stunned surprise. I was certain that there and then I knew all there was to know. My fate had been revealed to me…. I was completely convinced I would never see my eighteenth birthday because, lit up by such grace as I now was, there could never be anything like ordinary time for me again.</p></blockquote><p>Those curious about Herzog’s views on ecstatic truth would be better served by reading his memoir or the book-length interview with Paul Cronin published as <em>Werner Herzog: A Guide for the Perplexed</em>, notwithstanding the fact that a good deal of those previous books reappears in this one.</p><p>Whole chapters consist of anecdotes from the memoir that are retold or expanded upon with no new revelations or insight, least of all about fake news or the future of truth, as promised. (Although to be fair, his story about Mike Tyson’s prodigious knowledge of the Merovingians is so good that it bears repeating.) The book’s observations about the nature of truth are also rehashed nearly verbatim from previous works to somewhat deadening effect, as the provocations of a visionary begin to sound a bit more like inert slogans than careful (or even wild) thinking on the subject. A highlight of the book—and perhaps its hidden moral—is a two-paragraph chapter about a pig in Sicily that fell into the sewer, was trapped there, and eventually changed the shape of its body to fit its confinement, followed by a rumination on the colossal amount of inbreeding it would take to reach to Alpha Centauri. However, it turns out that this story, too, has already appeared in print at least twice, once in a 1979 diary entry <a href=\"https://www.theparisreview.org/letters-essays/5909/language-itself-resists-werner-herzog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">published by </a> in 2009 under the fitting title “Language Itself Resists,” and again in a broader selection from his diaries published that same year as .</p><p>Herzog comes closest to considering the place of ecstatic truth in a “post-truth era” in a chapter on the novel powers of artificial intelligence to produce “fictive ‘truths.’” It is one of the few chapters that appears to have been written specifically for this book, which seems to indicate that Herzog is sensitive to the challenge that today’s shifting epistemic tides pose to his guiding ideal. But instead of grappling with the question, or at least giving his view of it, Herzog offers a brief catalog of things that LLMs are OK at, includes a few execrable poems written by AI, and then ends abruptly by informing the reader that an AI-generated photo recently won an international photography contest. Nothing is said about the possibility of an LLM producing anything truly original; or the fact that it doesn’t actually live in, perceive, or understand the world whose signs it probabilistically manipulates; or the enormous environmental costs of using these tools to supplant elementary human thinking, which one would think ought to bother a man who rightly describes the drive to extraplanetary colonization as a morally grotesque abandonment of the only habitable planet we will ever have. And it’s too bad, since we’d like to know what Werner Herzog thinks about all that.</p><p>Viewed in the most generous light, the book’s failure to achieve what it sets out to do suggests that perhaps we shouldn’t want an explanation of Herzog’s view of truth,and certainly that Herzog may not want to understand what he means by “ecstatic truth” in fear of extinguishing the need to quest after it.</p><section></section><p>It is obvious that what Herzog really cares about is the quest—so much so that its object, truth, seems of negligible importance by comparison. It might just as well have been authenticity or beauty or transcendence or something altogether invented, so long as it offered an unreachable destination. In the chapter on “Philosophical Efforts,” Herzog writes, “The quest itself, bringing us nearer to the unrevealed truth, allows us to participate in something inherently unattainable, which is truth.” Anyone else and we’d want to know what grounds he has for thinking that  claim about the nature of truthis itself true, but for Herzog such questions miss the point. The reality of an unattainable, ecstatic truth is an article of faith that justifies and structures his life’s work. Like that other great visionary Don Quixote, Herzog has spent a lifetime plunging himself into ordeals and suffering whose absurdity only serves to intensify his commitment to the quest by testifying to the reality of its elusive, unrevealed object. Who would endure such hardships, we cannot help but ask, if there weren’t some reality to the vision, if there weren’t something true about ecstatic truth? But if this is a sort of truth, then it is a truth in which one must believe but cannot know. It may be the sort of thing we can glimpse in the films and memoirs, but it will be very hard (if not impossible) to capture, rather than allude to, in speech and writing.</p><p>Herzog’s attempt to finally grasp the truth he has defined as ungraspable calls to mind the doomed adventures of the incorrigible visionaries he has spent his career mythologizing, men who cling so implacably to their idea of how things ought to be that it seems to elevate them above the meaninglessness of existence even as it sinks them down into it with the inevitable failure of hubris. Yet when I return to the book’s concluding chapter on “The Future of Truth” and find a mere two sentences of the hollowest platitude, I don’t think of Fitzcaraldo or Aguirre but that bit from Hölderlin that Herzog is fond of reciting. The full quote paints a different picture: “O man is a god when he dreams, a beggar when he thinks, and when enthusiasm is gone, he stands there like a wayward son whom the father has driven out of the house and regards the meager pennies that pity gave him for the journey.”</p><p>Many times has Herzog faced the world at the start of such a journey, wayward, unfunded, and uncertain where it might lead. And many times has he returned with marvels in his hands. Let us hope that this book marks the beginning of a journey and not its end.</p><div><ul></ul><div><div><div><p>Lowry Pressly is a writer and teacher, currently at Stanford University in the Department of Political Science, the McCoy Family Center for Ethics in Society, and the Stanford Civics Initiative.

      "content": "<p>It started with a flash of insight like a thunderbolt in a snow storm, the sort of insight that can only be induced by high altitude hypoxia and making breakfast.&nbsp;</p><p>“Breakfast is a vector space. You can place pancakes, crepes, and scrambled eggs on a simplex where the variables are the ratios between milk, eggs, and flour. We have explored too little of this manifold. More breakfasts can exist than we have known.”</p><p>I stood in the kitchen paralyzed by indecision. The mixing bowl was in front of me, the milk, eggs, and flour next to it, all of them individually as familiar as they had been a moment before, but now the possibilities for their combination were just too great. Breakfast was now an alien fractal intruding on our world like the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBsJgceM0KI\">lighthouse at the end of Annihilation</a>. The thoughts came unbidden.</p><p>“In the manifold of breakfast, are there empty subspaces? Might there be breakfasts that no one has ever had? With a theoretical model of breakfast, can we derive the existence of ‘dark breakfasts,’ breakfasts that we know must exist, but have never observed?”</p><p>The curtain of reality had pulled back for me, and I could no longer pretend to be ignorant of these eldritch possibilities. I furiously began to map the known breakfasts. If the dark breakfast exists, I must be able to find it in the interstices of the normal familiar world.</p><p>First I mapped all that I could recall from memory, pancakes, crepes, waffles, scrambled eggs, popovers, omelettes, and on and on, scouring my brain for every fast I had ever broken. The beginnings of the contours of breakfast began to reveal themselves. A gaping hole stared back at me, but I couldn’t yet be sure. I had to search the dark corners of the world to see if somewhere in far off lands that abyss had yet been filled. I called upon <a href=\"https://gemini.google.com/\">friendly ghosts</a>. I paged through <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page\">ancient tomes</a>. I added kaiserschmarrn, swedish pancakes, dan bing, madeleines, crumpets, clafoutis, blinis, pannu kakku, parathas, nalesniki. The map filled in bit by bit, but it was no use. The gap in the fabric of breakfast remained.</p><p>I searched for benign explanations. Could it be that milk is simply too heavy, and that by including the weight of the water content that boils off I am tilting the simplex too far in its direction? Could it be that by excluding slices of bread as ingredients since they aren’t raw flour and do not go in a mixing bowl, I have excluded breakfasts like french toast, eggs in a basket, breakfast burritos, and breakfast sandwiches that might yet have saved us? Could I have overlooked some arcane culture that breaks their fast with dumplings or egg noodles? None of these satisfied me. The Abyss stared back.</p><p>The breakfasts I was able to identify cluster into three major regions:</p><ol><li>The Pancake Local Group: Here are found most of the conventional breakfasts, pancakes, crepes, waffles, and all of their international variants. Space here is chaotic, fractal. Any slight deviation from your recipe in this region is likely to produce something else entirely. Breakfast here is metastable at best. (<a href=\"https://internationalpancakes.com/\">prior research on the pancake cluster</a>)</li><li>The Baked Good Quadrant: The items here are only breakfasts by convention. Any of them could be served at other meals, and often are.</li><li>The Egg Singularity and Custard Accretion Disk: While only omelettes are labelled for brevity, there are dozens of named dishes that could be stacked on top of the pure egg point, over easy, sunny side up, hard boiled, soft boiled, etc. From these a small tail of egg based dishes sneaks down the right side, each with some amount of milk added, often a variable or optional amount.</li></ol><p>I was days into my research before I finally found a clue. In an <a href=\"https://www.ihop.com/-/media/ihop/nutrition/faq/ihop-nutrition-faq92722.pdf\">obscure document</a> on the website of the International House of Pancakes Corporation there was a hint that the dark breakfast had been made. IHOP omelettes include pancake batter. While I cannot place IHOP omelettes exactly on the map, by interpolating between pancakes and omelettes, we can bound where they must occur, and confirm that the manifold possibilities do indeed pass through the Dark Breakfast Abyss.</p><p>We do not know why the Dark Breakfast Abyss is empty. But by anthropic reasoning, we should conclude that it is empty for good reason. The International House of Pancakes is playing a dangerous game. If someday a <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/472/\">remote IHOP</a> splashes a little too much batter in their omelette, cooks the Forbidden Breakfast, and thereby brings about the end of the world, well, at least we know the <a href=\"https://www.wafflehouse.com/how-to-measure-a-storms-fury-one-breakfast-at-a-time/\">Waffle House will be open</a>.</p><p>For <a href=\"https://nautil.us/the-hard-problem-of-breakfast-237916/\">other breakfast scholars</a> who wish to further my study, I offer my <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cY5CwTV91IhfPQZkB-XmeGr79diDmxvvZaVomeTciPM/edit?gid=0#gid=0\">data</a> and <a href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15s9j_bSInYoDKXDArH3LpVhL50Hl5gRZ#scrollTo=cK8NmhoZz5T0\">code</a>. If you are so foolhardy that you wish to explore the bounds of dark breakfast yourself, the recipe is as follows:</p><ul></ul><blockquote><p>The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.</p><cite>H.P.

      "content": "<p>Palantir Technologies has a permanent desk at the U.S.-led Civil Military Coordination Center (CMCC) headquarters in southern Israel, three sources from the diplomatic community inside the CMCC told Drop Site News. According to the sources, the artificial intelligence data analytics giant is providing the technological architecture for tracking the delivery and distribution of aid to Gaza.</p><p>The presence of Palantir and other corporations—along with recent changes banning non-profits unwilling to give data to Israeli authorities—is creating a situation in which the delivery of aid is taking a backseat to the pursuit of profit, investment, and the training of AI products, experts say.</p><p>The CMCC was established by U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) in October, one week after the so-called ceasefire went into effect in Gaza to “monitor implementation of the ceasefire” and “help facilitate the flow of humanitarian, logistical, and security assistance from international counterparts into Gaza.” Last week, at the inaugural summit of the Board of Peace in Washington, D.C., Major General Jasper Jeffers—who was tapped in January to lead the International Stabilization Force in Gaza—announced that the CMCC will serve as the Board of Peace’s operational headquarters.</p><p>According to the sources, a representative from Palantir sits in the CMCC operations room where aid convoys and distributions inside Gaza are monitored through drone surveillance. The representative integrates convoy and distribution-related data into Palantir’s systems, the sources said.</p><p>Palantir did not respond to an inquiry from Drop Site on its role in the CMCC or in aid distribution in Gaza. Founded in 2003 by billionaire Peter Thiel with the help of investments from the CIA’s venture capital arm In-Q-Tel, Palantir is known for its work with government agencies, including the U.S. military and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).</p><p><a href=\"https://www.palantir.com/assets/xrfr7uokpv1b/3MuEeA8MLbLDAyxixTsiIe/9e4a11a7fb058554a8a1e3cd83e31c09/C134184_finaleprint.pdf\" rel=\"\">announced</a><a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Philosopher_in_the_Valley/azYMEQAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=gaza+palantir+inauthor:Steinberger&amp;pg=PT205&amp;printsec=frontcover\" rel=\"\">according</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.un.org/en/A/HRC/59/23\" rel=\"\">report</a></p><p>The use of Palantir to track aid deliveries to Gaza is of particular concern to observers. “The distinction between death by drone and delivery of aid is being evaporated while we all sit around the same table,” a source from the diplomatic community who attends CMCC sessions told Drop Site.</p><p>Palantir’s two main platforms are Gotham and Foundry. “Gotham’s targeting offering supports soldiers with an Al-powered kill chain, seamlessly and responsibly integrating target identification and target effector pairing,” according to the company’s website. Foundry is Palantir’s platform for supply chain management and is billed as a way to “bridge siloed planning and execution processes, optimize inventory management, and help build supply chain resilience for economic and geopolitical uncertainty.”</p><p><a href=\"https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/architecture-center/interoperability\" rel=\"\">documentation</a></p><p>This means that, in theory, information that is being gathered at the CMCC—including from participating governments the UN and NGOs regarding the type of aid being distributed, its distribution locations and systems, and truck convoy routes—could be seamlessly pulled into Gotham’s AI targeting matrix. The same software logic used to track aid at the CMCC could be used to optimize and accelerate lethal airstrikes.</p><p>There is no information available as to whether Gotham and Foundry are the specific products being used to track aid, but publicly available photographic evidence indicates that Palantir’s Gaia—a platform referred to on their website as a tool to “bring the battlefield into view”—is being deployed at the CMCC.</p><p>In an interview with Drop Site on the role of Palantir in Gaza, the economist Yanis Varoufakis, the former Greek Finance Minister and a former member of Greece’s parliament, described an encounter he had with a Palantir representative who had explained to him the benefit the company gained from Gaza. “He was saying that ‘as the bombs fell we were having a party,’” Varoufakis said. According to Varoufakis, the Palantir representative explained how the chaos of intense violence in a high-density urban area like Gaza generates substantial data for training their AI models on how humans respond under stress. “The more bombardment and havoc, the better the training,” Varoufakis said.</p><p>“It’s one thing to say that companies like Lockheed Martin make money selling F35s to the Israelis,” he said. “That has been a time-honored way that the military industrial complex has benefited from war and genocide and war crimes.” He continued, “This is the first instance in history where it is the suffering of a people being subjected to genocide and bombing—the suffering itself—which is adding to the capital of a company which then uses that capital to produce commodities to sell elsewhere.”</p><p>Palantir operates on Oracle’s cloud infrastructure, led by Larry Ellison—a major donor to the Israeli military who also funds the Tony Blair Institute, which has itself consulted on governance mechanisms for Gaza.</p><p>The growing use of Palantir and other private sector companies in Gaza comes as the non-profit sector is being systematically squeezed out. As of March 1, 2026, Israel will ban dozens of aid groups from operating in Gaza, as well as the West Bank and East Jerusalem, under new registration rules, including prominent NGOs such as Doctors Without Borders, the Norwegian Refugee Council, Oxfam, and Medical Aid for Palestinians.</p><p>The new measures require aid groups to register the names and contact information of employees and to provide details about their funding and operations to Israeli authorities. The aid groups said in a joint statement this week that “the demand to transfer personal data raises acute security and legal risks. It exposes national staff to potential retaliation and undermines established data protection and confidentiality safeguards.”</p><p>“NGOs are being pushed out of Gaza because aid delivered by humanitarian organizations is based on need and is provided to people wherever they are located,” said an aid worker who spoke to Drop Site on condition of anonymity. “This doesn’t match the vision of the ‘New Gaza’ where Palestinians will need to be displaced again into the zones where reconstruction will be permitted and their access to aid will be controlled through screening.”</p><p>Not all NGOs are being pushed out of Gaza. Others—on a list of registered and  approved organizations—are expanding their role alongside the private sector. These include Christian groups like Samaritan’s Purse and GAiN, both of whom were involved in the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), and who sources from the diplomatic community have recently seen gathering in a “prayer circle” at the CMCC.</p><p>These approved NGOs, alongside private firms coordinated through the CMCC like Palantir, stand ready to take over the distribution of aid in Gaza.</p><p>“Aid in Gaza has been stripped to bare survival and its future delivery appears to be faith based, profit driven, militarized and certainly not to be delivered by anyone that dares to speak out about what Palestinians are being subjected to,” said a senior aid worker who spoke to Drop Site on condition of anonymity.</p><p>Gaza’s experience with private delivery mechanisms has been catastrophic. In May 2025, the U.S. and Israeli-backed GHF was contracted to distribute aid in the enclave. During the four and half months the GHF operated in Gaza, more than 2,600 Palestinians seeking food were killed and over 19,000 wounded by Israeli forces or security contractors at or near aid distribution sites.</p><p>The former headquarters of the GHF, a large warehouse-style building in Kiryat Gat, is now the headquarters of the CMCC.</p><p>As aid groups are being banned, U.S. military contractors are also filling the vacuum. According to sources from the diplomatic community who attend the CMCC, the physical presence of Safe Reach Solutions (SRS), a U.S. military contractor that provided security for the GHF,  has recently expanded at the center of the facility, with SRS officials taking up more prominent seating space on the operations floor. The company’s representatives now sit behind name tags in seating that had previously been reserved for UN agencies, the sources said.</p><p>SRS did not respond to an inquiry from Drop Site about its role at the CMCC or in Gaza aid distribution.</p><p>“Given the precedent of the GHF, which turned aid delivery into a killing machine,” Albanese told Drop Site, “and the grave violations of international law embedded in the so-called peace plan—first and foremost the negation of the Palestinian right to self-determination—the risk that companies and states involved in the CMCC may be complicit in, or even direct perpetrators of, international crimes is real.”</p><p><a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/security-aviation/2025-08-05/ty-article/.premium/u-s-firm-eastern-european-drivers-israeli-link-whos-behind-getting-aid-into-gaza/00000198-73ff-dcb9-ab99-73ff7d4d0000\" rel=\"\">according</a></p><p>The re-emergence of GHF-linked companies, alongside the digital capacity to monitor and monetize the surviving population in Gaza, is now converging with the construction of a new physical infrastructure spearheaded by giant real estate conglomerates. </p><p>At last week’s Board of Peace meeting, the reconstruction of Gaza was positioned as a massive financial “unlocking” of a distressed asset. Figures like Yakir Gabay, who built a real estate empire in Germany, envisioned the coastline transformed into a “Mediterranean Riviera” featuring 200 hotels and artificial islands. Marc Rowan, a billionaire investor and the CEO of Apollo Global Management, framed the project as the consolidation of Gaza’s “productive assets” into a “unified structure.”</p><p>A significant addition to the CMCC’s corporate roster is Terra Firma Capital Partners, which sources confirmed now maintains a permanent presence at the CMCC. Founded by British financier Guy Hands, the firm brings experience in managing massive-scale residential assets. Terra Firma has links to the New Labour era, specifically through Lord John Birt, Tony Blair’s former strategy director, who worked for the company after he left government.</p><p>“The genocide is entering a new phase. After the destruction of Gaza and the erasure of entire family lines, powerful states are now deciding the fate of the survivors without ever listening to their voices,” Albanese said. </p><p>“If Gaza is not to become a capitalist techno-dystopia, the time to act is now. States and corporations supporting this emerging infrastructure must be stopped, and held accountable. There is no time to lose.”</p>",

      "content": "<p>\n\tIn a stunning twist, <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/netflix/\" data-tag=\"netflix\">Netflix</a> is declining to raise its bid for Warner Bros., positioning David Ellison’s <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/paramount/\" data-tag=\"paramount\">Paramount</a> as the winner in the battle for the fabled studio.</p><p>\n\tNetflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters released a statement Thursday outlining their decision, namely that the deal is “no longer financially attractive” and that it “was always a ‘nice to have’ at the right price, not a ‘must have’ at any price.”\n\n</p><p>\n\t“The transaction we negotiated would have created shareholder value with a clear path to regulatory approval. However, we’ve always been disciplined, and at the price required to match Paramount Skydance’s latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive, so we are declining to match the Paramount Skydance bid,” the co-CEOs said.\n\n\t</p><p>\n\t“Warner Bros. is a world-class organization, and we want to thank David Zaslav, Gunnar Wiedenfels, Bruce Campbell, Brad Singer and the WBD Board for running a fair and rigorous process,” they added. “We believe we would have been strong stewards of Warner Bros.’ iconic brands, and that our deal would have strengthened the entertainment industry and preserved and created more production jobs in the U.S.&nbsp; But this transaction was always a ‘nice to have’ at the right price, not a ‘must have’ at any price.”</p><p>\n\tWith Netflix out, Paramount’s latest bid is almost a sure thing to be accepted by the Warners board, which determined earlier Thursday that it was a “<a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/warner-bros-discovery-paramounts-offer-superior-to-netflix-1236516591/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/warner-bros-discovery-paramounts-offer-superior-to-netflix-1236516591/\">superior proposal</a>” to Netflix’s deal.\n\n\t</p><p>\n\t“Netflix is a great company and throughout this process Ted, Greg, Spence and everyone there have been extraordinary partners to us. We wish them well in the future,” said David Zaslav, president and CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery. “Once our Board votes to adopt the Paramount merger agreement, it will create tremendous value for our shareholders. We are excited about the potential of a combined Paramount Skydance and Warner Bros. Discovery and can’t wait to get started working together telling the stories that move the world.”</p><p>\n\tPSKY’s latest proposal was for $31 per share, but&nbsp;had a number of other <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/warner-bros-board-warms-to-paramounts-sweetened-bid-new-details-are-revealed-1236514073/\">sweeteners</a>, including a ticking fee payable to shareholders equal to $0.25 per quarter beginning after Sept. 30, 2026, as well as a $7 billion regulatory termination in the event the transaction does not close due to regulatory matters.</p><p>\n\tParamount has also agreed to pay the $2.8 billion termination fee that Warner Bros. would be required to pay to Netflix to terminate the existing merger agreement. </p><p>\n\tIf all goes as expected, Netflix will be on the receiving end of that $2.8 billion sooner rather than later. Netflix shares soared by more than 10 percent in after-hours trading after the decision was announced.</p><p>\n\t“We are pleased WBD’s Board has unanimously affirmed the superior value of our offer, which delivers to WBD shareholders superior value, certainty and speed to closing,” Paramount CEO David Ellison said in a statement on Thursday before Netflix backed out of the bidding.\n\n\t</p><p>\n\tOf course, a Paramount deal is not necessarily a sure thing. U.S. and European regulators still need to formally sign off, and state attorneys general will have a say as well. Already politicians are positioning themselves to challenge the deal (Sen. Elizabeth Warren called in an “antitrust disaster” Thursday), with Ellison likely to be called before Congress to discuss it.</p><p>\n\tAnd the politics of the deal are sure to come up. </p><p>\n\tSarandos and Peters, meanwhile, say they will continue to pour cash into content.</p><p>\n\t“Netflix’s business is healthy, strong and growing organically, powered by our slate and best-in-class streaming service. This year, we’ll invest approximately $20 billion in quality films and series and will expand our entertaining offering. Consistent with our capital allocation policy, we’ll also resume our share repurchase program,” the co-CEOs said. “We will continue to do what we’ve done for more than 20 years as a public company: delight our members, profitably grow our business, and drive long-term shareholder value.”</p>",

      "content": "<p>I believe deeply in the existential importance of using AI to defend the United States and other democracies, and to defeat our autocratic adversaries.</p><p>Anthropic has therefore worked proactively to deploy our models to the Department of War and the intelligence community. We were <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/expanding-access-to-claude-for-government\">the first frontier AI company</a> to deploy our models in the US government’s classified networks, the first to deploy them at the <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/11/14/anthropic-claude-nuclear-information-safety\">National Laboratories</a>, and the first to provide <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-gov-models-for-u-s-national-security-customers\">custom models</a> for national security customers. Claude is <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-and-the-department-of-defense-to-advance-responsible-ai-in-defense-operations\">extensively deployed</a> across the Department of War and other national security agencies for mission-critical applications, such as intelligence analysis, modeling and simulation, operational planning, cyber operations, and more.</p><p>Anthropic has also acted to defend America’s lead in AI, even when it is against the company’s short-term interest. We chose to forgo several hundred million dollars in revenue to cut off the <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/updating-restrictions-of-sales-to-unsupported-regions\">use of Claude by firms linked to the Chinese Communist Party</a> (some of whom have been <a href=\"https://media.defense.gov/2025/Jan/07/2003625471/-1/-1/1/ENTITIES-IDENTIFIED-AS-CHINESE-MILITARY-COMPANIES-OPERATING-IN-THE-UNITED-STATES.PDF\">designated by the Department of War</a> as Chinese Military Companies), shut down <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/disrupting-AI-espionage\">CCP-sponsored cyberattacks</a> that attempted to abuse Claude, and have advocated for <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/opinion/trump-can-keep-americas-ai-advantage-china-chips-data-eccdce91?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqdPk42glTHtJxGWpiSYR1xY28wMr6SpvGWmvlfp8_gYMp2h0ulOBH89Njx5eB0%3D&amp;gaa_ts=6983c8a6&amp;gaa_sig=t3NbNoEV35S9fhpBAUsmCPXHG6Zc3taB_jNESn4lAI7qy0l37FtVqnKZe-ASVGLp4SqxRsIS-HRn0k51UzsdpQ%3D%3D\">strong export controls on chips</a> to ensure a democratic advantage.</p><p>Anthropic understands that the Department of War, not private companies, makes military decisions. We have never raised objections to particular military operations nor attempted to limit use of our technology in an  manner.</p><p>However, in a narrow set of cases, we believe AI can undermine, rather than defend, democratic values. Some uses are also simply outside the bounds of what today’s technology can safely and reliably do. Two such use cases have never been included in our contracts with the Department of War, and we believe they should not be included now:</p><ul><li><strong>Mass domestic surveillance. </strong>We support the use of AI for lawful foreign intelligence and counterintelligence missions. But using these systems for mass surveillance is incompatible with democratic values. AI-driven mass surveillance <a href=\"https://www.darioamodei.com/essay/the-adolescence-of-technology\">presents serious, novel risks to our fundamental liberties</a>. To the extent that such surveillance is currently legal, this is only because the law has not yet caught up with the rapidly growing capabilities of AI. For example, under current law, the government can purchase detailed records of Americans’ movements, web browsing, and associations from public sources without obtaining a warrant, a practice the <a href=\"https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/ODNI-Declassified-Report-on-CAI-January2022.pdf\">Intelligence Community has acknowledged</a> raises privacy concerns and that has generated bipartisan opposition in Congress. Powerful AI makes it possible to assemble this scattered, individually innocuous data into a comprehensive picture of any person’s life—automatically and at massive scale.</li><li><strong>Fully autonomous weapons. </strong>Partially autonomous weapons, like those used today in Ukraine, are vital to the defense of democracy. Even autonomous weapons (those that take humans out of the loop entirely and automate selecting and engaging targets) may prove critical for our national defense. But today, frontier AI systems are simply not reliable enough to power fully autonomous weapons. We will not knowingly provide a product that puts America’s warfighters and civilians at risk. We have offered to work directly with the Department of War on R&amp;D to improve the reliability of these systems, but they have not accepted this offer. In addition, <a href=\"https://www.darioamodei.com/essay/the-adolescence-of-technology\">without proper oversight</a>, fully autonomous weapons cannot be relied upon to exercise the critical judgment that our highly trained, professional troops exhibit every day. They need to be deployed with proper guardrails, which don’t exist today.</li></ul><p>To our knowledge, these two exceptions have not been a barrier to accelerating the adoption and use of our models within our armed forces to date.</p><p>The Department of War has <a href=\"https://media.defense.gov/2026/Jan/12/2003855671/-1/-1/0/ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE-STRATEGY-FOR-THE-DEPARTMENT-OF-WAR.PDF\">stated</a> they will only contract with AI companies who accede to “any lawful use” and remove safeguards in the cases mentioned above. They have threatened to remove us from their systems if we maintain these safeguards; they have also threatened to designate us a “supply chain risk”—a label reserved for US adversaries, never before applied to an American company— to invoke the Defense Production Act to force the safeguards’ removal. These latter two threats are <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/26/incoherent-hegseths-anthropic-ultimatum-confounds-ai-policymakers-00800135?utm_content=topic/politics&amp;utm_source=flipboard\">inherently contradictory</a>: one labels us a security risk; the other labels Claude as essential to national security.</p><p>Regardless, these threats do not change our position: we cannot in good conscience accede to their request.</p><p>It is the Department’s prerogative to select contractors most aligned with their vision. But given the substantial value that Anthropic’s technology provides to our armed forces, we hope they reconsider. Our strong preference is to continue to serve the Department and our warfighters—with our two requested safeguards in place. Should the Department choose to offboard Anthropic, we will work to enable a smooth transition to another provider, avoiding any disruption to ongoing military planning, operations, or other critical missions. Our models will be available on the expansive terms we have proposed for as long as required.</p><p>We remain ready to continue our work to support the national security of the United States.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Offline navigation is a lifeline for travelers, adventurers, and everyday commuters. We demand speed, accuracy, and the flexibility to tailor routes to our specific needs. For years, OsmAnd has championed powerful, feature-rich offline maps that fit in your pocket. But as maps grew more detailed and user demands for complex routing increased, our trusty <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A* algorithm</a>, despite its flexibility, started hitting a performance wall. How could we deliver a  without bloating map sizes or sacrificing the deep customization our users love?</p><p>The answer: <strong>OsmAnd's custom-built Highway Hierarchy (HH) Routing.</strong> This isn't your standard routing engine; it's a ground-up redesign, meticulously engineered to overcome the unique challenges of providing advanced navigation on compact, offline-first map data.</p><div><div><p>100x speedup is achieved by comparing HH with bidirectional A*.\n2-phase A* already uses many heuristics which don't always create an optimal route and still 5-10x slower.</p></div></div><h2>Why Standard Solutions Failed<a href=\"https://osmand.net/blog/fast-routing/#why-standard-solutions-failed\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Why Standard Solutions Failed\" title=\"Direct link to Why Standard Solutions Failed\">​</a></h2><p>OsmAnd has always been about putting you in control. Our original <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A* routing engine</a>, configurable via <a href=\"https://github.com/osmandapp/OsmAnd-resources/blob/master/routing/routing.xml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a>, offered immense power. You could define intricate profiles, avoid specific road types, and truly personalize your journey. With maps optimized for minimal storage (the entire planet's car data for our new HH-routing is around a mere 800MB!), OsmAnd was a lean, mean navigating machine.</p><p>However, this flexibility came at a cost for complex routes:</p><ul><li>* Calculating a 200-300km car route (or even shorter bicycle/pedestrian paths) could mean visiting over a million road segments, taking 10-20 seconds. For longer trips, this wait could become frustrating.</li></ul><p>We explored standard advanced algorithms like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraction_hierarchies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Contraction Hierarchies (CH)</a>, known for their speed. But they presented their own set of deal-breakers for OsmAnd:</p><ul><li> CH typically pre-calculates optimal paths. Supporting OsmAnd's 10+ routing parameters (leading to over 1024 combinations per profile!) would be impossible with standard CH.</li><li> A CH car profile for a region can be massive (e.g., OSRM's Europe is tens of GBs, their global car profile around 200GB for just one profile). Our goal was to keep  profiles and parameters for the  well under 20GB.</li><li> Users download individual countries or regions. CH usually requires processing the entire road network globally, which doesn't align with OsmAnd's flexible map management.</li><li> The extensive pre-processing for CH makes it unsuitable for frequent updates, let alone OsmAnd’s goal of supporting near real-time changes through hourly map updates.</li></ul><p>The challenge was clear: achieve a quantum leap in speed while preserving extreme flexibility, minimal storage, regional map support, and dynamic update capabilities. Standard Highway Hierarchies were a starting point, but we needed something more – a uniquely OsmAnd solution.</p><h2>Secret Sauce #1: Two-Level Routing<a href=\"https://osmand.net/blog/fast-routing/#secret-sauce-1-two-level-routing\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Secret Sauce #1: Two-Level Routing\" title=\"Direct link to Secret Sauce #1: Two-Level Routing\">​</a></h2><p>The core of OsmAnd's HH-Routing is an elegant two-level hierarchy built upon \"area clusters.\"</p><ul><li> The map is intelligently segmented into numerous small regions or clusters.</li><li> Each cluster has a limited number of defined \"border points\" – these are the gateways in and out of the cluster.</li><li> For common scenarios, we pre-calculate the travel time/distance (the \"shortcut\") between border points  and also to border points of  clusters.</li></ul><p>This map illustrates the OsmAnd routing concept. <a href=\"https://osmand.net/map/navigate/?start=42.343860,-71.068550&amp;end=42.306935,-71.082991&amp;profile=car#14/42.3280/-71.0819\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The route</a> starts in the Start Area Cluster (221558), moves to the nearest Border Point, and continues through precomputed Shortcuts across intermediate clusters. It then enters the Finish Area Cluster (221536) via another border point and finishes using local roads. This method speeds up routing by combining local search with efficient inter-cluster shortcuts.</p><p>The real magic, our , lies in  these border points are selected. Naive approaches quickly fail:</p><ul><li>Randomly selecting border points or using simple geometric divisions (squares/hexagons) results in too many border points per cluster (50-80). This leads to a shortcut explosion (N*(N-1)/2 shortcuts), making the files large and and calculations slow.</li><li>We even tried building hierarchies with 2-3 levels, but the number of shortcuts grew too fast for higher levels if we generated a full graph inside each cluster.</li></ul><p><strong>The \"Parking Lot\" Insight:</strong>\nImagine a vast shopping mall parking lot with thousands of individual parking spots and internal lanes (representing road segments within a cluster). No matter how complex it is inside, there are usually only a few key exits to the main roads. Our goal was to identify these natural \"exits\" for each map cluster. For instance, the complex road network around Amsterdam Airport Schiphol (<a href=\"https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=17/52.321360/4.766226\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">see on OpenStreetMap</a>) has many internal roads but limited primary access points.</p><p>We wanted a scenario where, say, 5 well-placed border points could efficiently represent an area with 5,000 internal points and 10,000 road edges. This would reduce those 10,000 edges to just 5*4/2 = 10 shortcuts for routing  that cluster at a high level – an incredible 1:1000 point ratio and a 30x reduction in edges to consider for the high-level path!</p><p><strong>The Algorithm: Ford-Fulkerson to Find the Bottlenecks</strong>\nTo find these crucial border points, we employed a clever technique based on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford%E2%80%93Fulkerson_algorithm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ford-Fulkerson algorithm</a>. By simulating \"flooding\" roads with traffic from random start/end points, we could identify the natural bottlenecks – the \"minimum cut\" in graph theory terms. These bottlenecks became our border points.</p><p>\nCrucially, this distribution of border points is <strong>agnostic of routing speed profiles</strong>. It’s based only on whether a road is  or not. This means the <em>same set of clusters and border points</em> can be used for all car routing profiles (default, shortest, fuel-efficient) and all bicycle profiles (default, prefer flat terrain, etc.). Only the  of the shortcuts between these points change based on the profile. This is a massive factor in keeping storage down – <strong>map data only increased by about 0.5% per profile</strong> to store this HH-Routing structure!</p><p>Just look at the numbers for processing the entire planet for a car profile:</p><ul><li>Original OSM: ~2.07 billion points, ~2.42 billion edges</li><li>Resulting HH structure: ~3 million border points, ~541,000 clusters</li><li>Estimated shortcuts: ~91 million (a manageable number for global routing)</li></ul><h2>How OsmAnd Builds Routes<a href=\"https://osmand.net/blog/fast-routing/#how-osmand-builds-routes\" aria-label=\"Direct link to How OsmAnd Builds Routes\" title=\"Direct link to How OsmAnd Builds Routes\">​</a></h2><p>So, how does OsmAnd use this structure to calculate your route at lightning speed? It's a multi-step process:</p><p><strong>A. Preprocessing (Done by OsmAnd when new maps are prepared):</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Cluster &amp; Border Point Definition:</strong> The map is divided into clusters, and border points are identified using the Ford-Fulkerson based method.</li><li><strong>Shortcut Pre-calculation:</strong> For the most commonly used speed profiles, the travel costs (time/distance) for shortcuts between border points within each cluster are pre-calculated and stored. (Each border point effectively has an \"entry\" and \"exit\" aspect for directed travel).</li></ol><p><strong>B. User Route Request (Query Time - this is what happens on your device):</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>Step 1: Connect to the Hierarchy (Your Local Area):</strong></p><ul><li>OsmAnd identifies the clusters containing your start and target points.</li><li>It then uses the standard <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dijkstra algorithm</a> on the  within your start cluster to find the best paths from your actual start location to  border points of that starting cluster.</li><li>The same is done for your target point within its own cluster (finding paths from all its border points to your actual destination).</li><li>This is quick because it's operating on a very small, localized part of the map.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Step 2: Route on the Abstract Graph (The \"Highway\" Part):</strong></p><ul><li>Now, OsmAnd performs another Dijkstra search, but this time on the much smaller \"base graph.\" This graph consists  of the border points and the pre-calculated shortcut values between them.</li><li>This step rapidly finds the optimal sequence of border points and shortcuts to get from your start cluster's periphery to your target cluster's periphery. It's incredibly fast because it's ignoring all the tiny roads  intermediate clusters.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Step 3: Refine with Detailed Shortcuts (Applying Secret Sauce #2):</strong></p><ul><li>The result from Step 2 is a high-level route – a sequence of shortcuts connecting border points.</li><li>Now, for  shortcut in this sequence, OsmAnd runs its highly optimized A* algorithm on the , but <strong>strictly limited to the small area of the cluster that shortcut belongs to.</strong></li><li>For example, a 500km route might be broken down into ~100 such shortcuts. If each A* shortcut calculation explores 100-1000 detailed road segments, the total detailed segments visited by A* might be around 10,000-50,000. Compare this to the 1,000,000+ segments the old A* might have needed for the entire route!</li></ul></li></ol><p>This combination – localized Dijkstra, super-fast abstract graph traversal, and highly localized A* refinement – is what delivers the .</p><h2>Secret Sauce #2: Adaptive Routing<a href=\"https://osmand.net/blog/fast-routing/#secret-sauce-2-adaptive-routing\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Secret Sauce #2: Adaptive Routing\" title=\"Direct link to Secret Sauce #2: Adaptive Routing\">​</a></h2><p>Speed is fantastic, but not if it means sacrificing the features OsmAnd users rely on. This is where our  comes into play – ensuring HH-Routing remains incredibly flexible and dynamic:</p><ul><li> Because the final shortcut refinement (Step 3 above) uses A* on detailed maps , all your specified parameters are naturally incorporated:<ul><li>Avoiding specific road types or toll roads.</li><li>Adding penalties or preferences for certain roads.</li><li>Following all the nuanced rules in your custom <a href=\"https://github.com/osmandapp/OsmAnd-resources/blob/master/routing/routing.xml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a> profiles.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Handling Live Updates &amp; Dynamic Changes:</strong> What if a bridge is closed due to a <a href=\"https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/maps-resources#live-updates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">live map update</a> you just downloaded?<ul><li>If the A* calculation for a shortcut (in Step 3) finds it's now impassable, or if its actual detailed cost is significantly different (e.g., &gt;20%) from the pre-calculated shortcut value:<ul><li> The system can update the cost of that specific shortcut in the base graph and quickly re-run the Dijkstra search (Step 2) on the abstract graph to find an alternative high-level path.</li><li> For very localized changes, it might even re-evaluate all shortcuts within that one affected cluster.</li></ul></li><li>Minor road updates (like those in map data that might be a few months old if you're using maps from different regions) usually result in negligible cost differences for shortcuts, so the pre-calculated values remain effective.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Graceful Fallback for Extreme Customization:</strong><ul><li>What if you create a truly unique routing profile that's wildly different from the common ones for which shortcuts were pre-calculated? The system is smart. If it detects that too many shortcuts (~50, for example) need on-the-fly recalculation and deviate significantly, it might determine that falling back to the original, comprehensive A* algorithm for the  would actually be faster than doing many small, heavily modified A* calculations.</li></ul></li></ul><h2>Real Benefits for OsmAnd Users<a href=\"https://osmand.net/blog/fast-routing/#real-benefits-for-osmand-users\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Real Benefits for OsmAnd Users\" title=\"Direct link to Real Benefits for OsmAnd Users\">​</a></h2><p>This complex engineering translates into tangible benefits:</p><ul><li> The 100x average improvement means route calculations, especially for longer journeys, are now dramatically faster.</li><li> Our HH-Routing data adds only  to OsmAnd's already incredibly compact map sizes. The entire planet's car routing data is around 800MB!</li><li><strong>Full Customization Power:</strong> All the beloved flexibility of <a href=\"https://github.com/osmandapp/OsmAnd-resources/blob/master/routing/routing.xml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a> and detailed routing parameters is retained.</li><li><strong>Works with Regional Maps:</strong> Download only the countries you need. HH-Routing seamlessly calculates routes across the borders of your downloaded map files (as long as they are compatible, see limitations). Clusters that overlap a region's boundary are included within that region's data.</li><li><strong>Supports Frequent Updates:</strong> The architecture is designed to work with <a href=\"https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/maps-resources#live-updates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">OsmAnd’s hourly map updates</a>, allowing routing to adapt to fresh road information.</li><li> This structure makes it much easier to implement features like alternative route suggestions based on these key border points.</li></ul><p>No system is perfect, and OsmAnd's HH-Routing has a few considerations:</p><ul><li><strong>Highly Divergent Profiles:</strong> For routing configurations that are not pre-calculated as common scenarios and whose costs vary too much from default configurations, the original <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A* algorithm</a> might still be faster (and is often used as an automatic fallback).</li><li><strong>Map Version Synchronicity (Important!):</strong> For HH-Routing to work correctly when a route crosses multiple map files (e.g., different countries or regions), <a href=\"https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/maps-resources#updates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>all those map files MUST be from the same generation date</strong></a> (i.e., downloaded from OsmAnd around the same time, based on the same underlying OpenStreetMap data version and pre-calculation run).<ul><li>If you try to route from a map of France updated in May with a map of Germany updated in April, HH-Routing may not be compatible across the border. You would need to update all relevant maps to the same version.</li><li>This doesn't mean all maps must be , just <em>from the same batch/pre-calculation period</em>.</li></ul></li><li> The intensive preprocessing required to generate all these routing profiles for the entire planet takes about 2-3 days. This means new map updates are now typically released around the 5th of each month, instead of the 2nd.</li></ul><h2>Smart Engineering Delivers<a href=\"https://osmand.net/blog/fast-routing/#smart-engineering-delivers\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Smart Engineering Delivers\" title=\"Direct link to Smart Engineering Delivers\">​</a></h2><p>OsmAnd's HH-Routing is more than just an algorithm; it's a testament to innovative problem-solving. It’s a carefully engineered system born from the need to overcome specific, demanding constraints: the desire for blazing speed, minimal storage, complete routing flexibility, regional map support, and adaptability to fresh data.</p><p>By cleverly identifying crucial \"bottleneck\" border points, creating a universal two-level hierarchy, and dynamically refining routes with our optimized A* engine, we've managed to deliver a vastly superior navigation experience.

      "content": "<div><div><p>Southern California residents are noticing new license plate readers that appear to be operated by the Border Patrol. Some have had confusing encounters with agents.</p></div></div><p>On a cracked two-lane road on the eastern edge of San Diego County, James Cordero eased his Jeep onto the shoulder after something caught his eye. It looked like an abandoned trailer. Inside he found a hidden camera feeding a vast surveillance network that logs the license plate of every driver passing through this stretch of remote backcountry between San Diego and the Arizona state line.&nbsp;</p><p>Cordero, 44, has found dozens of these cameras hidden in trailers and construction barrels on border roads around San Diego and Imperial counties: one on Old Highway 80 near Jacumba Hot Springs; another outside the Golden Acorn Casino in Campo; another along Interstate 8 toward In-Ko-Pah Gorge.&nbsp;</p><p>They started showing up after California granted permits to the Border Patrol and other federal agencies to place license plate readers on state highways in the last months of the Biden administration. Now as many as 40 are feeding information into <a href=\"https://calmatters.org/tag/donald-trump/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Trump administration</a> databases as the Democratic-led state chafes over the federal government’s <a href=\"https://calmatters.org/tag/immigration/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">massive deportation program</a>.</p><p>The cameras are raising concerns with privacy experts, civil liberties advocates and humanitarian aid workers who say California should not be supporting the surveillance and data-collection program, which they view as an unwarranted government intrusion into the lives of Americans who’ve committed no crime. Moreover, they say the program conflicts with state law.&nbsp;</p><p>Supporters say the devices allow law enforcement to quickly identify and locate people they suspect of serious crimes. They also argue the cameras help agencies spot patterns in drug and human trafficking, and could be used to help locate missing persons, such as children or other vulnerable people.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;“If you’re not doing anything illegal, why worry about it?” said long-time Jacumba resident Allen Stanks, 70.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“Everyone is talking about privacy, OK. Stop putting everything on Facebook. ‘Here’s a picture of my food.’ Who cares?” said Stanks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Some locals, however, suspect the cameras are behind some unusual encounters they’ve had in recent months with officers from Border Patrol and its parent agency, Customs and Border Protection. In one case agents questioned a grandmother – a lawful permanent resident&nbsp; – about why she went to a casino, according to her grandson.&nbsp;</p><p>Cordero has a different concern. On his days off, he leads volunteers into the far reaches of the county, leaving water, food and clothing for migrants. He fears his colleagues could be detained by agents.</p><p>“I’m not so much worried about myself, but I’m worried about a lot of our volunteers that come out,” said Cordero. “I don’t want them to have to deal with any of the nonsense of being tracked or being pulled over and questioned.”&nbsp;</p><p>He has good reason to be nervous. During the first Trump administration, federal officials prosecuted volunteers from the humanitarian group “No More Deaths” for leaving water and supplies for migrants in the Arizona desert. The volunteers faced charges, including “abandonment of property” and felony harboring, though the convictions for some were later overturned.</p><p>Border Patrol provides little information about its use of license plate readers on its website. In 2020, the Department of Homeland Security <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/privacy-pia-cbp049a-cbplprtechnology-july2020.pdf\">issued a report</a> that describes the technology in general, but doesn’t specify where it’s being used. CalMatters reached out to Border Patrol and Homeland Security officials for comment, but did not receive a response.&nbsp;</p><p>“There’s no transparency, that’s the worst part,” Cordero said.&nbsp;</p><p>The Homeland Security report says some readers are capturing license plate numbers, as well as the make and model of the vehicle, the state the vehicle is registered in, the camera owner and type, the GPS coordinates for where the image was taken, and the date and time of the capture.&nbsp;</p><p>The “technology may also capture (within the image) the environment surrounding a vehicle, which may include drivers and passengers,” the report states.

His grandmother, a resident of Imperial Valley with legal status, was crossing the border when agents asked her about her trips to casinos.&nbsp;</p><p>“She asked them back, ‘Is something wrong with that? Am I not supposed to be doing that or why are you questioning me about this?’ and they were like “Oh, no, it just seems suspicious,” Ojeda recounted.&nbsp;</p><p>Ojeda said he was equally concerned, and he doesn’t enjoy the feeling of being watched just because he lives near the border. “It’s how I feel every day,” he said. “Driving around, I joke with my co-workers: ‘Which chapter of  is this?’”&nbsp;</p>",

      "content": "<p>Whenever a new technology arrives, the impulse is to treat it as something that has never existed before. A clean break from everything that came prior. I catch myself doing this with vibe coding constantly, and I see it everywhere around me. But the most useful lens for understanding a new phenomenon is almost never the phenomenon itself. You want something adjacent, close enough to share structural similarities but removed enough to see clearly. It’s on the lookout for something like this that I started reading more about the Maker Movement of ~2005-2015.</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Anderson_(writer)\" rel=\"\">Chris Anderson</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makers_(novel)\" rel=\"\"> Makers,</a></p><p>A lot of the intellectual energy of the AI era orbits around AGI: when it arrives, what it’ll do to jobs, whether it will be aligned. The Maker Movement had its own gravitational center, and it was the idea that making physical things with your hands could produce an internal transformation. You would become more creative, more entrepreneurial, more self-reliant. The object you made mattered less than what the act of making did to you.</p><p><a href=\"https://fredturner2022.sites.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj27111/files/media/file/turner-millenarian-tinkering-tech-culture-2018.pdf\" rel=\"\">published a paper</a></p><p>The specifics of seventeenth-century Puritanism are obviously gone. Nobody at a Maker Faire was talking about predestination. But Turner traced the literary forms and the millenarian structure—the belief that a great transformation is coming, and that individual discipline will determine who makes it through. In the Maker narrative, the American landscape is economically barren. Jobs have disappeared. Institutions have failed you. And in this wilderness, the lone individual searches inside themselves for signs of the entrepreneurial spirit, the creative spark, evidence that they are among the elect who will build their way to salvation.</p><p>Turner’s observation extends well beyond 3D printers. You can trace this same pattern through almost every hobbyist technology scene of the past fifty years. Homebrew computer clubs in the 1970s. Punk zines in the 1980s. The early web in the 1990s. Each one developed a community of practice—what Brian Eno would call a “scenius”—where people played with tools that the mainstream considered toys. Each one generated its own salvation narrative: master this tool, transform yourself, become the kind of person who builds the future.</p><p>And each one operated with a useful kind of slack. The tools were unproductive on purpose. Nobody expected your Arduino project to ship to customers. Nobody expected your homebrew computer to compete with IBM. The whole point was that you had permission to fuck around, and the finding-out happened gradually, through play, over years. This is where the old Silicon Valley adage comes from: “What smart people do on the weekends, everyone else will do during the week in ten years.”</p><p>Vibe coding broke this pattern in a way that matters.</p><p>Every previous wave of hobbyist technology went through a scenius phase—a period where small groups of weirdos played with tools before anyone expected economic output from them.</p><p>Vibe coding skipped that phase entirely. It was deployed directly to the general public, and almost immediately into the codebases of enterprise companies and well-developed products. There was no protected playground period. There was no time to accumulate the weird, useless, playful knowledge that scenius communities generate. Instead, there was immediate pressure to one-shot yourself into a hit product or solve a complex use case on the first try.</p><p>This matters because the scenius phase is where the internal transformation actually happens. When you spend two years making useless Arduino projects, you develop instincts about electronics, materials, and design that you can’t get from a tutorial. When vibe coding goes straight to production, you lose that developmental space. The tool is powerful enough to produce real output before the person using it has developed real judgment. When I speak with people who are on Claude Code 12-14 hours a day, I feel like I’m speaking to someone possessed by something, attempting to grasp a different reality. In the case of scenius, the feedback loop that tethers you to reality was provided by other humans. Someone looked at your project and told you it’s pointless, or brilliant, or both. While in the case of vibe coding, the feedback loop is provided by the machine, and you’re constantly attempting to discern if you’re going crazy or if something genuinely valuable has been produced.</p><p>What it produces is something like hypomania: a state where your productive capacity genuinely increases. You’re not imagining that you’re getting more done, you actually are, but your evaluative faculty is unaccustomed to this mode of creation. You lose the ability to distinguish between “this is good” and “I feel good making this.” Everything feels like a breakthrough. The output is real but your relationship to it is distorted.</p><p>The speed and ease of vibe coding create a kind of evaluative anesthesia. You can’t tell if you’ve built something useful or just something that exists. In some way, this is the sober version of hippies in the 60s trying LSD for the first time: sometimes you may have a breakthrough, or you may have a breakdown, but regardless of which, this is the opposite of the salvation through making that Fred Turner talks about.</p><p>There’s a second reason the old transformation-through-making metaphor doesn’t fit vibe coding, and it has to do with how the Maker Movement actually ended.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/06/12/strategy-letter-v/\" rel=\"\">commoditizing your complement</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/09/monday-com-stock-ai-software.html\" rel=\"\">entire SaaS business models</a></p><p>With both of these forces at play—no scenius phase to develop through, and value accumulating upstream rather than with the maker—the old metaphor of transformation-through-making doesn’t hold up exactly. We need a new one.</p><p>Specifically: consumption of a surplus intelligence. AI represents an enormous amount of available cognitive energy, and vibe coding is one way of expending that energy before it goes to waste. Think of it like a resource that’s being generated whether you use it or not—and vibe coding is the act of channeling that surplus into play, into exploration, into rapid creation that may or may not produce lasting artifacts.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.fast.ai/posts/2026-01-28-dark-flow/\" rel=\"\">the dark flow state when you gamble</a></p><p>Consumption almost always gets treated as a negative behavior, especially if you’re an entrepreneur or builder. Consuming is what passive people do. Builders produce.</p><p>I think this framing is wrong, or at least incomplete. There are several productive ways to think about what consumption actually generates.</p><p>Expenditure that’s visible generates spectacle, and spectacle generates attention. When you vibe-code something in public—building fast, shipping immediately, iterating in front of an audience—the product you make matters less than the performance of making it. And undoubtedly, much of vibe coding today is pure signalling performance.</p><p><a href=\"https://x.com/search?q=built%20in%20a%20weekend%20&amp;src=typed_query\" rel=\"\">built this in a weekend</a></p><p>This is structurally identical to how content creators already operate. A YouTuber’s individual video is an expenditure. The audience accumulated across hundreds of videos is the asset. Vibe coding just adds another medium to the content creator’s toolkit: instead of expending effort on essays or videos, you expend it on apps and tools, and you capture the attention the same way.</p><p>If you treat your vibe-coded output as gifts—open source tools, free utilities, shared templates, public repos—you’re creating the conditions to occupy an interesting or powerful position in the network. Think of the people who built the early web’s most useful free tools and resources: They became nodes that other people oriented around.</p><p>Every time you vibe-code something, you’re generating signal. Signal about what users want. Signal about which patterns work. Signal about where the model fails, what edge cases it misses, what instructions it misinterprets. That signal currently flows upstream to model providers for free. Your prompts, your iterations, your corrections—all of it becomes training data for the next generation of models. You are, in a very literal sense, performing unpaid labor for the infrastructure layer every time you build something.</p><p>Consumption doesn’t have to be passive. Surplus can be spent well. The key distinction is whether you’re burning energy with some awareness of what the combustion produces—taste, attention, social capital, structured signal—or whether you’re just spinning up a dozen projects and wondering why none of them stick.</p><p>Personally, I find the consumption metaphor to be a good way to deal with the burnout that comes with constantly using AI for various things. A lot of people approach making things with the mindset of craft, and naturally extend this framing to vibe coding. That framing feels noble and it’s deeply familiar, but it’s also a recipe for burnout, because craft assumes you are reaching inside yourself and pulling something out. The whole emotional architecture of craft is transformational: you struggle, and develop mastery, and the object you produce is evidence of inner change. When the tool is doing most of the producing, that framework starts to collapse. You’re left reaching inward for something that the process never required you to develop, and the gap between the effort you expected to invest and the effort that was actually needed starts to feel like a personal failure rather than a feature of the technology.</p><p>The consumption framing sidesteps this entirely. You’re not reaching inward. You’re starting from the position that there is extra energy available and it needs to go somewhere. The question shifts from “what does this say about me as a maker” to “what’s the most interesting thing I can spend this on.” That’s a fundamentally different emotional posture, and in practice it’s a much more sustainable one.</p>",

When you run , BuildKit is the engine behind it. But reducing BuildKit to “the thing that builds Dockerfiles” is like calling LLVM “the thing that compiles C.” It undersells the architecture by an order of magnitude.</p><p>BuildKit is a general-purpose, pluggable build framework. It can produce OCI images, yes, but also tarballs, local directories, APK packages, RPMs, or anything else you can describe as a directed acyclic graph of filesystem operations. The Dockerfile is just one frontend. You can write your own.</p><p>BuildKit’s design is clean and surprisingly understandable once you see the layers. There are three key concepts.</p><p>At the heart of BuildKit is  (Low-Level Build definition). Think of it as the LLVM IR of build systems. LLB is a binary protocol (protobuf) that describes a DAG of filesystem operations: run a command, copy files, mount a filesystem. It’s content-addressable, which means identical operations produce identical hashes, enabling aggressive caching.</p><p>When you write a Dockerfile, the Dockerfile frontend parses it and emits LLB. But nothing in BuildKit requires that the input be a Dockerfile. Any program that can produce valid LLB can drive BuildKit.</p><h3>Frontends: bring your own syntax</h3><p>A  is a container image that BuildKit runs to convert your build definition (Dockerfile, YAML, JSON, HCL, whatever) into LLB. The frontend receives the build context and the build file through the BuildKit Gateway API, and returns a serialized LLB graph.</p><p>This is the key insight: the build language is not baked into BuildKit. It’s a pluggable layer. You can write a frontend that reads a YAML spec, a TOML config, or a custom DSL, and BuildKit will execute it the same way it executes Dockerfiles.</p><p>You’ve actually seen this mechanism before. The  directive at the top of a Dockerfile tells BuildKit which frontend image to use. <code># syntax=docker/dockerfile:1</code> is just the default. You can point it at any image.</p><h3>Solver and cache: content-addressable execution</h3><p>The  takes the LLB graph and executes it. Each vertex in the DAG is content-addressed, so if you’ve already built a particular step with the same inputs, BuildKit skips it entirely. This is why BuildKit is fast: it doesn’t just cache layers linearly like the old Docker builder. It caches at the operation level across the entire graph, and it can execute independent branches in parallel.</p><p>The cache can be local, inline (embedded in the image), or remote (a registry). This makes BuildKit builds reproducible and shareable across CI runners.</p><p>BuildKit’s  flag is where this gets practical. You can tell BuildKit to export the result as:</p><ul><li> — push to a registry (the default for )</li><li> — dump the final filesystem to a local directory</li><li> — export as a tarball</li><li> — export as an OCI image tarball</li></ul><p>The  output is the most interesting for non-image use cases. Your build can produce compiled binaries, packages, documentation, or anything else, and BuildKit will dump the result to disk. No container image required.</p><p>Projects like <a href=\"https://earthly.dev\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Earthly</a>\n, <a href=\"https://dagger.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dagger</a>\n, and <a href=\"https://depot.dev\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Depot</a>\n are all built on top of BuildKit’s LLB. It’s a proven pattern.</p><h2>Building APK packages with a custom frontend</h2><p>To demonstrate this concretely, I built <a href=\"https://github.com/tuananh/apkbuild\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">apkbuild</a>\n: a custom BuildKit frontend that reads a YAML spec and produces Alpine APK packages. No Dockerfile involved. The entire build pipeline — from source compilation to APK packaging — runs inside BuildKit using LLB operations. Think of this like a dummy version of <a href=\"https://github.com/chainguard-dev/melange\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Chainguard’s melange</a></p><p>I chose YAML for familiarity, but the spec could be anything you want (JSON, TOML, a custom DSL) as long as your frontend can parse it.</p><p>My package YAML spec looks like this:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"yaml\"></code></pre></div><p>That’s it. No Dockerfile. BuildKit reads this spec through the custom frontend and produces a  file.</p><p>Build the frontend image:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"shell\"></code></pre></div><p>Then use it to build an APK package:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"shell\"></code></pre></div><p>You should be able to see the APK package in the  folder like below</p><p> tells BuildKit to use our custom frontend instead of the default Dockerfile parser. The  dumps the resulting  files to . No image is created. No registry is involved.</p><p>BuildKit gives you a content-addressable, parallelized, cached build engine for free. You don’t need to reinvent caching, parallelism, or reproducibility. You write a frontend that translates your spec into LLB, and BuildKit handles the rest.</p><p>This is relevant beyond toy demos. Dagger uses LLB as its execution engine for CI/CD pipelines. Earthly compiles Earthfiles into LLB. The pattern is proven at scale.</p><p>If you’re building a tool that needs to compile code, produce artifacts, or orchestrate multi-step builds, consider BuildKit as your execution backend. The Dockerfile is just the default frontend. The real power is in the engine underneath.</p>",

These emails indicate that those companies scrape people's Github activity, and if they notice users contributing to repos in their field of business, send marketing emails to those users without receiving their consent. My guess is that they use commit metadata for this purpose. This includes recipients under the GDPR (AKA me).</p><p>I've sent complaints to both organizations, no response so far.</p><p>I have just contacted both Github and YC Ethics on this issue, I'll update here if I get a response.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Hi HN, I'm Narek. I built Manim-Web, a TypeScript/JavaScript port of 3Blue1Brown’s popular Manim math animation engine.</p><p>The Problem: Like many here, I love Manim's visual style. But setting it up locally is notoriously painful - it requires Python, FFmpeg, Cairo, and a full LaTeX distribution. It creates a massive barrier to entry, especially for students or people who just want to quickly visualize a concept.</p><p>The Solution: I wanted to make it zero-setup, so I ported the engine to TypeScript. Manim-Web runs entirely client-side in the browser. No Python, no servers, no install. It runs animations in real-time at 60fps.</p><p>How it works underneath:\n- Rendering: Uses Canvas API / WebGL (via Three.js for 3D scenes).\n- LaTeX: Rendered and animated via MathJax/KaTeX (no LaTeX install needed!).\n- API: I kept the API almost identical to the Python version (e.g., scene.play(new Transform(square, circle))), meaning existing Manim knowledge transfers over directly.\n- Reactivity: Updaters and ValueTrackers follow the exact same reactive pattern as the Python original.</p><p>Because it's web-native, the animations are now inherently interactive (objects can be draggable/clickable) and can be embedded directly into React/Vue apps, interactive textbooks, or blogs. I also included a py2ts converter to help migrate existing scripts.</p><p>It's open-source (MIT). I'm still actively building out feature parity with the Python version, but core animations, geometry, plotting, and 3D orbiting are working great. I would love to hear your feedback, and I'll be hanging around to answer any technical questions about rendering math in the browser!</p>",

Ten years ago, a team released a game called <a href=\"https://github.com/screeps/screeps\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Screeps</a>. It was described \n              as an \"MMO RTS sandbox for programmers.\" In Screeps, human players write javascript strategies \n              that get executed in the game's environment. Players gain resources, lose territory, and have \n              units wiped out. It's a traditional RTS, but controlled entirely through code. \n            </p><p>\n              The Screeps paradigm, writing code and having it execute in a real-time game environment, is well suited \n              for an LLM benchmark. Drawing on a version of the Screeps open source API, LLM Skirmish pits \n              LLMs head-to-head in a series of 1v1 real-time strategy games.\n            </p></section><section><p>\n              In LLM Skirmish, each player begins with a \"spawn\" (a building that can create units), one \n              military unit, and three economic units. The objective of each LLM Skirmish match is to \n              eliminate your opponent's spawn. If a player is not eliminated within 2,000 game frames \n              (each player is allowed up to one second of runtime computation per frame), the game ends \n              and the victor is determined based on score.\n            </p></section><section><p>\n              Every LLM Skirmish tournament consists of five rounds. In each round, each LLM is asked to \n              write a script implementing its strategy. For all rounds after the first, each LLM can see \n              the results of all its matches from the previous round and use that information to make \n              changes to the script it submits for the next round. In every round, every player plays all \n              other players once. This means there are 10 matches per round and 50 matches per tournament.\n            </p></section><section><p>\n              LLM Skirmish was conducted using <a href=\"https://opencode.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OpenCode</a>, \n              an open source general purpose agentic coding harness. OpenCode was selected because it was not \n              designed for any of the evaluated models and is fully open source to aid in replicability.\n            </p><p>\n              Each LLM agent runs in an isolated Docker container with OpenCode providing the coding environment. \n              The orchestrator coordinates the tournament by sending prompts to each agent, which then uses \n              OpenCode's tools (file editing, shell commands, etc.) to write and submit their game scripts.\n            </p><p>\n              At the start of each round, agents receive \n              <a href=\"https://github.com/llmskirmish/skirmish/blob/main/prompts/OBJECTIVE.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OBJECTIVE.md</a> \n              (the game rules, API documentation, and instructions for writing a game script) and \n              <a href=\"https://github.com/llmskirmish/skirmish/blob/main/prompts/NEXT_ROUND.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NEXT_ROUND.md</a> \n              (instructions for reviewing match logs from the previous round, rounds 2-5 only). \n              Agents are also provided with <a href=\"https://github.com/llmskirmish/skirmish/tree/main/example_strategies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">two example strategies</a> as reference.\n            </p><p>\n              After each agent creates their strategy, the orchestrator validates the script. If validation fails, the agent \n              receives the error message and has up to 3 attempts to fix the issue before the round proceeds.\n            </p></section><section><p>\n              LLM Skirmish tests in-context learning, as each tournament lasts five rounds and models are \n              able to alter strategies between rounds. One would hypothesize that if a model is successfully \n              learning in context, scripts written after seeing previous results (as in rounds 2–5) would be \n              of higher quality compared to scripts written in round 1.\n            </p><p>\n              Across all tournaments, each model submits 25 scripts for a total of 250 matches. In a tournament, \n              we consider each model to be a player. If we treat each script as a player and have all scripts \n              play against each other, we can simulate 7,750 matches to get a robust per-round average win rate \n              (a proxy for script quality).\n            </p><div><div><h3>Script Round vs Performance</h3></div></div><p>\n              We can see that four of the five models evaluated have notable increases in average win rate \n              between round 1 and round 5 (Claude Opus 4.5 +20%, GLM 4.7 +16%, GPT 5.2 +7%, Grok 4.1 Fast +6%).\n            </p><p>\n              Gemini 3 Pro's performance presents an anomaly. Its round 1 average win rate was 70% (higher \n              than all four other evaluated models), while its round 2-5 average win rate was 15% (lower than \n              all four other evaluated models). Gemini 3 Pro's round 1 scripts are approximately four times \n              shorter than those of top-performing models Claude 4.5 Opus and GPT 5.2. A qualitative review of \n              Gemini 3 Pro's scripts suggests it had success with simplistic strategies in round 1. In rounds \n              2-5, compared to the other four models evaluated, Gemini 3 Pro most aggressively populated its \n              context with previous round results before submitting its script for that round, suggesting that \n              context rot was a notable contributor to the performance variance. Whether this context rot reflects \n              other models being better at planning tool use than Gemini 3 Pro, or whether OpenCode is a \n              uniquely inhospitable harness for Gemini 3 Pro, is worth investigating further in future versions \n              of LLM Skirmish.\n            </p></section><section><p>\n              API costs vary significantly across models. The chart below plots each model's \n              average cost per round against its ELO rating. Claude Opus 4.5 achieved the highest \n              ELO (1778) but at the highest cost ($4.12/round). GPT 5.2 delivers nearly 1.7x more \n              ELO per dollar than Claude Opus 4.5.\n            </p></section>",

This helps you identify commenters that you want to read as you quickly scan a comment thread.</blockquote><p>I've found that this reduces the time I spent on Hacker News, as I can glance at long comment threads and just find the good stuff.</p><p>Hacker Smacker is directly inspired by Slashdot's friend/foe system. Hacker Smacker is also open-source and is <a href=\"https://github.com/samuelclay/hackersmacker\">available on GitHub</a>.</p></section><section><p>Hacker Smacker was built to learn how FoaF (Friend of a Friend) works. The idea is that not only do you want to surface content from your friends, but if you chose your friends well, they can help you surface more great content by highlighting comments from their friends.</p><p>The impetus for building a small system where the primary goal is simply to quickly show relationships was that I wanted to build the same system for <a href=\"http://www.newsblur.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">NewsBlur</a>, a visual RSS feed reader with intelligence. The backend is built using <a href=\"http://redis.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">Redis</a> sets and CoffeeScript/Node.js. NewsBlur's social layer, which was built immediately after this project, uses a very similar backend.</p><p>Learning how to build this project was the main reason, as I am now able to bring this technique to other projects.</p></section>",

      "content": "<p>Emdash is an open-source and provider-agnostic desktop app that lets you run multiple coding agents in parallel, each isolated in its own git worktree, either locally or over SSH on a remote machine. We call it an Agentic Development Environment (ADE).</p><p>We are building Emdash for ourselves. While working on a cap-table management application (think Stripe Atlas + Pulley), we found our development workflow to be messy: lots of terminals, lots of branches, and too much time spent waiting on Codex.</p><p>Emdash puts the terminal at the center and makes it easy to run multiple agents at once. Each agent runs as a task in its own git worktree. You can start one or a few agents on the same problem, test, and review.</p><p>Emdash works over SSH so you can run agents where your code lives and keep the parallel workflow. You can assign tickets to agents, edit files manually, and review changes.</p><p>We also spent time making task startup fast. Each task can be created in a worktree, and creating worktrees on demand was taking 5s+ in some cases. We now keep a small reserve of worktrees in the background and let a new task claim one instantly. That brought task start time down to ~500–1000ms depending on the provider. We also spawn the shell directly and avoid loading the shell environments on startup.</p><p>We believe using the providers’ native CLIs is the right approach. It gives you the full capabilities of each agent, always. If a provider starts supporting plan mode, we don't have to add that first.</p><p>We support 21 coding agent CLIs today, including Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Droid, Amp, Codebuff, and more. We auto-detect what you have installed and we’re provider-agnostic by design. If there’s a provider you want that we don’t support yet, we can add it. We believe that in the future, some agents will be better suited for task X and others for task Y. Codex, Claude Code, and Gemini all have fans. We want to be agnostic and enable individuals and teams to freely switch between them.</p><p>Beyond orchestration, we try to pull most of the development loop into Emdash. You can review diffs, commit, open PRs, see CI/CD checks, and merge directly from Emdash once checks pass. When starting a task, you can pass issues from Linear, GitHub, and Jira to an agent. We also support convenience variables and lifecycle scripts so it’s easy to allocate ports and test changes.</p><p>Emdash is fully open-source and MIT-licensed.</p><p>Download for macOS, Linux or Windows (as of yesterday !), or install via Homebrew: brew install --cask emdash.</p><p>We’d love your feedback. How does your coding agent development setup look like, especially when working with multiple agents? We would want to learn more about it. Check out our repository here: <a href=\"https://github.com/generalaction/emdash\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/generalaction/emdash</a></p><p>We’ll be around in the comments — thanks!</p>",

      "content": "<p> is a working CSS-only x86 CPU/emulator/computer. Yes, the  CSS. No JavaScript required.</p><p>What you're seeing above is a <a href=\"https://github.com/rebane2001/x86CSS/blob/mane/c/main.c\">C program</a> that was compiled using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection\">GCC</a> into native <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8086\">8086</a> machine code being executed fully within CSS.</p><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h3>Is CSS a programming language?</h3><p>Do you really need to ask at this point?</p><p>I plan on writing a blog post that explains how this works as well as many of the tricks used. Bookmark <a href=\"https://lyra.horse/blog/\">my blog</a> or add it to your RSS reader.</p><h3>Surely you still need a little bit of JavaScript?</h3><p>There is a script tag on this site, which is there to provide a clock to the CSS - but this is only there to make the entire thing a bit faster and more stable. The CSS also has a JS-less clock implementation, so if you disable scripts on this site, it will still run. <b>JavaScript is not required.</b></p><p>My CSS clock uses an animation combined with style container queries, which means you don't need to interact with anything for the program to run, but it also means its a bit slower and less stable as a result. A hover-based clock, such as the one in <a href=\"https://dev.to/janeori/expert-css-the-cpu-hack-4ddj\">Jane Ori's CPU Hack</a>, is fast and stable, but requires you to hold your mouse on the screen, <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32622021\">which some people claim</a> does not count as turing complete for whatever reason, so I wanted this demo to be fully functional with zero user input.</p><h3>But you still need HTML, right?</h3><p>Not really... well, kind of?</p><p>This entire CPU runs in just CSS and doesn't require any HTML code, but there is no way to load the CSS without a &lt;style&gt; tag, so that much is required. In Firefox <a href=\"https://lyra.horse/fun/tic-tac-nohtml/\">it is possible</a> to load CSS with no HTML, but atm this demo only works in Chromium-based browsers.</p><h3>Why does it only work in Chrome?</h3><p>This project uses a few CSS features, such as <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Values/if\">if() statements</a>, <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/At-rules/@container#container_style_queries\">style queries</a>, and custom <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/At-rules/@function\">@functions</a>, that are not available in all browsers. At this time, it's only compatible with Chromium-based browsers, but hopefully that'll change at some point since the features used are in the CSS spec. I usually make sure to target Firefox in the projects I make, but it's just not realistic for me with this one.</p><h3>What preprocessor do you use?</h3><p>I straight up just write CSS! The CSS in <a href=\"https://github.com/rebane2001/x86css/blob/mane/base_template.html\">base_template.html</a> is handwritten in Sublime Text, but for the more repetitive parts of the code I wrote a <a href=\"https://github.com/rebane2001/x86css/blob/mane/build_css.py\">python script</a>.</p><h3>What ai/model/llm do you use?</h3><p> I don't think you can build a project like this with an llm.</p><p>Not really, you can get way better performance by writing code in CSS directly rather than emulating an entire archaic CPU architecture.</p><p>It is fun though, and computers are made for art and fun!</p><h3>Can I write/run my own programs?</h3><p>Yes, but you'll have to compile them yourself. See below.</p><p>No, not in its current state.</p><h3>Have you figured out how to center a div?</h3><h3>You were so preoccupied with whether or not you could that you didn't stop to think if you should</h3><p>idk why everybody keeps saying that, obviously i thought about whether i should first and came to the conclusion that it would be fun and cool asf to do it</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86\">x86</a> is the CPU architecture most computers these days run on. Heavily simplified, this demo runs the same machine code in CSS that your computer does in its processor. To be fair, modern x86 is 64bit and has a bunch of useful extensions, so it's not quite the same - this here is the original 16bit x86 that ran on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8086\">8086</a>.</p><p>This project implements most of the x86 architecture, but not literally every single instruction and quirk, because a lot of it is unnecessary and not worth adding.</p><p>The way I approached this project was by writing programs I wanted to run in C, compiling them in GCC with various levels of optimization, and then implementing every instruction I needed. This way I know I have everything I need implemented.</p><p>There is some behaviour that's wrong, and some things are missing (e.g. setting the CF/OF flag bits). That's okay.</p><p>You can run your own software in this emulator!</p><p>If you have 8086 assembly ready to go, clone my repo, and put the assembly in a file called . Then, put the address of the _start() function in  as a number. Once that's set, you can just run  with Python3 (no dependencies required!) and the output will be in .</p><p>If you want to write C code, you can do so using <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/tkchia/build-ia16\">gcc-ia16</a> (you can build it yourself or install it from the <a href=\"https://launchpad.net/~tkchia/+archive/ubuntu/build-ia16/\">PPA</a>). The  script does the build with the correct flags and also makes the  files. Don't forget to run  after! This building setup works on both Linux and WSL1/2 (I haven't tried on macOS).</p><p>By default there is 0x600 bytes (1.5kB) of memory, but this can be increased in the  file as necessary. The program gets loaded at memory address 0x100. There's some custom I/O addresses for you to be able to interface with the program.</p><p>Here's an example program:</p><pre><code>static const char STR_4BYTES[] = \"hell\";\nstatic const char STR_8BYTES[] = \"o world!\";\n\nvoid (*writeChar1)(char);\nvoid (*writeChar4)(const char[4]);\nvoid (*writeChar8)(const char[8]);\nchar (*readInput)(void);\n\nint _start(void) {\n  // Set up custom stuff\n  writeChar1 = (void*)(0x2000);\n  writeChar4 = (void*)(0x2002);\n  writeChar8 = (void*)(0x2004);\n  readInput = (void*)(0x2006);\n  int* SHOW_KEYBOARD = (int*)(0x2100);\n\n  // Write a single byte to screen\n  writeChar1(0x0a);\n  // Write 4 bytes from pointer to screen\n  writeChar4(STR_4BYTES);\n  // Write 8 bytes from pointer to screen\n  writeChar8(STR_8BYTES);\n  // Write a character from custom charset\n  writeChar1(0x80);\n\n  while (1) {\n    // Show numeric keyboard\n    *SHOW_KEYBOARD = 1;\n    // Read keyboard input\n    char input = readInput();\n    if (!input) continue;\n    *SHOW_KEYBOARD = 0;\n    // Echo input\n    writeChar1(input);\n    break;\n  }\n\n  while (1) {\n    // Show alphanumeric keyboard\n    *SHOW_KEYBOARD = 2;\n    char input = readInput();\n    if (!input) continue;\n    *SHOW_KEYBOARD = 0;\n    writeChar1(input);\n    break;\n  }\n\n  return 1337;\n}</code></pre>",

      "content": "<div><div><p>We are releasing Steerling-8B, the first interpretable model that can trace any token it generates to its input context, concepts a human can understand, and its training data.\nTrained on 1.35 trillion tokens, the model achieves downstream performance within range of models trained on 2–7× more data.\nSteerling-8B unlocks several capabilities which include suppressing or amplifying specific concepts at inference time without retraining, training data provenance for any generated chunk, and inference-time alignment via concept control, replacing thousands of safety training examples with explicit concept-level steering.</p></div></div><p>For the first time, a language model, at the 8-billion-parameter scale, can explain every token it produces in three key ways.\nMore specifically, for any group of output tokens that Steerling generates, we can trace these tokens to:</p><ol><li> the prompt tokens,</li><li> human-understandable topics in the model’s representations, and</li><li> the training data drove the output.</li></ol><p>We are releasing the weights of a base model trained on 1.35T tokens as well as companion code to interact and play with the model.</p><p>Below we show Steerling-8B generating text from a prompt across various categories. You can select an example, then click on any highlighted chunk of the output. The panel below will update to show:</p><ol><li><strong>Input Feature attribution:</strong> which tokens in the input prompt strongly influenced that chunk.</li><li> the ranked list of concepts, both tone (e.g. analytical, ) and content (e.g. Genetic alteration methodologies), that the model routed through to produce that chunk.</li><li><strong>Training data attribution:</strong> how the concepts in that chunk distribute across training sources (ArXiv, Wikipedia, FLAN, etc.), showing where in the training data the model’s knowledge originates.</li></ol><p>Steerling is built on a <a href=\"https://www.guidelabs.ai/post/block-causal-diffusion-language-model/\">causal discrete diffusion model</a> backbone, which lets us steer generation across multi-token tokens rather than only at the next-token.\nThe key design choice is decomposing the model’s embeddings into three explicit pathways: ~33K supervised “known” concepts, ~100K “discovered” concepts the model learns on its own, and a residual that captures whatever remains.</p><p>We then constrain the model with training loss functions that ensure the model routes signal through concepts without a fundamental tradeoff with performance.\nThe concepts feed into logits through a linear path, every prediction decomposes exactly into per-concept contributions, and we can edit those contributions at inference time without retraining.\nFor the full architecture, training objectives, and scaling analysis, see <a href=\"https://www.guidelabs.ai/post/scaling-interpretable-models-8b/\">Scaling Interpretable Models to 8B</a>.</p><img src=\"https://www.guidelabs.ai/images/embedding_decomposition.apng\" alt=\"Diagram showing Steerling's embedding decomposition into known concepts, discovered concepts, and residual\" width=\"2200\" height=\"900\"><p>Despite being trained on significantly fewer compute than comparable models, Steerling-8B achieves competitive performance across standard benchmarks. The figure below shows average performance (across 7 benchmarks) versus approximate training FLOPs on a log scale, with vertical lines marking multiples of Steerling’s compute budget.</p><figure><figcaption><p>Steerling outperforms both LLaMA2-7B and Deepseek-7B on overall average despite using fewer FLOPs, and remains within range of models trained with 2–10× more compute.</p></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><p>Steerling performance across various benchmarks ranging from general purpose question answering to those focused on reasoning and math.</p></figcaption></figure><p>In the <a href=\"https://www.guidelabs.ai/post/scaling-interpretable-models-8b/\">previous update</a>, we shared several ways that assess how interpretable a model’s representations are.\nHere we provide another metric that gives insight into the model’s use of its concepts. On a held-out validation set, over 84% of token-level contribution comes from the concept module: the model is not just using the residual to make its predictions.\nThis matters for control: if the model’s predictions genuinely flow through concepts, then editing those concepts at inference time actually changes what the model does rather than nudging a side channel while the real work happens elsewhere.</p><figure><figcaption><p>Token level logit distribution of Steerling-8B’s activations on a held-out validation set. Over 84% of token-level contribution comes from the concept module.</p></figcaption></figure><p>A useful check is what happens when we remove the residual pathway. On several LM Harness tasks, dropping the residual has only a small effect, which suggests the model’s predictive signal is largely routed through concepts rather than hidden “everything-else” channels.</p><figure><figcaption><p>Change in model performance across a variety of benchmarks with and without the model’s residual portion. This indicates that the model mostly relies on concepts, both supervised or discovered, for its outputs.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Finally, Steerling can  in text with  on a held-out validation dataset.</p><p>In the coming weeks, we’ll be releasing deep dives on each of these capabilities:</p><ul><li>: precise control via intervention;</li><li>: what did Steerling learn that we didn’t teach it? We’ll open up the discovered concept space and show structure that surprised us.</li><li><strong>Alignment without fine-tuning</strong>: replace thousands of safety training examples with a handful of concept-level interventions.</li><li><strong>Memorization &amp; training data valuation</strong>: trace any generation back to the training data that produced it, and assign value to individual data sources.</li><li><strong>The case for inherent interpretability</strong>: what do you gain when interpretability is designed in from the start, and what do you miss when it’s bolted on after the fact?</li></ul><p>We’ll cover each of these in detail in upcoming posts, with quantitative evaluations and deployment-oriented case studies.</p>",

Should I Walk or Drive?\" This question has been making the rounds as a simple AI logic test so I wanted to see how it holds up across a broad set of models. Ran 53 models (leading open-source, open-weight, proprietary) with no system prompt, forced choice between drive and walk, with a reasoning field.<p>On a single run, only 11 out of 53 got it right (42 said walk). But a single run doesn't prove much, so I reran every model 10 times. Same prompt, no cache, clean slate.<p>The results got worse. Of the 11 that passed the single run, only 5 could do it consistently. GPT-5 managed 7/10. GPT-5.1, GPT-5.2, Claude Sonnet 4.5, every Llama and Mistral model scored 0/10 across all 10 runs.<p>People kept saying humans would fail this too, so I got a human baseline through Rapidata (10k people, same forced choice): 71.5% said drive. Most models perform below that.<p>All reasoning traces (ran via Opper, my startup), full model breakdown, human baseline data, and raw JSON files are in the writeup for anyone who wants to dig in or run their own analysis.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47128138\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47128138</a></p>\n<p>Points: 362</p>\n<p># Comments: 441</p>\n",

In particular, we’re curious to hear the community’s take on our inclusion of AI-related topics (e.g., dedicating an entire class to the topic of agentic coding; though we tried to counterbalance it with plenty of disclaimers, and a dedicated section on AI etiquette in Beyond the Code).<p>--Anish, Jon, and Jose</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47124171\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47124171</a></p>\n<p>Points: 429</p>\n<p># Comments: 124</p>\n",

      "url": "https://github.com/pgdogdev/pgdog",

      "author": "levkk",

      "content": "<p>Hey HN! Lev and Justin here, authors of PgDog (<a href=\"https://pgdog.dev/\">https://pgdog.dev/</a>), a connection pooler, load balancer and database sharder for PostgreSQL. If you build apps with a lot of traffic, you know the first thing to break is the database. We are solving this with a network proxy that works without requiring application code changes or database migrations.</p><p>The most important update: we are in production. Sharding is used a lot, with direct-to-shard  queries (one shard per query) working pretty much all the time. Cross-shard (or multi-database) queries are still a work in progress, but we are making headway.</p><p>Aggregate functions like count(), min(), max(), avg(), stddev() and variance() are working, without refactoring the app. PgDog calculates the aggregate in-transit, while transparently rewriting queries to fetch any missing info. For example, multi-database average calculation requires a total count of rows to calculate the original sum. PgDog will add count() to the query, if it’s not there already, and remove it from the rows sent to the app.</p><p>Sorting and grouping works, including DISTINCT, if the columns(s) are referenced in the result. Over 10 data types are supported, like, timestamp(tz), all integers, varchar, etc.</p><p>Cross-shard writes, including schema changes (CREATE/DROP/ALTER), are now atomic and synchronized between all shards with two-phase commit. PgDog keeps track of the transaction state internally and will rollback the transaction if the first phase fails. You don’t need to monkeypatch your ORM to use this: PgDog will intercept the COMMIT statement and execute PREPARE TRANSACTION and COMMIT PREPARED instead.</p><p>Omnisharded tables, a.k.a replicated or mirrored (identical on all shards), support atomic reads and writes. That’s important because most databases can’t be completely sharded and will have some common data on all databases that has to be kept in-sync.</p><p>Multi-tuple inserts, e.g., INSERT INTO table_x VALUES ($1, $2), ($3, $4), are split by our query rewriter and distributed to their respective shards automatically. They are used by ORMs like Prisma, Sequelize, and others, so those now work without code changes too.</p><p>Sharding keys can be mutated. PgDog will intercept and rewrite the update statement into 3 queries, SELECT, INSERT, and DELETE, moving the row between shards. If you’re using Citus (for everyone else, Citus is a Postgres extension for sharding databases), this might be worth a look.</p><p>If you’re like us and prefer integers to UUIDs for your primary keys, we built a cross-shard unique sequence, directly inside PgDog. It uses the system clock (and a couple other inputs), can be called like a Postgres function, and will automatically inject values into queries, so ORMs like ActiveRecord will continue to work out of the box. It’s monotonically increasing, just like a real Postgres sequence, and can generate up to 4 million numbers per second with a range of 69.73 years, so no need to migrate to UUIDv7 just yet.</p><pre><code>    INSERT INTO my_table (id, created_at) VALUES (pgdog.unique_id(), now());\n</code></pre>\nResharding is now built-in. We can move gigabytes of tables per second, by parallelizing logical replication streams across replicas. This is really cool! Last time we tried this at Instacart, it took over two weeks to move 10 TB between two machines. Now, we can do this in just a few hours, in big part thanks to the work of the core team that added support for logical replication slots to streaming replicas in Postgres 16.<p>Sharding hardly works without a good load balancer. PgDog can monitor replicas and move write traffic to a promoted primary during a failover. This works with managed Postgres, like RDS (incl. Aurora), Azure Pg, GCP Cloud SQL, etc., because it just polls each instance with “SELECT pg_is_in_recovery()”. Primary election is not supported yet, so if you’re self-hosting with Patroni, you should keep it around for now, but you don’t need to run HAProxy in front of the DBs anymore.</p><p>The load balancer is getting pretty smart and can handle edge cases like SELECT FOR UPDATE and CTEs with INSERT/UPDATE statements, but if you still prefer to handle your read/write separation in code, you can do that too with manual routing. This works by giving PgDog a hint at runtime: a connection parameter (-c pgdog.role=primary), SET statement, or a query comment. If you have multiple connection pools in your app, you can replace them with just one connection to PgDog instead. For multi-threaded Python/Ruby/Go apps, this helps by reducing memory usage, I/O and context switching overhead.</p><p>Speaking of connection pooling, PgDog can automatically rollback unfinished transactions and drain and re-sync partially sent queries, all in an effort to preserve connections to the database. If you’ve seen Postgres go to 100% CPU because of a connection storm caused by an application crash, this might be for you. Draining connections works by receiving and discarding rows from abandoned queries and sending the Sync message via the Postgres wire protocol, which clears the query context and returns the connection to a normal state.</p><p>PgDog is open source and welcomes contributions and feedback in any form. As always, all features are configurable and can be turned off/on, so should you choose to give it a try, you can do so at your own pace. Our docs (<a href=\"https://docs.pgdog.dev\">https://docs.pgdog.dev</a>) should help too.</p><p>Thanks for reading and happy hacking!</p>",

      "content": "<p>Hey HN! I built a native macOS desktop client for Hacker News and I'm open-sourcing it under the MIT license.</p><p>I spend a lot of time reading HN — I wanted something that felt like a proper Mac app: a sidebar for browsing stories, an integrated reader for articles, and comment threading — all in one window. Essentially, I wanted HN to feel like a first-class citizen on macOS, not a website I visit.</p><p>- Split-view layout — stories in a sidebar on the left, articles and comments on the right, using the standard macOS NavigationSplitView pattern.</p><p>- Built-in ad blocking — a precompiled WKContentRuleList blocks 14 major ad networks (DoubleClick, Google Syndication, Criteo, Taboola, Outbrain, Amazon ads, etc.) right in the WebKit layer. No extensions needed. Toggleable in settings.</p><p>- Pop-up blocking — kills window.open() calls. Also toggleable.</p><p>- HN account login — full authentication flow (login, account creation, password reset). Session is stored in the macOS Keychain, and cookies are injected into the WebView so you can upvote, comment, and submit stories while staying logged in.</p><p>- Bookmarks — save stories locally for offline access. Persisted with Codable serialization, searchable and filterable independently.</p><p>- Search and filtering — powered by the Algolia HN API. Filter by content type (All, Ask, Show, Jobs, Comments), date range (Today, Past Week, Past Month, All Time), and sort by hot or recent.</p><p>- Scroll progress indicator — a small orange bar at the top tracks your reading progress via JavaScript-to-native messaging.</p><p>- Auto-updates via Sparkle with EdDSA-signed updates served from GitHub Pages.</p><p>- Dark mode — respects system appearance with CSS and meta tag injection.</p><p>Tech details for the curious:</p><p>The whole app is ~2,050 lines of Swift across 16 files. It uses the modern @Observable macro (not the old ObservableObject/Published pattern), structured concurrency with async/await and withThrowingTaskGroup for concurrent batch fetching, and SwiftUI throughout — no UIKit/AppKit bridges except for the WKWebView wrapper via NSViewRepresentable.</p><p>Two APIs power the data: the official HN Firebase API for individual item/user fetches, and the Algolia Search API for feeds, filtering, and search. The Algolia API is surprisingly powerful for this — it lets you do date-range filtering, pagination, and full-text search that the Firebase API doesn't support.</p><p>The release pipeline is a single GitHub Actions workflow (467 lines) that handles the full macOS distribution story: build and archive, code sign with Developer ID, notarize with Apple (with a 5-retry staple loop for ticket propagation delays), create a custom DMG with AppleScript-driven icon positioning, sign and notarize the DMG, generate an EdDSA Sparkle signature, create a GitHub Release, and deploy an updated appcast.xml to GitHub Pages.</p><p>Getting macOS code signing and notarization working in CI was honestly the hardest part of this project. If anyone is distributing a macOS app outside the App Store via GitHub Actions, I'm happy to answer questions — the workflow is fully open source.</p><p>I'd love feedback — especially on features you'd want to see. Some ideas I'm considering: keyboard-driven navigation (j/k to move between stories), a reader mode that strips articles down to text, and notification support for replies to your comments.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I run a lot of Claude Code and Codex sessions in parallel. I was using Ghostty with a bunch of split panes, and relying on native macOS notifications to know when an agent needed me. But Claude Code's notification body is always just \"Claude is waiting for your input\" with no context, and with enough tabs open, I couldn't even read the titles anymore.</p><p>I tried a few coding orchestrators but most of them were Electron/Tauri apps and the performance bugged me. I also just prefer the terminal since GUI orchestrators lock you into their workflow. So I built cmux as a native macOS app in Swift/AppKit. It uses libghostty for terminal rendering and reads your existing Ghostty config for themes, fonts, colors, and more.</p><p>The main additions are the sidebar and notification system. The sidebar has vertical tabs that show git branch, working directory, listening ports, and the latest notification text for each workspace. The notification system picks up terminal sequences (OSC 9/99/777) and has a CLI (cmux notify) you can wire into agent hooks for Claude Code, OpenCode, etc. When an agent is waiting, its pane gets a blue ring and the tab lights up in the sidebar, so I can tell which one needs me across splits and tabs. Cmd+Shift+U jumps to the most recent unread.</p><p>The in-app browser has a scriptable API ported from agent-browser [1]. Agents can snapshot the accessibility tree, get element refs, click, fill forms, evaluate JS, and read console logs. You can split a browser pane next to your terminal and have Claude Code interact with your dev server directly.</p><p>Everything is scriptable through the CLI and socket API – create workspaces/tabs, split panes, send keystrokes, open URLs in the browser.</p>",

      "content": "<p data-jscall-id=\"34\">We're excited to announce <a href=\"https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl/pull/5532\" data-jscall-id=\"35\">RayMakie</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/JuliaGraphics/Hikari.jl\" data-jscall-id=\"36\">Hikari</a>, a physically-based GPU ray tracing pipeline integrated directly into <a href=\"https://docs.makie.org\" data-jscall-id=\"37\">Makie</a>. Any Makie scene can now be rendered with photorealistic path tracing: just swap out the backend and get global illumination, volumetric media, spectral rendering, and physically-based materials, all running on the GPU.</p><p data-jscall-id=\"40\"> RayMakie, Hikari, and Raycore are not fully released yet — we plan to publish official releases in the coming weeks. In the meantime, the  in <a href=\"https://github.com/SimonDanisch/RayDemo\" data-jscall-id=\"43\">RayDemo</a> will be kept up to date so you can already try things out.</p><h2 data-jscall-id=\"44\">Why Ray Tracing in Julia?</h2><p data-jscall-id=\"45\">Research groups across many fields (climate science, structural biology, fluid dynamics, particle physics) produce complex 3D data that needs to be communicated clearly and compellingly. Photorealistic rendering can transform dense simulation output into images that reveal structure and tell a story. But getting research data into a traditional ray tracer usually means exporting meshes, learning new tools, and losing the interactive workflow.</p><p data-jscall-id=\"46\">By building ray tracing directly into Makie, we eliminate that gap. The same scene you explore interactively with GLMakie can be rendered photorealistically with RayMakie, no export step, no new API to learn.</p><p data-jscall-id=\"47\">Writing the implementation in Julia gives us:</p><ul data-jscall-id=\"48\"><li data-jscall-id=\"49\"><p data-jscall-id=\"50\">: Julia compiles to efficient GPU code, competitive with C++ ray tracers</p></li><li data-jscall-id=\"56\"><p data-jscall-id=\"57\">: The familiar Makie API for scene construction, camera control, and lighting, with ray tracing as a drop-in rendering option</p></li><li data-jscall-id=\"59\"><p data-jscall-id=\"60\">: Custom materials, media, and integrators run directly on the GPU through Julia's multiple dispatch, opening up novel visualization and simulation use cases</p></li><li data-jscall-id=\"62\"><p data-jscall-id=\"63\">: A state-of-the-art spectral path tracer in a high-level language makes ray tracing research and experimentation accessible to a much wider audience</p></li></ul><p data-jscall-id=\"66\">Hikari is a Julia port of <a href=\"https://pbrt.org/\" data-jscall-id=\"67\">pbrt-v4</a>, the reference implementation from <em data-jscall-id=\"68\">Physically Based Rendering</em> (Pharr, Jakob, Humphreys). It implements a wavefront volumetric path tracer with spectral rendering, supporting participating media (NanoVDB, grid-based volumes), physically-based materials (metals, dielectrics, coated surfaces), and environment/sun-sky lighting. The ray intersection engine lives in <a href=\"https://github.com/JuliaGeometry/Raycore.jl\" data-jscall-id=\"69\">Raycore.jl</a>, a standalone package factored out of Hikari and based on AMD's <a href=\"https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/RadeonRays_SDK\" data-jscall-id=\"70\">Radeon Rays SDK</a> and <a href=\"https://gpuopen.com/hiprt/\" data-jscall-id=\"71\">HIPRT</a>.</p><p data-jscall-id=\"72\">RayMakie connects Hikari to Makie's scene graph. You build a scene with standard Makie calls (, , , ), set materials and lights, then render:</p><pre data-jscall-id=\"77\"><code data-jscall-id=\"78\">\nusing RayMakie, Hikari\n\nscene = Scene(size=(1920, 1080), lights=[SunSkyLight(Vec3f(1, 2, 8))])\ncam3d!(scene)\nmesh!(scene, my_mesh; material=Hikari.Gold(roughness=0.1))\n\nimg = colorbuffer(scene;\n    device=AMDGPU.ROCBackend(),  # or CUDABackend(), CPU()\n    integrator=Hikari.VolPath(samples=100, max_depth=12),\n    sensor=Hikari.FilmSensor(iso=100, white_balance=6500),\n)</code></pre><h3 data-jscall-id=\"80\">Breeze: Volumetric Cloud Rendering</h3><p data-jscall-id=\"81\"><a href=\"https://github.com/NumericalEarth/Breeze.jl/\" data-jscall-id=\"82\">Breeze.jl</a> generates cloud fields from Large Eddy Simulations powered by <a href=\"https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl\" data-jscall-id=\"83\">Oceananigans.jl</a>, a GPU-accelerated ocean and atmosphere simulator developed at MIT's Climate Modeling Alliance (CliMA). The demo renders BOMEX cumulus clouds as photorealistic volumetric media, using NanoVDB sparse grids for efficient storage and Hikari's volumetric path tracing for physically-accurate light scattering through the cloud medium.</p><p data-jscall-id=\"86\">The terrain demo combines real elevation data from ArcGIS (via <a href=\"https://github.com/MakieOrg/Tyler.jl\" data-jscall-id=\"87\">Tyler.jl</a>) with BOMEX cloud volumes, inspired by <a href=\"https://www.rayshader.com/\" data-jscall-id=\"88\">rayshader</a>.</p><blockquote data-jscall-id=\"91\"><p data-jscall-id=\"92\">Makie-Oceananigans integration has been a major initiative over the past year. The ray tracing work with Breeze is truly groundbreaking in my opinion. It may be crucial for science, for inspecting the structure of clouds and thunderstorms. It also has the potential to lead to commercial products.</p><p data-jscall-id=\"93\">, Research Scientist at MIT and CliMA (Climate Modeling Alliance), lead developer of Oceananigans.jl and Breeze.jl</p></blockquote><h3 data-jscall-id=\"95\">PlantGeom: Digital Twins for Agriculture</h3><p data-jscall-id=\"96\"><a href=\"https://github.com/VEZY/PlantGeom.jl\" data-jscall-id=\"97\">PlantGeom.jl</a> renders biophysically accurate 3D plant models for agricultural research. The ray-traced oil palm uses coated diffuse transmission materials to simulate the waxy leaf cuticle and subsurface light transport through leaf tissue.</p><blockquote data-jscall-id=\"100\"><p data-jscall-id=\"101\">Makie has become a central part of my daily scientific workflow. The fact that a single plotting ecosystem can cover the entire spectrum from high-performance 3D scenes to publication-ready figures is just exceptional. Several of the packages I develop would simply not exist in their current form without Makie. My research focuses on developing plant-scale digital twins to study complex agricultural systems (agroforestry, species mixtures, agrivoltaics) with the goal of understanding crop responses to climate and contributing to food security and climate-change adaptation. The recent work on ray tracing is especially exciting: beyond rendering, I am planning to use RayCore.jl for scientific applications such as computing radiation interception in plant canopies, which enables organ-scale energy balance calculations (latent and sensible heat fluxes) and photosynthesis modeling. Understanding how plant shadows affect heat transfer is crucial for adapting agriculture to extreme heat events. Makie has been a genuine force multiplier for my research.</p><p data-jscall-id=\"102\">, CIRAD, developer of PlantGeom.jl</p></blockquote><h3 data-jscall-id=\"104\">ProtPlot: Protein Structure Visualization</h3><p data-jscall-id=\"105\"><a href=\"https://github.com/MurrellGroup/ProtPlot.jl\" data-jscall-id=\"106\">ProtPlot.jl</a> renders protein ribbon diagrams with physically-based materials. Different materials reveal different aspects of the structure: glass refractions show the interior ribbon path, while a coated diffuse surface with shallow depth of field draws attention to specific regions of the fold. Specular highlights, ambient occlusion, and defocus blur make spatial relationships immediately clear in a way that flat shading cannot.</p><p data-jscall-id=\"116\">ProtPlot also powers animated visualizations of protein folding trajectories, the transport process that generative models learn to perform. Ray tracing makes the spatial relationships in these animations immediately legible. The code to produce this is almost entirely standard Makie and ProtPlot, only the imports and a few rendering parameters change:</p><pre data-jscall-id=\"117\"><code data-jscall-id=\"118\">\nusing RayMakie, ProtPlot, Hikari, AMDGPU\n\ndevice = AMDGPU.ROCBackend()\n\ntracks = readdir(\"Trajectories/samp_00015\", join=true)\nset_theme!(lights=[\n    Makie.SunSkyLight(Vec3f(0.4, -0.3, 0.7);\n        intensity=1.0f0, turbidity=3.0f0, ground_enabled=false),\n])\nProtPlot.animate_molecule_dir(\"trajectory.mp4\", tracks)</code></pre><p data-jscall-id=\"119\">The  function is pure ProtPlot code, building Makie figures with , , and  as usual. Then when using the RayMakie backend, Makie will use it to render the video without requiring any additional changes.</p><blockquote data-jscall-id=\"127\"><p data-jscall-id=\"128\">My lab is working on new kinds of generative models, primarily for protein structures. These work by specifying a process that transports randomly sampled noise to a biophysically plausible protein structure, and training a deep neural network to learn how to do this. But the details of this transport process are critical and, while you can to some extent mathematically reason about it, there is no substitute to being able to actually see it in action, both when you're designing it and when investigating how well the model has actually learned it. We work with visualization tools, like ProtPlot.jl, primarily developed by Anton Oresten in my lab, which rely entirely on Makie for this. These visualizations are not just for our internal use, but can be valuable for communicating how the methods work. Developments like raytracing will allow us to configure these to show exactly the details we seek to communicate without them getting buried in the complexity.</p><p data-jscall-id=\"129\">, Karolinska Institutet</p></blockquote><h3 data-jscall-id=\"131\">TrixiParticles: Fluid Simulation</h3><p data-jscall-id=\"132\"><a href=\"https://github.com/trixi-framework/TrixiParticles.jl\" data-jscall-id=\"133\">TrixiParticles.jl</a> simulates fluid dynamics with smoothed particle hydrodynamics. The water splash demo renders SPH surface meshes with a dielectric material (IOR 1.33) simulating water. Fresnel reflections and refractions create the characteristic look of water without any post-processing. The animation shows a gold ball dropping into water, with each frame independently path-traced:</p><blockquote data-jscall-id=\"137\"><p data-jscall-id=\"138\">Native raytracing in Makie would let us move some of our workflows entirely into Julia, from simulation to publication-ready figures, without relying on external tools.</p><p data-jscall-id=\"139\"><strong data-jscall-id=\"140\">Dr. Michael Schlottke-Lakemper</strong>, University of Stuttgart, lead developer of TrixiParticles.jl</p></blockquote><h3 data-jscall-id=\"141\">Volumetric Rendering: Clouds, Smoke, and Exhaust Plumes</h3><p data-jscall-id=\"142\">Participating media are first-class citizens in Hikari's path tracer. Light scatters through volumes realistically, no billboard tricks or screen-space approximations. Hikari supports two volume representations:  sparse grids for large-scale data (like the cloud simulations above), and  for dense grids with per-voxel color, emission, and scattering properties. Both integrate directly with Makie's  plot or can be attached to any mesh as a .</p><p data-jscall-id=\"147\">The  from the <a href=\"https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v4-scenes\" data-jscall-id=\"149\">pbrt-v4 test scenes</a>, rendered with NanoVDB and Henyey-Greenstein phase function scattering:</p><p data-jscall-id=\"152\">A  from <a href=\"https://github.com/WaterLily-jl/WaterLily.jl\" data-jscall-id=\"154\">WaterLily.jl</a> LES simulation, visualized as volumetric smoke. The volume density is updated in-place each frame via  with a colormap, so the scene never needs to be rebuilt:</p><p data-jscall-id=\"159\">The  (model provided by <a href=\"https://juliahub.com\" data-jscall-id=\"161\">JuliaHub</a>) with a procedurally generated emissive rocket exhaust plume.  with per-voxel emission creates the blue-white core fading to orange at the edges:</p><h3 data-jscall-id=\"165\">GLTF Models: Emissive Textures and Scene Composition</h3><p data-jscall-id=\"166\">RayMakie loads GLTF/GLB models and automatically maps their PBR materials to Hikari equivalents. Emissive texture maps create area lights that both glow and illuminate the scene. The Christmas tree decorations below are lit entirely by their own emissive maps; the quadcopter model was provided by <a href=\"https://juliahub.com\" data-jscall-id=\"167\">JuliaHub</a>:</p><h3 data-jscall-id=\"170\">Geant4: Particle Detector Visualization</h3><p data-jscall-id=\"171\"><a href=\"https://github.com/JuliaHEP/Geant4.jl\" data-jscall-id=\"172\">Geant4.jl</a> provides Julia bindings to the CERN Geant4 particle physics simulation toolkit. The CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid) detector at CERN is one of the largest and most complex scientific instruments ever built. RayMakie can load the full detector geometry from GDML files, apply a quadrant cut to reveal internal structure, and render the result with physically-based metal materials (gold, copper, silver, aluminum, iron).</p><p data-jscall-id=\"182\">The detector meshes are generated from Geant4's tessellated polyhedra with crease-angle vertex splitting for smooth normals on curved barrel surfaces while preserving hard edges at structural boundaries.</p><h3 data-jscall-id=\"183\">Black Hole: Custom GPU Materials</h3><p data-jscall-id=\"184\">One of the most powerful aspects of building a ray tracer in Julia is that users can define entirely new physics by subtyping . The black hole demo demonstrates this: a custom  struct implements gravitational lensing by overriding  to bend light rays according to the Schwarzschild metric. The accretion disk is an emissive volumetric density field with temperature-dependent coloring, hotter near the event horizon, cooler at the outer edge.</p><p data-jscall-id=\"188\">Because Julia's multiple dispatch compiles these custom methods directly into the GPU kernels alongside the built-in materials, there is no performance penalty for user-defined physics. The same wavefront path tracer handles standard glass and metals alongside relativistic spacetime curvature.</p><p data-jscall-id=\"191\">The black hole can also be explored interactively. RayMakie's interactive mode progressively refines the path-traced image while you move the camera in real time:</p><p data-jscall-id=\"195\">An overlay renderer composites rasterized elements (lines, text, wireframes) on top of the ray-traced image, so Makie's standard 2D overlays like legends, colorbars, and annotations work alongside path tracing. The interactive window can also target individual subscenes and axes, so you can place a ray-traced view next to other plots in a GLMakie figure. Looking ahead, this overlay renderer has the potential to grow into a full pure-Julia GPU-accelerated rasterizer, which could eventually replace OpenGL as Makie's primary rendering backend.</p><p data-jscall-id=\"197\">RayMakie is available as a Makie backend. To render any existing Makie scene with ray tracing:</p><pre data-jscall-id=\"198\"><code data-jscall-id=\"199\">\nusing RayMakie, Hikari\n\n# Build your scene with standard Makie\nscene = Scene(size=(800, 600), lights=[SunSkyLight(Vec3f(1, 2, 8))])\ncam3d!(scene)\nmesh!(scene, my_geometry; material=Hikari.Gold())\n\n# Render with path tracing\nimg = colorbuffer(scene;\n    device=AMDGPU.ROCBackend(),\n    integrator=Hikari.VolPath(samples=100, max_depth=12),\n)</code></pre><p data-jscall-id=\"200\">For interactive exploration, use <code data-jscall-id=\"201\">RayMakie.interactive_window</code> to progressively refine the image while adjusting the camera in real time.</p><ul data-jscall-id=\"203\"><li data-jscall-id=\"204\"><p data-jscall-id=\"205\">: GPU memory is currently allocated eagerly and not released early, making it easy to run out of VRAM on complex scenes.

      "content": "\n<p>I'm building a commercial macOS app with Electrobun [1]. I have previously written the same app with Tauri. I'll say that, while I love Tauri, using Electrobun has been an absolute breeze. I got the same app done in roughly 70% of the time [2]. It's a very productive stack. In no small part due to Electrobun, but also the fact that Bun has tons of DX niceties and a builtin bundler.<p>Electrobun lets you open/manipulate/close webview windows and communicate with them using typed rpc. It also handles building, code signing, and notarization.<p>And because I'm using Bun, running an HMR + React + Tailwind server is just one command (`bun ./index.html`) or like 5 lines of code. Pass --console and the webview's console.log()s get streamed to your Terminal too.<p>There's tons of other things Electrobun does that I haven't even mentioned, because I haven't interacted much with them yet. E.g. I know that it lets you show platform-native notifications, prompts/popups, etc.<p>There also is a very impressive updating mechanism that relies on a bsdiff implementation written in Zig. You just ship the deltas, so updates to very large apps are just a few KBs most of the time.<p>It's genuinely a very productive stack and impressive piece of tech.<p>[1] Not affiliated - I just like the project.<p>[2]: The API and implementation was clear, so I'll cautiously say this is not a case of \"rewrites are always faster\". In fact, the Tauri version was a rewrite too :)</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47069650\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47069650</a></p>\n<p>Points: 98</p>\n<p># Comments: 28</p>\n",

Tools like<a href=\"https://lazygit.dev\" target=\"_blank\">lazygit</a>and<a href=\"https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker\" target=\"_blank\">lazydocker</a>, powered by libraries like<a href=\"https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea\" target=\"_blank\">Bubbletea</a>,<a href=\"https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink\" target=\"_blank\">Ink</a>and<a href=\"https://github.com/Textualize/textual\" target=\"_blank\">Textual</a>, have shown that the terminal isn't just for text anymore — it's become a rich, interactive canvas.</p><p>At the same time, AI coding agents have completely changed how developers work. Tools like Claude Code, Codex and Amp are running in terminals on remote machines, generating code, running builds, and waiting for human input. Developers increasingly need to check in on these agents from wherever they are — approve a change on the train, monitor a build from the couch, or nudge an agent in the right direction while away from their desk.</p><p>And then there's<a href=\"https://ghostty.org\" target=\"_blank\">Ghostty</a>. Ghostty is our favourite terminal emulator. It's a terminal built with our own values of performance and true-to-platform native behaviour, as well as being beautiful, fast and flexible. Ghostty's terminal engine is open source and written in a way that can be embedded, which meant we could bring that same level of performance and correctness to iOS.</p><p>Over the last twelve months, we've been using all of these tools heavily. How we program has changed dramatically — we spend more time in the terminal than ever, working alongside agents, reviewing their output, and managing remote machines. At some point we realised that the app we kept reaching for on our phones didn't exist yet. So we built it. Echo is that app.</p><h2>Built for iOS, not ported to it</h2><p>We didn't want to just wrap a terminal in a WebView and ship it, or use a substandard terminal emulator. Echo is a native app, built from the ground up for iPhone and iPad. That means Metal-accelerated rendering, native Keychain integration for your SSH keys, and Face ID to keep your connections secure.</p><p>On iPhone, we spent a lot of time on the keyboard experience. There's a specially designed toolbar above the keyboard with quick keys for common terminal characters, and gesture-based arrow key movement that feels right at home on a touchscreen. It sounds like a small thing, but it makes a huge difference when you're actually trying to get work done on your phone.</p><p>On iPad, Echo really shines. Full hardware keyboard support with all the shortcuts you'd expect, Split View and Slide Over for running multiple sessions side by side, and Stage Manager support so you can resize and arrange terminal windows alongside your other apps. It's the kind of experience that makes an iPad with a keyboard feel like a genuinely capable development machine.</p><h2>A home for agents on the go</h2><p>One of the things we're most excited about is how well Echo works as an interface for AI coding agents. Echo's minimal, distraction-free UI turns out to be the perfect environment for this — you SSH into your machine, attach to a tmux session, and you're right back where you left off with your agent.</p><p>We've been using Echo ourselves to interact with Claude Code, Codex, and others — and it's genuinely changed how we think about those workflows. Being able to approve a file change or review a diff from your phone feels like a superpower. The complex TUI interfaces that these agents present — syntax-highlighted code, interactive diffs, progress indicators — they all render beautifully because of Ghostty's terminal engine underneath.</p><p>If you know us from<a href=\"https://replay.software/sleeve\">Sleeve</a>, you know we care about customization. Echo ships with a curated collection of terminal themes so you can make your terminal feel like yours. We've hand-picked some classics and some fresh options, and we'll be adding more over time.</p><p>Echo is available today on the App Store for iPhone and iPad, for a one-time purchase of $2.99. No subscriptions, no in-app purchases — just the way we like it.</p><p>This is a really exciting release for us. Echo represents something new for Replay — our first step into iOS, and into a space that's evolving incredibly fast. We have a lot of ideas for where to take Echo next, and we can't wait to share them with you.</p><p>If you have any questions, feedback, or just want to say hi, you can always reach us at<a href=\"https://replay.software/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3a494f4a4a55484e7a485f4a565b431449555c4e4d5b485f\"></a>. We'd love to hear what you think.</p>",

      "content": "Hi HN,<p>I built it for two reasons:</p><p>1. To play around with different ways of interacting with a LLM. Instead of a standard chat conversation, the LLM returns question forms the user can directly interact with (and use to continue the conversation with the LLM).</p><p>2. Because I thought it would be cool to have a site dedicated to interactive educational content instead of purely consuming content (which I do too much).</p><p>An example of a (useful-for-me) interactive conversation is: <a href=\"https://rebrain.gg/conversations/6\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://rebrain.gg/conversations/6</a>. In it I'm learning how to use the `find` bash command. (Who ever knew to exclude a directory from a look-up you need to do `find . -path &lt;path&gt; -exclude -o &lt;what you want to look for&gt;`, where `-o` stands for \"otherwise\"!)</p><p>Still very early on, so interested in and open to any feedback.</p>",

Always-on-Display, expanded support for more watches, new launcher styles, customizable quick settings, significant performance increases in parts of the User Interface, and enhancements to our synchronization clients are just some highlights of what to expect.</p><h2>Design, Usability, and App Improvements<a href=\"https://asteroidos.org/news/2-0-release/index.html#asteroidos-20-has-landed-design-usability-and-app-improvements\" name=\"asteroidos-20-has-landed-design-usability-and-app-improvements\"></a></h2><h2>Performance and System Enhancements<a href=\"https://asteroidos.org/news/2-0-release/index.html#asteroidos-20-has-landed-performance-and-system-enhancements\" name=\"asteroidos-20-has-landed-performance-and-system-enhancements\"></a></h2><ul><li><p>Significant performance improvements have been made to the User Interface, resulting in smoother animations and transitions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Battery Life Improvements</strong>Various optimizations have been implemented to extend battery life during daily use.</p></li><li><p>Numerous bug fixes and stability improvements have been applied across the system.</p></li></ul><p>Since 1.0 we added support for the following watches:</p><ul><li>Fossil Gen 4 Watches (firefish/ray)</li><li>Fossil Gen 5 Watches (triggerfish)</li><li>Fossil Gen 6 Watches (hoki)</li><li>Huawei Watch 2 (sawfish/sawshark)</li><li>MTK6580 (harmony/inharmony)</li><li>Ticwatch C2+ &amp; C2 (skipjack)</li><li>Ticwatch Pro, Pro 2020 and LTE (catfish/catfish-ext/catshark)</li><li>Ticwatch Pro 3 (rover/rubyfish)</li></ul><p>And partial support for the following watches:</p><ul><li>Casio WSD-F10/F20 (koi, ayu) - bricking have been reported on some watches</li><li>LG Watch Urbane 2 (nemo) - missing too many features</li><li>Moto 360 1st gen (minnow) - has underwhelming performance, it is the only watch we have ported with a TI SoC.</li><li>Samsung Gear 2 (rinato) - too unstable and too bad power management</li><li>Samsung Gear Live (sprat) - in an unusable state due to persistent display issues</li></ul><p>We have created an \"Experimental\" category in our watch gallery for the above 5 watches since we do not consider those suitable for daily use. We will however continue to provide install images for these watches, and we welcome new contributors with fresh ideas to help improve support! We also continue to monitor supported watches and for example recently demoted the Sony Smartwatch 3 (tetra) due to unresolved hardware support issues.</p><p>The Samsung Gear 2 (rinato) is our first watch supported with a mainline Linux kernel and therefore without the use of libhybris. The Asus Zenwatch 2 (sparrow) also has very basic support for running on a mainline Linux kernel.</p><p>For a complete list of supported devices and installation instructions, please visit our <a href=\"https://asteroidos.org/install/\">installation guide</a>.</p><p>Apart from adding new watches, the community has also been actively enhancing the support for our existing range of watches.\nVisit our newly created <a href=\"https://asteroidos.org/install/features/\">feature matrix page</a> to find out about the detailed support level for your watch.</p><p>This release would not have been possible without the dedicated efforts of our community contributors. We extend our heartfelt thanks to everyone who reported issues, submitted patches, and provided feedback during the development cycle.</p><p>Over the years, the AsteroidOS community has expanded its reach, with community translators adding over 20 languages to the <a href=\"https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/asteroidos/#languages\">AsteroidOS Weblate</a>. Translating into your local language is the easiest way to get involved. Your help is most valuable to make AsteroidOS fit for use in your region.</p><p>Watchface creation has been a popular community activity lately. We are happy to present the new and comprehensive <a href=\"https://asteroidos.org/wiki/watchfaces-creation/\">watchfaces creation and design guide</a>. It is garnished with testing and deployment scripts to simplify the process further. \nOur community came up with funny and beautiful new watchfaces. Those are all collected in the <a href=\"https://github.com/AsteroidOS/unofficial-watchfaces\">unofficial watchfaces repository</a>.</p><p>moWerk has contributed a variety of watchfaces. Two highlights are the minimalistic <a href=\"https://youtu.be/cXeWRX6N6Sg\">pulsedot</a> and a classic Monty Python inspired <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eLtMosen/status/1403642123338014722\">silly walks watchface</a>.</p><p>Dodoradio worked on a few unusual watches, like the <a href=\"https://asteroidos.org/install/narwhal/\">LG Watch W7</a> with its physical hands to be taken into account. And the <a href=\"https://github.com/AsteroidOS/meta-smartwatch/pull/140\">Casio WSD-FXX series</a> sporting multifunctional secondary displays. Along with some more conventional ports such as the Fossil Gen5 and Polar M600. For watches with GPS, he contributed a <a href=\"https://git.dodorad.io/dodoradio/asteroid-map/about\">Map app with waypoint functionality</a> to the community repository. His initial version of the often requested <a href=\"https://git.dodorad.io/dodoradio/asteroid-health\">asteroid-health</a> app is already capable of automatically tracking steps and heartrate with minimal impact on battery life.</p><p>PostmarketOS now offers our launcher and core apps, thanks to postmarketOS developer PureTryOut, who moved our buildsystem from qmake to cmake along the way.</p><p>The program <a href=\"https://github.com/AsteroidOS/lcd-tools\">lcd-tools</a> by lecris and MagneFire was originally developed to control the secondary LCD on the TicWatch Pro. And got extended by dodoradio and beroset to make use of many more features the Casio secondary displays offer.</p><p>MagneFire, jrt, moWerk and beroset joined the AsteroidOS team.</p><ul><li>A <a href=\"https://asteroidos.org/faq/\">FAQ</a> section has been added to provide a quick overview of our project.</li><li>The Install page has grown into a gallery of supported watches over time with now 30 watches listed. We renamed it to \"<a href=\"https://asteroidos.org/watches/\">Watches</a>\" and plan to evolve this page into a purchase guide to aid new users in choosing a supported watch. A first step was to resize the images of all watches to correctly reflect the relative size differences between them, to be able to compare their dimensions.</li><li>The <a href=\"https://asteroidos.org/wiki/documentation/\">Documentation</a> pages are frequently updated by community members and nicely keep up with the current state of development. We recently moved them into a MediaWiki. This enables users without deeper knowledge to contribute to the documentation much more easily.</li></ul><p>With 2.0 we introduce a community repository, to improve discoverability and simplify the installation of precompiled packages, while building the foundation for a possible graphical software center in the future. Currently, the repository consists of a few debugging tools, community watchfaces, games and emulators. Developers are welcome to create pull requests on the <a href=\"https://github.com/AsteroidOS/meta-asteroid-community\">meta-community</a> repo for packaging.</p><p>After moving our infrastructure to a larger server, we have seen an increase in the frequency of nightly releases. However, it is worth noting that completely rebuilding all packages for all 30 watch system images still takes almost a week. Therefore, we can expect the nightlies to be ready on weekends. </p><p>Interested in contributing to AsteroidOS? Whether you're a developer, designer, or enthusiast, there are many ways to get involved:</p><ul><li><strong>Contribute to the codebase</strong> by tackling open issues or developing new features.</li></ul><p>Your participation helps make AsteroidOS better for everyone.</p><p>Ready to experience the latest features and improvements? Download AsteroidOS 2.0 from our <a href=\"https://asteroidos.org/watches/\">official website</a> and follow the installation instructions for your device.</p><p>Thank you for your continued support. We hope you enjoy AsteroidOS 2.0!</p><p>As you might have noticed, the current releases linked on the installation pages have feature parity with the 2.0 release. At some point, we decided to switch from our stable 1.0 release to a quasi 1.1 nightly rolling release, as the 1.0 release became too old to maintain. In the future, we would like to change our release cycle to offer more frequent stable releases. A stable release will always be stable. But not too old to no longer be maintainable.</p><p>For the future, we are going to set up a roadmap for features we would like to see in an eventual next release.\nBased on recent early community work, we might see features like:</p><ul><li>Combined fitness app (Privacy minded heart rate monitoring and step counter tracking)</li><li>WiFi setup via the settings app</li><li>Web based Watchface creation tool</li><li>App store for making community contributions easily available</li></ul><div>Written by AsteroidOS Team on the 17/02/2026</div>",

While this is OK in e.g., GoLang, it is quite annoying in TypeScript. First, because of the more powerful type system (it's easier to guess that updated_at is a date than it is to guess whether it's nullable or not), second, because of idiosyncrasies (INT4s are deserialised as JS numbers, but INT8s are deserialised as strings).</p><p>So I wrote pg-typesafe, with the goal of it being the less burdensome: you call queries exactly the same way as you would call node-pg, and they are fully typed.</p><p>It's very new, but I'm already using it in a large-ish project, where it found several bugs and footguns, and also allowed me to remove many manual type definitions.</p>",

      "content": "\n<p>13 years ago, we launched Watsi.org with a Show HN [1].<p>For nearly a year, this community drove so much traffic that we couldn’t list patients fast enough. Then pg saw us on HN, wrote us our first big check, and accepted us as the first YC nonprofit (W13). The next few years were a whirlwind.<p>I was a young, naive founder with just enough experience to know I wanted Watsi to be more efficient, transparent, and innovative than most nonprofits. We spent 24/7 talking to users and coding. We did things that don’t scale. We tried our best to be walking, talking pg essays.<p>Over the years we learned that product/market fit is different for nonprofits. Not many people wake up and think, \"I'd love to donate to a nonprofit today\" with the same oomph that they think, \"I'd love a coffee\" or \"I'd like to make more money.\"<p>No matter how much effort we put into fundraising, donations grew linearly, while requests for care grew exponentially. I felt caught in the middle. After investing everything I had, I eventually burned out and transitioned to the board.<p>I made a classic founder mistake and intertwined my self-worth with Watsi's success. I believed that if I could somehow help every patient, I was a good person, but if I let down some patients, which became inevitable, I was a bad person.<p>This was exacerbated by seeing our for-profit YC batch mates raise massive rounds. I felt like a failure for not scaling Watsi faster, but eventually we accepted reality and set Watsi on more of a slow, steady, and sustainable trajectory.<p>Now that I have perspective, I'm incredibly proud of what the org has accomplished and grateful to everyone who has done a tour of duty to support us. Watsi donors have donated over $20M to fund 33,241 surgeries, and we have a good shot of helping patients for a long time to come.<p>In a world of fast growth and fast crashes, here's a huge thank you to the HN users who have stuck by Watsi, or any other important cause, even when it's not on the front page. I believe it embodies the best of humanity. Thanks HN!<p>[1] <a href=\"http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4424081\">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4424081</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47049824\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47049824</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1119</p>\n<p># Comments: 111</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>The book page links to a blog post that explains how I got about it (and \nhas a link to sample content), but the TL&DR is that I could not find \na lot of books that were on \"our\" history _and_ were larded with technical \ndetails. So I set about writing one, and some five years later I'm happy \nto share the result. I think it's one of the few \"computer history\" books that has tons of code, but correct me if I'm wrong (I wrote this both to tell a story and to learn :-)).<p>My favorite languages are Smalltalk and Lisp, but as an Emacs user, I've been \nusing the latter for much longer and for my current projects, Common Lisp is a better fit, so I call myself \"a Lisp-er\" these days. If people like what I did, \nI do have plans to write some more (but probably only after I retire, writing next to a full-time job is heard). Maybe on Smalltalk, maybe on computer networks - two topics close to my heart.<p>And a shout-out to Dick Gabriel, he contributed some great personal memories about the man who started it all, John McCarthy.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47048733\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47048733</a></p>\n<p>Points: 246</p>\n<p># Comments: 99</p>\n",

Box was a US Forest Ranger in Northern California, and I've got his daily work diary from 1927-1945, through the depression, WWII, Conservation Corps, and lots of forest fires. I've scanned the entire thing, had Claude help with transcription, indexing, and web site building, and put the whole thing here:<p><a href=\"https://forestrydiary.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://forestrydiary.com/</a><p>This is one of those projects I've sat on for years, but with Claude and Mistral helping with the handwriting recognition, and even helping me write a custom scanning app that would auto scan each page and put it into a database as I assembled everything.<p>As far as I know, this is the only US Forestry Diary that has been fully scanned in and published. I understand that there are other diaries in some collections, but none have been scanned in. I hope this helps somebody. Please let me know if it does.<p>This is the sort of project Claude and AI can help with - A personal project that sits on the shelf forever, but now a reasonable project that can be published in my spare time.  I'm not trying to earn money on this, but just improving our knowledge and history just a little bit.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47041836\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47041836</a></p>\n<p>Points: 120</p>\n<p># Comments: 29</p>\n",

So I'm sharing.<p>This is an open & unconventional textbook covering maths, computing, and artificial intelligence from the ground up. For curious practitioners seeking deeper understanding, not just survive an exam/interview.<p>To ambitious students, an early careers or experts in adjacent fields looking to become cracked AI research engineers or progress to PhD, dig in and let me know your thoughts.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47036063\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47036063</a></p>\n<p>Points: 88</p>\n<p># Comments: 26</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>Fun little side project I built after learning about circuit bending in cameras for intentional glitch effect. It is browser based camera toy where you \"rewire\" CCD pin pairs, turn knobs to get different glitch artefacts in real time to capture as photos. I had fun learning to simulate different pin modes - channel split, hue/phase shifts, horizontal clock delays, colour kill etc.<p>Here are some photos taken: <a href=\"https://glitchycam.com/gallery\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://glitchycam.com/gallery</a><p>I intentionally leaned towards skeuomorphic design for nostalgia. I miss the days where I'd spend hours making a button to look like a physical button. Here I chose to make it look like a \"good enough\" Teenage Engineering device UI.<p>I tested/used GPT-5.3-Codex to build this from scratch, since there was a lot of hype around it on X. Maybe I wasn’t using it right, but I found it needed a lot of code cleanup at every step and a lot of hand holding along the way. It missed details/nuances and didn't land the skeuomorphic buttons or the interaction polish. It mostly helped with boilerplate where there wasn't much thinking/detailing. It did give a basic starting point for the effect calculations, but didn't really move the needle on the details.<p>Please give it a go and let me know what you think - your photos and video never leave your browser (you can download them if you choose to). Everything is processed locally in your browser (works offline), nothing is uploaded or seen by anyone.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47033954\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47033954</a></p>\n<p>Points: 169</p>\n<p># Comments: 22</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>Hi everyone,<p>I run a generative AI infra company, unified API for 600+ models. Our team started deploying AI agents for our marketing and lead gen ops: content, engagement, analytics across multiple X accounts.<p>OpenClaw worked fine for single agents. But at ~14 agents across 6 accounts, the problem shifted from \"how do I build agents\" to \"how do I manage them.\"<p>Deployment, monitoring, team isolation, figuring out which agent broke what at 3am. Classic orchestration problem.<p>So I built klaw, modeled on Kubernetes:\nClusters — isolated environments per org/project\nNamespaces — team-level isolation (marketing, sales, support)\nChannels — connect agents to Slack, X, Discord\nSkills — reusable agent capabilities via a marketplace<p>CLI works like kubectl:\nklaw create cluster mycompany\nklaw create namespace marketing\nklaw deploy agent.yaml<p>I also rewrote from Node.js to Go — agents went from 800MB+ to under 10MB each.<p>Quick usage example: I run a \"content cluster\" where each X account is its own namespace. Agent misbehaving on one account can't affect others. Adding a new account is klaw create namespace [account] + deploy the same config. 30 seconds.<p>The key differentiator vs frameworks like CrewAI or LangGraph: those define how agents collaborate on tasks. klaw operates one layer above — managing fleets of agents across teams with isolation and operational tooling. You could run CrewAI agents inside klaw namespaces.<p>Happy to answer questions.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47025478\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47025478</a></p>\n<p>Points: 60</p>\n<p># Comments: 44</p>\n",

You deploy lightweight connectors that bridge to specific resources (private web apps, SSH, databases, CIDR ranges). Admins delegate resource-access to specific users and roles. It uses WireGuard with NAT hole-punching for peer-to-peer connections and traffic goes directly between the user and connector instead of through a central server. It supports native clients (Mac/Windows/Linux/iOS/Android) plus identity-aware, browser-based access when a client isn’t required.<p>Pangolin has a cloud and is optionally self-hosted. The Community Edition is AGPLv3. The Enterprise Edition is also open-source under the commercial license which enables free personal/small business use.<p>Everything, from the server to the clients, is fully open-source and you can even self-host the whole stack. We’d love to hear what you think and I'm happy to answer any questions!</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47022745\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47022745</a></p>\n<p>Points: 79</p>\n<p># Comments: 26</p>\n",

Off Grid is an open-source app that puts that hardware to work. Text generation, image generation, vision AI, voice transcription — all running on your phone, all offline, nothing ever uploaded.<p>That means you can use AI on a flight with no wifi. In a country with internet censorship. In a hospital where cloud services are a compliance nightmare. Or just because you'd rather not have your journal entries sitting in someone's training data.<p>The tech: llama.cpp for text (15-30 tok/s, any GGUF model), Stable Diffusion for images (5-10s on Snapdragon NPU), Whisper for voice, SmolVLM/Qwen3-VL for vision.

We wanted something that gives security teams (and curious individuals) an immediate, visual picture of what's happening right now.\nWhat it does:<p>Live dashboard with severity distribution across ~63k tracked threats (critical, high, medium, low)\nInteractive heat map showing geographic threat concentration, with a European focus\nReal-time threat feed with search, filtering by CVE, type, severity, country, and tags\nTimeline view for trend analysis with custom date ranges\n100% AI enrichment – every threat entry gets contextualized analysis, impact assessment, and actionable recommendations\nCommunity submissions – anyone can submit incident reports or vulnerability write-ups for AI triage\nAPI + integrations (webhooks, Slack, email alerts, SIEM/MISP routing) for automation<p>The free tier gives you full access to the dashboard, threat database, map, and feeds. The lifetime upgrade unlocks custom feeds, automations, and API access for piping data into your own security stack.\nWe're a small team based in Riga, Latvia. Would love feedback from the HN security community – what feeds or features would make this more useful for your workflow?</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47018888\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47018888</a></p>\n<p>Points: 223</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>Hey HN! I was a long-time Arc browser user and loved how its sidebar organized tabs and bookmarks into workspaces. I wanted to switch to other browsers without losing that workflow. So I built Arcmark, it's a macOS bookmark manager (Swift/AppKit) that floats as a sidebar attached to any browser window. It uses macOS accessibility API to follow the browser window around.<p>You get workspace-based links/bookmarks organization with nested folders, drag-and-drop reordering, and custom workspace colors. For the most part I tried replicating Arc's sidebar UX as close as possible.<p>1. Local-first: all data lives in a single JSON file ( ~/Library/Application Support/Arcmark/data.json). No accounts, no cloud sync.<p>2. Works with any browser: Chrome, Safari, Brave, Arc, etc. Or use it standalone as a bookmark manager with a regular window.<p>3. Import pinned tab and spaces from Arc: it parses Arc's  StorableSidebar.json to recreate the exact workspace/folder structure.<p>4. Built with swift-bundler rather than Xcode.<p>There's a demo video in the README showing the sidebar attachment in action.\nThe DMG is available on the releases page (macOS 13+), or you can build from source.<p>This is v0.1.0 so it's a very early version. Would appreciate any feedback or thoughts<p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/Geek-1001/arcmark\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/Geek-1001/arcmark</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47016058\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47016058</a></p>\n<p>Points: 92</p>\n<p># Comments: 21</p>\n",

I've been diving deep into Data Engineering, especially in the context of Large Language Models (LLMs).<p>The Problem:\nI found that learning resources for modern data engineering are often fragmented and scattered across hundreds of medium articles or disjointed tutorials. It's hard to piece everything together into a coherent system.<p>The Solution:\nI decided to open-source my learning notes and build them into a structured book. My goal is to help developers fast-track their learning curve.<p>Key Features:<p>LLM-Centric: Focuses on data pipelines specifically designed for LLM training and RAG systems.<p>Scenario-Based: Instead of just listing tools, I compare different methods/architectures based on specific business scenarios (e.g., \"When to use Vector DB vs. Keyword Search\").<p>Hands-on Projects: Includes full code for real-world implementations, not just \"Hello World\" examples.<p>This is a work in progress, and I'm treating it as \"Book-as-Code\". I would love to hear your feedback on the roadmap or any \"anti-patterns\" I might have included!<p>Check it out:<p>Online: <a href=\"https://datascale-ai.github.io/data_engineering_book/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://datascale-ai.github.io/data_engineering_book/</a><p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/datascale-ai/data_engineering_book\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/datascale-ai/data_engineering_book</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47008163\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47008163</a></p>\n<p>Points: 248</p>\n<p># Comments: 31</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>I've been working on CloudRouter, a skill + CLI that gives coding agents like Claude Code and Codex the ability to start cloud VMs and GPUs.<p>When an agent writes code, it usually needs to start a dev server, run tests, open a browser to verify its work. Today that all happens on your local machine. This works fine for a single task, but the agent is sharing your computer: your ports, RAM, screen. If you run multiple agents in parallel, it gets a bit chaotic. Docker helps with isolation, but it still uses your machine's resources, and doesn't give the agent a browser, a desktop, or a GPU to close the loop properly. The agent could handle all of this on its own if it had a primitive for starting VMs.<p>CloudRouter is that primitive — a skill that gives the agent its own machines. The agent can start a VM from your local project directory, upload the project files, run commands on the VM, and tear it down when it's done. If it needs a GPU, it can request one.<p><pre><code>  cloudrouter start ./my-project\n  cloudrouter start --gpu B200 ./my-project\n  cloudrouter ssh cr_abc123 \"npm install && npm run dev\"\n</code></pre>\nEvery VM comes with a VNC desktop, VS Code, and Jupyter Lab, all behind auth-protected URLs. When the agent is doing browser automation on the VM, you can open the VNC URL and watch it in real time. CloudRouter wraps agent-browser [1] for browser automation.<p><pre><code>  cloudrouter browser open cr_abc123 \"http://localhost:3000\"\n  cloudrouter browser snapshot -i cr_abc123\n  # → @e1 [link] Home  @e2 [link] Settings  @e3 [button] Sign Out\n  cloudrouter browser click cr_abc123 @e2\n  cloudrouter browser screenshot cr_abc123 result.png\n</code></pre>\nHere's a short demo: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/SCkkzxKBcPE\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/SCkkzxKBcPE</a><p>What surprised me is how this inverted my workflow. Most cloud dev tooling starts from cloud (background agents, remote SSH, etc) to local for testing. But CloudRouter keeps your agents local and pushes the agent's work to the cloud. The agent does the same things it would do locally — running dev servers, operating browsers — but now on a VM. As I stopped watching agents work and worrying about local constraints, I started to run more tasks in parallel.<p>The GPU side is the part I'm most curious to see develop. Today if you want a coding agent to help with anything involving training or inference, there's a manual step where you go provision a machine. With CloudRouter the agent can just spin up a GPU sandbox, run the workload, and clean it up when it's done. Some of my friends have been using it to have agents run small experiments in parallel, but my ears are open to other use cases.<p>Would love your feedback and ideas.

To see what actually happened, I was forced to use `--verbose`, which floods the terminal with unreadable JSON and system prompts.<p>I wanted a middle ground: *Full observability without the noise.*<p>`claude-devtools` is a local Electron app that tails the session logs in `~/.claude/` to reconstruct the execution trace in real-time.<p>*Unlike wrappers, it solves the visibility gap in your native terminal workflow:*\n1.  *Real Diffs:* It shows inline diffs (red/green) the moment files are edited, instead of just a checkmark.\n2.  *Context Forensics:* It breaks down token usage by File vs Tool Output vs Thinking (so you know exactly why your context window is full).\n3.  *Agent Trees:* It visualizes sub-agent execution paths which are usually interleaved and confusing in the CLI.<p>It’s 100% local, and works with the logs already on your machine.

Ralph made many contributions to the royalty-free media ecosystem, whether it was as a project lead on Theora, serving as release manager for multiple Xiph libraries or maintaining Xiph infrastructure that has been used across the industry by codec engineers and researchers[2].\nHe was also the first to ship Rust code in Firefox[3] during his time at Mozilla, which was a major milestone for both the language and Firefox itself.<p>Ralph was a great contributor, a kind colleague and will be greatly missed.<p>Official Announcement: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7427730451626262530\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7427730...</a><p>[1]: <a href=\"http://www.wizards-of-os.org/archiv/sprecher/g_h/ralph_giles.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.wizards-of-os.org/archiv/sprecher/g_h/ralph_giles...</a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https://media.xiph.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://media.xiph.org/</a><p>[3]: <a href=\"https://medium.com/mozilla-tech/deploying-rust-in-a-large-codebase-7e50328074e8\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://medium.com/mozilla-tech/deploying-rust-in-a-large-co...</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46996490\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46996490</a></p>\n<p>Points: 506</p>\n<p># Comments: 27</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>Hey HN. I'm Fabien, principal engineer, 25 years shipping production systems (Ruby, Swift, now Rust). I built Moltis because I wanted an AI assistant I could run myself, trust end to end, and make extensible in the Rust way using traits and the type system. It shares some ideas with OpenClaw (same memory approach, Pi-inspired self-extension) but is Rust-native from the ground up. The agent can create its own skills at runtime.<p>Moltis is one Rust binary, 150k lines, ~60MB, web UI included. No Node, no Python, no runtime deps. Multi-provider LLM routing (OpenAI, local GGUF/MLX, Hugging Face), sandboxed execution (Docker/Podman/Apple Containers), hybrid vector + full-text memory, MCP tool servers with auto-restart, and multi-channel (web, Telegram, API) with shared context. MIT licensed. No telemetry phoning home, but full observability built in (OpenTelemetry, Prometheus).<p>I've included 1-click deploys on DigitalOcean and Fly.io, but since a Docker image is provided you can easily run it on your own servers as well. I've written before about owning your content (<a href=\"https://pen.so/2020/11/07/own-your-content/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://pen.so/2020/11/07/own-your-content/</a>) and owning your email (<a href=\"https://pen.so/2020/12/10/own-your-email/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://pen.so/2020/12/10/own-your-email/</a>). Same logic here: if something touches your files, credentials, and daily workflow, you should be able to inspect it, audit it, and fork it if the project changes direction.<p>It's alpha. I use it daily and I'm shipping because it's useful, not because it's done.<p>Longer architecture deep-dive: <a href=\"https://pen.so/2026/02/12/moltis-a-personal-ai-assistant-built-in-rust/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://pen.so/2026/02/12/moltis-a-personal-ai-assistant-bui...</a><p>Happy to discuss the Rust architecture, security model, or local LLM setup.

      "content": "\n<p>Hey y’all, Kartik, Ishaan, and Christian from Omnara (<a href=\"https://www.omnara.com/\">https://www.omnara.com/</a>) here. We’re building a web and mobile agentic IDE for Claude Code and Codex that lets you run and interact with coding agents from anywhere. Omnara lets you run Claude Code and Codex sessions on your own machine, and exposes those sessions through a web and mobile interface so you can stay involved even when you’re away from your desk. Think of it like Claude Code Desktop or Conductor, except you can continue your sessions on your phone.<p>Here’s a demo of the web and mobile apps - <a href=\"https://youtu.be/R8Wmy4FLbhQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/R8Wmy4FLbhQ</a><p>We started using Claude Code early last year and quickly ran into a pattern: agents could work for long stretches on their own, but progress would stall whenever they needed follow-up input. If that happened while we were away from our desks, everything just paused. We looked at remote agent solutions like Codex Web and Devin, which were the main options at the time, but they ran in remote VMs, and we wanted our coding agent to run in our own environment. Our first attempt at solving this was a lightweight wrapper that streamed messages from the Claude Code CLI to a mobile app, but that approach ended up being fragile and hard to maintain.<p>As the Claude Agent SDK matured, it gave us enough control to rewrite Omnara from scratch and run the agent loop directly. We chose to build a GUI across web and mobile instead of a TUI or CLI, because we think GUIs are generally more ergonomic for working with agents and code, especially on mobile. We still preserve the main strength of CLIs and TUIs: running anywhere, including on headless machines.<p>Omnara keeps that property by running a small headless daemon on the user’s machine (or a remote VM) that hosts the agent loop. The daemon maintains an authenticated, outbound WebSocket connection to our server, which relays messages between the agent running on the user’s machine and any connected web or mobile clients. Because the daemon only makes outbound connections, there’s no need for exposed ports, SSH access, or tunneling on the user’s machine.<p>In our first version of Omnara, users liked that agent sessions ran in their own environment, but they still depended on the machine staying online. Some users ran Omnara on a remote machine that stayed up, which worked well for them, though most still did most of their work on laptops. In the current version, Omnara can continue an agent session in a hosted remote sandbox when your local machine goes offline.<p>The conversation state of an agent is already persisted on our server, and you can optionally enable cloud syncing for the working code. When syncing is enabled, Omnara creates git commits at each turn in the conversation and pushes them to our server, so execution can resume from the same state regardless of whether it continues locally or in the cloud. If you continue working in a remote sandbox, you can later pull any changes back into your local environment when you return to your machine. Environment parity in the sandbox isn’t perfect yet, but in practice, missing dependencies are usually easy to resolve by asking the agent to install them.<p>Another thing we learned from using the initial version of Omnara is that mobile is fine for quick interactions, but not great for extended back-and-forth. Users asked for a hands-free way to keep agents moving while walking, driving, or doing something else, which led us to add a voice agent. Coming from more traditional software engineering backgrounds, we honestly thought coding by talking to a voice agent would be gimmicky and added it mostly as a fallback.<p>What surprised us is how useful the voice agent ended up being in practice. When working with coding agents, being redundant and overly explicit usually helps, and people naturally give more detail when speaking than when typing. Going back and forth with the agent as the conversation unfolds tends to produce a much more solid plan than trying to one-shot it with a prompt (this could technically also be done over text, but talking and iterating over voice feels easier and more natural). It’s also just fun. Talking through an idea with an agent while out on a walk is a lot more enjoyable than staring at a terminal screen.<p>To try it out, open your terminal and download Omnara with<p><pre><code>  curl -fsSL https://omnara.com/install/install.sh | bash\n</code></pre>\nthen run omnara inside any git repository. This starts a headless Claude Code or Codex session in that repo, which immediately appears in the Omnara web and mobile apps. From there, you can continue that session or start new ones remotely (with or without worktrees) and switch between the web and mobile clients without interrupting the agent.<p>Omnara is free for 10 agent sessions per month, then $20/month for unlimited sessions. When agents run in your own environment, you can use your existing Claude or Codex subscription, so there’s no need to pay us for additional tokens. If you use Claude Code or Codex, we’d love to hear your feedback on Omnara!</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46991591\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46991591</a></p>\n<p>Points: 131</p>\n<p># Comments: 144</p>\n",

Hologram compiles Elixir to JavaScript to run in the browser, enabling full-stack development in pure Elixir - and soon, Local-First applications.<p>This release is a milestone for our porting initiative. 49 contributors ported 150 Erlang functions across 19 modules, pushing client-side Erlang runtime coverage from 34% to 96% and overall Elixir standard library readiness from 74% to 87%.<p>This means the vast majority of Elixir standard library functions needed for full-stack web and basic local-first apps now work in the browser - string processing, collections, sets, binary operations, Unicode normalization, math, time operations, file path handling, and more.<p>Beyond porting, the release includes enhancements, bug fixes, and infrastructure groundwork.<p>Happy to answer any questions!</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46982943\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46982943</a></p>\n<p>Points: 77</p>\n<p># Comments: 19</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>Hi HN,<p>I’m Vincent from Aden. We spent 4 years building ERP automation for construction (PO/invoice reconciliation). We had real enterprise customers but hit a technical wall: Chatbots aren't for real work. Accountants don't want to chat; they want the ledger reconciled while they sleep. They want services, not tools.<p>Existing agent frameworks (LangChain, AutoGPT) failed in production - brittle, looping, and unable to handle messy data. General Computer Use (GCU) frameworks were even worse. My reflections:<p>1. The \"Toy App\" Ceiling & GCU Trap\nMost frameworks assume synchronous sessions. If the tab closes, state is lost. You can't fit 2 weeks of asynchronous business state into an ephemeral chat session.<p>The GCU hype (agents \"looking\" at screens) is skeuomorphic. It’s slow (screenshots), expensive (tokens), and fragile (UI changes = crash). It mimics human constraints rather than leveraging machine speed. Real automation should be headless.<p>2. Inversion of Control: OODA > DAGs\nTraditional DAGs are deterministic; if a step fails, the program crashes. In the AI era, the Goal is the law, not the Code. We use an OODA loop to manage stochastic behavior:<p>- Observe: Exceptions are observations (FileNotFound = new state), not crashes.<p>- Orient: Adjust strategy based on Memory and - Traits.<p>- Decide: Generate new code at runtime.<p>- Act: Execute.<p>The topology shouldn't be hardcoded; it should emerge from the task's entropy.<p>3. Reliability: The \"Synthetic\" SLA\nYou can't guarantee one inference ($k=1$) is correct, but you can guarantee a System of Inference ($k=n$) converges on correctness. Reliability is now a function of compute budget. By wrapping an 80% accurate model in a \"Best-of-3\" verification loop, we mathematically force the error rate down—trading Latency/Tokens for Certainty.<p>4. Biology & Psychology in Code\n\"Hard Logic\" can't solve \"Soft Problems.\" We map cognition to architectural primitives:\nHomeostasis: Solving \"Perseveration\" (infinite loops) via a \"Stress\" metric. If an action fails 3x, \"neuroplasticity\" drops, forcing a strategy shift.\nTraits: Personality as a constraint. \"High Conscientiousness\" increases verification; \"High Risk\" executes DROP TABLE without asking.<p>For the industry, we need engineers interested in the intersection of biology, psychology, and distributed systems to help us move beyond brittle scripts. It'd be great to have you roasting my codes and sharing feedback.<p>Repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/adenhq/hive\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/adenhq/hive</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46979781\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46979781</a></p>\n<p>Points: 106</p>\n<p># Comments: 36</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>I've been building a tool that changes how LLM coding agents explore codebases, and I wanted to share it along with some early observations.<p>Typically claude code globs directories, greps for patterns, and reads files with minimal guidance. It works in kind of the same way you'd learn to navigate a city by walking every street. You'll eventually build a mental map, but claude never does - at least not any that persists across different contexts.<p>The Recursive Language Models paper from Zhang, Kraska, and Khattab at MIT CSAIL introduced a cleaner framing. Instead of cramming everything into context, the model gets a searchable environment. The model can then query just for what it needs and can drill deeper where needed.<p>coderlm is my implementation of that idea for codebases. A Rust server indexes a project with tree-sitter, builds a symbol table with cross-references, and exposes an API. The agent queries for structure, symbols, implementations, callers, and grep results — getting back exactly the code it needs instead of scanning for it.<p>The agent workflow looks like:<p>1. `init` — register the project, get the top-level structure<p>2. `structure` — drill into specific directories<p>3. `search` — find symbols by name across the codebase<p>4. `impl` — retrieve the exact source of a function or class<p>5. `callers` — find everything that calls a given symbol<p>6. `grep` — fall back to text search when you need it<p>This replaces the glob/grep/read cycle with index-backed lookups. The server currently supports Rust, Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, and Go for symbol parsing, though all file types show up in the tree and are searchable via grep.<p>It ships as a Claude Code plugin with hooks that guide the agent to use indexed lookups instead of native file tools, plus a Python CLI wrapper with zero dependencies.<p>For anecdotal results, I ran the same prompt against a codebase to \"explore and identify opportunities to clarify the existing structure\".<p>Using coderlm, claude was able to generate a plan in about 3 minutes. The coderlm enabled instance found a genuine bug (duplicated code with identical names), orphaned code for cleanup, mismatched naming conventions crossing module boundaries, and overlapping vocabulary. These are all <i>semantic</i> issues which clearly benefit from the tree-sitter centric approach.<p>Using the native tools, claude was able to identify various file clutter in the root of the project, out of date references, and a migration timestamp collision. These findings are more consistent with methodical walks of the filesystem and took about 8 minutes to produce.<p>The indexed approach did better at catching semantic issues than native tools and had a key benefit in being faster to resolve.<p>I've spent some effort to streamline the installation process, but it isn't turnkey yet. You'll need the rust toolchain to build the server which runs as a separate process. Installing the plugin from a claude marketplace is possible, but the skill isn't being added to your .claude yet so there are some manual steps to just getting to a point where claude could use it.<p>Claude continues to demonstrate significant resistance to using CodeRLM in exploration tasks. Typically to use you will need to explicitly direct claude to use it.<p>---<p>Repo: github.com/JaredStewart/coderlm<p>Paper: Recursive Language Models <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24601\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24601</a> — Zhang, Kraska, Khattab (MIT CSAIL, 2025)<p>Inspired by: <a href=\"https://github.com/brainqub3/claude_code_RLM\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/brainqub3/claude_code_RLM</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46974515\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46974515</a></p>\n<p>Points: 79</p>\n<p># Comments: 37</p>\n",

Something you can actually see and reason about, instead of just tailing logs.<p>So we built Clawe, a small coordination layer on top of OpenClaw that lets agent workflows run, pause, retry, and hand control back to a human at specific points.<p>This started as an experiment in how agent systems might feel to operate, but we're starting to see real potential for it, especially for content review and maintenance workflows in marketing.

      "url": "https://github.com/pretzelai/stripe-no-webhooks",
      "date": 1770743688,
      "author": "prasoonds",
      "guid": 44265,
      "unread": true,
      "content": "\n<p>Hey HN, stripe-no-webhooks is an open-source library that syncs your Stripe payments data to your own Postgres database:\n<a href=\"https://github.com/pretzelai/stripe-no-webhooks\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/pretzelai/stripe-no-webhooks</a>.<p>Here's a demo video: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/cyEgW7wElcs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/cyEgW7wElcs</a><p>Why is this useful? (1) You don't have to figure out which webhooks you need or write listeners for each one. The library handles all of that. This follows the approach of libraries like dj-stripe in the Django world (<a href=\"https://dj-stripe.dev/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://dj-stripe.dev/</a>). (2) Stripe's API has a 100 rpm rate limit. If you're checking subscription status frequently or building internal tools, you'll hit it. Querying your own Postgres doesn't have this problem. (3) You can give an AI agent read access to the stripe.* schema to debug payment issues—failed charges, refunds, whatever—without handing over Stripe dashboard access. (4) You can join Stripe data with your own tables for custom analytics, LTV calculations, etc.<p>It creates a webhook endpoint in your Stripe account to forward webhooks to your backend where a webhook listener stores all the data into a new <i>stripe.*</i> schema. You define your plans in TypeScript, run a sync command, and the library takes care of creating Stripe products and prices, handling webhooks, and keeping your database in sync. We also let you backfill your Stripe data for existing accounts.<p>It supports pre-paid usage credits, account wallets and usage-based billing. It also lets you generate a pricing table component that you can customize. You can access the user information using the simple API the library provides:<p><pre><code>  billing.subscriptions.get({ userId });\n  billing.credits.consume({ userId, key: \"api_calls\", amount: 1 });\n  billing.usage.record({ userId, key: \"ai_model_tokens_input\", amount: 4726 });\n</code></pre>\nEffectively, you don't have to deal with either the Stripe dashboard or the Stripe API/SDK any more if you don't want to. The library gives you a nice abstraction on top of Stripe that should cover ~most subscription payment use-cases.<p>Let's see how it works with a quick example. Say you have a billing plan like Cursor (the IDE) used to have: $20/mo, you get 500 API completions + 2000 tab completions, you can buy additional API credits, and any additional usage is billed as overage.<p>You define your plan in TypeScript:<p><pre><code>  {\n    name: \"Pro\",\n    description: \"Cursor Pro plan\",\n    price: [{ amount: 2000, currency: \"usd\", interval: \"month\" }],\n    features: {\n      api_completion: {\n        pricePerCredit: 1,              // 1 cent per unit\n        trackUsage: true,               // Enable usage billing\n        credits: { allocation: 500 },\n        displayName: \"API Completions\",\n      },\n      tab_completion: {\n        credits: { allocation: 2000 },\n        displayName: \"Tab Completions\",\n      },\n    },\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThen on the CLI, you run the `init` command which creates the DB tables + some API handlers. Run `sync` to sync the plans to your Stripe account and create a webhook endpoint. When a subscription is created, the library automatically grants the 500 API completion credits and 2000 tab completion credits to the user. Renewals and up/downgrades are handled sanely.<p>Consume code would look like this:<p><pre><code>  await billing.credits.consume({\n    userId: user.id,\n    key: \"api_completion\",\n    amount: 1,\n  });\n</code></pre>\nAnd if they want to allow manual top-ups by the user:<p><pre><code>  await billing.credits.topUp({\n    userId: user.id,\n    key: \"api_completion\",\n    amount: 500,     // buy 500 credits, charges $5.00\n  });\n</code></pre>\nSimilarly, we have APIs for wallets and usage.<p>This would be a lot of work to implement by yourself on top of Stripe. You need to keep track of all of these entitlements in your own DB and deal with renewals, expiry, ad-hoc grants, etc. It's definitely doable, especially with AI coding, but you'll probably end up building something fragile and hard to maintain.<p>This is just a high-level overview of what the library is capable of. It also supports seat-level credits, monetary wallets (with micro-cent precision), auto top-ups, robust failure recovery, tax collection, invoices, and an out-of-the-box pricing table.<p>I vibe-coded a little toy app for testing: <a href=\"https://snw-test.vercel.app\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://snw-test.vercel.app</a>. There's no validation so feel free to sign up with a dummy email, then subscribe to a plan with a test card: 4242 4242 4242 4242, any future expiry, any 3-digit CVV.<p>Screenshot: <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/demo-screenshot-Rh6Ucqx\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://imgur.com/a/demo-screenshot-Rh6Ucqx</a><p>Feel free to try it out! If you end up using this library, please report any bugs on the repo.

      "content": "\n<p>Hi HN,<p>AI agents that can run tools on your machine are powerful for knowledge work, but they’re only as useful as the context they have. Rowboat is an open-source, local-first app that turns your work into a living knowledge graph (stored as plain Markdown with backlinks) and uses it to accomplish tasks on your computer.<p>For example, you can say \"Build me a deck about our next quarter roadmap.\" Rowboat pulls priorities and commitments from your graph, loads a presentation skill, and exports a PDF.<p>Our repo is <a href=\"https://github.com/rowboatlabs/rowboat\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/rowboatlabs/rowboat</a>, and there’s a demo video here: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AWoGo-L16I\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AWoGo-L16I</a><p>Rowboat has two parts:<p>(1) A living context graph: Rowboat connects to sources like Gmail and meeting notes like Granola and Fireflies, extracts decisions, commitments, deadlines, and relationships, and writes them locally as linked and editable Markdown files (Obsidian-style), organized around people, projects, and topics. As new conversations happen (including voice memos), related notes update automatically. If a deadline changes in a standup, it links back to the original commitment and updates it.<p>(2) A local assistant: On top of that graph, Rowboat includes an agent with local shell access and MCP support, so it can use your existing context to actually do work on your machine. It can act on demand or run scheduled background tasks. Example: “Prep me for my meeting with John and create a short voice brief.” It pulls relevant context from your graph and can generate an audio note via an MCP tool like ElevenLabs.<p>Why not just search transcripts? Passing gigabytes of email, docs, and calls directly to an AI agent is slow and lossy. And search only answers the questions you think to ask. A system that accumulates context over time can track decisions, commitments, and relationships across conversations, and surface patterns you didn't know to look for.<p>Rowboat is Apache-2.0 licensed, works with any LLM (including local ones), and stores all data locally as Markdown you can read, edit, or delete at any time.<p>Our previous startup was acquired by Coinbase, where part of my work involved graph neural networks. We're excited to be working with graph-based systems again. Work memory feels like the missing layer for agents.<p>We’d love to hear your thoughts and welcome contributions!</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46962641\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46962641</a></p>\n<p>Points: 204</p>\n<p># Comments: 56</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>A year ago, we launched Distr here to help software vendors manage customer deployments remotely. We had agents that pulled updates, a hub with a GUI, and a lot of assumptions about what on-prem deployment needed.<p>It turned out things get messy when your software is running in places you can't simply SSH into.<p>Over the last year, we’ve also helped modernize a lot of home-baked solutions: bash scripts that email when updates fail, Excel sheets nobody trusts to track customer versions, engineers driving to customer sites to fix things in person, debug sessions over email (“can you take a screenshot of the logs and send it to me?”), customers with access to internal AWS or GCP registries because there was no better option, and deployments two major versions behind that nobody wants to touch.<p>We waited a year before making our first breaking change, which led to a major SemVer update—but it was eventually necessary. We needed to completely rewrite how we manage customer organizations. In Distr, we differentiate between vendors and customers. A vendor is typically the author of a software / AI application that wants to distribute it to customers. Previously, we had taken a shortcut where every customer was just a single user who owned a deployment. We’ve now introduced customer organizations. Vendors onboard customer organizations onto the platform, and customers own their internal user management, including RBAC. This change obviously broke our API, and although the migration for our cloud customers was smooth, custom solutions built on top of our APIs needed updates.<p>Other notable features we’ve implemented since our first launch:<p>- An OCI container registry built on an adapted version of <a href=\"https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/</a>, directly embedded into our codebase and served via a separate port from a single Docker image. This allows vendors to distribute Docker images and other OCI artifacts if customers want to self-manage deployments.<p>- License Management to restrict which customers can access which applications or artifact versions. Although “license management” is a broadly used term, the main purpose here is to codify contractual agreements between vendors and customers. In its simplest form, this is time-based access to specific software versions, which vendors can now manage with Distr.<p>- Container logs and metrics you can actually see without SSH access. Internally, we debated whether to use a time-series database or store all logs in Postgres. Although we had to tinker quite a bit with Postgres indexes, it now runs stably.<p>- Secret Management, so database passwords don’t show up in configuration steps or logs.<p>Distr is now used by 200+ vendors, including Fortune 500 companies, across on-prem, GovCloud, AWS, and GCP, spanning health tech, fintech, security, and AI companies. We’ve also started working on our first air-gapped environment.<p>For Distr 3.0, we’re working on native Terraform / OpenTofu and Zarf support to provision and update infrastructure in customers’ cloud accounts and physical environments—empowering vendors to offer BYOC and air-gapped use cases, all from a single platform.<p>Distr is fully open source and self-hostable: <a href=\"https://github.com/distr-sh/distr\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/distr-sh/distr</a><p>Docs: <a href=\"https://distr.sh/docs\">https://distr.sh/docs</a><p>We’re YC S24. Happy to answer questions about on-prem deployments and would love to hear about your experience with complex customer deployments.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46958742\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46958742</a></p>\n<p>Points: 101</p>\n<p># Comments: 29</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>Hi HN — I’m the developer of NetViews, a macOS utility I built because I wanted better visibility into what was actually happening on my wired and wireless networks.<p>I live in the CLI, but for discovery and ongoing monitoring, I kept bouncing between tools, terminals, and mental context switches. I wanted something faster and more visual, without losing technical depth — so I built a GUI that brings my favorite diagnostics together in one place.<p>About three months ago, I shared an early version here and got a ton of great feedback. I listened: a new name (it was PingStalker), a longer trial, and a lot of new features. Today I’m excited to share NetViews 2.3.<p>NetViews started because I wanted to know if something on the network was scanning my machine. Once I had that, I wanted quick access to core details—external IP, Wi-Fi data, and local topology. Then I wanted more: fast, reliable scans using ARP tables and ICMP.<p>As a Wi-Fi engineer, I couldn’t stop there. I kept adding ways to surface what’s actually going on behind the scenes.<p>Discovery & Scanning:\n* ARP, ICMP, mDNS, and DNS discovery to enumerate every device on your subnet (IP, MAC, vendor, open ports).\n* Fast scans using ARP tables first, then ICMP, to avoid the usual “nmap wait”.<p>Wireless Visibility:\n* Detailed Wi-Fi connection performance and signal data.\n* Visual and audible tools to quickly locate the access point you’re associated with.<p>Monitoring & Timelines:\n* Connection and ping timelines over 1, 2, 4, or 8 hours.\n* Continuous “live ping” monitoring to visualize latency spikes, packet loss, and reconnects.<p>Low-level Traffic (but only what matters):\n* Live capture of DHCP, ARP, 802.1X, LLDP/CDP, ICMP, and off-subnet chatter.\n* mDNS decoded into human-readable output (this took months of deep dives).<p>Under the hood, it’s written in Swift. It uses low-level BSD sockets for ICMP and ARP, Apple’s Network framework for interface enumeration, and selectively wraps existing command-line tools where they’re still the best option. The focus has been on speed and low overhead.<p>I’d love feedback from anyone who builds or uses network diagnostic tools:\n- Does this fill a gap you’ve personally hit on macOS?\n- Are there better approaches to scan speed or event visualization that you’ve used?\n- What diagnostics do you still find yourself dropping to the CLI for?<p>Details and screenshots: <a href=\"https://netviews.app\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://netviews.app</a>\nThere’s a free trial and paid licenses; I’m funding development directly rather than ads or subscriptions. Licenses include free upgrades.<p>Happy to answer any technical questions about the implementation, Swift APIs, or macOS permission model.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46955712\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46955712</a></p>\n<p>Points: 242</p>\n<p># Comments: 61</p>\n",
