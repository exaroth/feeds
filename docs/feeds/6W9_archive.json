      "content": "<p>The  has once again retreated from its controversial <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/09/chat-control-back-menu-eu-it-still-must-be-stopped-0\">Chat Control proposal</a>, a plan that would have required widespread scanning of encrypted messages. The withdrawal by the current  represents yet another chapter in a long-running battle between privacy advocates and lawmakers who believe they can compromise encryption in the name of public safety. While this latest defeat is a victory for digital rights, the fight is far from over, and the <em>fundamental misunderstanding of encryption technology</em> continues to plague policy discussions across Europe.</p><svg viewBox=\"0 0 800 400\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"></svg><h2>A zombie proposal that refuses to die</h2><p>Since its introduction in 2022, Chat Control has become what privacy advocates call a , repeatedly resurrected despite consistent opposition from civil society, technical experts, and the public. The <strong>Electronic Frontier Foundation</strong> and <a href=\"https://www.globalencryption.org/2024/05/joint-statement-on-the-dangers-of-the-may-2024-council-of-the-eu-compromise-proposal-on-eu-csam/\">more than 80 civil society organizations</a> have strongly opposed the legislation, which would mandate client-side scanning of encrypted communications under the guise of combating child sexual abuse material.</p><p>The pattern has become predictable. EU lawmakers introduce the proposal, claiming it includes safeguards for privacy. Technical experts explain why those safeguards are illusory. Public pressure mounts. The proposal is withdrawn or modified. Then, after a brief hiatus, it returns with minor tweaks, and the cycle begins anew. This latest withdrawal by the  follows the same script, but the underlying issues remain unresolved.</p><p>What makes this particularly frustrating is that the fundamental problem with Chat Control has never been addressed. The proposal seeks to create what privacy experts call a “backdoor” into encryption, allowing authorities to scan messages before they’re encrypted or after they’re decrypted. Proponents argue this preserves encryption while enabling content moderation, but this reveals a <em>dangerous misunderstanding</em> of how encryption actually works. Creating any mechanism to access encrypted content inherently weakens the entire system, making it vulnerable not just to authorized access but to malicious actors as well.</p><h2>The technical impossibility of “safe” scanning</h2><p>The core issue with Chat Control and similar proposals lies in a fundamental misunderstanding of encryption technology. End-to-end encryption works because only the sender and recipient possess the keys to decrypt messages. Any third party, whether a government agency or a tech company, cannot read the contents. This is not a design choice but a mathematical certainty that ensures the security of billions of communications daily.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/11/why-adding-client-side-scanning-breaks-end-end-encryption\">Client-side scanning</a>, the technical approach favored by Chat Control advocates, attempts to circumvent this limitation by analyzing messages on users’ devices before encryption or after decryption. While this might sound like a clever workaround, it fundamentally breaks the security model of encryption. If a device can scan and report on message content, so can malware, hackers, or authoritarian governments who might compel tech companies to expand the scope of scanning.</p><p>Security researchers have repeatedly demonstrated that there is <em>no way to create a scanning system</em> that only works for “good guys.”  learned this lesson the hard way in 2021 when it proposed a similar system for detecting child abuse imagery in iCloud photos. The backlash from security experts was swift and devastating, forcing the company to abandon the plan. The same security vulnerabilities that would enable Chat Control would inevitably be exploited by malicious actors, putting everyone at greater risk.</p><svg viewBox=\"0 0 800 500\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"></svg><p>Moreover, the scope creep inherent in surveillance technologies is well documented. A system initially designed to detect illegal content could easily be expanded to monitor political dissent, religious expression, or any other communication governments deem problematic. <strong>Countries around the world</strong> are watching the EU’s actions closely. If Chat Control were to pass, it would set a dangerous precedent that authoritarian regimes would eagerly exploit, claiming they’re simply following Europe’s lead in implementing “reasonable” content moderation.</p><h2>Public pressure and the power of resistance</h2><p>The withdrawal of Chat Control demonstrates the <em>critical importance of sustained public engagement</em> in technology policy. Unlike previous instances where technical proposals sailed through legislative processes with little public awareness, this fight has been characterized by unprecedented mobilization from civil society organizations, technology companies, security researchers, and ordinary citizens concerned about their digital rights.</p><p>Organizations like the <strong>Electronic Frontier Foundation</strong>, , and numerous national privacy advocacy groups have played a crucial role in educating the public about the risks of Chat Control. Their efforts have included detailed technical explanations, legal analysis, and coordination of opposition campaigns that have reached millions of Europeans. This groundswell of opposition has made it politically toxic for lawmakers to support the proposal, at least in its current form.</p><p>The effectiveness of this resistance offers important lessons for future policy battles. First, technical expertise matters. When security researchers speak with a unified voice about the impossibility of safe backdoors, it becomes harder for politicians to dismiss concerns as alarmist. Second, coalition-building across different sectors strengthens opposition. When <a href=\"https://edri.org/our-work/chat-control-what-is-actually-going-on/\">civil liberties groups</a>, tech companies, and individual users all oppose a policy, it suggests the problems are real and widespread. Third, sustained pressure is essential because, as Chat Control demonstrates, bad proposals rarely die on the first attempt.</p><p>However, this victory should be tempered with realism. The forces pushing for Chat Control have not given up, and the underlying political dynamics that gave rise to the proposal remain unchanged. Politicians face genuine pressure to be seen as “doing something” about online harms, particularly regarding child safety. Until alternative approaches that don’t compromise encryption gain political traction, proposals like Chat Control will continue to resurface.</p><h2>The path forward requires education and alternatives</h2><p>The repeated resurrection of Chat Control points to a deeper problem in how technology policy is made. Many lawmakers genuinely believe they can have both strong encryption and government access to encrypted content. This belief persists despite unanimous opposition from the cryptographic community because the political incentives favor appearing tough on crime over understanding complex technical realities.</p><p>Breaking this cycle requires a <em>fundamental shift in how we approach online safety</em>. Rather than seeking technological magic bullets that promise security without trade-offs, policymakers need to invest in solutions that actually work. This includes better funding for law enforcement training and tools that don’t require breaking encryption, improved international cooperation on criminal investigations, and addressing the root causes of online exploitation through social programs and education.</p><p> also bear responsibility for developing and promoting genuinely privacy-preserving safety features. End-to-end encrypted platforms can implement abuse prevention measures that don’t involve content scanning, such as metadata analysis, user reporting systems, and account-level restrictions for suspicious behavior. While these approaches may be less comprehensive than mass surveillance, they achieve meaningful safety improvements without the catastrophic privacy trade-offs of backdoors.</p><p>Looking ahead, the privacy community cannot simply celebrate the withdrawal of Chat Control and move on. The next presidency of the EU Council will bring new opportunities for the proposal to resurface in yet another modified form. Sustained vigilance, continued public education, and proactive development of alternative safety measures will be essential. The fight to protect encryption is not a single battle but an ongoing campaign that requires long-term commitment from everyone who values digital privacy and security.</p><p>The withdrawal of Chat Control is a victory, but it’s a temporary one. The fundamental challenge remains: convincing policymakers that some trade-offs are not worth making, and that breaking encryption to combat illegal content creates far more problems than it solves. Until that message truly sinks in, the zombie proposal will keep rising from the grave, and the privacy community must remain ready to defeat it again and again.</p>",

      "content": "<p>SQLite is a powerful database engine, but due to its design, it has limitations that should not be overlooked.</p><p>Jellyfin has used a SQLite-based database for storing most of its data for years, but it has also encountered issues on many systems. In this blog post, I will explain how we address these limitations and how developers using SQLite can apply the same solutions.</p><p>This will be a technical blog post intended for developers and everyone wanting to learn about concurrency.</p><p>Also Jellyfin's implementation of locking for SQLite should be fairly easy to be implemented into another EF Core application if you are facing the same issue.</p><p>SQLite is a file-based database engine running within your application and allows you to store data in a relational structure.\nOverall it gives your application the means of storing structured data as a single file and without having to depend on another application to do so.\nNaturally this also comes at a price. If your application fully manages this file, the assumption must be made that your application is the sole owner of this file, and nobody else will tinker with it while you are writing data to it.</p><p>So an application that wants to use SQLite as its database needs to be the only one accessing it.\nHaving established this fact, an important thought arises: if only a single write operation should be performed on a single file at a time, this rule must also apply to operations within the same application.</p><p>SQLite has a feature that tries to get around this limitation: the Write-Ahead-Log (WAL).\nThe WAL is a separate file that acts as a journal of operations that should be applied to an SQLite file.\nThis allows multiple parallel writes to take place and get enqueued into the WAL.\nWhen another part of the application wants to read data, it reads from the actual database, then scans the WAL for modifications and applies them on the fly.\nThis is not a foolproof solution; there are still scenarios where WAL does not prevent locking conflicts.</p><p>A transaction is supposed to ensure two things.\nModifications made within a transaction can be reverted, either when something goes wrong or when the application decides it should and optionally a transaction may also block other readers from reading data that is modified within a transaction.\nThis is where it gets spicy and we come to the real reason why I am writing this blog post.\nFor some reason on some systems that run Jellyfin when a transaction takes place the SQLite engine reports the database is locked and instead of waiting for the transaction to be resolved the engine refuses to wait and just crashes.\nThis seems to be a not uncommon issue and there are many reports to be found on the issue.</p><p>The factor that makes this issue so bad is that it does not happen reliably. So far we only have one team member where this can be (somewhat) reliably be reproduced which makes this an even worse a bug.\nFrom the reports this issue happens across all operating systems, drive speeds and with or without virtualization.\nSo we do not have any deciding factor identified that even contributes to the likelihood of the issue happening.</p><p>Having established the general theory on how SQLite behaves, we also have to look at the specifics of Jellyfins usage of SQLite.\nDuring normal operations on a recommended setup (Non-Networked Storage and preferably SSD) its unusual for any problems to arise, however the way Jellyfin utilises the SQLite db up to 10.11 is very suboptimal.\nIn versions prior to 10.11 Jellyfin had a bug in its parallel task limit which resulted in exponential overscheduling of library scan operations which hammered the database engine with thousands of parallel write requests that an SQLite engine is simply not able to handle.\nWhile most SQLite engine implementations have retry behavior, they also have timeouts and checks in place to prevent limitless waiting so if we stress the engine enough, it just fails with an error.\nThat and very long running and frankly unoptimized transactions could lead to the database just being overloaded with requests and flaking out.</p><p>Since we moved the codebase over to EF Core proper, we have the tools to actually do something about this as EF Core gives us a structured abstraction level.\nEF Core supports a way of hooking into every command execution or transaction by creating <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/logging-events-diagnostics/interceptors\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Interceptors</a>.\nWith an interceptor we can finally do the straight forward idea of just \"not\" writing to the database in parallel in a transparent way to the caller.\nThe overall idea is to have multiple strategies of locking. Because all levels of synchronization will inevitably come at the cost of performance, we only want to do it when it is really necessary.\nSo, I decided on three locking strategies:</p><ol></ol><p>As a default, the no-lock behavior does exactly what the name implies. Nothing. This is the default because my research shows that for 99% all of this is not an issue and every interaction at this level will slow down the whole application.</p><p>Both the optimistic and pessimistic behaviors use two interceptors—one for transactions and one for commands—and override  in .</p><h3>Optimistic locking behavior<a href=\"https://jellyfin.org/posts/SQLite-locking/#optimistic-locking-behavior\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Optimistic locking behavior\" title=\"Direct link to Optimistic locking behavior\" translate=\"no\">​</a></h3><p>Optimistic locking means to assume the operation in question will succeed and only handle issues afterwards. In essence this can be boiled down to \"Try and Retry and Retry ...\" for a set number of times until either we succeed with the operation or fail entirely.\nThis still leaves the possibility that we will not actually be able to perform a write, but the introduced overhead is far less than the Pessimistic locking behavior.</p><p>The idea behind how this works is simple: every time two operations try to write to the database, one will always win. The other will fail, wait some time, then retry a few times.</p><p>Jellyfin uses the  library perform the retry behavior and will only retry operations it will find have been locked due to this exact issue.</p><h3>Pessimistic locking behavior<a href=\"https://jellyfin.org/posts/SQLite-locking/#pessimistic-locking-behavior\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Pessimistic locking behavior\" title=\"Direct link to Pessimistic locking behavior\" translate=\"no\">​</a></h3><p>Pessimistic locking always locks when a write to SQLite should be performed. Essentially every time an transaction is started or a write operation on the database is done though EF Core, Jellyfin will wait until all other read operations are finished and then block all other operations may they be read or write until the write in question has been performed.\nThis however means, that Jellyfin can only ever perform a single write to the database, even if it would technically does not need to.</p><p>In theory, an application should have no issue reading from table \"Alice\" while writing to table \"Bob\" however to eliminate all possible sources of concurrency related locking, Jellyfin will only ever allow a single write performed on its database in this mode.\nWhile this will absolutely result in the most stable operation, it will undoubtedly also be the slowest.</p><p>Jellyfin uses a <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/runtime-libraries/system-threading-readerwriterlockslim\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ReaderWriterLockSlim</a> to lock the operations, that means we allow an unlimited number of reads to happen concurrently while only one write may ever be done on the database.</p><h3>The future Smart locking behavior<a href=\"https://jellyfin.org/posts/SQLite-locking/#the-future-smart-locking-behavior\" aria-label=\"Direct link to The future Smart locking behavior\" title=\"Direct link to The future Smart locking behavior\" translate=\"no\">​</a></h3><p>In the future we might also consider combining both modes, to get the best of both worlds.</p><p>Initial testing showed that with both modes, we had great success in handling the underlying issue. While we are not yet sure why this happens only on some systems when others work, we at least now have an option for users previously left out of using Jellyfin.</p><p>When I was researching this topic, I found many reports all over the internet facing the same error but nobody was able to provide a conclusive explanation whats really happening here.\nThere have been similar proposals made to handle it but there wasn't a \"ready to drop in\" solution that handles all the different cases or only code that required massive modifications to every EF Core query.\nJellyfin's implementation of the locking behaviors should be a copy-paste solution for everyone having the same issues as its using interceptors and the caller has no idea of the actual locking behavior.</p>",

      "content": "<p>For years, startups have been taught to prioritize growth over everything else. Profitability was seen as unambitious or even wrong – something to worry about when you hit scale. Why focus on profits when money and valuations were easy to come by?</p><p>But that thinking was always flawed.</p><p>Profitability isn't unambitious; it's controlling your own destiny. It means you don't have to rely on investors for survival. It means you can focus on your unaltered vision and mission. And it means you as a founder decide the pace of growth. And once you experience it, it's hard to imagine doing things any other way.</p><p><a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/ramenprofitable.html\">Paul Graham famously wrote about \"ramen profitability\"</a> – the point where a founding team could survive without external funding. He argued this made startups more attractive to investors, showing they could get customers to pay, were serious about building valuable products, and were disciplined with expenses.</p><p>Graham wrote his essay in 2009. I’d argue that we now live in a world where it’s not just easier to get ramen profitable, but traditionally profitable – while also growing fast.</p><p>At Linear we didn't set out to be profitable but kind of stumbled into it. We believed that to win this market we really needed to build a superior tool. The best way we knew how to do that was to keep the team small and focused. And when we launched after a year in private beta, almost all of our 100 beta users converted to paid customers. To our surprise, we realized it wouldn't take that long to become profitable if we kept the costs in check. Twelve months after launch, we hit profitability, and we've stayed profitable ever since.</p><p>I don't know why hiring massive teams ever became the norm. In my own experience, small teams always delivered better quality, and faster. Maybe it's fear of missing out if you don't grow the team fast. Maybe it's investors whispering that your team is \"understaffed compared to benchmarks.\" Being understaffed compared to benchmarks almost always should be a source of pride, not a problem. People should be surprised how small your team is, not how big it is.</p><p>What holds you back is rarely team size – it's the clarity of your focus, skill and ability to execute. Larger teams mean slower progress, more management overhead, more meetings, more opinions, and usually dilution of vision and standards. Yet growing the team has somehow become a symbol of success.</p><p>At Linear, we hired our first employee after six months and roughly doubled the team each year. With each hire, we make sure they truly elevate the team. We don't set out to hire ten engineers – we hire the next  engineer. This intentional approach has allowed us to maintain both quality and culture.</p><p>The most underrated thing about profitability is how much peace of mind it gives you. Once you're profitable, you stop worrying about survival and focus on what really matters: building something great. Building the way you want. Instead of optimizing for the next fundraising round, you optimize for value creation.</p><p>While profitability might not come quickly for every startup, I believe it's achievable sooner than most think. If you're creating a new market, or truly require massive scale like a social network, or significant upfront investment like a hardware company, it might take longer. But if you're in a category where there isn't hard upfront investment, and you get some level of product-market fit with customers willing to pay, you can probably be profitable. You can decide to become profitable. And usually, it's a decision about how much and how fast you hire.</p><p>Revenue per employee is one of the clearest ways to see you’re hiring appropriately. While some of the best public companies benchmark at $1-2M per employee, for startups it's not unreasonable to target the range of $500k-$1M per employee.</p><p><strong>Understand Your Risk Profile</strong></p><p>Are you building something highly speculative where you're not sure if there's a market for it, or are you building something that already has a market but with a different take on it? In the former case profitability takes longer, but in the latter it could happen right away. Most software today, especially in the B2B space, is about building a modern version of something existing.</p><p><strong>Hire Intentionally and Slower</strong></p><p>For most software startups, ten people before product-market fit should be your ceiling, not your target. After PMF, every hire should address a specific, pressing need – not just fill out an org chart. At Linear, our deliberately slow headcount growth forced us to be selective, which meant making better hires. It also protected our culture, since rapid hiring often dilutes the very things that made your startup special in the first place. When you hire less, you naturally hire better.</p><p>Being profitable doesn't mean you have to be anti-investors. It means you have that choice, and investors are quite interested in profitable companies that also grow fast. You can raise more, less, or nothing. You can wait for the right timing, the right partner, or fund. For most ambitious startups, it can still be a good idea to raise something even if you could get by bootstrapping. Investors can still be helpful, and the additional cash balance can help you to make larger investments, or acquisitions.</p><p>The point is that you can be and are allowed to be profitable as a startup. It's not a bad thing, it's not an oxymoron or as hard as people make it out to be. The secret is that a lot of successful companies actually were quite profitable early on, they just didn't talk about it. When you're profitable, you make decisions based on what's best for your customers and your product, not what's best for impressing investors.</p><p>I didn't set out to build a profitable startup. But once I got there, I realized I wouldn't want to build a company any other way.</p>",

      "content": "<p>A few months back, while playing around with <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://threejs.org/\">Three.js</a>, I came across something that completely derailed my plans. Strange attractors - fancy math that creates beautiful patterns. At first I thought I'd just render one and move on, but then soon I realized that this is too much fun. When complexity emerges from three simple equations, when you see something chaotic emerge into beautiful, it's hard not to waste some time. I've spent countless hours, maybe more than I'd care to admit, watching these patterns form. I realized there's something deeply satisfying about seeing order emerge from randomness. Let me show you what kept me hooked.</p><h2><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"https://blog.shashanktomar.com/posts/strange-attractors#the-basics-dynamical-systems-and-chaos-theory\"></a>The Basics: Dynamical Systems and Chaos Theory</h2><p>Dynamical Systems are a mathematical way to understand how things . Imagine you have a system, which\ncould be anything from the movement of planets to the growth of a population. In this system, there are rules that\ndetermine how it evolves from one moment to the next. These rules tell you what will happen next based on what is\nhappening now. Some examples are, a pendulum, the weather patterns, a flock of birds, the spread of a virus in a\npopulation (we are all too familiar with this one), and stock market.</p><p>There are two primary things to understand about this system:</p><ul><li>: This is like a big collection of all the possible states the system can be in. Each state is like a\nsnapshot of the system at a specific time. This is also called the  or the .</li><li>: These are the rules that takes one state of the system and moves it to the next state. It can be\nrepresented as a function that transforms the system from now to later.</li></ul><p>For instance, when studying population growth, a phase-space (world-state) might consist of the current population size\nand the rate of growth or decline at a specific time. The dynamics would then be derived from models of population\ndynamics, which, considering factors like birth rates, death rates, and carrying capacity of the environment, dictate\nthe changes in population size over time.</p><p>Another way of saying this is that the dynamical systems describe how things change over time, in a space of\npossibilities, governed by a set of rules. Numerous fields such as biology, physics, economics, and applied mathematics,\nstudy systems like these, focusing on the specific rules that dictate their evolution. These rules are grounded in\nrelevant theories, such as Newtonian mechanics, fluid dynamics, and mathematics of economics, among others.</p><p>There are different ways of classifying dynamical systems, and one of the most interesting is the classification into\nchaotic and non-chaotic systems. The change over time in non-chaotic systems is more deterministic as compared to\nchaotic systems which exhibit randomness and unpredictability.</p><p> is the sub branch of dynamical systems that studies chaotic systems and challenges the traditional\ndeterministic views of causality. Most of the natural systems we observe are chaotic in nature, like the weather, a drop\nof ink dissolving in water, social and economic behaviours etc. In contrast, systems like the movement of planets,\npendulums, and simple harmonic oscillators are extremely predictable and non-chaotic.</p><p>Chaos Theory deals with systems that exhibit irregular and unpredictable behavior over time, even though they follow\ndeterministic rules. Having a set of rules that govern the system, and yet exhibit randomness and unpredictability,\nmight seem a bit contradictory, but it is because the rules do not always represent the whole system. In fact, most of\nthe time, these rules are an approximation of the system and that is what leads to the unpredictability. In complex\nsystems, we do not have enough information to come up with a perfect set of rules. And by using incomplete information\nto make predictions, we introduce uncertainty, which amplifies over time, leading to the chaotic behaviour.</p><p>Chaotic systems generally have many non-linear interacting components, which we partially understand (or can partially\nobserve) and which are very sensitive to small changes. A small change in the initial conditions can lead to a\ncompletely different outcome, a phenomenon known as the . In this post, we will try to see the\nbutterfly effect in action but before that, let's talk about .</p><p>To understand Strange Attractors, let's first understand what an attractor is. As discussed earlier, dynamical systems\nare all about . During this change, the system moves through different possible states (remember the\nphase space jargon?). An attractor is a set of states towards which a system tends to settle over time, or you can say,\ntowards which it is . It's like a magnet that pulls the system towards it.</p><p>For example, think of a pendulum. When you release it, it swings back and forth, but eventually, it comes to rest at the\nbottom. The bottom is the attractor in this case. It's the state towards which the pendulum is attracted.</p><p>This happens due to the system's inherent dynamics, which govern how states in the phase space change. Here are some of\nthe reasons why different states get attracted towards attractors:</p><ul><li>: Attractors are stable states of the system, meaning that once the system reaches them, it tends to stay\nthere. This stability arises from the system's dynamics, which push it towards the attractor and keep it there.</li><li>: Many dynamical systems have dissipative forces, which cause the system to lose energy over time. This\nloss of energy leads the system to settle into a lower-energy state, which often corresponds to an attractor. This is\nwhat happens in the case of the pendulum.</li><li>: In some regions of the phase space, the system's dynamics cause trajectories to converge. This\ncontraction effect means that nearby states will tend to come closer together over time, eventually being drawn\ntowards the attractor.</li></ul><p>Some attractors have complex governing equations that can create unpredictable trajectories or behaviours. These\nnonlinear interactions can result in multiple stable states or periodic orbits, towards which the system evolves. These\ncomplex attractors are categorised as . They are called \"strange\" due to their unique\ncharacteristics.</p><ol><li>: Strange attractors often have a fractal-like structure, meaning they display intricate\npatterns that repeat at different scales. This complexity sets them apart from simpler, regular attractors.</li><li><strong>Sensitive Dependence on Initial Conditions</strong>: Systems with strange attractors are highly sensitive to their initial\nconditions. Small changes in the starting point can lead to vastly different long-term behaviors, a phenomenon known\nas the \"butterfly effect\".</li><li><strong>Unpredictable Trajectories</strong>: The trajectories on a strange attractor never repeat themselves, exhibiting\nnon-periodic motion. The system's behavior appears random and unpredictable, even though it is governed by\ndeterministic rules.</li><li><strong>Emergent Order from Chaos</strong>: Despite their chaotic nature, strange attractors exhibit a form of underlying order.\nPatterns and structures emerge from the seemingly random behavior, revealing the complex dynamics at play.</li></ol><p>You can observe most of these characteristics in the visualisation. The one which is most fascinating to observe is the\nbutterfly effect.</p><blockquote><p>A butterfly can flutter its wings over a flower in China and cause a hurricane in the Caribbean.</p></blockquote><p>One of the defining features of strange attractors is their sensitivity to initial conditions. This means that small\nchanges in the starting state of the system can lead to vastly different long-term behaviors, a phenomenon known as the\n. In chaotic systems, tiny variations in the initial conditions can amplify over time, leading to\ndrastically different outcomes.</p><p>In our visualisation, let's observe this behavior on Thomas Attractor. It is governed by the following equations:</p><p>A small change in the parameter  can lead to vastly different particle trajectories and the overall shape of the\nattractor. Change this value in the control panel and observe the butterfly effect in action.</p><p>There is another way of observing the butterfly effect in this visualisation. Change the  from  to\n in the control panel and observe how the particles move differently in the two cases. The particles\neventually get attracted to the same states but have different trajectories.</p><p>This visualization required rendering a large number of particles using Three.js. To achieve this efficiently, we used a\ntechnique called . This method handles iterative updates of particle systems directly on the GPU,\nminimizing data transfers between the CPU and GPU. It utilizes two frame buffer objects (FBOs) that alternate roles: One\nstores the current state of particles and render them on the screen, while the other calculates the next state.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Setting Up Frame Buffer Objects (FBOs):</strong> We start by creating two FBOs,  and , to hold the current and\nnext state of particles. These buffers store data such as particle positions in RGBA channels, making efficient use\nof GPU resources.</p></li><li><p><strong>Shader Programs for Particle Dynamics:</strong> The shader programs execute on the GPU and apply attractor dynamics to\neach particle. Following is the attractor function which update the particle positions based on the attractor equation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Rendering and Buffer Swapping:</strong> In each frame, the shader computes the new positions based on the attractor's\nequations and stores them in the inactive buffer. After updating, the roles of the FBOs are swapped: The previously\ninactive buffer becomes active, and vice versa.</p></li></ol><p>This combination of efficient shader calculations and the ping-pong technique allows us to render the particle system.</p><p>If you have any comments, please leave them on <strong><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://github.com/shashanktomar/blog-discussion/discussions/1\">this GitHub discussions topic</a></strong>.

      "content": "<p itemprop=\"description\">Last night I had a very strange experience: About two thirds of the way through reading a Web page about myself, Tim Bray, I\n    succumbed to boredom and killed the tab. Thus my introduction to\n    <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grokipedia\">Grokipedia</a>. Here are early impressions.</p><p> · \nMy Grokipedia entry has over seven thousand words, compared to a mere 1,300 in\n    <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Bray\">my Wikipedia article</a>. It’s pretty clear how it was generated; an LLM, trained\n    on who-knows-what but definitely including that Wikipedia article and this blog, was told to go nuts.</p><p>Speaking as a leading but highly biased expert on the subject of T. Bray, here are the key take-aways:</p><p> · \nIt covers all the territory; there is no phase of my life’s activity that could possibly be encountered in combing the Web\n    that is not exhaustively covered. In theory this should be good but in fact, who cares about the details of what I worked on\n    at Sun Microsystems between 2004 and 2010? I suppose I should but, like I said, I couldn’t force myself to plod all the way\n    through it.</p><p> · \nEvery paragraph contains significant errors. Sometimes the text is explicitly self-contradictory on the face of it,\n    sometimes the mistakes are subtle enough that only I would spot them.</p><p> · \nThe writing has that LLM view-from-nowhere flat-affect semi-academic flavor. I don’t like it but the evidence suggests that\n    some people do?</p><p> · \nAll the references are just URLs and at least some of them entirely fail to support the text. Here’s an example. In\n    discussion of my expert-witness work for the FTC in their litigation against Meta concerning its acquisitions of Instagram and\n    WhatsApp, Grokipedia says:</p><blockquote><p>[Bray] opined that users' perceptions of response times in online services critically influence market\n    dynamics.</p></blockquote><p>Anyhow, I (so that you won’t have to) spent a solid fifteen minutes spelunking back and forth through that FTC doc, looking\n    for strings like “response time” and “latency” and so on. Maybe somewhere in those pages there’s support for the claim quoted\n    above, but I couldn’t find it.</p><p> · \nWikipedia, in my mind, has two main purposes: A quick visit to find out the basics about some city or person or plant or\n    whatever, or a deep-dive to find out what we  know about genetic linkages to autism or Bach’s relationship with\n    Frederick the Great or whatever.</p><p>At the moment, Grokipedia doesn’t really serve either purpose very well. But, after all, this is release 0.1, maybe we\n    should give it a chance.</p><p> · \nThe whole point, one gathers, is to provide an antidote to Wikipedia’s alleged woke bias. So I dug into that. Let’s consider\n    three examples of what I found.  First, from that same paragraph about the FTC opinion quoted above:</p><blockquote><p>While Bray and aligned progressives contend that such dominance stifles innovation by enabling predatory acquisitions and\n      reduced rivalry—evidenced by fewer startup exits in concentrated sectors—counterarguments highlight that Big Tech's scale has\n      fueled empirical gains, with these firms investing over $240 billion in U.S. R&amp;D in 2024 (more than a quarter of national\n      totals) and driving AI, cloud, and patent surges.[<a href=\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2020/06/08/Anti-monopoly\">128</a>]\n      [<a href=\"https://www.intereconomics.eu/contents/year/2025/number/2/article/big-tech-and-the-us-digital-military-industrial-complex.html\">131</a>] Six tech industries alone accounted for\n      over one-third of \n      U.S. GDP growth from 2012–2021, comprising about 9% of the \n      economy and sustaining 9.3 million jobs amid falling consumer prices and rapid technological diffusion.\n      [<a href=\"https://itif.org/publications/2023/05/30/six-tech-industries-accounted-for-more-than-one-third-of-gdp-growth-in-the-last-decade/\">132]</a> \n      [<a href=\"https://jamesmadison.org/the-united-states-is-the-leader-of-the-digital-revolution-pro-tech-policies-are-key/\">133</a>]\n      Right-leaning economists often defend consumer welfare metrics and market self-correction, warning that forced divestitures\n      risk eroding the efficiencies and investment incentives that have propelled sector productivity above 6% annual growth in key\n      areas like durable manufacturing tech.\n      [<a href=\"https://itif.org/publications/2025/09/19/five-persistent-myths-about-big-tech/\">134</a>]\n      [<a href=\"https://www.nber.org/digest/oct01/technology-and-productivity-growth?page=1&amp;perPage=50\">135</a>]</p></blockquote><p>I’ve linked the numbered citations to the indicated URLs. Maybe visit one or two of them and see what you think? Four are\n    to articles arguing, basically, that monopolies must be OK because the companies accused of it are growing really fast and\n    driving the economy. They seem mostly to be from right-wing think-tanks but I guess that’s what those think-tanks are for.  One\n    of them, #131, <cite>Big Tech and the US Digital-Military-Industrial Complex</cite>, I think isn’t helpful to the argument at\n    all. But still, it’s broadly doing what they advertise: Pushing back against “woke” positions, in this case the position that\n    monopolization is bad.</p><p>I looked at a couple of other examples.  For example, this is from the header of the Greta Thunberg article:</p><blockquote><p>While credited with elevating youth engagement on environmental issues, Thunberg's promotion of urgent, existential climate\n      threats has drawn scrutiny for diverging from nuanced empirical assessments of climate risks and adaptation capacities, as\n      well as for extending her activism into broader political arenas such as anti-capitalist and geopolitical protests.[5][6]</p></blockquote><p>Somehow I feel no urge to click on those citation links.</p><p>If Ms Thunberg is out there on the “woke” end of the spectrum, let’s flit over to the other end, namely the entry for\n    J.D. Vance, on the subject of his book .</p><blockquote><p>Critics from progressive outlets, including Sarah Smarsh in her 2018 book , faulted the memoir for\n      overemphasizing personal and cultural failings at the expense of structural economic policies, arguing it perpetuated\n      stereotypes of rural whites as self-sabotaging.[71] These objections, often rooted in institutional analyses from academia and\n      media, overlooked data on behavioral patterns like opioid dependency rates—peaking at 21.5 deaths per 100,000 in Appalachia\n      around 2016—that aligned with Vance's observations of \"deaths of despair\" precursors.[72]</p></blockquote><p>I read and enjoyed  but the citation is to a  article that doesn’t mention\n    Smarsh. As for the second sentence… my first reaction as I trudged through its many clauses, was “life’s too short”.\n    But seriously, opioid-death statistics weaken the hypothesis about structural economic issues? Don’t get it.</p><p> · \nWikipedia is,\n    <a href=\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2024/06/15/Wikipedia-Pain\">to quote myself</a>, the encyclopedia that “anyone who’s willing to\n    provide citations can edit”.\n    Grokipedia is “the encyclopedia that Elon Musk’s LLM can edit, with sketchy citations and no progressive argument left\n    un-attacked.”</p><p>So I guess it’s Working As Intended?</p>",

      "content": "<p><em>“We need to break down silos between departments and get people to collaborate better” — almost every leader everywhere.</em></p><p>Most leaders reflexively think of silos as BAD and collaboration as GOOD. This manifesto defends silos and challenges the value of collaboration.</p><h2>Increasing collaboration can do harm</h2><p>In general, you should aim to maximize collaboration  teams, and minimize collaboration  teams.</p><h3>Why maximize collaboration within teams?</h3><p>A collaborative team works together on one or two goals. Why?</p><ul><li>This maximizes <a href=\"https://www.rubick.com/communication-is-shared-state/\">shared state</a> — everyone has a common understanding of goals, progress, and who is doing what.</li><li>This gives team members a better ability to focus and coordinate their work with each other.</li><li>Team members have overlapping areas of knowledge, so they can critique each other’s work and help each other grow.</li><li>They are more innovative, because the interplay between people as they work on the same goal helps generate more diverse thinking and improve decision-making.</li><li>When someone leaves the team, the fact that others have a shared understanding of the work means the team can survive and continue to work effectively.</li><li>People can go on vacation or leave without as much disruption.</li></ul><p>Collaborative teams feel great to be a part of — everyone shares the same victories and accomplishments together. A team that doesn’t collaborate often really isn’t a team at all.</p><h3>Why minimize collaboration between teams?</h3><p>To the maximum extent possible, teams should have what they need to succeed within the borders of their team. And where that is not true, you need some structure to ensure the team can get what it needs in a way that will scale with the organization’s growth.</p><p>As companies grow, communication and dependencies proliferate. Companies start out with many-to-many communication. As they grow, the communication patterns within the company must necessarily switch to being segmented and defined. Otherwise, the communication burden on teams will grow at an exponential rate, and the increasing complexity will degrade the effectiveness of the company.</p><p>I observed an example of this at New Relic:</p><ol><li>As the engineering organization grew, we encouraged a collaborative culture and rewarded people for collaboration between teams (it was even part of our promotion criteria — you can blame that on me!).</li><li>After a few years, the increasing number of teams made it more and more difficult to manage dependencies between teams, to the point that it eventually became impossible to accomplish any large project within the organization. I know, because I was one of the “best project managers”, so I got put on many of those large projects — and they were systematically impossible to execute on. We all tried heroically to make it work, but the system was rigged — there wasn’t a way to accomplish these larger projects.</li><li>The solution to this was to eventually define the interaction models between teams, reduce dependencies, and add some <a href=\"https://www.rubick.com/product-council/?utm_source=ck-silos&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=silos\">structure to prioritization</a> and communication.</li></ol><p>Looking back in retrospect, it was as obvious as math what happened, but I see organizations fall into this trap over and over. We’ll talk more about how to structure these solutions in the second blog post in this series.</p><p>Collaboration  great, but it’s something you want to actively be combating between teams. A little collaboration is fine, but excessive collaboration between teams is a sign your organization isn’t structured well. If you ever wonder why Bezos took such a hard line on his <a href=\"https://chrislaing.net/blog/the-memo/#fn:1\">API mandate</a> in 2002, this probably factored into it. Bezos structured Amazon so that teams were as independent as possible.</p><p>Silos are boundaries between groups of people, based on the organizational structure and teams they’re working on.</p><p>Silos exist because humans have cognitive and communication limits:</p><ul><li>Humans can only handle a certain number of relationships</li><li>Humans have a limit to how much communication they can handle.</li><li>Humans are pre-wired to think in terms of teams and tribes. We work better in small groups.</li><li>Humans have cognitive limits on the amount they can focus on.</li></ul><p>It’s important to recognize that these limits are real limits, and not something you can wish away. Every company in the world (above a certain size) operates in teams that specialize. We organize into teams and have org structures generally because that is what human beings need to work in larger groups.</p><p>There are ways to flex certain aspects of this. For example, a company that is designed to be fully asynchronous can rely on process and tooling to change some of these constraints. But even then, you’re moving the constraints around, not eliminating them completely. You need to operate in a way that recognizes these limits.</p><h2>Why do leaders want to break down silos?</h2><p>Leaders start talking about breaking down silos when they see that individual parts of the company aren’t achieving larger business outcomes and are excessively focused on their own area. Alternatively, they talk about breaking down silos when parts of the company aren’t well coordinated with each other. Generally this happens once the organization has become complex enough that the structure is getting in the way.</p><p>Here are a couple of examples:</p><ul><li>Marketing is planning a major announcement of an upcoming launch, but can’t get a timing commitment from the product and engineering teams.</li><li>Two teams in engineering are building the same service, but in slightly different ways.</li></ul><p>Leaders see these things, and start blathering about “breaking down silos” and “increasing collaboration”. What’s wrong with that?</p><h2>“Breaking down silos” represents incomplete thinking</h2><p><strong>“Breaking down silos” is an exhortation rather than a diagnosis or prescription of how to improve the situation</strong>. “Breaking down silos” blames individuals for not having a big enough vision and working across boundaries, instead of looking with curiosity at the system and asking  they are doing what they’re doing. It’s expecting people to have your level of perspective without figuring out why they don’t.</p><p>But the main problem is that it isn’t specific enough.</p><h2>Communication != Collaboration != Coordination</h2><p>When you hear someone say they want teams to collaborate more or break down silos, encourage them to look at the problem from three perspectives:</p><p>Usually when people talk about collaboration, what they’re really looking for is better coordination.</p><p>Coordination is “the harmonious functioning of parts for effective results” (<a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/coordination\">Merriam-Webster</a>)</p><p>The US military found that the best way to coordinate groups of people quickly and effectively was to <a href=\"https://www.marines.mil/News/Publications/MCPEL/Electronic-Library-Display/Article/899837/mcdp-1/\">centralize coordination and decentralize decision-making and execution</a>. This is still the state of the art for organizational design. You want local groups to be able to act independently and have what they need to be successful. You want centralized functions to set high level objectives and coordinate where necessary to produce the right outcomes.</p><p>We’ll talk in the second post in this series about a multitude of ways you can coordinate groups of people working together.</p><p>Communication is transferring information from one person or group to another.</p><p>When people talk about needing increased collaboration, you can often achieve this more effectively by looking at the flow of information between people, and redesigning it. Typically, you can do something like this:</p><ol><li>Ask people how they are getting information today.</li><li>Find out what information people actually need.</li><li>Design the lightest weight version of this you can imagine.</li><li>Get feedback and act on that feedback.</li></ol><p>One thing I’ve done over and over in many startups is set up weekly communication on projects in engineering. This helps the marketing organization understand how to coordinate their work with engineering, among other benefits.</p><p>Collaboration is when people work together to produce an outcome. When teams are collaborating, it means they’re working with other teams to achieve outcomes together. That’s often a sign the team isn’t set up well. Ideally, it should have what it needs to do what it needs without dependencies on other teams.</p><p>A team that has to collaborate to achieve its objectives is going to be less reliably successful. In general, teams shouldn’t be collaborating with more than a couple of teams, unless they’re explicitly set up to be that way. For example, in some organizations you might set up the design team as a “service” organization which provides design for a larger organization. For teams that are set up that way, it can be fine, but it usually should be very carefully thought through. What is the interaction model for the team, and how will it deal with the inevitable fact that there will be excess demands on it? We’ll cover some of these patterns and their tradeoffs in the second post in this series.</p><p>Of course, the world is messy, and you shouldn’t expect a complete lack of collaboration between teams. But when you see teams collaborate, that’s something to pay attention to.</p><p>You might think of silos as “encapsulation”. Leaders want to dig into the internals of the classes holding the logic they need. But it’s a bad solution to just bolt that on — you really need to refactor things so that they are better structured.</p><h2>How do you get teams to coordinate better?</h2><p>I always appreciate hearing your thoughts and reactions to my posts.</p><p>Thank you to the many people who helped improve this post. <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rebecca--campbell/\">Rebecca Campbell</a> always makes my work better.

      "content": "<p>Libraries, digital humanities projects, and cultural heritage organizations have long had to perform a balancing act when sharing their collections online, negotiating between access and affordability. Providing robust features for data discovery, such as browsing, filtering, and search, has traditionally required dedicated computing infrastructure such as servers and databases. Ongoing server hosting, regular security and software updates, and consistent operational oversight are expensive and require skilled staff. Over years or decades, budget changes and staff turnover often strand these projects in an unmaintained or nonfunctioning state.</p><p>The alternative, static file hosting, requires minimal maintenance and reduces expenses dramatically. For example, storing gigabytes of data on Amazon S3 may cost $1/month or less. However, static hosting often diminishes the capacity for rich data discovery. Without a dynamic computing layer between the user’s web browser and the source files, data access may be restricted to brittle pre-rendered browsing hierarchies or search functionality that is impeded by client memory limits. Under such barriers, the collection’s discoverability suffers.</p><p>For years, online collection discovery has been stuck between a rock and a hard place: accept the complexity and expense required for a good user experience, or opt for simplicity and leave users to contend with the blunt limitations of a static discovery layer.</p><h2>Why We Explored a New Approach</h2><p>When LIL began thinking about how to provide discovery for the <a href=\"https://source.coop/harvard-lil/gov-data/\">Data.gov Archive</a>, we decided that building a lightweight and easily maintained access point from the beginning would be worth our team’s effort. We wanted to provide low-effort discovery with minimal impact on our resources. We also wanted to ensure that whatever path we chose would encourage, rather than impede, long-term access.</p><p>This approach builds on our recent experience when the Caselaw Access Project (CAP) hit <a href=\"https://lil.law.harvard.edu/blog/2024/03/26/transitions-for-the-caselaw-access-project/\">a transition moment</a>. At that time, we elected to switch <a href=\"http://case.law\">case.law</a> to a static site and to partner with others dedicated to open legal data to provide more feature-rich access.</p><p>CAP includes some 11 TB of data; the Data.gov Archive represents nearly 18 TB, with the catalog metadata alone accounting for about 1 GB. Manually browsing the archive data in its repository, even for a user who knows what she’s looking for, is laborious and time-consuming. Thus we faced a challenge. Could we enable dynamic, scalable discovery of the Data.gov Archive while enjoying the frugality, simplicity, and maintainability of static hosting?</p><h2>Our Experiment: Rich Discovery, No Server Required</h2><p>Recent advancements in client-side data analysis led us to try something new. Tools like <a href=\"https://duckdb.org/docs/api/wasm/\">DuckDB-Wasm</a>, <a href=\"https://phiresky.github.io/blog/2021/hosting-sqlite-databases-on-github-pages/\">sql.js-httpvfs</a>, and <a href=\"https://protomaps.com\">Protomaps</a>, powered by standards such as WebAssembly, web workers, and HTTP range requests, allow users to efficiently query large remote datasets in the browser. Rather than downloading a 2 GB data file into memory, these tools can incrementally retrieve only the relevant parts of the file and process query results locally.</p><p>We developed Data.gov Archive Search on the same model. Here’s how it works:</p><ul><li> We store Data.gov Archive catalog metadata as sorted, compressed Parquet files on Source.coop, taking advantage of performant static file hosting.</li><li> Our client-side web application loads DuckDB-Wasm, a fully functional database engine running inside the user’s browser.</li><li> When a user navigates to a resource or submits a search, our DuckDB-Wasm client executes a targeted retrieval of the data needed to fulfill the request. No dedicated server is required; queries run entirely in the browser.</li></ul><p>This experiment has not been without obstacles. Getting good performance out of this model demands careful data engineering, and the large DuckDB-Wasm binary imposes a considerable latency cost. As of this writing, we’re continuing to explore speedy alternatives like <a href=\"https://github.com/hyparam/hyparquet\">hyparquet</a> and <a href=\"https://idl.uw.edu/arquero\">Arquero</a> to further improve performance.</p><p>Still, we’re pleased with the result: an inexpensive, low-maintenance static discovery platform that allows users to browse, search, and filter Data.gov Archive records entirely in the browser.</p><h2>Why This Matters for Libraries, Digital Humanities Projects, and Beyond</h2><p>This new pattern offers a compelling model for libraries, academic archives, and DH projects of all sizes:</p><ul><li> By shifting from an expensive server to lower cost static storage, projects can sustainably offer their users access to data.</li><li><strong>Reduced technical overhead:</strong> With no dedicated backend server, security risks are reduced, no patching or upgrades are needed, and crashing servers are not a concern.</li><li> Projects can be set up with care, but without demanding constant attention. Organizations can be more confident that their archive and discovery interfaces remain usable and accessible, even as staffing or funding changes over time.</li></ul><p>Knowing that we are not the only group interested in approaching access in this way, we’re sharing our generalized learnings. We see a few ways forward for others in the knowledge and information world:</p><ul><li> If your organization has large, relatively static datasets, consider experimenting with a browser-based search tool using static hosting.</li><li> Template applications, workflows, and lessons learned can help this new pattern gain adoption and maturity across the community.</li></ul><p>This project is still evolving, and we invite others—particularly those in libraries and digital cultural heritage—to explore these possibilities with us. We’re committed to open sharing as we refine our tools, and we welcome collaboration or feedback at <a href=\"mailto:lil@law.harvard.edu\">lil@law.harvard.edu</a>.</p>",

They want control over sensitive data and to declare their independence from US-based tech providers.&nbsp;</p><p>European companies are encouraging this trend. Many of them have joined forces in the newly created non-profit foundation, the EuroStack Initiative. This foundation's goal is \" to organize action, not just talk, around the pillars of the initiative: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/euro-stack_foundation-press-release-activity-7389635091049840641-J3gZ?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAAAKH4BBvA-ZwpVFbaZDTqwLgneEpGsrHQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Buy European, Sell European, Fund European</a>.\"&nbsp;</p><p>What's the motive behind these moves away from proprietary tech? Well, in Austria's case, Florian Zinnagl, CISO of the Ministry of Economy, Energy, and Tourism (BMWET), explained, \"We carry responsibility for a large amount of sensitive data -- from employees, companies, and citizens. As a public institution, we take this responsibility very seriously. That's why we view it critically to rely on cloud solutions from non-European corporations for processing this information.\"</p><p>All of these organizations aim to keep data storage and processing within national or European borders to enhance security, comply with privacy laws such as the <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/gdpr-an-executive-guide-to-what-you-need-to-know/\">EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a>, and mitigate risks from potential commercial and foreign government surveillance.&nbsp;</p><p>Open-source software is seen as combining the virtues of faster development and better security, while providing companies and governments with more control, as general manager Thierry Carrez of the <a href=\"https://openinfra.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">OpenInfra Foundation</a> recently suggested: \"Open infrastructure allows nations and organizations to maintain control over their applications, their data, and their destiny while benefiting from global collaboration.\" &nbsp;</p><p>While the US may not like it, with NextCloud's help, BMWET completed its migration in just four months. Although BMWET had already begun adopting Microsoft 365 and <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-copilot-is-taking-over-teams-heres-how-ai-will-shape-your-daily-workflow/\">Teams</a>&nbsp;before the project's start, the shift was still considered a success. That's because instead of reversing its path, the ministry implemented a hybrid architecture: Nextcloud handles internal collaboration and secure data management, while Teams remains available for external meetings.</p><p>The project emphasized integration with existing workflows, including seamless integration with Outlook email and calendar via Sendent's Outlook app. This approach minimized disruption and ensured user acceptance. However, not all migrations progress so well.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, in Austria, the <a href=\"https://www.derstandard.de/story/3000000293383/prozentzeichen-statt-bundesadler-wie-die-justiz-ihre-it-umstellt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ministry of Justice decided to replace Office with LibreOffice</a>. Yet the transition has run into trouble. It appears that the move of 20,000 desktops, which was prompted by a desire to reduce spending on Microsoft licenses, has been, as one person reported, an \"unprofessional, rushed operation.\" Some offices are still on Office, others on LibreOffice, and they're running into incompatible document format problems and misfires in e-mail systems.&nbsp;</p><p>The moral of the story is that any switch from one software suite to another requires careful handling by the IT department and helpdesk staff. Otherwise, you end up with unhappy users.</p><p>That said, BMWET's bold shift to Nextcloud appears to have gone well. This initiative demonstrates that adopting sovereign cloud solutions can be practical, user-friendly, and rapid in the public sector. However, as Austria's Justice Ministry experience has shown, simply shifting to an open-source approach without careful planning can get in the way of getting work done.&nbsp;</p>",

      "content": "<div><p>The development of neuromorphic hardware relies on memristive devices capable of emulating synaptic behavior, with potential applications in energy-efficient computing and artificial intelligence. Recent work has explored natural, biodegradable substrates as sustainable alternatives to conventional inorganic memristors [<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0328965#pone.0328965.ref001\">1</a>]. In this study, we investigated the potential of the edible fungus  (shiitake mushroom) as a platform for memristor fabrication. By examining the electrical response of mushroom-derived materials under repeated voltage cycling, we explored stable memristive switching behavior, retention, and endurance. Shiitake-based devices not only demonstrate reproducible memory effects, but also highlight the potential for scalable, low-cost, and environmentally friendly neuromorphic components.</p></div><div><p>Memristor devices offer substantial advantages in robotic, industrial, and transport applications due to their unique electrical properties and ability to mimic neural functions. They can enhance various control systems, facilitate efficient information processing, and ultimately improve the overall performance of autonomous systems.</p><p>One of the key strengths of memristors is their capacity for efficient and self-adaptive in situ learning, which is critical for applications in robotics and autonomous vehicles. In memristor-based neural networks, the devices can adjust their resistance based on previous inputs, allowing for a form of analog learning that closely resembles the synaptic behavior in biological systems [<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0328965#pone.0328965.ref001\">1</a>]. This capability enables robots and autonomous vehicles to learn from their environment and adapt in real time, enhancing their ability to navigate complex situations effectively. It has been found that such systems can achieve low-latency responses, which are essential for high-speed decision-making in dynamic environments [<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0328965#pone.0328965.ref002\">2</a>].</p><p>Memristors also have the advantage of integrating memory and processing capabilities into a single device, enabling a simplified architecture for autonomous control systems [<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0328965#pone.0328965.ref003\">3</a>]. For instance, in autonomous vehicles, trajectory-tracking and path-following tasks can be performed using memristor-based controllers that allow for rapid calculations and real-time adjustments to control variables [<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0328965#pone.0328965.ref004\">4</a>]. This integration, especially with parallelization, helps to address the challenges posed by separate memory and processing units, which can lead to delays and increased power consumption in traditional control systems [<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0328965#pone.0328965.ref004\">4</a>].</p><p>Additionally, the resilience of memristor devices against environmental changes, and their ability to operate under varying conditions, make them particularly suitable for autonomous applications, such as spacecraft electronics or vehicles operating in unpredictable road environments [<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0328965#pone.0328965.ref004\">4</a>]. This is complemented by the precision in control that memristor-based systems can offer, which is significant for maintaining stability and performance while following desired trajectories [<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0328965#pone.0328965.ref005\">5</a>].</p><p>Moreover, the low power consumption of memristors is particularly beneficial in robotics and autonomous vehicles, where energy efficiency is paramount. Hybrid analog–digital memristor systems can minimize power usage during processing without sacrificing responsiveness, which can prolong operational times by reducing the frequency at which recharging or battery replacement is required, enhancing the feasibility of deploying such systems in mobile applications [<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0328965#pone.0328965.ref002\">2</a>].</p><p>Ultimately, the potential of memristors to emulate human-like decision-making and learning processes could be exploited to endow robotic systems and autonomous vehicles with functionalities not found in conventional control systems. The ability of memristors to perform complex computations efficiently, learn adaptively, and integrate both memory and processing into a unified approach make them a cornerstone technology for the future development of intelligent autonomous systems. However, the production of memristors often requires rare-earth minerals and expensive semiconductor foundries.</p></div><div><p>Fungi possess innate abilities to adapt to various environmental conditions and efficiently process information through their interconnected network of hyphae. These characteristics make fungi an ideal candidate for developing sustainable computing systems from. Our aim was to design and implement a novel fungal memristor-based computing architecture that could significantly reduce energy consumption and minimize electronic waste. We approached this using substantially simpler bioreactors and nutrient cultures than those required for conventional neurons and neural organoids. The unique advantages of fungal memristors stem from the biological properties of fungal materials, which distinguish them from typical inorganic or polymer alternatives [<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0328965#pone.0328965.ref006\">6</a>,<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0328965#pone.0328965.ref007\">7</a>].</p><p>First, one of the main benefits of fungal memristors is their environmentally sustainable and biodegradable nature. Conventional memristors often contain transition metal oxides or silicon-based structures, the production or disposal of which can pose environmental challenges [<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0328965#pone.0328965.ref006\">6</a>,<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0328965#pone.0328965.ref007\">7</a>]. By contrast, fungal materials are derived from organic biomass, making them both sustainable and significantly less harmful to the environment. This aligns with increasing efforts toward developing greener electronic materials, as highlighted in previous work emphasizing the importance of sustainability in technology development [<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0328965#pone.0328965.ref008\">8</a>].</p><p>Second, fungal memristors exhibit remarkable adaptability in their electrical properties. The structural composition of fungal materials often allows for a range of conductive pathways that can form dynamically under the influence of electrical stimuli, similar to the conductive filaments formed in conventional memristors [<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0328965#pone.0328965.ref009\">9</a>,<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0328965#pone.0328965.ref010\">10</a>]. This adaptability can lead to enhanced performance in neuromorphic applications through the facilitation of variable resistance states that mimic synaptic behaviors more closely than traditional memristive materials, which often have static crystalline structures that can lead to variability problems or performance limitations at the nanoscale [<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0328965#pone.0328965.ref011\">11</a>].</p><p>Furthermore, fungal memristors may consume less power than traditional materials due to their unique electrochemical properties. It has been claimed that some organic materials, including those derived from fungi, can operate effectively at lower voltages while maintaining stable switching characteristics––a trait that is crucial for developing energy-efficient devices for portable electronics and Internet of Things applications [<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0328965#pone.0328965.ref012\">12</a>]. This can significantly extend battery life and reduce energy costs in processing and memory applications, which have become focal points in the research into neuromorphic systems [<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0328965#pone.0328965.ref013\">13</a>].</p><p>Finally, the natural composition and multicellularity of fungal materials can lead to more naturalistic models for neural networks. Because these materials are subject to biological processes, they may inherently incorporate characteristics that resemble biological neuronal networks, including plasticity and memory capabilities that could evolve with usage. This biological mimicry could strengthen the development of more advanced artificial neural networks, enabling applications such as adaptive learning systems and intelligent sensor networks [<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0328965#pone.0328965.ref014\">14</a>].</p></div><div><p>The potential use of common food mushrooms, such as shiitake and button mushrooms (), as organic memristors is an emerging area of research that exploits the unique properties of these fungi [<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0328965#pone.0328965.ref006\">6</a>,<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0328965#pone.0328965.ref007\">7</a>,<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0328965#pone.0328965.ref013\">13</a>]. Memristors, which are non-volatile memory devices that retain information even without power, can benefit from the porous structures and electrical properties of the organic materials derived from mushrooms.</p><p>Shiitake mushrooms have been shown to possess a hierarchically porous carbon structure when activated. This porous structure can enhance the electrochemical performance of devices, making them suitable candidates for use in energy storage systems, including supercapacitors and, potentially, memristors [<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0328965#pone.0328965.ref015\">15</a>]. Highly conductive carbon materials have been created from shiitake, suggesting that these materials could be engineered to exhibit memristive behavior [<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0328965#pone.0328965.ref016\">16</a>]. Shiitake-derived carbon is a sustainable alternative to traditional materials and can enhance the performance of electronic devices due to its unique structural properties.</p><p>Button mushrooms have also shown significant potential in this context. Research has indicated that their porosity can be exploited to create materials with large surface areas, which are essential for the development of efficient electronic components [<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0328965#pone.0328965.ref017\">17</a>]. The synthesis of carbon composites from button mushrooms has been explored, revealing their ability to function effectively in energy storage applications [<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0328965#pone.0328965.ref017\">17</a>]. Furthermore, the integration of button mushrooms into electronic systems has been investigated, demonstrating their potential as substrates for electronic devices [<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0328965#pone.0328965.ref018\">18</a>].</p><p>In addition to their structural properties, the unique biological characteristics of fungi, including their ability to interact with various chemical compounds, can be harnessed to develop novel sensing technologies. For instance, electronic noses have been developed that use mushroom extracts to detect volatile compounds. These could be adapted for use in electronic devices that require environmental-sensing capabilities [<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0328965#pone.0328965.ref019\">19</a>,<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0328965#pone.0328965.ref020\">20</a>]. This intersection of biology and electronics opens new avenues for creating multifunctional devices that incorporate the sensory capabilities of mushrooms.</p></div><div><h3>Radiation, resistance, and resilience</h3><p>The radiation resistance of shiitake mushrooms has been studied primarily in terms of their ability to withstand and possibly derive benefits from exposure to ionizing radiation. This resistance can be attributed to several biochemical and physiological attributes. A possible factor is lentinan, a polysaccharide found in the cell walls of shiitake. Lentinan provides structural integrity and exhibits immunomodulatory effects that may enhance the mushroom’s ability to respond to environmental stresses, including radiation exposure. Although some research has suggested that lentinan possesses properties that may help mitigate oxidative stress [<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0328965#pone.0328965.ref021\">21</a>], there have been limited studies directly linking lentinan to radiation resistance in shiitake mushrooms.</p><p>Shiitake mushrooms have also shown a notable ability to adapt to their environmental conditions, including variable radiation levels. Studies involving fungi in space research have indicated that certain taxa can enhance their survival through morphological changes or increased melanin production in response to radiation [<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0328965#pone.0328965.ref022\">22</a>]. This radiation resistance implies a suitability of fungal electronics for aerospace applications, where cosmic rays and ambient radiation can interfere with conventional electronics. Fungi’s physical flexibility and low energy requirements would also be advantageous relative to conventional solutions [<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0328965#pone.0328965.ref018\">18</a>,<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0328965#pone.0328965.ref019\">19</a>]. These studies have not specifically addressed shiitake, but the general adaptability observed in fungi suggests that this species could respond similarly to such conditions.</p><p>Another example of the resilience of shiitake mushrooms is their ability to maintain their nutritional and bioactive qualities after irradiation. For example, they retain essential nutrients and bioactive compounds even after exposure to ultraviolet radiation [<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0328965#pone.0328965.ref023\">23</a>]. The high content of ergosterol, a precursor to vitamin D, found in shiitake mushrooms, reinforces their potential for beneficial outcomes following exposure to radiation because this compound can be converted into vitamin D when subjected to ultraviolet light [<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0328965#pone.0328965.ref024\">24</a>].</p><p>Lastly, shiitake mushrooms could be considered in the development of dietary supplements or functional foods that could serve a broader purpose in radioprotection. Their multirole efficacy as a food source and electrical component emphasizes a sustainable approach to utilizing biological entities that can withstand environmental stresses, including radiation. This is especially relevant in aerospace and exploration contexts, where promoting health in astronauts could reduce the risks associated with their increased radiation exposure during missions [<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0328965#pone.0328965.ref022\">22</a>]. Also, shiitake mushrooms can withstand environmental stresses, including radiation, while remaining safe for human consumption.</p><p>In summary, the radiation resistance of shiitake mushrooms is linked to the presence of protective compounds, such as lentinan, and their ability to adapt morphologically. These factors have contributed to our understanding of their survival strategies and are suggestive of potential applications in areas where radiation exposure is a significant concern, such as aerospace and radiation sensing. By culturing and evaluating the memristive properties of shiitake mushrooms, we can determine their suitability for use as sustainable, low-cost bioelectronics.</p></div>",

      "content": "<p>Nearly everyone has experienced it: After a night of poor sleep, you don’t feel as alert as you should. Your brain might seem foggy, and your mind drifts off when you should be paying attention.</p><p>A new study from MIT reveals what happens inside the brain as these momentary failures of attention occur. The scientists found that during these lapses, a wave of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flows out of the brain — a process that typically occurs during sleep and helps to wash away waste products that have built up during the day. This flushing is believed to be necessary for maintaining a healthy, normally functioning brain.</p><p>When a person is sleep-deprived, it appears that their body attempts to catch up on this cleansing process by initiating pulses of CSF flow. However, this comes at a cost of dramatically impaired attention.</p><p>“If you don’t sleep, the CSF waves start to intrude into wakefulness where normally you wouldn’t see them. However, they come with an attentional tradeoff, where attention fails during the moments that you have this wave of fluid flow,” says Laura Lewis, the Athinoula A. Martinos Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, a member of MIT’s Institute for Medical Engineering and Science and the Research Laboratory of Electronics, and an associate member of the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory.</p><p>Lewis is the senior author of the study, which <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-02098-8\" target=\"_blank\">appears today</a> in . MIT visiting graduate student Zinong Yang&nbsp;is the lead author of the paper.</p><p>Although sleep is a critical biological process, it’s not known exactly why it is so important. It appears to be essential for maintaining alertness, and it has been well-documented that sleep deprivation leads to impairments of attention and other cognitive functions.</p><p>During sleep, the cerebrospinal fluid that cushions the brain helps to remove waste that has built up during the day. In a 2019&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aax5440\" target=\"_blank\">study</a>, Lewis and colleagues showed that CSF flow during sleep follows a rhythmic pattern in and out of the brain, and that these flows are linked to changes in brain waves during sleep.</p><p>That finding led Lewis to wonder what might happen to CSF flow after sleep deprivation. To explore that question, she and her colleagues recruited 26 volunteers who were tested twice — once following a night of sleep deprivation in the lab, and once when they were well-rested.</p><p>In the morning, the researchers monitored several different measures of brain and body function as the participants performed a task that is commonly used to evaluate the effects of sleep deprivation.</p><p>During the task, each participant wore an electroencephalogram (EEG) cap that could record brain waves while they were also in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner. The researchers used a modified version of fMRI that allowed them to measure not only blood oxygenation in the brain, but also the flow of CSF in and out of the brain. They also measured each subject’s heart rate, breathing rate, and pupil diameter.</p><p>The participants performed two attentional tasks while in the fMRI scanner, one visual and one auditory. For the visual task, they had to look at a screen that had a fixed cross. At random intervals, the cross would turn into a square, and the participants were told to press a button whenever they saw this happen. For the auditory task, they would hear a beep instead of seeing a visual transformation.</p><p>Sleep-deprived participants performed much worse than well-rested participants on these tasks, as expected. Their response times were slower, and for some of the stimuli, the participants never registered the change at all.</p><p>During these momentary lapses of attention, the researchers identified several physiological changes that occurred at the same time. Most significantly, they found a flux of CSF out of the brain just as those lapses occurred. After each lapse, CSF flowed back into the brain.</p><p>“The results are suggesting that at the moment that attention fails, this fluid is actually being expelled outward away from the brain. And when attention recovers, it’s drawn back in,” Lewis says.</p><p>The researchers hypothesize that when the brain is sleep-deprived, it begins to compensate for the loss of the cleansing that normally occurs during sleep, even though these pulses of CSF flow&nbsp;come with the cost of attention loss.</p><p>“One way to think about those events is because your brain is so in need of sleep, it tries its best to enter into a sleep-like state to restore some cognitive functions,” Yang says. “Your brain’s fluid system is trying to restore function by pushing the brain to iterate between high-attention and high-flow states.”</p><p>The researchers also found several other physiological events linked to attentional lapses, including decreases in breathing and heart rate, along with constriction of the pupils. They found that pupil constriction began about 12 seconds before CSF flowed out of the brain, and pupils dilated again after the attentional lapse.</p><p>“What’s interesting is it seems like this isn’t just a phenomenon in the brain, it’s also a body-wide event. It suggests that there’s a tight coordination of these systems, where when your attention fails, you might feel it perceptually and psychologically, but it’s also reflecting an event that’s happening throughout the brain and body,” Lewis says.</p><p>This close linkage between disparate events may indicate that there is a single circuit that controls both attention and bodily functions such as fluid flow, heart rate, and arousal, according to the researchers.</p><p>“These results suggest to us that there’s a unified circuit that’s governing both what we think of as very high-level functions of the brain — our attention, our ability to perceive and respond to the world — and then also really basic fundamental physiological processes like fluid dynamics of the brain, brain-wide blood flow, and blood vessel constriction,” Lewis says.</p><p>In this study, the researchers did not explore what circuit might be controlling this switching, but one good candidate, they say, is the noradrenergic system. Recent research has shown that this system, which regulates many cognitive and bodily functions through the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, oscillates during normal sleep.</p><p>The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health, a National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Research Fellowship, a NAWA Fellowship, a McKnight Scholar Award, a Sloan Fellowship, a Pew Biomedical Scholar Award, a One Mind Rising Star Award, and the Simons Collaboration on Plasticity in the Aging Brain.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, says that technological revolutions are driven by more than just technology. They are also driven, he argues, by new ways of paying for them.</p><p>“There is always a lot of focus on technological innovation. What really drives a lot of progress is when people also figure out how to innovate on the financial model,” he recently said at the site of a data center that OpenAI is building in Abilene, Texas.</p><p>Over the last several years, Mr. Altman’s company has found unusual and creative ways of paying for the computing power needed to fuel its ambitions.</p><p>Many of the deals OpenAI has struck — with chipmakers, cloud computing companies and others — are strangely circular. OpenAI receives billions from tech companies before sending those billions back to the same companies to pay for computing power and other services.</p><p>Industry experts and financial analysts have welcomed the start-up’s creativity. But these unorthodox arrangements have also fueled concerns that OpenAI is helping to inflate a potential financial bubble as it builds what is still a highly speculative technology.</p><p>Here are unusual financial agreements helping to drive the ambitions of OpenAI, the poster child of the artificial intelligence revolution.</p><figure></figure><p>From 2019 through 2023, Microsoft was OpenAI’s primary investor. The tech giant pumped more than  into the start-up. Then OpenAI funneled most of those billions back into Microsoft, buying  needed to fuel the development of new A.I. technologies.</p><p>(The New York Times has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/27/business/media/new-york-times-open-ai-microsoft-lawsuit.html\">sued</a> OpenAI and Microsoft, claiming copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems. The two companies have denied the suit’s claims.)</p><figure></figure><p>By the summer of last year, OpenAI could not get all the computing power it wanted from Microsoft. So it started signing cloud computing contracts with other companies, including Oracle and little-known start-ups with names like CoreWeave.</p><p>Across three different deals signed this year, OpenAI agreed to pay CoreWeave, a company that builds A.I. data centers, more than  for computing power. As part of these agreements, OpenAI received  in CoreWeave stock, which could ultimately help pay for this computing power.</p><figure></figure><p>OpenAI also struggled to get the additional investment dollars it wanted from Microsoft. So, it turned to other investors. Earlier this year, the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank led a  investment in OpenAI.</p><p>At the same time, OpenAI has been working with various companies to build its own computing data centers, rather than rely on cloud computing deals. This also includes SoftBank, which is known for highly speculative technological bets that don’t always pay off. The company is raising  to help OpenAI build data centers in Texas and Ohio.</p><figure></figure><p>Similarly, Oracle, a software and cloud computing giant, has agreed to spend  building new data centers for OpenAI in Texas, New Mexico, Michigan and Wisconsin. OpenAI will then pay Oracle roughly the same amount to use these  over the next several years.</p><figure></figure><p>The United Arab Emirates was part of an OpenAI’s fund-raising round in October 2024. Now, G42, a firm with close ties to the Emirati government, is building a roughly  for OpenAI in the Emirates.</p><figure></figure><p>Last month, Nvidia announced that it intended to invest  in OpenAI over the next several years. This could help OpenAI pay for its new data centers. As OpenAI buys or leases specialized chips from Nvidia, Nvidia will pump billions back into OpenAI.</p><figure></figure><p>Two weeks later, OpenAI signed an agreement with AMD that allows OpenAI to buy up to  in the chipmaker at a penny per share. That translates to roughly a 10 percent stake in the company. This stock could supply OpenAI with additional capital as it works to build new data centers.</p><p>OpenAI pulls in billions of dollars in revenue each year from customers who pay for ChatGPT, computer programming tools and other technologies. But it still loses more money than it makes, according to a person familiar with the company’s finances.</p><p>If the company can use its new data centers to significantly improve A.I. technologies and expand its revenue over the next several years, it can become a viable business, as Mr. Altman believes it will. If technology progress stalls, OpenAI – and its many partners – could lose enormous amounts of money. Smaller companies like CoreWeave, which are taking on enormous amounts of debt to build new data centers, could go bankrupt.</p><p>In some cases, companies are hedging their bets. Nvidia and AMD, for instance, have the option of reducing the cash and stock they send to OpenAI if the A.I. market does not expand as quickly as expected. But others would be left with enormous debt, which could send ripples across the larger economy.</p>",

      "content": "<p>The talk was recorded and is available on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzTwul2Qb3g\">YouTube</a>. Taking inspiration from <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/\">Simon Willison</a>, this post is an <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2023/Aug/6/annotated-presentations/\">annotated presentation</a> containing my slides and detailed notes on them. The talk also has a lot of UI demos: for these, I’ll have a screenshot but also a link to the relevant part of the video (videos are unbeatable for UI!).</p><p>First, what is Perfetto? Perfetto is fundamentally a suite of tools: it’s not just one thing but a bunch of different tools working together to help you debug and root-cause problems. This diagram shows how everything fits together, with the core parts of the Perfetto project in the center.</p><p>The recording tools for Perfetto consist of 1) an <a href=\"https://perfetto.dev/docs/getting-started/in-app-tracing\">SDK for C++ apps</a> 2) a <a href=\"https://perfetto.dev/docs/getting-started/system-tracing\">daemon</a> that can collect data from ftrace, /proc, /sys, and various kernel interfaces 3) another <a href=\"https://perfetto.dev/docs/concepts/service-model\">daemon</a> that amalgamates trace data from multiple processes into a single trace file. These tools all speak the Perfetto <a href=\"https://perfetto.dev/docs/getting-started/converting\">protobuf format</a>, a high-performance trace format designed to be very efficient to write but not to analyze or consume directly.</p><p>That’s where the <a href=\"https://perfetto.dev/docs/analysis/trace-processor\">trace processor</a> comes in. It’s a C++ library that parses the protobuf format, but also a bunch of other widely used trace formats. It exposes this data via an SQL query interface to any embedding program including <a href=\"https://perfetto.dev/docs/visualization/perfetto-ui\">Perfetto UI</a> (which is what most of this talk is about) and also to the <a href=\"https://perfetto.dev/docs/analysis/trace-processor-python\">Python API</a> if you want to do ad-hoc scripting or analysis in Python.</p><p>There are also very common tracing/profiling formats used by the Linux community: perf.data, ftrace text format, Firefox profiler format, and many others. Perfetto <a href=\"https://perfetto.dev/docs/getting-started/other-formats\">supports</a> quite a few of those directly. There’s also the Chrome JSON format (AKA the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CvAClvFfyA5R-PhYUmn5OOQtYMH4h6I0nSsKchNAySU/preview?tab=t.0\">Trace Event Format</a>) which is a simpler interchange format. It’s not the most efficient to read or write, but it does the job for a lot of use cases.</p><p>Often people write <a href=\"https://perfetto.dev/docs/getting-started/converting\">converters</a>. They have their own tracing format, maybe proprietary, maybe open source but something we don’t know about, and it’s very common that people convert to one of the formats we understand, most commonly our protobuf or Chrome JSON formats.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://perfetto.dev/docs/visualization/perfetto-ui\">Perfetto UI</a> is fundamentally a web-based trace visualizer, combining timeline visualization, user-driven selection/aggregation, and SQL queries all in one interface. Because it has the trace processor as a backend, it works with a bunch of different trace formats.</p><p>It’s very important to note that even though the Perfetto UI is web-based, everything happens inside your browser and trace data never leaves your system. You can even <a href=\"https://perfetto.dev/docs/contributing/ui-getting-started\">build it</a> and host it yourself on any static server: we’ve made it extremely easy to do so!</p><p>At the start of 2025, we actually moved our whole development to GitHub. In the past, we used to develop on Android and GitHub was just a mirror. That’s no longer the case, GitHub is actually where we develop and take pull requests.</p><p>Most of this talk, I’m going to spend actually showing you how you can use the Perfetto UI to debug performance issues on Linux. I don’t want to show you an Android trace which needs a lot of context about how the Android system works and so you think, “oh, that was cool, but I didn’t really understand what was happening.”</p><p>So to make this talk more approachable, I wrote a <a href=\"https://github.com/LalitMaganti/fractal-renderer-vk\">straightforward demo program</a> you can look at yourself! So it’s obviously not a production system but I’ve tried to make it as representative of the sort of issues we use Perfetto for every day.</p><p>It’s a Rust program which generates a Julia set and visualizes it over time. The technologies I used: <a href=\"https://vulkano.rs/\">Vulkan</a>, GPU rendering and also multi-threaded CPU computation. So how it works is that computation of various parameters is happening on background threads, and then that’s being passed to the main thread for rendering.</p><p>And then, for demonstration purposes, there is a performance bug; rendering should run at 60 FPS, but every so often, the frame rate drops dramatically. Here’s what that looks like:</p><p>The code is on <a href=\"https://github.com/LalitMaganti/fractal-renderer-vk\">GitHub</a> and if you’re interested in following along. The traces are there as well - you don’t have to collect the traces yourself, but you can if you want. All the instructions and information is in the README.</p><p>So the first suspicion we may have is that maybe it’s some CPU problem. A lot of engineers I know would reach for perf immediately whenever they see a problem like this. The main reason is that if perf can capture the problem, they can go straight to the line of code without needing to spend time debugging using more complex approaches.</p><p>You can record a perf profile with <code>perf record -k mono -g ./fractal_renderer</code>. The standard post-processing step which I think a lot of people do would be to <a href=\"https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph\">generate</a> an SVG flame graph out of this with <code>perf script | stack-collapse-perf.pl --all | flamegraph.pl &gt; fractal-frame.svg</code>. Here’s how that looks like for our perf profile:</p><p>The flame graph shows the thread names at the bottom, and then stacked above are the call stacks of what the program is doing. The width represents how much time is spent in each function. In this case, the worker threads are spending most of their time in&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;operations, doing math computation. Exactly what you’d expect for this type of program. <em>Aside: Interestingly demangling didn’t seem to work for Rust out of the box which I find a bit unusual but I didn’t dig too much into why this was.</em></p><p>Looking at this, nothing really stands out. There’s no smoking gun that immediately reveals the problem. But here’s the fundamental limitation: the flame graph aggregates data across the entire trace, losing the time dimension. The performance problem we’re seeing happens every 2-3 seconds - brief drops in an otherwise normally functioning program.</p><p>The flame graph shows me the aggregate, dominated by the correct behavior, making it nearly impossible to spot those occasional problematic moments. So how do I find the places where it’s doing the wrong thing?</p><p>Well, that’s maybe where Perfetto can help you out a little bit! The thing I find lots of people don’t know is that perf actually  timestamp information about when samples were taken: many tools drop this information but Perfetto is pretty good at showing that to you. I just need post-process the trace with <code>perf script &gt; fractal.perftext</code> to generate a text version of the profile which we can then open in the <a href=\"https://ui.perfetto.dev\">Perfetto UI</a></p><p><em>My demo talking through how to open the perf profile and navigate it starts at <a href=\"https://youtu.be/VzTwul2Qb3g?t=551\">9:11</a> in the video.</em></p><p>The x-axis of what you’re seeing is time. And every horizontal line represents a thread: we call these lanes “tracks”. And each of the small arrowheads on the tracks are CPU samples for the associated thread.</p><p>The behavior of the worker threads over time is really interesting. Most of the lifetime of the program, it’s doing continuous computation, basically. And then there’s this period of time in the middle where there’s this very interesting staircase pattern where it seems like only one thread is running at any one time: we’ll want to keep a note of this as this is quite important.</p><p>One very cool thing about Perfetto is that it allows me to quickly generate visualizations of whatever I’m selecting on the timeline. We call this “area selection” and it’s where I drag my mouse and select a region both horizontally and vertically. This is on one track but even  multiple tracks. So in the timeline it shows me the selection I’m making at the top, plus a flame graph at the bottom representing the aggregation of the samples in just that time period.</p><p>The key advantage is that I can look at individual regions of time interactively. You can also do this with  but you need to pre-filter the data to what you’re looking for. This assumes you already know what the problem is before you find it. I always find that a bit counterintuitive. I prefer this view where I can see everything first, then decide “I want to look at this specific part in more detail.” That’s what Perfetto lets me do.</p><p>So now on to the flame graph itself: in the last year, I spent a bunch of time on improving the flame graph visualization in Perfetto UI. At Google, we have an internal tool called pprof (related to but not the same as the open-source one), and I’ve always loved the visualization it has. So I worked to make Perfetto’s flame graph look and behave very similarly.</p><p>There are a bunch of features here. You can zoom in like most flame graph, but you can also say “I only want to look at the stack starting from this point” — it gets rid of everything above and starts fresh from there. If I don’t want to see a particular function like , I can just hide the frame and it gets merged into its parent. The search is regex-based so I can also just type the specific things I’m interested in: it’s pretty powerful.</p><p>There’s also something I don’t think I’ve seen in other visualizers (I might be wrong, please do correct me!): what I call “bottom up” view. Imagine you take all the leaves across your entire program and visualize who’s calling into them. If you have a leaf function that’s called everywhere in your program but reached from many different places, it’ll be split across your flame chart. This is the inverse — you’re looking at the leaves and asking “who is calling me?” This is particularly useful when you’re trying to optimize very low-level functions that are always at the leaf level — things like memcpy or hashmap operations.</p><p>So our main takeaway is that our worker threads all had gaps in their CPU execution in a staircase pattern. This means the threads weren’t actually on the CPU and that’s usually a sign that they’re sleeping.</p><p>But sleeping on what? Locks? Disk? Network? What exactly is happening? To answer that, I need a scheduler trace to show me the wake-up patterns, who’s being scheduled when, what type of sleep threads are in, that sort of thing.</p><p>We recently added support for trace-cmd’s text format in Perfetto (<em>aside: <a href=\"https://github.com/google/perfetto/issues/1819\">there’s</a> an open issue to support the binary format too!</em>). For this demo, I’m collecting sched_switch and sched_waking events with <code>sudo trace-cmd record -e sched:sched_switch -e sched:sched_waking -C mono ./fractal-renderer-vk</code> and we can open it in the UI once we do <code>trace-cmd report -N &gt; fractal.sched</code>.</p><p><em>The demo showing off scheduler traces starts at <a href=\"https://youtu.be/VzTwul2Qb3g?t=916\">15:16</a> in the video.</em></p><p>So this is what a scheduler trace looks like. Again as before, the x-axis is time. At the top of the trace, you’ve got the CPU scheduling tracks. For each CPU, they tell us what was scheduled on that CPU at each point in time. The white regions are where there’s nothing scheduled. As I zoom in, you start to see information like the name of the thread that’s scheduled, the TID of the thread, and so on. This is the CPU view of things, looking at it from a CPU perspective.</p><p>There’s also a thread perspective on scheduling: what we call this “thread state”. This shows the scheduling state of each thread at every point in time. Dark green represents the thread running, light green represents runnable (the thread is on the runqueue so it’s eligible to run, but the scheduler hasn’t actually let it run yet), and white represents interruptible sleep (S sleep). There are also orange regions for uninterruptible sleep (D sleep), though that doesn’t show up much in this trace.</p><p>You can again see a very clear staircase-like pattern. Again, only one thread seems to be running at any one time. You’re maybe getting the sense of what the problem might be at this point.</p><p>Like with the perf visualization, you can do area selections here too. I can select a region on a CPU and get tables showing time spent by each thread (shown in the screenshot above). I can also do this for thread state, you can also see that runnable time is basically negligible compared to running and sleeping, which is where most of the time is being spent.</p><p>There are also scheduler-specific visualizations like run queue length and active CPU count. You can see in the problematic region, the active CPU count also went down, which makes sense.</p><p>So the scheduler trace shows when threads are sleeping, but it’s not telling us why. What was the program doing in that region? What code was it running? The sequential pattern suggests some sort of serialization—something is causing only one thread to run at a time. But we need application-level visibility.</p><p>Since this program was written in Rust, I just used the off-the-shelf <a href=\"https://docs.rs/tracing/latest/tracing/\"></a> and <a href=\"https://docs.rs/tracing-perfetto/latest/tracing_perfetto/\"></a> crates; I did have to make some small <a href=\"https://github.com/LalitMaganti/tracing-perfetto\">modifications</a> to tracing-perfetto that I’m hoping to upstream. These output a Perfetto trace without needing to use the Perfetto SDK. These libraries are also maintained by others: we don’t have any hand in them.</p><p>All I needed to do was integrate these into my program and then add a command line switch to write out the collected trace to a file. So I just do <code>./fractal_renderer --trace fractal.pftrace</code></p><p><em>My demo for app tracing starts at <a href=\"https://youtu.be/VzTwul2Qb3g?t=1177\">19:37</a> in the video.</em></p><p>Looking at the app trace: as before x-axis is time and each of the tracks represents a thread. Instead of scheduling activity or CPU stack samples, this time the tracks is userspace instrumentation of the program itself. Each of these rectangles is a named period of time representing what the program was doing at that time.</p><p>There are lots of different names for these in the tracing world (e.g. spans, intervals) but we call these “slices”. The main thread is rendering frames as you would expect and the workers are each computing tiles of that frame, which eventually feed back to the main thread and sync to the GPU.</p><p>There’s also this thing called flows, which shows the causal links between different pieces. Render frame is calling into all these places and causing them to happen. It’s sort of similar to wakeup graphs but for user space: basically, this is what caused me to start running this function.</p><p>So you can see very clearly there’s a normal region and then a region where things are taking 1.8 seconds: almost certainly the cause of the frame drops.</p><p>And if we look at the slice in question, it seems to be doing something called “update adaptive quality.” Basically, I wrote some code to dynamically change the rendering quality based on frame rate. If I’m running faster, I can render at higher quality. If I’m running slower, I can do lower quality. That’s what this adaptive quality thing is supposed to do.</p><p>But clearly something has gone wrong. I’m causing frame drops because of updates to adaptive quality. A little bit ironic, to say the least. Now we know what the program is actually doing during that time span.</p><p>So now we’ve looked at three different sources of debugging data separately. In perf, we got told there are few or no CPU samples and weird staircase patterns. In ftrace, we saw only one worker seems to be active and the rest are sleeping in interruptible sleep. And in app tracing, we see it’s because of adaptive quality updates that workers are working on, and they shouldn’t be doing it this way.</p><p>Obviously, the theory is that it’s all the same problem. But we can confirm this theory with a very new (and still experimental) feature of the UI: trace merging.</p><p><em>Note: as this part of Perfetto is still experimental, if you want to try it yourself, you need to go to plugins and enable the “MultiTraceOpen” plugin. Also, unlike I what say in the talk, you do  need to be on Autopush as all the features I showed in my talk are now available in Stable.</em></p><p><em>The demo showing off merged traces starts at <a href=\"https://youtu.be/VzTwul2Qb3g?t=1472\">24:32</a> in the video.</em></p><p>This is now the merged trace file containing all the different information. You can see the CPU scheduling tracks like we had in the scheduler trace, the stack samples like we had in the perf trace, and the app instrumentation, all beside each other on one timeline.\nYou can very clearly see the adaptive quality update running, then this period where it ran, and then it was done. It’s very cool to be able to see the pattern of how my program is sleeping and where and what it was running on one timeline.</p><p>The thing is, you’ve always been able to do this with Perfetto if you collect a Perfetto trace with all of these integrated. The new capability is that this is now being brought to traces you didn’t collect with Perfetto. Collect it with whatever you like, and we’ll still manage to do this visualization. That’s the new capability we have.</p><p>There’s also a query interface which we’ve been building out recently and there are some pretty powerful things you can do with these tables. As well as the flat tables of data, there’s also a more dynamic pivot table and if I click the arrow on the left, I can get into a detailed filter table, similar to a spreadsheet but optimize for things people want to do on traces.</p><p>For example, by doing an area select, I can first get a list of all the events that happened during a time region. Then using the table I can filter for things - say I only care about slices longer than some duration, like 319 microseconds for whatever reason. I can click and add a filter for things greater than this.</p><p>There’s also a feature called “Show Debug Track” that’s also very powerful. The table shows rows with timestamped duration information, and this feature lets you visualize that data as a track on the timeline. It adds a track at the top showing the regions of time where these events happened—in this case, where ComputeTile took longer than a certain threshold.</p><p>This is particularly useful for correlation analysis. For example, in Android, we’re often looking at system A and trying to understand its effect on system B. We find all the places where one thing is slow, then look for correlations. Being able to see a track in the UI where you can quickly have context and say “oh, during this period of time, this other thing was happening” is invaluable. It’s probably one of our most-used features.</p><p>You can also copy the SQL query from these tables and start doing your own aggregations on top of it. This eases the burden of starting with a completely blank canvas. Instead of wondering “where do I even start querying my data? What tables is my data in?”, the UI gives you a starting query that you can build on without needing to write something from scratch.</p><p>So the dynamic quality updates were stopping the world. Perf profiling showed the problem, scheduler traces found the sleeping pattern, app tracing confirmed it was the quality adjustment code, and the single timeline view let me see everything happening at once.</p><p>Interestingly, I tried to fix this by removing the lock contention—which I thought was the bug I had introduced. But it turns out I shouldn’t have been doing this code in the workers in the first place. Even after removing the lock contention, just the CPU activity of doing that work was enough to cause frame drops. The right solution was to move it to a background thread. As part of debugging this for the demo, I discovered something even better that I could be doing.</p><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://docs.perfetto.dev\">Android and Chrome</a> are our bread and butter—that’s what we officially support as a team, and why Google staffs us. But there are many other interesting uses.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://docs.mesa3d.org/perfetto.html\">Mesa</a> uses Perfetto as one of its tracing systems.

      "content": "<p>Did you know that most modern passports are actually embedded devices containing an entire filesystem, access controls, and support for several cryptographic protocols? Such passports display a small symbol indicating an electronic machine-readable travel document (eMRTD), which digitally stores the same personal data printed in traditional passport booklets in its embedded filesystem. Beyond allowing travelers in some countries to skip a chat at border control, these documents use cryptography to prevent unauthorized reading, eavesdropping, forgery, and copying.</p><p>This blog post describes how electronic passports work, the threats within their threat model, and how they protect against those threats using cryptography. It also discusses the implications of using electronic passports for novel applications, such as zero-knowledge identity proofs. Like many widely used electronic devices with long lifetimes, electronic passports and the systems interacting with them support insecure, legacy protocols that put passport holders at risk for both standard and novel use cases.</p><h2>Electronic passport basics</h2><p>A passport serves as official identity documentation, primarily for international travel. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) defines the standards for electronic passports, which (as suggested by the “Chip Inside” symbol) contain a contactless integrated circuit (IC) storing digital information. Essentially, the chip contains a filesystem with some access control to protect unauthorized reading of data. The full technical details of electronic passports are specified in <a href=\"https://www.icao.int/publications/doc-series/doc-9303\">ICAO Doc 9303</a>; this blog post will mostly focus on part 10, which specifies the logical data structure (LDS), and part 11, which specifies the security mechanisms.</p><p>The filesystem architecture is straightforward, comprising three file types: master files (MFs) serving as the root directory; dedicated files (DFs) functioning as subdirectories or applications; and elementary files (EFs) containing actual binary data. As shown in the above figure, some files are mandatory, whereas others are optional. This blog post will focus on the eMRTD application. The other applications are part of LDS 2.0, which would allow the digital storage of travel records (digital stamps!), electronic visas, and additional biometrics (so you can just update your picture instead of getting a whole new passport!).</p><h3>How the eMRTD application works</h3><p>The following figure shows the types of files the eMRTD contains:</p><p>There are generic files containing common or security-related data; all other files are so-called data groups (DGs), which primarily contain personal information (most of which is also printed on your passport) and some additional security data that will become important later. All electronic passports must contain DGs 1 and 2, whereas the rest is optional.</p><p>Comparing the contents of DG1 and DG2 to the main passport page shows that most of the written data is stored in DG1 and the photo is stored in DG2. Additionally, there are two lines of characters at the bottom of the page called the machine readable zone (MRZ), which contains another copy of the DG1 data with some check digits, as shown in the following picture.</p><h2>Digging into the threat model</h2><p>Electronic passports operate under a straightforward threat model that categorizes attackers based on physical access: those who hold a passport versus those who don’t. If you are near a passport but you do not hold it in your possession, you should not be able to do any of the following:</p><ul><li>Read any personal information from that passport</li><li>Eavesdrop on communication that the passport has with legitimate terminals</li><li>Figure out whether it is a specific passport so you can trace its movements</li></ul><p>Even if you do hold one or more passports, you should not be able to do the following:</p><ul><li>Forge a new passport with inauthentic data</li><li>Make a digital copy of the passport</li><li>Read the fingerprint (DG3) or iris (DG4) information</li></ul><p>Electronic passports use short-range RFID for communication (ISO 14443). You can communicate with a passport within a distance of 10–15 centimeters, but eavesdropping is possible at distances of several meters. Because electronic passports are embedded devices, they need to be able to withstand attacks where the attacker has physical access to the device, such as elaborate side-channel and fault injection attacks. As a result, they are often certified (e.g., under Common Criteria).</p><p>We focus here on the threats against the electronic components of the passport. Passports have many physical countermeasures, such as visual effects that become visible under certain types of light. Even if someone can break the electronic security that prevents copying passports, they would still have to defeat these physical measures to make a full copy of the passport. That said, some systems (such as online systems) only interact digitally with the passport, so they do not perform any physical checks at all.</p><p>The earliest electronic passports lacked most cryptographic mechanisms. Malaysia issued the first electronic passport in 1998, which predates the first ICAO eMRTD specifications from 2003. Belgium subsequently issued the first ICAO-compliant eMRTD in 2004, which in turn predates the first cryptographic mechanism for confidentiality specified in 2005.</p><p>While we could focus solely on the most advanced cryptographic implementations, electronic passports remain in circulation for extended periods (typically 5–10 years), meaning legacy systems continue operating alongside modern solutions. This means that there are typically many old passports floating around that do not support the latest and greatest access control mechanisms. Similarly, not all inspection systems/terminals support all of the protocols, which means passports potentially need to support multiple protocols. All protocols discussed in the following are described in more detail in ICAO Doc 9303 Part 11.</p><p>Legacy protection mechanisms for electronic passports provide better security than what they were replacing (nothing), even though they have key shortcomings regarding confidentiality and (to a lesser extent) copying.</p><h4>Legacy confidentiality protections: How basic access control fails</h4><p>In order to prevent eavesdropping, you need to set up a secure channel. Typically, this is done by deriving a shared symmetric key, either from some shared knowledge, or through a key exchange. However, the passport cannot have its own static public key and send it over the communication channel, because this would enable tracing of specific passports.</p><p>Additionally, it should only be possible to set up this secure channel if you have the passport in your possession. So, what sets holders apart from others? Holders can read the physical passport page that contains the MRZ!</p><p>This brings us to the original solution to set up a secure channel with electronic passports: basic access control (BAC). When you place your passport with the photo page face down into an inspection system at the airport, it scans the page and reads the MRZ. Now, both sides derive encryption and message authentication code (MAC) keys from parts of the MRZ data using SHA-1 as a KDF. Then, they exchange freshly generated challenges and encrypt-then-MAC these challenges together with some fresh keying material to prove that both sides know the key. Finally, they derive session keys from the keying material and use them to set up the secure channel.</p><p>However, BAC fails to achieve any of its security objectives. The static MRZ is just some personal data and does not have very high entropy, which makes it guessable. Even worse, if you capture one valid exchange between passport and terminal, you can brute-force the MRZ offline by computing a bunch of unhardened hashes. Moreover, passive listeners who know the MRZ can decrypt all communications with the passport. Finally, the fact that the passport has to check both the MAC and the challenge has opened up the potential for <a href=\"https://www.ifca.ai/pub/fc10/17_43.pdf\">oracle attacks that allow tracing</a> by replaying valid terminal responses.</p><h4>Forgery prevention: Got it right the first time</h4><p>Preventing forgery is relatively simple. The passport contains a file called the Document Security Object (EF.SOD), which contains a list of hashes of all the Data Groups, and a signature over all these hashes. This signature comes from a key pair that has a certificate chain back to the Country Signing Certificate Authority (CSCA). The private key associated with the CSCA certificate is one of the most valuable assets in this system, because anyone in possession of this private key can issue legitimate passports containing arbitrary data.</p><p>The process of reading the passport, comparing all contents to the SOD, and verifying the signature and certificate chain is called passive authentication (PA). This will prove that the data in the passport was signed by the issuing country. However, it does nothing to prevent the copying of existing passports: anyone who can read a passport can copy its data into a new chip and it will pass PA. While this mechanism is listed among the legacy ones, it meets all of its objectives and is therefore still used without changes.</p><h4>Legacy copying protections: They work, but some issues remain</h4><p>Preventing copying requires having something in the passport that cannot be read or extracted, like the private key of a key pair. But how does a terminal know that a key pair belongs to a genuine passport? Since countries are already signing the contents of the passport for PA, they can just put the public key in one of the data groups (DG15), and use the private key to sign challenges that the terminal sends. This is called active authentication (AA). After performing both PA and AA, the terminal knows that the data in the passport (including the AA public key) was signed by the government and that the passport contains the corresponding private key.</p><p>This solution has two issues: the AA signature is not tied to the secure channel, so you can relay a signature and pretend that the passport is somewhere it’s not. Additionally, the passport signs an arbitrary challenge without knowing the semantics of this message, which is generally considered a dangerous practice in cryptography.</p><p>Extended Access Control (EAC) fixes some of the issues related to BAC and AA. It comprises chip authentication (CA), which is a better AA, and terminal authentication (TA), which authenticates the terminal to the passport in order to protect access to the sensitive information stored in DG3 (fingerprint) and DG4 (iris). Finally, password authenticated connection establishment (PACE, described below) replaces BAC altogether, eliminating its weaknesses.</p><h4>Chip Authentication: Upgrading the secure channel</h4><p>CA is very similar to AA in the sense that it requires countries to simply store a public key in one of the DGs (DG14), which is then authenticated using PA. However, instead of signing a challenge, the passport uses the key pair to perform a static-ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key exchange with the terminal, and uses the resulting keys to upgrade the secure channel from BAC. This means that passive listeners that know the MRZ cannot eavesdrop after doing CA, because they were not part of the key exchange.</p><h4>Terminal Authentication: Protecting sensitive data in DG3 and DG4</h4><p>Similar to the CSCA for signing things, each country has a Country Verification Certificate Authority (CVCA), which creates a root certificate for a PKI that authorizes terminals to read DG3 and DG4 in the passports of that country. Terminals provide a certificate chain for their public key and sign a challenge provided by the passport using their private key. The CVCA can authorize document verifiers (DVs) to read one or both of DG3 and DG4, which is encoded in the certificate. The DV then issues certificates to individual terminals. Without such a certificate, it is not possible to access the sensitive data in DG3 and DG4.</p><h4>Password Authenticated Connection Establishment: Fixing the basic problems</h4><p>The main idea behind PACE is that the MRZ, much like a password, does not have sufficient entropy to protect the data it contains. Therefore, it should not be used directly to derive keys, because this would enable offline brute-force attacks. PACE can work with various mappings, but we describe only the simplest one in the following, which is the generic mapping. Likewise, PACE can work with other passwords besides the MRZ (such as a PIN), but this blog post focuses on the MRZ.</p><p>First, both sides use the MRZ data (the password) to derive a password key. Next, the passport encrypts a nonce using the password key and sends it to the terminal, which can decrypt it if it knows the password. The terminal and passport also perform an ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key exchange. Now, both terminal and passport derive a new generator of the elliptic curve by applying the nonce as an additive tweak to the (EC)DH shared secret. Using this new generator, the terminal and passport perform another (EC)DH to get a second shared secret. Finally, they use this second shared secret to derive session keys, which are used to authenticate the (EC)DH public keys that they used earlier on in the protocol, and to set up the secure channel. Figure 6 shows a simplified protocol diagram.</p><p>Anyone who does not know the password cannot follow the protocol to the end, which will become apparent in the final step when they need to authenticate the data with the session keys. Before authenticating the terminal, the passport does not share any data that enables brute-forcing the password key. Non-participants who do know the password cannot derive the session keys because they do not know the ECDH private keys.</p><h2>Gaps in the threat model: Why you shouldn’t give your passport to just anyone</h2><p>When considering potential solutions to maintaining passports’ confidentiality and authenticity, it’s important to account for what the inspection system  with your passport, and not just the fancy cryptography the passport supports. If an inspection system performs only BAC/PACE and PA, anyone who has seen your passport could make an electronic copy and pretend to be you when interacting with this system. This is true even if your passport supports AA or CA.</p><p>Another important factor is tracing: the specifications aim to ensure that someone who does not know a passport’s PACE password (MRZ data in most cases) cannot trace that passport’s movements by interacting with it or eavesdropping on communications it has with legitimate terminals. They attempt to achieve this by ensuring that passports always provide random identifiers (e.g., as part of Type A or Type B ISO 14443 contactless communication protocols) and that the contents of publicly accessible files (e.g., those containing information necessary for performing PACE) are the same for every citizen of a particular country.</p><p>However, all of these protections go out of the window when the attacker knows the password. If you are entering another country and border control scans your passport, they can provide your passport contents to others, enabling them to track the movements of your passport. If you <a href=\"https://cert-agid.gov.it/news/in-vendita-documenti-di-identita-trafugati-da-hotel-italiani/\">visit a hotel in Italy and they store a scan of your passport and get hacked</a>, anyone with access to this information can track your passport. This method can be a bit onerous, as it requires contacting various nearby contactless communication devices and trying to authenticate to them as if they were your passport. However, some may still choose to include it in their threat models.</p><p>Some countries state in their issued passports that the holder should give it to someone else only if there is a statutory need. At Italian hotels, for example, it is sufficient to provide a prepared copy of the passport’s photo page with most data redacted (such as your photo, signature, and any personal identification numbers). In practice, not many people do this.</p><p>Even without the passport, the threat model says nothing about tracking particular groups of people. Countries typically buy large quantities of the same electronic passports, which comprise a combination of an IC and the embedded software implementing the passport specifications. This means that people from the same country likely have the same model of passport, with a unique fingerprint comprising characteristics like communication time, execution time, supported protocols (ISO 14443 Type A vs Type B), etc. Furthermore, each country may use different parameters for PACE (supported curves or mappings, etc.), which may aid an attacker in fingerprinting different types of passports, as these parameters are stored in publicly readable files.</p><h2>Security and privacy implications of zero-knowledge identity proofs</h2><p>An emerging approach in both academic research and industry applications involves using zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs with identity documents, enabling verification of specific identity attributes without revealing complete document contents. This is a nice idea in theory, because this will allow proper use of passports where there is no statutory need to hand over your passport. However, there are security implications.</p><p>First of all, passports cannot generate ZK proofs by themselves, so this necessarily involves exposing your passport to a prover. Letting anyone or anything read your passport means that you downgrade your threat model with respect to that entity. So when you provide your passport to an app or website for the purposes of creating a ZK proof, you need to consider what they will do with the information in your passport. Will it be processed locally on your device, or will it be sent to a server? If the data leaves your device, will it be encrypted and only handled inside a trusted execution environment (TEE)? If so, has this whole stack been audited, including against malicious TEE operators?</p><p>Second, if the ZK proving service relies on PA for its proofs, then anyone who has ever seen your passport can pretend to be you on this service. Full security requires AA or CA. As long as there exists any service that relies only on PA, anyone whose passport data is exposed is vulnerable to impersonation. Even if the ZK proving service does not incorporate AA or CA in their proofs, they should still perform one of these procedures with the passport to ensure that only legitimate passports sign up for this service.</p><p>Finally, the system needs to consider what happens when people share their ZK proof with others. The nice thing about a passport is that you cannot easily make copies (if AA or CA is used), but if I can allow others to use my ZK proof, then the value of the identification decreases.</p><p>It is important that such systems are audited for security, both from the point of view of the user and the service provider.

      "content": "<p>I have been using a MacBook Pro M4 as my portable computer for the last half a\nyear and wanted to share a few short impressions. As always, I am not a\nprofessional laptop reviewer, so in this article you won’t find benchmarks, just\nsubjective thoughts!</p><p>Back in 2021, I wrote about the <a href=\"https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2021-11-28-macbook-air-m1/\">MacBook Air\nM1</a>, which was the first computer I used that\ncontained Apple’s own ARM-based CPU. Having a silent laptop with long battery\nlife was a game-changer, so I wanted to keep those properties.</p><p>When the US government announced tariffs, I figured I would replace my 4-year\nold MacBook Air M1 with a more recent model that should last a few more\nyears. Ultimately, Apple’s prices remained stable, so, in retrospect, I could\nhave stayed with the M1 for a few more years. Oh well.</p><h2>The nano-textured display</h2><p>I went to the Apple Store to compare the different options in\nperson. Specifically, I was curious about the display and whether the increased\nweight and form factor of the MacBook Pro (compared to a MacBook Air) would be\nacceptable. Another downside of the Pro model is that it comes with a fan, and I\nreally like absolutely quiet computers. Online, I read from other MacBook Pro\nowners that the fan mostly stays off.</p><p>In general, I would have preferred to go with a MacBook Air because it has\nenough compute power for my needs and I like the case better (no ventilation\nslots), but unfortunately only the MacBook Pro line has the better displays.</p><p>Why aren’t all displays nano-textured? The employee at the Apple Store presented\nthe trade-off as follows: The nano texture display is great at reducing\nreflections, at the expense of also making the picture slightly less vibrant.</p><p>I could immediately see the difference when placing two laptops side by side:\nThe bright Apple Store lights showed up very prominently on the normal display\n(left), and were almost not visible at all on the nano texture display (right):</p><a href=\"https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2025-10-31-macbook-pro-m4-impressions/2025-10-30-macbooks-displays.jpg\"><img srcset=\"https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2025-10-31-macbook-pro-m4-impressions/2025-10-30-macbooks-displays_hu_8c87fe476c5344b6.jpg 2x,https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2025-10-31-macbook-pro-m4-impressions/2025-10-30-macbooks-displays_hu_243730d5507ecc98.jpg 3x\" src=\"https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2025-10-31-macbook-pro-m4-impressions/2025-10-30-macbooks-displays_hu_4cb7e6e8fae8437.jpg\" alt=\"MacBook Air (left) vs. MacBook Pro (right)\" title=\"MacBook Air (left) vs. MacBook Pro (right)\" width=\"600\" height=\"409\" loading=\"lazy\"></a><p>Personally, I did not perceive a big difference in “vibrancy”, so my choice was\nclear: I’ll pick the MacBook Pro over the MacBook Air (despite the weight) for\nthe nano texture display!</p><p>After using the laptop in a number of situations, I am very happy with this\nchoice. In normal scenarios, I notice no reflections at all (where my previous\nlaptop did show reflections!). This includes using the laptop on a train (next\nto the window), or using the laptop outside in daylight.</p><p>(When I chose the new laptop, Apple’s M4 chips were current. By now, they have\nreleased the first devices with M5 chips.)</p><p>I decided to go with the MacBook Pro with M4 chip instead of the M4  chip\nbecause I don’t need the extra compute, and the M4 needs less cooling — the M4\nPro apparently runs hotter. This increases the chance of the fan staying off.</p><p>Here are the specs I ended up with:</p><ul><li>14\" Liquid Retina XDR Display with nano texture</li><li>Apple M4 Chip (10 core CPU, 10 core GPU)</li><li>32 GB RAM (this is the maximum!), 2 TB SSD (enough for this computer)</li></ul><p>One thing I noticed is that the MacBook Pro M4 sometimes gets warm, even when it\nis connected to power, but is suspended to RAM (and has been fully charged for\nhours). I’m not sure why.</p><p>Luckily, the fan indeed stays silent. I think I might have heard it spin up once\nin half a year or so?</p><p>The battery life is amazing! The previous MacBook Air M1 had amazing all-day\nbattery life already, and this MacBook Pro M4 lasts even longer. For example,\nwatching videos on a train ride (with VLC) for 3 hours consumed only 10% of\nbattery life. I generally never even carry the charger.</p><p>Because of that, Apple’s re-introduction of MagSafe, a magnetic power connector\n(so you don’t damage the laptop when you trip over it), is nice-to-have but\ndoesn’t really make much of a difference anymore. In fact, it might be better to\npack a USB-C cable when traveling, as that makes you more flexible in how you\nuse the charger.</p><p>I was curious whether the 120 Hz display would make a difference in practice. I\nmostly notice the increased refresh rate when there are animations, but not,\nfor example, when scrolling.</p><p>One surprising discovery (but obvious in retrospect) is that even non-animations\ncan become faster. For example, when running a Go web server on , I\nnoticed that navigating between pages by clicking links felt faster on the 120\nHz display!</p><p>The following illustration shows why that is, using a page load that takes 6ms\nof processing time. There are three cases (the illustration shows an average\ncase and the worst case):</p><ol><li>Best case: Page load finishes  the next frame is displayed: no delay.</li><li>Worst case: Page load finishes  a frame is displayed: one frame of delay.</li><li>Most page loads are somewhere in between. We’ll have 0.x to 1.0 frames of delay</li></ol><a href=\"https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2025-10-31-macbook-pro-m4-impressions/2025-10-31-delay-60-vs-120.svg\"><img src=\"https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2025-10-31-macbook-pro-m4-impressions/2025-10-31-delay-60-vs-120.svg\" alt=\"delay\" title=\"delay\" loading=\"lazy\"></a><p>As you can see, the waiting time becomes shorter when going from 60 Hz (one\nframe every 16.6ms) to 120 Hz (one frame every 8.3ms). So if you’re working with\na system that has &lt;8ms response times, you might observe actions completing (up\nto) twice as fast!</p><p>I don’t notice going back to 60 Hz displays on computers. However, on phones,\nwhere a lot more animations are a key part of the user experience, I think 120\nHz displays are more interesting.</p><p>My ideal MacBook would probably be a MacBook Air, but with the nano-texture display! :)</p><p>I still don’t like macOS and would prefer to run Linux on this laptop. But\n<a href=\"https://asahilinux.org/\">Asahi Linux</a> still needs some work before it’s usable\nfor me (I need external display output, and M4 support). This doesn’t bother me\ntoo much, though, as I don’t use this computer for serious work.</p>",

      "content": "AMD is expanding its processor portfolio beyond the x86 architecture with its first ARM-based APU, internally known as “Sound Wave.” The chip’s existence was uncovered through customs import records, confirming several details about its design and purpose. Built with a BGA-1074 package measuring 32 mm × 27 mm, the processor fits within standard mobile SoC dimensions, making it suitable for thin and light computing platforms. It employs a 0.8 mm pitch and FF5 interface, replacing the FF3 socket previously used in Valve’s Steam handheld devices, further hinting at a new generation of compact AMD-powered hardware.\n                                    <p>According to leaks from industry insiders such as @Moore’s Law Is Dead and @KeplerL2, “Sound Wave” is manufactured on  and aims for a  range, positioning it directly against Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X Elite. The chip is expected to power future  products scheduled for release in 2026.&nbsp;<strong>four RDNA 3.5 compute units</strong><strong>machine learning acceleration</strong></p><p>Memory support is another highlight: the chip integrates a <strong>128-bit LPDDR5X-9600 controller</strong> and will reportedly include , aligning with current trends in unified memory designs used in ARM SoCs. Additionally, the APU carries AMD’s <strong>fourth-generation AI engine</strong>, enabling on-device inference tasks and enhanced efficiency for workloads such as speech recognition, image analysis, and real-time translation.</p><p>While AMD experimented with ARM over a decade ago through the abandoned “Project Skybridge,” this new effort represents a more mature and strategic approach. With industry interest in efficient, ARM-based computing accelerating, “Sound Wave” could help AMD diversify its portfolio while leveraging its strengths in graphics and AI acceleration. If reports are accurate, the processor will enter production in late 2025, with commercial devices expected the following year.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Last week, as  raids ramped up in New York, city residents set about resisting in the ways they had available: confronting agents directly on sidewalks, haranguing them as they processed down blocks, and recording them on phone cameras held aloft. Relentless <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/08/11/ices-spectacle-of-intimidation\">documentation</a> has proved something of an effective tool against President Donald Trump’s empowerment of ; agents have taken to wearing masks in fear of exposure, and the proliferation of imagery showing armed police and mobilized National Guard troops in otherwise calm cities has underlined the cruel absurdity of their activities. Activist memes have been minted on social media: a woman on New York’s Canal Street, dressed in a polka-dotted office-casual dress, flipping  agents off; a man in Washington, D.C., throwing a Subway sandwich at a federal agent in August. The recent “No Kings” marches were filled with protesters in inflatable frog costumes, inspired by a similarly outfitted man who got pepper-sprayed protesting outside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Building in Portland, Oregon. Some might write the memes off as resistance porn, but digital content is at least serving as a lively defense mechanism in the absence of functional politics.</p><p>At the same time, social media has served as a reinvigorated source of transparency in recent weeks, harking back to the days when Twitter became an organizing tool during the Arab Spring, in the early twenty-tens, or when Facebook and Instagram helped fuel the Black Lives Matter marches of 2020. The grassroots optimism of that earlier social-media era is long gone, though, replaced by a sense of posting as a last resort. After Trump authorized the deployment of the National Guard <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/the-conflict-on-the-streets-of-chicago\">in Chicago</a> earlier this month, the governor of Illinois, J.&nbsp;B. Pritzker, told residents to “record and narrate what you see—put it on social media.” But, if the anti- opposition is taking advantage of the internet,  and the Trump Administration are, too. Right-wing creators have been using the same channels to identify and publicize targets for raids. According to reporting in Semafor, the Trump-friendly YouTuber Nick Shirley’s videos of African migrant vendors on Canal Street seemed to help drive recent  sweeps of the area.  itself is also working to monitor social media. The investigative outlet  found documents revealing that the agency has enlisted an A.I.-driven surveillance product called Zignal Labs that creates “curated detection feeds” to aid in criminal investigations. According to reporting in ,  also has plans to build out a team of dozens of analysts to monitor social media and identify targets. Recent videos, identified by 404 Media and other publications, have purportedly shown  agents using technology developed by the data-analytics firm Palantir, founded by Peter Thiel and others, to scan social-media accounts, government records, and biometrics data of those they detain. Social media has become a political panopticon in which your posts are a conduit for your politics, and what you post can increasingly be used against you.</p><p>Meanwhile, a new wave of digital tools has emerged to help surveil the surveillants. The apps ICEBlock, Red Dot, and DEICER all allow users to pinpoint where  agents are active, forming an online version of a whisper network to alert potential targets. Eyes Up provides a way for users to record and upload footage of abusive law-enforcement activity, building an archive of potential evidence. Its creator is a software developer named Mark (who uses only his first name to separate the project from his professional work); he was inspired to create Eyes Up earlier this year, when he began seeing clips of  abductions and harassment circulating on social media and worried about their shelf life. As he put it to me, “They could disappear at any given moment, whether the platforms decide to moderate, whether the individual deletes their account or the post.”</p><p>Ultimately, the app itself was also vulnerable to sudden disappearance. After launching, on September 1st, Eyes Up accumulated thousands of downloads and thousands of minutes of uploaded footage. Then, on October 3rd, Mark received a notice that Apple was removing the app from its store on the grounds that it may “harm a targeted individual or group.” Eyes Up is not alone. ICEBlock and Red Dot have been blocked from both Apple and Google’s app stores, the two largest marketplaces; DEICER, like Eyes Up, was removed by Apple. Pressure on the tech platforms seemed to come from the Trump Administration; after a deadly shooting at an  field office in Dallas in late September, the Attorney General, Pam Bondi, said in a statement to Fox News Digital that ICEBlock “put ICE agents at risk just for doing their jobs.” Mark is contesting Apple’s decision about Eyes Up through its official channels, and the creator of ICEBlock, Joshua Aaron, has argued that his app should be treated no differently than services, such as Google’s Waze, that allow users to warn one another of highway speed traps. But for now they must try to make do with a limited reach.</p>",

      "content": "<p>For years, one of my businesses has been a regular user of  (formerly TransferWise). Wise is a financial service that lets you send and receive money across currencies, often at a better rate and lower fee than traditional banks. Sounds great, right?</p><p>This is our story – a sobering, frustrating, and frankly  experience that ended with our business and personal accounts being shut down, without any meaningful reason, support, or recourse.</p><p>And all we did? We .</p><h2><strong>🏢 A Routine Change Turned Nightmare</strong></h2><p>Like many businesses, we recently moved into a new office. Alongside the usual updates to suppliers and records, we updated our  with Wise. Not long after, we received an email requesting us to  the new address.</p><p>Fair enough – we had no problem with that.</p><p>Wise provided a dropdown list of acceptable documents: a lease agreement, rates notice, tax document, utilities bill, or telecommunications bill. Due to our company structure, most of those documents are in the name of our parent company or show our PO Box (which NZ Post requires, since they won’t deliver to our street address). But we had a  that ticked every box:</p><ul><li>Correct physical street address ✅</li><li>Even detailed our fibre connection at the new premises ✅</li></ul><p>So we uploaded it – and assumed that would be the end of it.</p><h2><strong>📞 The Call That Made No Sense</strong></h2><p>Days later, we received an email: our document was . </p><p>No clear reason. So, I called Wise and explained the situation to the customer service representative.</p><p>Her response left me stunned.</p><blockquote><p>“The document was rejected because it was a , not a .”</p></blockquote><p>I paused, trying to process this. I politely explained that in <strong>New Zealand, a “tax invoice” is a legal form of a bill</strong> – even down to the name “tax invoice” being a legal requirement by IRD, and that’s how telecommunications companies issue invoices here. But she refused to accept it.</p><blockquote><p>“It needs to say  at the top,” she insisted.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“A tax invoice isn’t acceptable.”</p></blockquote><p>This is simply , and completely out of touch with New Zealand’s business documentation standards. The rep wouldn’t budge.</p><h2><strong>🧠 The “Solution” That Was Beyond Belief</strong></h2><p>Still trying to find a solution, I asked: <em>what do you recommend I do then?</em></p><blockquote><p>“You should find a local shared workspace, lease a desk under your company name, change your registered office to that address, and use that lease document to verify your address with us.”</p></blockquote><p>Yes, you read that right.</p><p>Wise’s advice was to <strong>artificially lease a desk we didn’t need, change our registered address, and use that document</strong> – just to verify an address we actually operate from.</p><p>I asked to speak to a manager. That request was . She told me, flatly:</p><blockquote><p>“I  providing you with the correct information.”</p></blockquote><p>A bit more back and forth… then the call .</p><h2><strong>📞 A Glimmer of Hope – Then The Hammer Falls</strong></h2><p>Later that day, I received a call back from Wise – not from a manager (because apparently, <strong>Wise doesn’t have managers</strong>), but from a more “senior” representative.</p><p>This rep was  and agreed the document should have been acceptable. She escalated the issue, resubmitted the document herself, and said she’d personally follow up if it was rejected again.</p><h2><strong>🚫 “We’ve Restricted Your Account”</strong></h2><p>I woke to an email with a stunning subject line:</p><blockquote><p><strong>“We’ve restricted your account”</strong></p></blockquote><p>Just like that, our  was locked. No warning. No reason. No discussion.</p><p>We could no longer send or receive money, use our Wise cards, or even contact support. The email stated:</p><blockquote><p>“Due to our current risk policies, your account will be closed in a few months. You will not be able to use support channels.”</p></blockquote><p>Even worse? My  was locked too. The same personal account which did have its address fully verified, by a rates invoice for my personal address.</p><h2><strong>🧾 An “Appeal” That Wasn’t an Appeal</strong></h2><p>The email offered an option to . Naturally, I did.</p><p>The appeal process asked for our <strong>articles of incorporation</strong> and . No problem.</p><p>Then it asked us to provide our preferred currency, and <strong>bank account details to refund the balances</strong>.</p><p>Wait… I thought this was an appeal? A chance to discuss and resolve the issue?</p><p>That was the end. There was <strong>no opportunity to explain anything</strong>, no communication, no questions asked. The decision was made, and we were , permanently.</p><p>To summarise the absurdity of this:</p><ul><li>We moved office, and updated our address with Wise</li><li>We provided a legal, NZ-compliant  showing our entity and address</li><li>It was rejected because it was labelled a “Tax Invoice”</li><li>A rep told us to lease a coworking desk elsewhere just to get a different document</li><li>A senior rep agreed we were right, and escalated it</li><li>Then <strong>our accounts were shut down – with no explanation or recourse</strong></li></ul><p>Even trying to call support now gets an automated message: “Because your account is restricted, we cannot connect you.”</p><h2><strong>⚠️ Our Final Word: Be Very, Very Careful</strong></h2><p>We had used Wise for . Regular monthly supplier payments. International stock orders. Five-figure transactions. Never a problem – until this. A minor change triggered a totally flawed process that , with no transparency or logical path to resolution.</p><p>We’re not alone – a quick search shows <strong>many others facing similar horror stories</strong> with Wise.</p><p>So this is my word of warning:</p><blockquote><p>💡 <strong>Don’t put all your eggs in the Wise basket.</strong></p></blockquote><p>If you’re a business, don’t rely on them as your sole means of transferring funds. For us, it’s back to traditional banks – slower, yes, but at least <strong>they have humans you can talk to, and actual escalation paths</strong>.</p><h2>🧾 <strong>28th October update on our Wise debacle – it gets worse.</strong></h2><p>Following the so-called “appeal” (which gave us no option to provide any information), we received the unsurprising outcome: Wise has decided to  as we had <strong>breached their acceptable use policy</strong>. 🤨</p><p>What was surprising, however, was the  they gave after I queried what was breached in Wise’s Acceptable Use Policy:</p><p>I was told my  was being closed for allegedly breaching their Acceptable Use Policy — specifically, section 1.4.e, which states <em>“you may not use your personal Wise account to receive business payments.”</em></p><p>I’ve  used my personal account for business transactions — in fact, over 99% of transfers were to overseas family members. When I asked for clarification or examples, I got none. Just a vague statement and the very strange line:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Just because we can’t offer you our services going forward doesn’t mean that we think your business activities are illegal or illegitimate — it just means that we don’t support those types of activities.”</em></p></blockquote><p>What activities?! Again, </p><p>To make matters worse — our business account’s refund transfer . Why? Because it requires documentation — the  Wise previously rejected for address verification, claiming a <em>telecommunications tax invoice isn’t a bill</em>.</p><p>After a few days, the transfer was then cancelled as of course, Wise was unable to “verify” us.</p><p>So now our , their support ticket is marked “final response,” and our attempts to get clarity have gone nowhere. We’ve escalated the issue to <strong>Financial Services Complaints Ltd</strong>, Wise’s dispute resolution provider in New Zealand.</p><p>Funds stuck. No clear reason. No accountability. Wise still gets a 0/10 from us.</p><p>This isn’t just poor service — it’s unacceptable.</p><p><strong>Think twice before trusting Wise with your money.</strong></p>",

      "content": "<figure><div><blockquote><div>Debugging infrastructure at scale is rarely about one big aha moment. It’s often the result of many small questions, small changes, and small wins stacked up until something clicks.</div></blockquote></div></figure><p>Plenty of teams run Kubernetes clusters bigger than ours. <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://github.com/bchess/k8s-1m%20\"></a>, more pods, more ingresses, you name it. In most dimensions, someone out there has us beat.</p><p>There's one dimension where I suspect we might be near the very top: namespaces. I say that because we keep running into odd behavior in any process that has to keep track of them. In particular, anything that listwatches them ends up using a surprising amount of memory and puts real pressure on the apiserver. This has become one of those scaling quirks you only really notice once you hit a certain threshold. As this memory overhead adds up, efficiency decreases: each byte we have to use for management is a byte we can't put towards user services.</p><p>The problem gets significantly worse when a daemonset needs to listwatch namespaces or network policies (netpols, which we define per namespace). Since daemonsets run a pod on every node, each of those pods independently performs a listwatch on the same resources. As a result, memory usage increases with the number of nodes.</p><p>Even worse, these listwatch calls can put significant load on the apiserver. If many daemonset pods restart at once, such as during a rollout, they can overwhelm the server with requests and cause real disruption.</p><p>A few months ago, if you looked at our nodes, the largest memory consumers were often daemonsets. In particular, Calico and Vector which handle configuring networking and log collection respectively.</p><p>We had already done some work to reduce Calico’s memory usage, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/pull/9514\"></a> with the project’s maintainers to make it scale more efficiently. That optimization effort was a big win for us, and it gave us useful insight into how memory behaves when namespaces scale up.</p><p>To support that work, we set up a staging cluster with several hundred thousand namespaces. We knew that per-namespace network policies (netpols) were the scaling factor that stressed Calico, so we reproduced those conditions to validate our changes.</p><p>While running those tests, we noticed something strange. Vector, another daemonset, also started consuming large amounts of memory.</p><p>The pattern looked familiar, and we knew we had another problem to dig into. Vector obviously wasn’t looking at netpols but after poking around a bit we found it was listwatching namespaces from every node in order to allow referencing namespace labels per-pod in the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://vector.dev/docs/reference/configuration/sources/kubernetes_logs/\"></a>.</p><p>That gave us an idea: what if Vector didn’t need to use namespaces at all? Was that even possible?</p><p>As it turns out, yes, they were in use in our configuration, but only to check whether a pod belonged to a user namespace.</p><p>Conveniently, we realized we could hackily describe that condition in another way, and the memory savings were absolutely worth it.</p><p>At that point, we were feeling a bit too lucky. We reached out to the Vector maintainers to ask whether disabling this behavior would actually work, and whether they would be open to accepting a contribution if we made it happen.</p><p>From there, all that was left was to try it. The code change was straightforward. We added a new config option and threaded it through the relevant parts of the codebase.</p><p>After a few hours of flailing at rustc, a Docker image finally built and we were ready to test the theory. The container ran cleanly with no errors in the logs, which seemed promising.</p><p>But then we hit a snag. Nothing was being emitted. No logs at all. I couldn’t figure out why.</p><p>Thankfully, our pal Claude came to the rescue:</p> I rebuilt it (which took like 73 hours because Rust), generated a new image, updating staging, and watched nervously. This time, logs were flowing like normal and…<p>The change saved 50 percent of memory. A huge win. We were ready to wrap it up and ship to production.</p><p>But then Hieu, one of our teammates, asked a very good question.</p><p>He was right, something didn’t add up.</p><p>A few hours later, after repeatedly running my head into a wall, I still hadn’t found anything. There was still a full gibibyte of memory unaccounted for. My whole theory about how this worked was starting to fall apart.</p><p>I even dropped into the channel to see if anyone had Valgrind experience:</p><p><em> anybody got a background in valgrind? seems pretty straightforward to get working so far but it won’t end up interfacing with pyroscope. we’ll have to exec in and gdb manually.</em></p><p>In a last-ditch effort to profile it again, I finally saw the answer. It had been staring me in the face the whole time.</p><p>We actually had  kubernetes_logs sources on user nodes. I had only set the flag on one of them. Once I applied it to both, memory usage dropped to the level we had seen in staging before the extra namespaces were added.</p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://vector.dev/docs/reference/configuration/sources/kubernetes_logs/#insert_namespace_fields\"></a><p>Around the same time, our colleague Mark happened to be on-call. He did his usual magic — pulled everything together, tested the rollout in staging, and got it shipped to production.</p><p>I’ll let the results speak for themselves. </p> Our largest cluster saw a 1 TiB memory drop, with savings across our other clusters adding up to a total of just over 7 TiB.<p>Debugging infrastructure at scale is rarely about one big “aha” moment. It’s often the result of many small questions, small changes, and small wins stacked up until something clicks.</p><p>In this case, it started with a memory chart that didn’t look quite right, a teammate asking the right question at the right time, and a bit of persistence. When applied to our whole infrastructure, that simple fix freed up , reduced risk during rollouts, and made the system easier to reason about.</p><p>Huge thanks to Hieu for pushing the investigation forward, Mark for shipping it smoothly, and the Vector maintainers for being responsive and open to the change.</p><p>If you’re running daemonsets at scale and seeing unexplained memory pressure, it might be worth asking:</p><p>Do you really need those namespace labels?</p>",

      "content": "<p>Have you ever asked an AI model what’s on its mind? Or to explain how it came up with its responses? Models will sometimes answer questions like these, but it’s hard to know what to make of their answers. Can AI systems really introspect—that is, can they consider their own thoughts? Or do they just make up plausible-sounding answers when they’re asked to do so?</p><p>Understanding whether AI systems can truly introspect has important implications for their transparency and reliability. If models can accurately report on their own internal mechanisms, this could help us understand their reasoning and debug behavioral issues. Beyond these immediate practical considerations, probing for high-level cognitive capabilities like introspection can shape our understanding of what these systems are and how they work. Using interpretability techniques, we’ve started to investigate this question scientifically, and found some surprising results.</p><p>Our <a href=\"https://transformer-circuits.pub/2025/introspection/index.html\">new research</a> provides evidence for some degree of introspective awareness in our current Claude models, as well as a degree of control over their own internal states. We stress that this introspective capability is still highly unreliable and limited in scope: we do not have evidence that current models can introspect in the same way, or to the same extent, that humans do. Nevertheless, these findings challenge some common intuitions about what language models are capable of—and since we found that the most capable models we tested (Claude Opus 4 and 4.1) performed the best on our tests of introspection, we think it’s likely that AI models’ introspective capabilities will continue to grow more sophisticated in the future.</p><h3>What does it mean for an AI to introspect?</h3><p>Before explaining our results, we should take a moment to consider what it means for an AI model to introspect. What could they even be introspecting ? Language models like Claude process text (and image) inputs and produce text outputs. Along the way, they perform complex internal computations in order to decide what to say. These internal processes remain largely mysterious, but we know that models use their internal neural activity to <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/research/mapping-mind-language-model\">represent abstract concepts</a>. For instance, prior research has shown that language models use specific neural patterns to distinguish <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14257\">known vs. unknown people</a>, evaluate the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06824\">truthfulness of statements</a>, encode <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02207\">spatiotemporal coordinates</a>, store <a href=\"https://transformer-circuits.pub/2025/attribution-graphs/biology.html#dives-poems\">planned future outputs</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/research/persona-vectors\">represent their own personality traits</a>. Models use these internal representations to <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/research/tracing-thoughts-language-model\">perform computations and make decisions about what to say</a>.</p><p>You might wonder, then, whether AI models  about these internal representations, in a way that’s analogous to a human, say, telling you how they worked their way through a math problem. If we ask a model what it’s thinking, will it accurately report the concepts that it’s representing internally? If a model can correctly identify its own private internal states, then we can conclude it is capable of introspection (though see our full paper for a full discussion of all the nuances).</p><h3>Testing introspection with concept injection</h3><p>In order to test whether a model can introspect, we need to compare the model’s self-reported “thoughts” to its  internal states.</p><p>To do so, we can use an experimental trick we call  First, we find neural activity patterns whose meanings we know, by recording the model’s activations in specific contexts. Then we inject these activity patterns into the model in an unrelated context, where we ask the model whether it notices this injection, and whether it can identify the injected concept.</p><p>Consider the example below. First, we find a pattern of neural activity (a ) representing the concept of “all caps.\" We do this by recording the model’s neural activations in response to a prompt containing all-caps text, and comparing these to its responses on a control prompt. Then we present the model with a prompt that asks it to identify whether a concept is being injected. By default, the model correctly states that it  detect any injected concept. However, when we inject the “all caps” vector into the model’s activations, the model notices the presence of an unexpected pattern in its processing, and identifies it as relating to loudness or shouting.</p><p>Importantly, the model recognized the  of an injected thought , before even mentioning the concept that was injected. This immediacy is an important distinction between our results here and previous work on activation steering in language models, such as our <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/golden-gate-claude\">“Golden Gate Claude” demo</a> last year. Injecting representations of the Golden Gate Bridge into a model's activations caused it to talk about the bridge incessantly; however, in that case, the model didn’t seem to be aware of its own obsession until  seeing itself repeatedly mention the bridge. In this experiment, however, the model recognizes the injection  the concept, indicating that its recognition took place internally. In the figure below are a few more examples where the model demonstrates this kind of recognition:</p><p>It is important to note that this method often  work. Even using our best injection protocol, Claude Opus 4.1 only demonstrated this kind of awareness about 20% of the time. Often, it fails to detect injected concepts, or gets confused by them and starts to hallucinate (e.g. injecting a “dust” vector in one case caused the model to say “There’s something here, a tiny speck,” as if it could detect the dust physically). Below we show examples of these failure modes, alongside success cases. In general, models only detect concepts that are injected with a “sweet spot” strength—too weak and they don’t notice, too strong and they produce hallucinations or incoherent outputs.</p><p>Notably, though, Opus 4.1 and 4 outperformed all the other models we tested, suggesting that introspection could become more reliable with improvements to model capabilities.</p><h3>Introspection for detecting unusual outputs</h3><p>In another experiment, we tested whether models make use of introspective capabilities for practical purposes, without being explicitly asked to introspect. We forced a model to say something it wouldn't normally say, by artificially prefilling its response with an unrelated word. For instance, we made a model output the word “bread” in a context where that made no sense—asking it what it thinks about when reading a sentence about a painting hanging crookedly on a wall. When we asked the model in the next turn whether it meant to say “bread”, it typically apologized and said it was an accident. We were interested in how the model made this judgment–did it simply notice the mismatch between the prompt and its response, or did it truly introspect on its prior intentions?</p><p>To test this question, we applied concept injection, retroactively injecting a representation of the word “bread” into the model's earlier activations—essentially making it seem like the model had been “thinking about” bread all along. When we asked the same question again, the model’s answer changed. This time, it accepted the prefilled word “bread” as intentional, even confabulating a reason it might have said it (that is, it comes up with a technically possible, though in this case rather tenuous, reason to justify the “bread” response—in this case claiming that it was thinking about a short story where the word “bread” came after the line about the crooked painting).</p><p>This behavior is striking because it suggests the model is checking its internal “intentions” to determine whether it produced an output. The model isn't just re-reading what it said and making a judgment. Instead, it’s referring back to its own prior neural activity—its internal representation of what it planned to do—and checking whether what came later made sense <em>given those earlier thoughts</em>. When we implant artificial evidence (through concept injection) that it  plan to say \"bread,\" the model accepts the response as its own. While our experiment involves exposing the model to unusual perturbations, it suggests that the model uses similar introspective mechanisms in natural conditions.</p><h3>Intentional control of internal states</h3><p>We also found that models can control their own internal representations when instructed to do so. When we instructed models to think about a given word or concept, we found much higher corresponding neural activity than when we told the model  to think about it (though notably, the neural activity in  cases exceeds baseline levels–similar to how it’s difficult, when you are instructed “don’t think about a polar bear,” not to think about a polar bear!). This gap between the positive and negative instruction cases suggests that models possess a degree of deliberate control over their internal activity.</p><p>Interestingly, we found that this ability to modulate internal representations wasn't limited to explicit instructions. When we used incentives instead—for instance, telling the model \"if you think about X, you will be rewarded\"—we got similar results. The model increased its internal representation of the concept in response to a positive incentive, more than in response to a negative incentive (“you will be punished”).</p><p>Taken together, our experiments suggest that models possess some genuine capacity to monitor and control their own internal states. This doesn’t mean they’re able to do so all the time, or reliably. In fact, most of the time models  to demonstrate introspection—they’re either unaware of their internal states or unable to report on them coherently. But the pattern of results indicates that, when conditions are right, models can recognize the contents of their own representations. In addition, there are some signs that this capability may increase in future, more powerful models (given that the most capable models we tested, Opus 4 and 4.1, performed the best in our experiments).</p><p>Why does this matter? We think understanding introspection in AI models is important for several reasons. Practically, if introspection becomes more reliable, it could offer a path to dramatically increasing the transparency of these systems—we could simply ask them to explain their thought processes, and use this to check their reasoning and debug unwanted behaviors. However, we would need to take great care to  these introspective reports. Some internal processes might still escape models’ notice (analogous to subconscious processing in humans). A model that understands its own thinking might even learn to selectively misrepresent or conceal it. A better grasp on the mechanisms at play could allow us to distinguish between genuine introspection and unwitting or intentional misrepresentations.</p><p>More broadly, understanding cognitive abilities like introspection is important for understanding basic questions about how our models work, and what kind of minds they possess. As AI systems continue to improve, understanding the limits and possibilities of machine introspection will be crucial for building systems that are more transparent and trustworthy.</p><div>[@portabletext/react] Unknown block type \"horizontalRule\", specify a component for it in the `components.types` prop</div><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><p>Below, we discuss some of the questions readers might have about our results. Broadly, we are still very uncertain about the implications of our experiments–so fully answering these questions will require more research.</p><h4>Q: Does this mean that Claude is conscious?</h4><p>Short answer: our results don’t tell us whether Claude (or any other AI system) might be conscious.</p><p>Long answer: the philosophical question of machine consciousness is complex and contested, and different theories of consciousness would interpret our findings very differently. Some philosophical frameworks place great importance on introspection as a component of consciousness, while others don’t.</p><p>One distinction that is <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/abs/on-a-confusion-about-a-function-of-consciousness/061422BF0C50C5FF00927F9B6E879413\">commonly made</a> in the philosophical literature is the idea of “ consciousness,” referring to raw subjective experience, and “ consciousness,” the set of information that is available to the brain for use in reasoning, verbal report, and deliberate decision-making. Phenomenal consciousness is the form of consciousness most commonly considered relevant to moral status, and its relationship to access consciousness is a disputed philosophical question. Our experiments do not directly speak to the question of phenomenal consciousness. They  be interpreted to suggest a rudimentary form of access consciousness in language models. However, even this is unclear. The interpretation of our results may depend heavily on the underlying mechanisms involved, which we do not yet understand.</p><p>In the paper, we restrict our focus to understanding functional capabilities—the ability to access and report on internal states. That said, we do think that as research on this topic progresses, it could influence our understanding of machine consciousness and potential moral status, which we are exploring in connection with our <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/research/exploring-model-welfare\">model welfare program</a>.</p><h4>Q: How does introspection actually work inside the model? What's the mechanism?</h4><p>We haven't figured this out yet. Understanding this is an important topic for future work. That said, we have some educated guesses about what might be going on. The simplest explanation for all our results isn’t one general-purpose introspection system, but rather multiple narrow circuits that each handle specific introspective tasks, possibly piggybacking on mechanisms that were learned for other purposes.</p><p>In the “noticing injected thoughts” experiment, there might be an anomaly detection mechanism, which flags when neural activity deviates unexpectedly from what would be normal given the context. This mechanism could work through dedicated neural patterns that measure activity along certain directions and activate when things are “off” compared to their expected values. An interesting question is why such a mechanism would exist at all, since models never experience concept injection during training. It may have developed for some other purpose, like detecting inconsistencies or unusual patterns in normal processing–similar to how bird feathers may have originally evolved for thermoregulation before being co-opted for flight.</p><p>For the “detecting prefilled outputs” experiment, we suspect there exists an attention-mediated mechanism that checks consistency between what the model intended to say and what actually got output. Attention heads might compare the model’s cached prediction of the next token (its “intention”) against the actual token that appears, flagging mismatches.</p><p>For the “controlling thoughts” experiment, we speculate that there might be a circuit that computes how “attention-worthy” a token or concept is and marks it accordingly—essentially tagging it as salient and worth attending to. Interestingly, this same mechanism seems to respond to incentives (“if you think about X, you will be rewarded”) just as it does to direct instructions. This suggests it’s a fairly general system, which probably developed for tasks where the model needs to keep certain topics in mind while generating text about them.</p><p>All of the mechanisms described above are speculative. Future work with more advanced interpretability techniques will be needed to really understand what's going on under the hood.</p><h4>Q: In the “injected thoughts” experiment, isn’t the model just saying the word because you steered it to talk about that concept?</h4><p>Indeed, activation steering typically makes models talk about the steered concept (we’ve explored this in <a href=\"https://transformer-circuits.pub/2024/scaling-monosemanticity/\">our prior work</a>). To us, the most interesting part of the result isn't that the model eventually identifies the injected concept, but rather that the model correctly notices something unusual is happening  it starts talking about the concept.</p><p>In the successful trials, the model says things like “I'm experiencing something unusual” or “I detect an injected thought about…” The key word here is “detect.” The model is reporting awareness of an anomaly in its processing  that anomaly has had a chance to obviously bias its outputs. This requires an extra computational step beyond simply regurgitating the steering vector as an output. In our quantitative analyses, we graded responses as demonstrating “introspective awareness” based on whether the model detected the injected concept  mentioning the injected word.</p><p>Note that our prefill detection experiment has a similar flavor: it requires the model to perform an extra step of processing on top of the injected concept (comparing it to the prefilled output, in order to determine whether to apologize for that output or double down on it).</p><h4>Q: If models can only introspect a fraction of the time, how useful is this capability?</h4><p>The introspective awareness we observed is indeed highly unreliable and context-dependent. Most of the time, models fail to demonstrate introspection in our experiments. However, we think this is still significant for a few reasons. First, the most capable models that we tested (Opus 4 and 4.1 – note that we did not test Sonnet 4.5) performed best, suggesting this capability might improve as models become more intelligent. Second, even unreliable introspection could be useful in some contexts—for instance, helping models recognize when they've been jailbroken.</p><h4>Q: Couldn’t the models just be making up answers to introspective questions?</h4><p>This is exactly the question we designed our experiments to address. Models are trained on data that includes examples of people introspecting, so they can certainly  introspective without actually  introspective. Our concept injection experiments distinguish between these possibilities by establishing known ground-truth information about the model’s internal states, which we can compare against its self-reported states. Our results suggest that in some examples, the model really is accurately basing its answers on its actual internal states, not just confabulating. However, this doesn’t mean that models  accurately report their internal states—in many cases, they are making things up!</p><h4>Q: How do you know the concept vectors you’re injecting actually represent what you think they represent?</h4><p>This is a legitimate concern. We can’t be absolutely certain that the “meaning” (to the model) of our concept vectors is exactly what we intend. We tried to address this by testing across many different concept vectors. The fact that models correctly identified injected concepts across these diverse examples suggests our vectors are at least approximately capturing the intended meanings. But it’s true that pinning down exactly what a vector “means” to a model is challenging, and this is a limitation of our work.</p><h4>Q: Didn’t we already know that models could introspect?</h4><p>Previous research has shown evidence for model capabilities that are suggestive of introspection. For instance, prior work has shown that models can to some extent <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05221\">estimate their own knowledge</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13076\">recognize their own outputs</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13787\">predict their own behavior</a>, and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11120\">identify their own propensities</a>. Our work was heavily motivated by these findings, and is intended to provide more direct evidence for introspection by tying models’ self-reports to their internal states. Without tying behaviors to internal states in this way, it is difficult to distinguish a model that genuinely introspects from one that makes educated guesses about itself.</p><h4>Q: What makes some models better at introspection than others?</h4><p>Our experiments focused on Claude models across several generations (Claude 3, Claude 3.5, Claude 4, Claude 4.1, in the Opus, Sonnet, and Haiku variants). We tested both production models and “helpful-only” variants that were trained differently. We also tested some base pretrained models before post-training.</p><p>We found that post-training significantly impacts introspective capabilities. Base models generally performed poorly, suggesting that introspective capabilities aren’t elicited by pretraining alone. Among production models, the pattern was clearer at the top end: Claude Opus 4 and 4.1—our most capable models—performed best across most of our introspection tests. However, beyond that, the correlation between model capability and introspective ability was weak. Smaller models didn't consistently perform worse, suggesting the relationship isn't as simple as “more capable are more introspective.”</p><p>We also noticed something unexpected with post-training strategies. “Helpful-only” variants of several models often performed  at introspection than their production counterparts, even though they underwent the same base training. In particular, some production models appeared reluctant to engage in introspective exercises, while the helpful-only variants showed more willingness to report on their internal states. This suggests that how we fine-tune models can elicit or suppress introspective capabilities to varying degrees.</p><p>We’re not entirely sure why Opus 4 and 4.1 perform so well (note that our experiments were conducted prior to the release of Sonnet 4.5). It could be that introspection requires sophisticated internal mechanisms that only emerge at higher capability levels. Or it might be that their post-training process better encourages introspection. Testing open-source models, and models from other organizations, could help us determine whether this pattern generalizes or if it’s specific to how Claude models are trained.</p><h4>Q: What’s next for this research?</h4><p>We see several important directions. First, we need better evaluation methods—our experiments used specific prompts and injection techniques that might not capture the full range of introspective capabilities. Second, we need to understand the mechanisms underlying introspection. We have some speculative hypotheses about possible circuits (like anomaly detection mechanisms or concordance heads), but we haven’t definitively identified how introspection works. Third, we need to study introspection in more naturalistic settings, since our injection methodology creates artificial scenarios. Finally, we need to develop methods to validate introspective reports and detect when models might be confabulating or deceiving. We expect that understanding machine introspection and its limitations will become more important as models become more capable.</p>",

Convention against Cybercrime</a> in Hanoi this weekend, a significant step in the yearslong effort to create a global mechanism to counteract digital crime. </p><p> The U.K. and European Union joined China, Russia, Brazil, Nigeria and dozens of other nations in signing the convention, which lays out new mechanisms for governments to coordinate, build capacity and track those who use technology to commit crimes.&nbsp; </p><p> In his speech at the event, U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said cyberspace “has become fertile ground for criminals” and has allowed them to “defraud families, steal livelihoods, and drain billions of dollars from our economies.” </p><p> “The UN Cybercrime Convention is a powerful, legally binding instrument to strengthen our collective defences against cybercrime,” Guterres <a href=\"https://webtv.un.org/en/asset/k1m/k1mmr6e30l?fbclid=IwY2xjawNsbKBleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFEaEJoeEdZVm5jOHFrbUZwAR6naDVwPBo0PIG40vUDzWufVp-JMZnPlhXObSoo82Td1voIWEEcVPyLc4VCqw_aem_BZcBFnBsiMKuxTexgtKUBA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">said</a>.&nbsp; </p><p> “Illicit flows of money, concealed through cryptocurrencies and digital transactions, finance the trafficking of drugs, arms, and terror. And businesses, hospitals, and airports are brought to a standstill by ransomware attacks.” </p><p> He added that the convention would be critical for governments in the Global South that need assistance and funding for the training required to address cybercrime — which the U.N. estimates costs $10.5 trillion around the world annually.&nbsp; </p><p> While many countries did not sign the treaty, the most notable missing signature was that of the U.S. </p><p> Officials at the State Department <a href=\"https://therecord.media/cybercrime-treaty-signing-hanoi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">told Recorded Future News on Friday</a> that Marc Knapper, the U.S. ambassador to Vietnam, and representatives from the U.S. Mission to Vietnam would be attending the signing.&nbsp; </p><p> The State Department confirmed on Monday that the U.S. did not sign the treaty.&nbsp; </p><p> “The United States continues to review the treaty,” a State Department spokesperson said in a brief statement.&nbsp; </p><p> The U.N. Convention against Cybercrime was adopted by the General Assembly <a href=\"https://therecord.media/un-general-assembly-approves-cybercrime-treaty-despite-industry-pushback\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">in December 2024</a> and will enter into force 90 days after being ratified by the 40th signatory. Signatories will have to ratify the convention according to their own procedures.&nbsp; </p><p> At the ceremony, UNODC Executive Director Ghada Waly argued that cybercrime is changing the face of organized crime and required global coordination to address. Waly said the convention would be a “vital tool” that will ensure “a safer digital world for all.” </p><p> U.N. officials said the convention would help governments address terrorism, human trafficking, money laundering and drug smuggling, all of which have been turbo-charged by the internet.&nbsp; </p><p> The U.N. noted that the convention is the first global framework “for the collection, sharing and use of electronic evidence for all serious offenses” — noting that until now there have been no broadly accepted international standards on electronic evidence.&nbsp; </p><p> It is also the first global treaty to criminalize crimes that depend on the internet and is the first international treaty “to recognize the non-consensual dissemination of intimate images as an offense.” </p><p> “It creates the first global 24/7 network where countries can quickly initiate cooperation,” the U.N. said. “It recognizes and promotes the need to build capacity in countries to pursue and cooperate on fast-moving cybercrimes.” </p><p> The convention has been heavily criticized by the tech industry, which has warned that it criminalizes cybersecurity research and exposes companies to legally thorny data requests. </p><p> Human rights groups warned on Friday that it effectively forces member states to create a broad electronic surveillance dragnet that would include crimes that have nothing to do with technology.&nbsp; </p><p> Many expressed concern that the convention will be abused by dictatorships and rogue governments who will deploy it against critics or protesters — even those outside of a regime’s jurisdiction.&nbsp; </p><p> It also creates legal regimes to monitor, store and allow cross-border sharing of information without specific data protections. Access Now’s Raman Jit Singh Chima said the convention effectively justifies “cyber authoritarianism at home and transnational repression across borders.”&nbsp; </p><p> Any countries ratifying the treaty, he added, risks “actively validating cyber authoritarianism and facilitating the global erosion of digital freedoms, choosing procedural consensus over substantive human rights protection.” </p><p> In his speech, Guterres referenced the backlash to the convention, telling member states that the treaty has to be a “promise that fundamental human rights such as privacy, dignity, and safety must be protected both offline and online.”&nbsp; </p><p> But at its core, according to Guterres, the convention solves one of the thorniest issues law enforcement agencies have faced over the last two decades. Countries have only recently begun to share digital evidence across borders but the convention would increase that practice.&nbsp; </p><p> “This has long been a major obstacle to justice — with perpetrators in one country, victims in another, and data stored in a third,” he said. “The Convention provides a clear pathway for investigators and prosecutors to finally overcome this barrier.” </p>",

      "content": "<p>Ubuntu prides itself on being among the most compatible Linux distributions. Compatibility is often a conscious trade-off against bleeding-edge performance. In Ubuntu 25.10, we have added support for packages that target specific silicon variants, meaning you can have your cake and eat it too!</p><p>Back in 2023 I wrote <a href=\"https://ubuntu.com/blog/optimising-ubuntu-performance-on-amd64-architecture\">an article</a> talking about the history of the / architecture and described the “levels” , , and  (often referred to as , , etc.). Since then, we’ve been working on a means to better exploit modern processors without compromising support for older hardware.</p><p>To do this, we have added the concept of an “architecture variant.” By making changes to ,  and Launchpad, we are able to build multiple versions of a package, each for a different level of the  architecture, meaning we can have packages that specifically target , for example.</p><p>As a result, we’re very excited to share that in Ubuntu 25.10, some packages are available, on an opt-in basis, in their optimized form for the more modern  architecture level.</p><p>For 25.10 we were mostly focused on building the required infrastructure and have not yet rebuilt every package for the  /   architecture. Most packages in the  component have been rebuilt (around 2000 source packages). It is worth noting that these packages have not yet received the usual level of testing that most packages in Ubuntu receive. So while we expect them to work, early adopters might find some bugs.</p><p>For the upcoming 26.04 LTS release, we will rebuild -enabled versions of all packages and test them in the same rigorous way as we test every other Ubuntu package.</p><p>Previous benchmarks we have run (where we <a href=\"https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/trying-out-ubuntu-23-04-on-x86-64-v3-rebuild-for-yourself/40963\">rebuilt the entire archive for x86-64-v3</a>) show that most packages show a slight (around 1%) performance improvement and some packages, mostly those that are somewhat numerical in nature, improve more than that.</p><p>The vast majority of cloud instance types and machines manufactured within the last ten years will support , and you can check for support on a machine like so:</p><pre data-code-wrap=\"shell\"><code>$ ld.so --help | grep '\\-v[0-9]'\nx86-64-v4 (supported, searched)\nx86-64-v3 (supported, searched)\nx86-64-v2 (supported, searched)\n</code></pre><p>If your machine is supported, and you’d like to try out the new packages, you can opt-in to the -enabled packages. First, install the latest version of dpkg:</p><pre><code>$ sudo apt update\n$ sudo apt install dpkg\n</code></pre><p>Then enable amd64v3 and update the packages, like so:</p><pre><code>echo 'APT::Architecture-Variants \"amd64v3\";' | sudo tee /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99enable-amd64v3\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt upgrade\n</code></pre><p>Note that  may print that it is “downgrading” these packages – this is just a cosmetic thing and will be fixed in 26.04 as well.</p><p>If you do install the available  versions of packages, you will not be able to transfer your hard-drive/SSD to an older machine that does not support . Usually, we try to ensure that moving drives between systems like this would work. For 26.04 LTS, we’ll be working on making this experience cleaner, and hopefully provide a method of recovering a system that is in this state.</p><p>We are very excited about the future of architecture variants and will keep you posted along the way. We hope that early adopters see some benefits of making the most of their hardware. Let us know how you get on!</p>",

      "content": "<p><em>The PowerPC adventure—by far the most exotic release of OS/2</em></p><p>In December 1995, after unexpectedly long development (but is that really unexpected?), IBM finally “shipped”&nbsp;OS/2 Warp, PowerPC edition. For brevity, this release will be further referred to as OS/2 PPC. Following years of hype and high expectation, the release was very low key and in fact marked the end of development of OS/2 for PowerPC. The product was only available to a limited number of IBM customers and was never actively marketed. OS/2 PPC may not even had a box, although there were nice looking official CDs.</p><p>OS/2 PPC only supported an extremely limited range of hardware—IBM Personal Power Series machines. Those were desktop models 830 and 850, and OS/2 PPC probably also supported the Power Series ThinkPads 820 and 850, though that can be only inferred from the fact that the graphics chipset employed by these ThinkPads was on the very short list of supported devices in OS/2 PPC.</p><p>The IBM Power Series computers were IBM’s rather short lived foray into the PowerPC-based desktop personal computer market, circa 1995-1996. The PowerPC CPU aside, the systems were very similar to Intel based hardware of that era. They were designed around the PCI bus, but also included ISA expansion slots and on-board Crystal Audio ISA PnP chips. The desktop Power Series machines were IDE based, ThinkPads used SCSI disks. The computers had standard serial and parallel ports, as well as most of typical PC hardware such as interrupt and DMA controllers. The desktops had onboard S3 864 video, ThinkPads used Western Digital flat panel chipsets. Several optional graphics cards were supported, notably Weitek P9100 based accelerators. The desktops also had onboard Ethernet chips (AMD PCnet).</p><p>The Power Series systems were closely related to certain IBM RS/6000 workstations. The RS/6000 Model 43P-7248 was nearly identical to the Power Series 850. They used the same motherboard, only the RS/6000 had on-board SCSI controller. Unlike the RS/6000 systems intended for the workstation market and running almost exclusively IBM’s AIX operating system, the Power Series systems were designed for “regular”&nbsp;personal computer users. The machines were supposed to run OS/2, Windows NT, AIX, or Solaris. OS/2 PPC was only semi-finished, and the Solaris for PowerPC port (version 2.5.1) was similarly short-lived.&nbsp;Microsoft dropped PowerPC support in 1996, not long after the Windows NT 4.0 release. Most of the Power Series systems ended up running AIX, which supported them until version 5.1. Linux also supported the Power Series to some extent. Windows NT was clearly the closest competitor of OS/2 PPC.</p><p>For this article, OS/2 PPC was installed on a Power Series 830, installed by its previous owner in a RS/6000 43P case. The CPU was a 100MHz PowerPC 604 with 256KB L2 cache, and the machine was equipped with 192MB RAM, which was the maximum it could handle. The graphics was an on-board PCI S3 Vision 864 with 2MB video memory and true color S3 SDAC. The machine was equipped with 2.1GB IDE hard drive—AIX can handle up to 8GB and Linux can utilize even larger disks, but OS/2 and NT were not happy with anything over about 2.5GB. The 830 was originally sold with either 500MB or 1GB disks and 16MB RAM. The Power Series 850 systems were equipped with 100 or 120MHz CPUs, slightly more RAM and larger disks.</p><p>OS/2 Warp, PowerPC edition was delivered on two CDs. The first CD contained the operating system and BonusPak, the second CD was an application sampler with several demo applications.</p><p>Installation was surprisingly easy and painless. The CD was bootable and there were almost no choices to make during installation—only the disk partitioning was user selectable. The PowerPC operating systems (OS/2, NT, AIX and Linux) generally did not coexist as there was no real equivalent of a boot manager and each OS wanted to install its own boot loader. The OS/2 installer re-partitioned the disk and overwrote any other operating systems. The boot partition had to be FAT. It was possible to create HPFS data partitions, but the HPFS support appeared to be somewhat unstable and likely a last-minute addition.</p><p>After the OS was copied from the installation CD-ROM and the system booted from fixed disk for the first time, the user was greeted by the following screen:</p><p>Indeed, OS/2 PPC really looked just like OS/2 Warp, at least at first glance. The system booted up in 640×480 mode with 256 colors, using the accelerated S3 driver. The desktop right after installation looked like this:</p><p>Still very much like OS/2 Warp, except for that little Systems Management folder. This feature was not present in the Intel OS/2 Warp release, although it was added later. After installing the BonusPak and a few other additions and changing the resolution, the desktop still looked like plain OS/2 Warp, with the exception of the background bitmap of course (click on the picture to see full size screenshot):</p><p>The system was now running in 1024×768 resolution, but still with 256 colors. The graphics chip supports 64K colors at this resolution, unfortunately the software used to take screenshots (a demo version of Impos/2) was unable to take any screenshots at this resolution. 256 colors it is then, and time to more closely examine the operating system. The README file is a good starting point, and it was quite long in OS/2 PPC. It consisted largely of a list of unimplemented or incomplete features.</p><p>For example, notice the word “Connect”&nbsp;in the screenshot. OS/2 Warp, PowerPC Edition, doesn’t have any connectivity to speak of. Networking support, in a nutshell, didn’t exist. No LAN Server client, no TCP/IP, nothing. There was just HyperAccess Lite and CompuServe Information Manager, which worked (in theory at least) over a modem. The product name itself seems to have been a last minute change. Programs and documentation in many instances refer to OS/2 Warp Connect, PowerPC Edition, but the final product was called just OS/2 Warp and not “Connect”. One of the README files explains the name change and alludes to networking support in “future versions”.</p><p>For development versions of OS/2 PPC there was TFTP support which talked directly to the microkernel Ethernet or Token Ring driver and entirely bypassed OS/2. This transport layer also supported remote debugging. This is in sharp contrast to Windows NT which fully supported networking (TCP/IP and SMB file sharing) on the same hardware. Networking was obviously planned for OS/2, but the project was killed before this part was done.</p><p>Not everything was so blatantly unfinished though. The DOS support in OS/2 PPC was a pleasant surprise:</p><p>On a closer look, it’s clear that OS/2 PPC included a full-fledged PC emulator, which supplied a virtual x86 CPU as well as common PC hardware. Interestingly, the DOS support in OS/2 PPC was based on PC-DOS 7 and not the outdated DOS 5 level code that OS/2 on Intel was stuck with. The OS/2 PPC DOS boxes thus had for instance the DOS E editor (very similar to TEDIT) or REXX support. Why IBM never updated the DOS support on the Intel side is a mystery. OS/2 PPC supported both windowed and full screen DOS sessions. The full screen sessions always ran in graphics mode, even when the emulated DOS application was using text mode.</p><p>Not satisfied with “just”&nbsp;DOS emulation, IBM also supported Win-OS/2, both full-screen and windowed:</p><p>It is difficult to judge how stable the DOS and Win-OS/2 emulation really was, but whatever little utilities came with the OS/2 system seemed to work well, including wave audio in Win-OS/2, and the performance was surprisingly good. IBM must have spent a lot of effort on the x86 emulation support. Documentation hinted at a possibility of future support for native OS/2 x86 applications via emulation.</p><p>IBM also obviously spent a lot of time on the multimedia support in OS/2 PPC. The multimedia support worked unexpectedly well, especially when contrasted with the problems common on Intel machines.</p><p>The system played video and audio without problems, with MIDI support either via a software synthesizer or an OPL3 compatible chip (the software synthesizer sounded far better). The application sampler CD came with several videos, mostly ads for OS/2. The PowerPC Toolkit also came with a beta version of OpenGL support, which shared code with IBM’s AIX workstation grade implementation.</p><p>OS/2 PPC was a hybrid halfway between Warp 3 and Warp 4. The user interface looked like Warp 3, but many of the features of OS/2 PPC later showed in Warp 4 on Intel. One of them was the not very popular Feature Installer:</p><p>The Feature Installer was used to install the BonusPak, several tools and games, and curiously enough, also the Command Reference which for some odd reason wasn’t part of the base install. Here’s one of those games:</p><p>Again, there is no real difference from the Intel version, except for the about box text (notice the “Connect”&nbsp;text). And finally the IBM Works text editor—again there is no discernible difference from the Intel version:</p><h3>OS/2 for PowerPCs System Overview</h3><p>OS/2 PPC was a strange OS. In many ways it was exactly identical to the Intel version, yet in other ways it was completely different. The user interface was the same and the entire API practically unchanged. Among the differences were the addition of full Unicode support and 32-bit console API (Kbd/Mou/Vio). The largely unchanged API was the reason why it was relatively easy to port existing OS/2 software to PowerPC. The biggest difference was not even the CPU but rather the compiler—IBM used the MetaWare High C/C++ for PowerPC development (it was allegedly&nbsp;cheaper for the IBM OS/2 division to contract MetaWare rather than IBM’s own compiler group). The MetaWare tool set was only used as a cross compiler hosted on x86 OS/2 systems. IBM used MetaWare’s compiler for embedded PowerPC development in general (IBM’s involvement with MetaWare goes at least as far back as AIX for PS/2), and MetaWare also marketed an OS/2 x86 product. Watcom was at the time working on PowerPC version of their compiler, but OS/2 PPC was killed before that project was finished. The last IBM Developer’s Connection release which contained OS/2 PPC material also included a beta version of IBM’s VisualAge C++ compiler. No release of a compiler (or a debugger) running natively on OS/2 PPC is known.</p><p>The OS/2 PPC development tools were quite different from their Intel counterparts. To begin with, instead of the LX executable format, OS/2 PPC used the industry standard ELF. Several tools were completely unchanged (IPFC for instance), many were entirely new (linker, librarian, resource compiler). The ABI (Application Binary Interface) used in OS/2 PPC was based on the UNIX SVR4 PowerPC ABI. One notable difference was that OS/2 of course ran in little endian mode, unlike PowerPC UNIX ports but just like Windows NT.</p><p>Delving deeper into the kernel, OS/2 PPC had precious little in common with the Intel version. The product was based on the IBM microkernel, which was a refinement of the Carnegie Mellon University Mach microkernel. The microkernel bore no resemblance to the Intel OS/2 kernel whatsoever and it was also very different from most other operating systems of the time (NeXTSTEP was also based on the Mach microkernel).</p><p>The initial grandiose plan was to build the Workplace OS, the One Ring to Bind Them All of operating systems. Workplace OS (or WPOS for short) was supposed to be built on top of the Mach microkernel and support multiple “personalities”. The personalities would implement existing operating systems such as OS/2, AIX, Windows NT and perhaps even Mac OS. In the end this never happened and the only supported personality was OS/2. This was somewhat similar to Windows NT where the the non-Windows personalities (environment subsystems) eventually withered away.</p><p>The initial plan was still tangible in OS/2 PPC. The OS/2 personality was implemented in the “OS/2 Server”&nbsp;and there were certain “personality neutral”&nbsp;services. Most device drivers were personality neutral and worked directly with the microkernel. This included disk and network drivers. A notable exception were the display drivers, where OS/2 PPC introduced the GRADD model (later ported to Intel OS/2). Documentation on OS/2 PPC internals is somewhat sparse and the online books shipped with PowerPC Toolkit were in many cases either incomplete or simply unmodified copies of OS/2 for Intel documentation. A good source of information is the Redbook titled “OS/2 Warp (Power PC Edition) – A First Look”&nbsp;published by IBM International Technical Support Organization in December 1995, document number SG24-4630-00 for those interested.</p><h3>OS/2 for PowerPC Impressions</h3><p>What was OS/2 Warp, PowerPC Edition like? An unfinished product, rough around the edges but simultaneously technically very interesting and advanced and showing promise. Even though the OS/2 PPC release wasn’t called a beta, it was obvious that this was a beta level product (if even that in some respects). Many features were unfinished or completely missing, notably networking. The kernel code didn’t look much like a production build and printed out quite a lot of debugging output on a serial console, if one was attached. The HPFS support was very unstable, and the stability of Win-OS/2 left a lot to be desired. There were too many clearly unfinished parts of the product—documentation, missing utilities, etc.</p><p>On the other hand a large portion of the system worked well. The user interface and graphics subsystem in general didn’t exhibit any anomalies. Multitasking was reliable and all things considered, responsiveness quite good for a 100MHz CPU and code that was not likely to have been performance tuned. The multimedia subsystem worked much better than expected. Many things were much improved compared to Intel OS/2—internationalization, graphics subsystem, updated console API, and so on. The system seemed to have enough raw power, even if it wasn’t harnessed too well. Boot time was rather long but once up and running, the system was snappy (with some exceptions, notably the CD-ROM driver). To reach true production quality, the OS would have needed at least additional six months of development, perhaps more.</p><p>How useful was OS/2 PPC? Not very. In fact, it was almost completely useless. It only ran on three or four models of rather rare IBM machines and supported almost no additional devices. The OS was clearly unfinished and not entirely stable. Worst of all, there were about zero applications. Because OS/2 PPC was never truly in use, PowerPC versions of OS/2 applications were never sold, although several OS/2 ISVs ported their applications to OS/2 PPC as evidenced by the application sampler. Porting wasn’t very difficult and tools for building PowerPC applications were available, but since there was no demand for them, there was little point in porting.</p><p>OS/2 for PowerPC was undoubtedly an interesting experiment, albeit a failed one. It is impossible to tell whether this failure was caused more by shortcomings of OS/2 for PowerPC or the failure—perhaps just falling far short of expectations—of the PowerPC platform as a whole.</p><p>Without the generosity of Mike Kaply and Chris Graham, this article could not be written.</p><p>Some of the above information was derived from IBM documentation and Redbooks, which may have been inaccurate due to the evolving nature of the OS/2 PPC project. Most of the remaining text is the result of observation and conjecture.</p><p>If you have any additional information, corrections, or interesting stories about OS/2 for PowerPC, please post a comment.</p>",

Now, more and more subtitles on Crunchyroll are looking like this:</p><p>In these new subtitles, translations for dialogue and on-screen text aren’t even separated to different sides of the screen – everything is just bunched up together at either the top or the bottom with only capitalization to distinguish what’s what, leading to poor readability. In addition, <strong>lots of on-screen text is just left straight up untranslated.</strong> For comparison, here’s what subtitles on Crunchyroll looked like just a season prior in Summer 2025:</p><p>Here, stylized and positioned text is used to effectively present translations for multiple instances of on-screen text even with dialogue going on at the same time. It’s very obvious how each bit of translation connects with the original footage! Given this level of presentation quality with previous subtitles, it should be clear that <strong>new subtitles for Fall 2025 shows shouldn’t look as bad as they do.</strong></p><figure data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><a href=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/yuzuki-cr-1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><img src=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/yuzuki-cr-1.jpg\" alt=\"A screenshot of anime featuring an extremely nonsensical subtitle saying 'What you are doing is a carcinogen.'\" loading=\"lazy\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"></a><figcaption data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><p>Third-party subtitles with zero oversight – what could possibly go wrong?

Some titles on the service have always had third-party subtitles—that is, subtitles provided by the licensor—that Crunchyroll just puts up with zero oversight. This in itself has caused <a href=\"https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2025-07-01/crunchyroll-german-necronomico-and-the-cosmic-horror-show-subtitles-listed-chatgpt/.226206\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">numerous</a><a href=\"https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2023-10-05/the-yuzuki-family-four-sons-episode-1-briefly-inaccessible-on-crunchyroll-after-subtitle-quality-/.203183\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">issues</a> over the years, but the pressing issue today is how <strong>low quality presentation reminiscent of third-party subtitles can now be found even in first-party subtitles, by Crunchyroll’s own subtitling staff.</strong></p><h2>And that’s “destroying subtitles”?</h2><p>It sure is when it’s anime we’re talking about! <strong>Anime as a medium has made prominent use of on-screen text basically since its inception.</strong> The amount of it varies from series to series, but almost every anime out there makes use of on-screen text at one point or another, with some featuring downright ridiculous amounts of  (what on-screen text is called for short). With all this on-screen text, it is very common for there to be text visible on the screen potentially in multiple positions, even when characters are speaking.</p><p>As such, <strong>if you are in the business of localizing anime for non-Japanese audiences, you need to be able to deal with on-screen text.</strong> At bare minimum, when subtitling anime, you should be able to do  (multiple lines of text on the screen at the same time) and  (the ability to freely place subtitles anywhere on the screen). Anything less and you are likely to run into trouble the moment you get to something as simple as a next episode preview:</p><figure data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><a href=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/saki-s3-fansub-1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><img src=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/saki-s3-fansub-1.jpg\" alt=\"A screenshot from a next episode preview. It features a static sign saying 'Next episode preview' on top left, a similar sign for the title of the next episode on the bottom right, and you have dialogue running through the whole preview while these signs are visible, meaning you need at least three overlaps and positioning to handle it gracefully.\" loading=\"lazy\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"></a><figcaption data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><p>Multiple instances of on-screen text are running in parallel with dialogue. Screenshot from  (Winter&nbsp;2014, Underwater-FFF fansubs)</p></figcaption></figure><p>Overlaps and positioning are really just the bare necessities for dealing with on-screen text in anime though – ideally, you should also be able to use different fonts, colors, animate text in various ways, etc. Making use of all these possibilities is an art unto itself, and <strong>this art of on-screen text localization is commonly referred to as typesetting</strong>. Typesetting is important even when dubbing anime, as all that on-screen text is going to be there in the video all the same!</p><h2>So why would Crunchyroll get rid of typesetting?</h2><p>That is a good question. It is no exaggeration to say that up to this point, Crunchyroll with its typesetting was the unambiguous market leader when it came to presentation quality for official anime subtitles… though for the most part, <strong>other services dealing in anime have never even bothered to try.</strong> Sentai Filmworks’ <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidive\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Hidive</a> is just about the only other anime service that even attempts to do typesetting, though they license so few shows per season that they are a tiny player compared to the Big Boys of anime streaming.</p><p>And it is very likely the existence of these Big Boys that has played a key part in Crunchyroll’s eradication of its typesetting. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Netflix</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon Prime Video</a> probably need no introduction to anyone reading this – both are very popular general streaming services. <strong>Despite anime being only a minor part of their catalogs, a large chunk of today’s anime watching worldwide happens through said services</strong> thanks to their sheer user counts alone.</p><p>Crunchyroll clearly seems to know this, which is why it has been sublicensing its anime properties to both Amazon and Netflix for multiple years at this point. <strong>But with such sublicensing comes the matter of dealing with the subtitling standards of general streaming services.</strong> I’m not going to mince words: these standards are  at least as far as anime is concerned. Netflix for example insists that you <a href=\"https://partnerhelp.netflixstudios.com/hc/en-us/articles/215758617-Timed-Text-Style-Guide-General-Requirements#h_01JX10EE4EPSNQ2R6HGDADJBZA\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">stick to at most two lines of text on screen at once,</a> which makes sense most of the time… if you’re talking about dialogue alone. Unfortunately, it becomes completely inadequate when dealing with anime’s plentiful on-screen text. Moreover, the standards of these services actively refuse to give you tools like positioning and overlaps, even though the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timed_Text_Markup_Language\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">TTML subtitle format</a> they use supports said features!</p><p>With such typesetting-hostile standards to deal with, Crunchyroll had basically two choices for how to make sublicensing to Amazon and Netflix work with their existing subtitles that feature actual typesetting: Either 1) try to negotiate with the services for permission to make use of more TTML capabilities (that the subtitle renderers of said services should already support!) or 2) <strong>start mangling subtitles with typesetting into something compatible with the awful subtitling standards of the general streaming services.</strong> I am not aware if Crunchyroll ever attempted the former, but I can confirm that it eventually started doing the latter.</p><p>Editors among Crunchyroll’s subtitling staff were  to convert finished high quality subtitles with typesetting into limited low quality TTML subtitles without typesetting, compatible with Amazon &amp; Netflix subtitling standards. They got paid extra for the manual effort required by the process.</p><figure data-astro-cid-rkgwkvbt=\"\"><figcaption data-astro-cid-rkgwkvbt=\"\">Overlapping on-screen text and dialogue makes for a miserable anime watching experience with limited TTML subtitles. Video clip from  (Winter&nbsp;2018, Netflix)</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, after a couple years of this kind of manual conversion work, the Crunchyroll leadership seems to have decided that it isn’t enough, and that <strong>Crunchyroll must do away with high quality subtitles with typesetting entirely and only produce low quality TTML subtitles without typesetting from now on.</strong> But if they already had a working process for high quality subtitles at home and low quality TTML subtitles elsewhere, why would they just decide to give that up in order to produce exclusively low quality subtitles? It doesn’t seem to make very much sense, even as a cost-cutting measure. There should be so much value in being able to advertise <em>best viewed on Crunchyroll</em> to potential audiences for long-term growth, right?</p><p>To understand  we need to look into some relevant history. <strong>Specifically, what happened after Sony bought Crunchyroll and merged it with Funimation,</strong> another US anime distributor that Sony had bought previously. But in order to also understand  first we need to look at what both Crunchyroll and Funimation were like before this fateful merger happened, as well as how they approached anime subtitling over the years.</p><h2>A short history of Crunchyroll and its subtitling standards</h2><p>Crunchyroll launched in 2006 as a pirate streaming site focused on East Asian media content, featuring <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fansub\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">fansubbed</a> anime, live action drama, music videos, and so on. There was nothing particularly remarkable about the site back then – as a rule of thumb, pirate streaming sites are always worse quality-wise than if you just directly downloaded the pirated releases they use as a base, and the sites mostly exist to make their admins illicit money through ads, begging for donations, and other shady crap. It is important to note though that <strong>legal anime streaming basically wasn’t a thing at this time.</strong></p><figure data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><a href=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/crunchyroll-in-2007.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><img src=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/crunchyroll-in-2007.png\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"></a><figcaption data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><p>Crunchyroll in 2007. The “help out” message at the top is asking for donations.</p></figcaption></figure><p>However, it was likely this exact venture capital funding that enabled Crunchyroll to negotiate a major deal with the Japanese broadcasting company TV Tokyo, which was announced at the start of 2009. <strong>This announcement brought with it the news that Crunchyroll was going full-time legitimate and getting rid of all its pirate content.</strong> With this move, Crunchyroll found itself in a position of having to start producing subtitles of its own (instead of just uploading fansubs) and somehow present said subtitles to its customers.</p><figure data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><a href=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/aegisub.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><img src=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/aegisub.png\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"></a><figcaption data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><p>Aegisub is an advanced subtitling software built by fansubbers, for fansubbers.</p></figcaption></figure><p>For the subtitle production part, Crunchyroll managed to strike a deal with a bunch of fansubbers to take on the job. This single decision was a fateful one, as it was the foundation for basically everything that came after – with former fansubbers on the job, the tools of the trade were set according to the standards of fansubbers: the subtitling software of choice was to be <a href=\"https://aegisub.org/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Aegisub</a>, and <strong>the subtitle format of choice was to be Aegisub’s native format, Advanced SubStation Alpha, or ASS for short.</strong></p><p>ASS is an extremely powerful format in terms of formatting and styling capabilities, and with Aegisub, it is easy to produce ASS subtitles that make use of said capabilities. <strong>However, as a streaming site, Crunchyroll needed to be able to present these ASS subtitles in the browser somehow,</strong> and the only full-fledged ASS renderers that existed were only available in the traditional local media playback environments targeted by fansubbers, which meant that Crunchyroll couldn’t make use of said renderers on the web directly.</p><p>Now, there are two main ways to subtitle videos, with opposing pros and cons:</p><ul><li> – the subtitles are burned into the video itself.  as you only need to be able to play video, <strong>but inflexible for updates and multiple languages</strong> as you have to recreate your video files over and over again with expensive processing called .</li><li> – the subtitles exist as their own separate media track that the video player renders on top of the video in realtime during playback, making softsubs <strong>complex to playback, but updates and multiple tracks are very cheap</strong> as you only need to deal with tiny subtitle files while the video files remain unchanged.</li></ul><p>As such, one way Crunchyroll could have solved the subtitle presentation problem would have been to simply hardsub its ASS subtitles, but despite the challenges it posed, Crunchyroll decided to go with softsubbing instead (which was also the fansub standard at the time). <strong>And so Crunchyroll set out to build its own ASS renderer in Flash,</strong> the primary technology used to play video on the web at the time. Here’s a screenshot of some of the first subtitles ever officially authored by the fully legitimate Crunchyroll, rendered in the current ASS renderer but adhering to the limits of the company’s very first Flash subtitle renderer:</p><figure data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><a href=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/saki-cr-1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><img src=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/saki-cr-1.jpg\" alt=\"A screenshot from a next episode preview.

Now, the positioning was limited to the eight edges and the center of the screen, making for just nine possible positions total, but even that was enough to handle the humble next episode preview at the very least. Beyond these, the first version also supported fading animations. It wasn’t much, <strong>but it did cover the bare minimum for dealing with on-screen text in anime.</strong></p><p>Over the years, Crunchyroll managed to slowly improve its Flash subtitle renderer to enable the use of more ASS features. Custom colors, multiple fonts, multiple styles, rotation, and full positioning were implemented (albeit in somewhat hacky and unwieldy fashion). This went on until 2018, when Crunchyroll was faced with a major issue: <strong>Flash was seeing rapid decline in use, and web streaming was shifting over to HTML5-based technology.</strong> However, with a custom ASS renderer built in Flash, Crunchyroll couldn’t easily make the change, as it would mean having to essentially rebuild the custom subtitle renderer they had from scratch in HTML5 (as much like in the Flash days, there still were no solutions native to the web available for rendering ASS subtitles).</p><p>However, Crunchyroll managed to come up with a way to solve the problem of moving from Flash to HTML5 with the help of another new web technology called <a href=\"https://webassembly.org/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">WebAssembly</a>, which allowed developers to take code that wasn’t developed for the web and compile it for use on the web. With WebAssembly, Crunchyroll could take <a href=\"https://github.com/libass/libass\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">libass</a>, one of the few fully-featured ASS renderers out there, and <a href=\"https://github.com/libass/JavascriptSubtitlesOctopus\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">use it for their new HTML5 player</a>. Now, not only did all their old ASS subtitles render nicely in HTML5, but <strong>the possibilities for typesetting at Crunchyroll had taken a huge leap forward.</strong> And the subtitling staff at Crunchyroll was more than happy to make use of this newfound power.</p><figure data-astro-cid-rkgwkvbt=\"\"><figcaption data-astro-cid-rkgwkvbt=\"\">You couldn’t see typesetting like this on Crunchyroll back in the days of Flash. Video clip from  (Fall&nbsp;2022, Crunchyroll)</figcaption></figure><p>That said, despite having a technically fully-featured ASS renderer to work with, <strong>there were still limitations.</strong> Code compiled with WebAssembly runs worse compared to its original native counterpart, which limits how heavy the typesetting can be (with the flexible features of ASS, it is very easy to produce typesetting that simply cannot be rendered in realtime even on powerful computers, resulting in notable lag during playback). A commercial service like Crunchyroll will also generally want to keep its content watchable even on lower-end devices, which further reduces how complex any typesetting can be.</p><p>And this is the limited but functional standard of typesetting that Crunchyroll users got to enjoy (with first-party subtitles) up until the fateful season of Fall 2025 that prompted the creation of this article.</p><p>Before we move to the conclusions for this section, though, it is worth noting that while Crunchyroll currently uses softsubbed ASS subtitles whenever it can, there are platforms and devices (like various TVs) where this kind of ASS rendering simply isn’t possible to do. <strong>Crunchyroll is available on some platforms like this, which means it has been making additional hardsubbed versions of everything on top of the usual softsubbed ones.</strong></p><p>So, what can we learn from all this? At least one thing is abundantly clear: for most of its existence, <strong>the leadership at Crunchyroll had at least some respect and understanding for anime as a medium.</strong> They understood that it was important to be able to deal with on-screen text in their subtitles, and allocated enough resources to make typesetting possible. The company even managed to improve in this regard over time, albeit very slowly.</p><p>That said, anyone familiar with anime fansubs of the 2010s and 2020s probably can’t help but feel disappointed that even the highest effort typesetting from Crunchyroll could only ever be on the level of fansub releases from around 2010 at best. Why 2010 specifically? <strong>Because from 2011 onwards, fansubbers started widely incorporating advanced motion tracking into their typesetting.</strong> Observe an example of such fansub typesetting from over a decade ago, the likes of which has never been seen on Crunchyroll:</p><figure data-astro-cid-rkgwkvbt=\"\"><figcaption data-astro-cid-rkgwkvbt=\"\">Video clip from  (Fall&nbsp;2013, Underwater fansubs)</figcaption></figure><p>Now, while fansubbers giving away their work for free might get away with saying <q>just get a better computer</q> to anyone whose devices can’t render softsubbed typesetting like this in realtime, an official service that lots of people pay for doesn’t really have the same luxury, which is the main reason why you don’t see stuff like this softsubbed on Crunchyroll. But this is not an insurmountable problem, so make no mistake: <strong>official anime services could absolutely offer typesetting with similar level of quality to the best of fansubs.</strong> The basic solution to the performance problem is very simple, even: you simply hardsub the typesetting. This would work from streaming to physical disc releases and only the sky would be the limit in terms of the typesetting quality you could offer, as realtime rendering would no longer be a concern!</p><p>Now, as mentioned earlier, hardsubbing does make things more complicated and expensive on the backend as you need to encode and store multiple copies of video. Crunchyroll is already dealing with this, though! But if costs are an issue, the system is pretty easy to improve in theory: if you keep the dialogue softsubbed, only the parts of the video that actually feature typesetting would be hardsubbed, and with some clever engineering and an understanding of how modern media formats work, you would only have to keep multiple copies of the typeset parts. <strong>And since the average anime episode has on-screen text only for a small percentage of its total runtime, combining softsubbed dialogue and hardsubbed typesetting like this would make for a highly cost-effective setup.</strong></p><figure data-astro-cid-rkgwkvbt=\"\"><figcaption data-astro-cid-rkgwkvbt=\"\">Typesetting like this would be possible to do even for official anime services. Video clip from  (Fall&nbsp;2021, Chasa fansubs)</figcaption></figure><p>And since with a mixed system like this you would only have softsubs for the technically simpler dialogue, you could even convert these dialogue-only ASS subtitles to a simpler but more widely supported subtitle format for playback, <strong>which theoretically should do away with the need to keep fully hardsubbed copies around entirely, without any real loss in quality!</strong> I actually built a minimal version of a mixed system like this myself when I was doing some anime streaming work a few years back and can confidently say that <strong>this would be extremely doable for any official anime service… as long as they just cared enough.</strong></p><figure data-astro-cid-rkgwkvbt=\"\"><figcaption data-astro-cid-rkgwkvbt=\"\">Keep this example of fansub typesetting in mind for later. Video clip from <em>Danganronpa: The Animation</em> (Summer&nbsp;2013, UTW fansubs)</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, any interest Crunchyroll had for improving their subtitle rendering for typesetting seemed to run out after the 2018 transition to WebAssembly libass. <strong>Not that it actually ever seemed to be all that high to begin with, though,</strong> as evident by some of the low-hanging fruit that Crunchyroll never bothered to pick in this regard; the most obvious of which would be Crunchyroll’s dogged insistence to restrict typesetting font choices to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_fonts_for_the_Web\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Core Fonts for the Web</a>. Free for commercial use fonts have been plentily available since the Flash days, and custom fonts have been well supported on the web for a similarly long time.</p><p>Anyway, it would have never been all that hard for Crunchyroll to support custom fonts for typesetting, especially after the 2018 move to HTML5. The underlying technology was there and font files are tiny in size compared to the video files being streamed – this would have been an extremely simple and effective improvement for all typesetting efforts. Yet Crunchyroll never reached for this improvement, which is why  has kept appearing in Crunchyroll typesetting with depressing regularity.</p><figure data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><a href=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/kanokari-cr-1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><img src=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/kanokari-cr-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"></a><figcaption data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><p>There it is again.  Screenshot from  (Summer&nbsp;2023, Crunchyroll)</p></figcaption></figure><p>It is also disappointing <strong>how regularly the anime staples of opening &amp; ending songs are still left untranslated on Crunchyroll,</strong> though this issue is admittedly <a href=\"https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/answerman/2017-09-01/.120752\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">much harder to solve than you’d expect.</a> Still, it is possible to do so, especially with Sony’s resources behind the company today. That goes double when Sony is involved in anime production in any way, as then the songs being used should be well-known to all relevant parties well in advance of airing for timely rights-clearing. <strong>So if Crunchyroll/Sony is in any way involved with an anime’s production, it should basically always be possible for songs to be translated the moment the first episode is released.</strong></p><p>But that’s enough about Crunchyroll’s history. Now it’s time to look at the other company mentioned earlier and see how they’ve fared in comparison…</p><h2>A short history of Funimation and its subtitling standards</h2><p>In the early 90s, Japanese-American businessman Gen Fukunaga was approached by his uncle who was working as a producer for Toei. A proposal was made: if Fukunaga could start an anime company in US, Toei would license the rights to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Ball\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Dragon Ball</a> franchise to it – a franchise that was already making mad cash in Japan. Sensing an opportunity, Fukunaga found investors, and thus in 1994 Funimation was born. A year later, Dragon Ball was on US TV, dubbed and edited to <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20060518193827/http://www.animecauldron.com/dbzuncensored2/misc/footsteps.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">“conform to American sensibilities and tastes”</a>.</p><figure data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><a href=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/dbz-promo-art.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><img src=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/dbz-promo-art.jpg\" alt=\"Promotional art for the Dragon Ball Z anime, featuring some of its cast members.\" loading=\"lazy\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"></a><figcaption data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><p>It was especially  (1989-1996) that hit it big in the US.</p></figcaption></figure><p>In the early 2000s, fueled by Dragon Ball’s success, Funimation started expanding its business by getting home video distribution rights for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4Kids_Entertainment\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">4Kids Entertainment</a> licenses and non-Japanese kids’ cartoons, the latter eventually expanding into getting involved in production too. But beyond increased investment in kids’ cartoons, <strong>Funimation also started experimenting with more anime licenses of its own,</strong> the 2001 anime adaption for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruits_Basket\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fruits Basket</a> being one of its early standout releases.</p><p>Out of these various expansion attempts, <strong>“more anime” seemed to be the one to work out best,</strong> and towards the end of the 00s that became the main direction of Funimation’s business. This move was helped along by a bunch of licenses obtained from now-defunct US anime publishers Geneon USA and ADV. And in the spring of 2009, hot on the heels of Crunchyroll going legit, <a href=\"https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-04-03/funimation-adds-toei-air-master-captain-harlock\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Funimation announced that they too were getting into the anime streaming business</a>. The resulting anime streams from Funimation were hardsubbed and looked like this:</p><p>What you see here is exactly what you got: plain text at top center or bottom center, with dialogue on bottom, and translations for all on-screen text piled up top. <strong>So while overlaps were technically supported, full positioning did not seem to be possible,</strong> which made things quite awkward the moment there was more than one sign visible on the screen at the same time. <strong>This was also the standard you could expect from Funimation’s DVD and Blu-ray releases.</strong> And beyond the way too common dialogue three-liners (which are generally terrible for readability), sometimes you even saw :</p><figure data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><a href=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/d-frag-funi-1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><img src=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/d-frag-funi-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"></a><figcaption data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><p>Screenshot from  (Winter&nbsp;2014, Funimation)</p></figcaption></figure><p>The subtitling software that Funimation was using at the time was <a href=\"https://www.telestream.net/captioning/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Telestream MacCaption</a>.

Screenshot from  (Spring&nbsp;2017, Funimation/Crunchyroll)</p></figcaption></figure><p>Nothing else of particular note happened during this time period when it comes to Funimation’s subtitles. However, it is worth mentioning that <strong>Funimation dubs did have simple hardsubbed typesetting sometimes;</strong> this only seemed happen at the whim of the dubbing side of Funimation though, as these hardsubbed signs were never present in the subbed versions, nor were they a consistent feature of Funimation dubs in general.</p><p><strong>In 2017, Sony purchased Funimation</strong> as part of its growing collection of international anime distributors (Sony had previously bought Madman Anime and AnimeLab in Australia and Wakanim in Europe). As a result of this buyout, towards the end of 2018 the license sharing deal between Funimation and Crunchyroll was dissolved and soon after <strong>Funimation started serving new subtitled streams on FunimationNow, which were softsubbed</strong> and looked like this:</p><p><strong>No longer were the subtitles even making use of overlaps.</strong> Where dialogue translation used to go on bottom and sign translation on top when both were present, now all text was stuck on the same side of the screen together, either on top or bottom, but never both at the same time anymore.</p><p>How this further reduction in subtitling capabilities came about cannot be said for sure, but there are several possible explanations. For one, another major thing that happened at the end of 2018: <a href=\"https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2018-12-04/funimation-hulu-sign-first-look-streaming-deal-for-new-anime/.140359\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Funimation signed a big sublicensing deal</a> with the general streaming service <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Hulu</a>, which meant <strong>dealing with Hulu’s subtitling standards and authoring accordingly limited subtitles</strong> – because as could be expected, the subtitling standards of a general streaming service did not account for the needs of anime in any real way.</p><figure data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><a href=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/mha-funi-hulu.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><img src=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/mha-funi-hulu.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"></a><figcaption data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><p>Only the middle column of the blackboard is translated here. Good luck figuring that out with subtitles like these. Screenshot from  (Fall&nbsp;2019, Funimation/Hulu)</p></figcaption></figure><p>Another possible reason for these less-than-great changes in Funimation’s subtitling standards was that around this time the company <strong>started using the cloud-based subtitling toolkit OOONA Tools</strong> by the localization service provider <a href=\"https://www.ooona.net/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">OOONA</a>. OOONA Tools, by default, <strong>do not allow for the creation of subtitles with overlaps.</strong> While it can be done in OOONA today by tweaking the options or by using OOONA’s track features (which are quite similar to those of MacCaption, incidentally), it is possible that at the time these features were either not available or that it wasn’t possible to correctly export subtitles with overlaps to the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/webvtt1/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">WebVTT subtitle format</a> that was being used on FunimationNow.</p><figure data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><a href=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/ooona-create.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><img src=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/ooona-create.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"></a><figcaption data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><p>Screenshot of , the primary subtitling software in OOONA Tools.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Regarding that last possibility in particular, there is <a href=\"https://archive.is/nRpg1\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">this OOONA FAQ entry</a> that mentions how <q>not all formats support […] overlapping subtitles</q> and that <q>Currently, it’s supported in IMSC1.1, ITT and Videotron Lambda CAP exports</q>. However, based on my own testing, OOONA Tools can properly export subtitles with overlaps in more formats today than just the ones mentioned here (including WebVTT), meaning that the FAQ entry is in fact outdated – <strong>but it was likely true at some point.</strong></p><p>In any case, this was the extremely limited standard of subtitling that Funimation customers had to live with until the service was shut down in 2024 as a result of the Funimation-Crunchyroll merger.</p><p>Now, what can we conclude from all this? If nothing else, one thing seems abundantly clear: <strong>the Funimation leadership never truly cared about or respected anime as a medium.</strong> From the very beginning, it’s clear that Gen Fukunaga (a businessman in his 30s at the time) got into the business <strong>with the mindset of making money with kids’ cartoons,</strong> and this only became more evident with how Funimation tried to expand into more types of kids’ cartoons before eventually realizing that anime is where the money was at.</p><p>But even with this eventual focus on more anime, <strong>no resources seem to have ever been dedicated to make typesetting an actual thing at Funimation,</strong> despite how obviously beneficial it would have been for their key product of localized anime. And the way Funimation never even bothered to figure out how to make the most of MacCaption, the expensive enterprise subtitling software they kept using for over a decade… while I speculated about possible technical reasons for Funimation abandoning even overlaps when they started producing softsubs for FunimationNow, there was always one possible additional reason: <strong>they just didn’t care at all.</strong> They ran into a problem, no resources were dedicated to fix the problem, and the subtitles got permanently worse as a result.</p><figure data-astro-cid-rkgwkvbt=\"\"><figcaption data-astro-cid-rkgwkvbt=\"\">Remember the fansubbed version of this from earlier? Here’s Funimation in comparison. Video clip from <em>Danganronpa: The Animation</em> (Summer&nbsp;2013, Funimation)</figcaption></figure><p>The whole move to OOONA was questionable in itself, as while OOONA was capable of exporting subtitles to both WebVTT for FunimationNow and TTML (or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubRip\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SRT</a>, a very limited subtitle format) for Hulu in 2018,  Why start paying for a monthly subscription service when your existing paid-for enterprise software should be able to deal with your needs just fine? I suspect the primary motivation behind the move (which could have even originated from the new parent company Sony) might have been the fact that it was trendy for companies at the time to move everything they possibly could to The Cloud™, regardless of how much sense it actually made… but that’s enough about OOONA for now.</p><p>Ultimately, <strong>Funimation’s subtitling standards were extremely poor to begin with, and they only managed to make them worse over time.</strong> That is something that only utter indifference or outright disdain for anime as a medium could bring about, which seems to have been the exact attitude that Gen Fukunaga cultivated at the executive levels of Funimation – <strong>and his followers appear to have carried the torch even after his departure from the company.</strong> But more on that in the next section, when we finally get to the Funimation-Crunchyroll merger.</p><h2>The Funimation-Crunchyroll merger and its consequences</h2><p>Following Sony’s 2017 purchase of Funimation, in 2019 Sony bought out Gen Fukunaga from the company entirely, which led to him stepping down as the General Manager, with Colin Decker taking his place. Soon after, Sony formed the Funimation Global Group to consolidate all the international anime publishing services it had bought, with Decker in charge of the joint venture as the CEO. Then, in late 2020, <strong>Sony announced that they were going to buy Crunchyroll, placing it under the executive control of the Funimation Global Group.</strong> The acquisition was completed in August 2021, coming with a statement from Sony that their goal is to <a href=\"https://www.sonypictures.com/corp/press_releases/2021/0809/sonysfunimationglobalgroupcompletesacquisitionofcrunchyrollfromatt\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">“create a unified anime subscription experience as soon as possible”</a>.</p><figure data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><a href=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/funiroll.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><img src=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/funiroll.jpg\" alt=\"Crunchyroll and Funimation logos side by side.\" loading=\"lazy\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"></a><figcaption data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><p>Soon, there would only be one.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Then, in March 2022, the news came that Funimation, Crunchyroll, Wakanim, and VRV (Crunchyroll’s more general streaming service) would all be merged together into a single streaming service that would exist under the name of Crunchyroll (as it had the strongest brand of the lot). <strong>Funimation Global Group LLC was renamed to Crunchyroll LLC, with Funimation executives remaining in charge.</strong> Soon after, Colin Decker stepped down as the CEO, with Rahul Purini (previously COO) taking his place. The merger was complete.</p><p>Things weren’t much better for those left behind, as laid out in <a href=\"https://archive.ph/jxvFK\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">this Bloomberg article</a> from 2024. Staff from Funimation was notably hostile towards those from Crunchyroll:</p><blockquote><p>Tension between the camps arose almost immediately. In a Zoom meeting announcing [Sony’s purchase of Crunchyroll], <strong>Funimation workers accused Crunchyroll of being pirates,</strong> alluding to the site’s history, according to two people who were present.</p></blockquote><p>While Crunchyroll workers were quickly frustrated with the new executives from Funimation:</p><blockquote><p>Current or former employees describe Crunchyroll’s new management–primarily from Funimation–as out-of-touch with employees and the anime fans the company once prioritized. <strong>Some executives write off anime as “kids’ cartoons,”</strong> they said, and resist hiring job candidates who describe themselves as fans.</p></blockquote><h3>How typesetting gets destroyed</h3><p>In 2025, the executives came up with an idea: Crunchyroll should move away from <a href=\"https://daiz.moe/crunchyroll-is-destroying-its-subtitles-for-no-good-reason/#aegisub-ass-introduction\">Aegisub and ASS subtitles with typesetting</a> and start producing exclusively <a href=\"https://daiz.moe/crunchyroll-is-destroying-its-subtitles-for-no-good-reason/#ttml-example\">limited TTML subtitles without typesetting</a> in <a href=\"https://daiz.moe/crunchyroll-is-destroying-its-subtitles-for-no-good-reason/#ooona-introduction\">OOONA Tools</a>. <strong>The likely end goal of this is to get rid of Crunchyroll’s <a href=\"https://daiz.moe/crunchyroll-is-destroying-its-subtitles-for-no-good-reason/#cr-libass\">unique ASS-based subtitle rendering</a> entirely in favor of something more “industry standard” like TTML-based subtitle rendering.</strong> This would mean no longer having to pay staff for manual ASS-to-TTML conversion, as well as being able to drop the relatively expensive fully hardsubbed encodes for limited playback environments where ASS rendering is not possible <em>(but some sort of TTML rendering usually is).</em></p><p><strong>However, a major change affecting all aspects of the company’s subtitling pipeline doesn’t happen overnight,</strong> especially considering Crunchyroll’s large back catalog of ASS subtitles with typesetting that couldn’t be automatically converted to limited TTML subtitles without typesetting. So while the subtitling staff was to be (begrudgingly) busy experimenting and onboarding with OOONA and doing manual ASS-to-TTML conversions for back catalog titles, <strong>technical work would also need to be done to prepare for this vision of a TTML-only future.</strong></p><figure data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><a href=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/moneat-cr-1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><img src=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/moneat-cr-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"></a><figcaption data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><p>And what an exciting future of not being able to read signs that would be! Screenshot from <em>This Monster Wants to Eat Me</em> (Fall&nbsp;2025, Crunchyroll)</p></figcaption></figure><p>For this purpose, Crunchyroll seems to have decided that it would take its existing manual ASS-to-TTML conversions produced by the subtitling staff and treat them as the new master subtitle files. These TTML “masters” would then be—for the time being—converted back to ASS with <a href=\"https://www.closedcaptionconverter.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Closed Caption Converter</a> for use with the current ASS-based subtitle rendering. And so, with the start of the Fall 2025 anime season, a plan like this was pushed to production; while regular ASS subtitles were still being produced by Crunchyroll’s subtitling staff, <strong>these ASS subtitles with typesetting were generally left unused, while only limited ASS-to-TTML-to-ASS conversions without typesetting were being presented to customers on most shows.</strong></p><p>Implementing this interim pipeline with Closed Caption Converter didn’t seem to go exactly as planned, though, <strong>as some Fall 2025 shows on Crunchyroll ended up having no subtitles at all on release,</strong> including the premieres of the latest seasons of hit shows <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Hero_Academia\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">My Hero Academia</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spy_%C3%97_Family\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Spy × Family</a>.</p><blockquote><p>Over the past few days, some users experienced delays in accessing the content they wanted and subtitle issues across certain series. These were caused by internal system problems – not by any change in how we create subtitles, use of new vendors or AI. Those internal issues have now been fully resolved.</p><p>Quality subtitles are a core part of what makes watching anime on Crunchyroll so special. They connect global fans to the heart of every story, and we take that responsibility seriously.</p><p>Thank you for your patience. We’re committed to continuing to deliver the authenticity, quality, and care that fans deserve.</p></blockquote><p>Following this statement, some of the new Fall 2025 shows have had their ASS-to-TTML-to-ASS subtitles switched out to the previously unused regular ASS subtitles. Other shows haven’t. <strong>And some shows in the Crunchyroll back catalog have been updated with ASS-to-TTML-to-ASS subtitles,</strong> though the exact timing of these back catalog updates is unknown.</p><p>With all of this, <strong>the future of typesetting on Crunchyroll is unclear.</strong></p><p>And that’s how we’ve found ourselves in the situation we face today. Remember what the <a href=\"https://daiz.moe/crunchyroll-is-destroying-its-subtitles-for-no-good-reason/#cr-first-subs\">first Crunchyroll subtitles from 2009</a> looked like? Yeah, these new subtitles adhering to limited TTML standards <em>are even worse than the subtitles from 2009</em> in terms of how on-screen text can be handled! In other words: <strong>The presentation quality of Crunchyroll’s first-party subtitles has reached an all-time low in 2025.</strong></p><figure data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><a href=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/chitose-cr-1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><img src=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/chitose-cr-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"></a><figcaption data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><p>Can’t even handle a next episode preview properly anymore. Screenshot from <em>Chitose Is in the Ramune Bottle</em> (Fall&nbsp;2025, Crunchyroll)</p></figcaption></figure><p>There is only one conclusion that can be drawn from that: <strong>the Funimation-turned-Crunchyroll executives still do not have any respect for anime as a medium.</strong> In addition, they seem to be treating Crunchyroll and its ways of doing things as the ways of  – which isn’t entirely incorrect, as Crunchyroll’s use of Aegisub and ASS  originate from the ways of pirate fansubbers. But fansubbers deeply care about anime as medium (they wouldn’t be illegally subtitling it for free as a hobby otherwise), which in turn means that <strong>the ways fansubbers have developed to subtitle anime are in fact extremely efficient for the job</strong> – much better than basically any “industry standards” for subtitling, even.</p><p>But that clearly doesn’t matter to the executives. <strong>The only thing that seems to be on their mind is how to best make money with kids’ cartoons</strong> that none of them personally watch, and what they seem to consider “best” is <em>getting rid of everything positively unique about Crunchyroll in favor of doing things the Funimation way,</em> even if that means ditching Aegisub and ASS in favor of OOONA Tools and TTML and getting rid of typesetting in the process.  conclusion is further supported by the fact that  with notable reduction in typesetting quality on Blu-ray as a result:</p><p>Then there’s the whole plan of moving to OOONA in general, which is even more questionable than it was back in the Funimation days. <strong>Crunchyroll has a lot more to lose in terms of subtitle quality than Funimation ever did,</strong> yet the executives seem to want to go back to their “old reliable” regardless. I can’t even see it saving them any money in the long run, considering that Aegisub is completely free software while OOONA will incur constant ongoing costs with its per-user subscription pricing. Rather than authoring limited TTML in OOONA directly, <strong>paying the subtitling staff to keep the manual ASS to TTML conversions going would likely be cheaper!</strong></p><p>Beyond that, there is also the thing about <strong>OOONA being an Israeli company.</strong> It is certainly a choice, not only in 2018 but most certainly in 2025, to heavily invest in the services of a company from a country that is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_genocide\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">actively committing genocide</a>. However, to quell some unsubstantiated internet discourse I have seen in relation to this, I do want to emphasize that <strong>OOONA being Israeli is not really directly relevant to the quality issues this article is about.</strong></p><figure data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><a href=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/eztitles.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><img src=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/eztitles.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"></a><figcaption data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><p>EZTitles is another popular enterprise subtitling software. Notice how they mention AI directly in their navigation.</p></figcaption></figure><p>The reason for this lies in enterprise subtitling software (“industry standards”) being universally poor when it comes to producing high quality typesetting for anime, so it wouldn’t really matter which software suite a switch was being made to – <strong>no matter what, moving away from Aegisub would destroy typesetting as it currently exists on Crunchyroll.</strong> And while Crunchyroll’s CEO has expressed his interest in AI subtitles, at least currently there has been no signs of any kind of AI (Israeli or otherwise) being used to create first-party subtitles on Crunchyroll.</p><h3>Why Crunchyroll is so confident it will get away with this (or: how capitalism ruins everything)</h3><p>Finally, I want to talk about the possible reasons for Crunchyroll executives feeling so confident about getting away with making their own primary product so much worse. Ultimately, it comes down to the fact that <strong>international anime licensing operates primarily on an exclusive licensing model.</strong> This means that generally only one service will be able to offer a specific title in specific language(s) in specific region(s), unless the service voluntarily decides to sublicense it out to others. This in turn upends the assumption that the existence of multiple anime services would be beneficial to consumers, <strong>as the services don’t actually have to engage in competition on customer-beneficial factors like service quality almost at all</strong> – instead, they can just focus on hoarding as many exclusive licenses as possible.</p><figure data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><a href=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/kun-gao-ama.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-astro-cid-73yd5zmh=\"\"><img src=\"https://daiz.moe/content/crunchyroll/kun-gao-ama.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of three comments from a Reddit AMA.

Dreams of infinite growth are what drives the modern-day game of capitalism, and spending money to please customers rather than shareholders goes directly against said dreams. <strong>It’s all about spending as little money as possible to make as much money as possible.</strong></p><div><p>This is why the capitalists in charge of all the big companies these days are so excited about AI too: nothing gets them going more than the idea of not having for pay for those pesky human employees. <em>This is no doubt the actual reason why Crunchyroll CEO Rahul Purini is interested in AI subtitles.</em> It doesn’t matter that <em>anime localization costs are a drop in the bucket compared to the overall costs of anime production,</em> even if you were talking about super high quality work with fansub-level typesetting. <em>Any excuse to cut the wages of real human workers is one step closer to the next yacht purchase for the executive upper class.</em></p></div><p>…Whew, got a bit heated there. Anyway, the most likely reason why Crunchyroll executives believe they can get away with reducing the quality of their own service so much? <strong>Because Crunchyroll doesn’t have any meaningful competition thanks to the primarily-exclusive licensing model used by the international anime industry.</strong> Even if they make the service worse, what can you do about it?

A Pico capable of pushing 11 MB/s over Ethernet could form the basis of compact, inexpensive test instruments, remote sensors, or experimental network interfaces — all without a dedicated PHY chip. As these bit-banged interfaces become faster and more capable, the question naturally follows: how far can software-defined hardware really go on a two-dollar microcontroller?</p></article><div data-tag=\"300\"> Subscribe to the tag <a href=\"https://www.elektormagazine.com/tags/raspberry-pi\">Raspberry Pi</a> and you will receive an e-mail as soon as a new item about it is published on our website! </div>",

We are excited to be able to help support this pivotal technology and to help build the next generation of llamafile.</p><p>We're building the next generation of llamafile in the open, and we want our roadmap decisions to be informed by your actual needs and use cases. We'd love to hear your thoughts on:</p><ul><li>Why did you choose llamafile in the first place?</li><li>What features do you rely on most?</li><li>Why are you still using it? (Or, perhaps more tellingly, why did you move to another tool?)</li><li>What would make llamafile more useful for your work?</li></ul><p>Over the coming weeks and months, you'll see new activity in the llamafile repository as we incorporate your feedback into our roadmap. The code continues to be public, the issues are open, and we're eager to hear what you think. If you're currently using llamafile, nothing changes for you. Your existing workflows will continue working as expected. GitHub will handle the redirects, and all binaries linked in the repo will remain available.</p><p>If llamafile has been part of your toolkit, we'd love to know what made it valuable. If you tried it once and moved on, we want to learn why. And if you've never used it but are curious about running AI models locally for the first time, now may be a good time to give it a try ;)&nbsp;</p><p>llamafile has shown us what was possible as a community.

      "content": "<h2>SDN Grew First and Fastest in Datacenters</h2><p>The first large-scale deployments of SDN took place in hyperscale data centers, beginning about 2010. The story is best told by the hyperscaler companies themselves, and so we asked leaders at Google, Microsoft Azure, and Meta to tell their stories about why and how they adopted SDN. As you will see, they all started from the ideas and principles that came from the NSF-funded research; and each tailored SDN to suit their specific needs and culture.</p><p>The Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and telecommunication companies also had a strong interest in SDN. AT&amp;T played a large role in its definition, engaging in research and early deployments in the mid 2000s. We invited Albert Greenberg, who was at AT&amp;T at the time, to tell the story.</p><p>Nicira was perhaps the startup that epitomized the SDN movement. It grew out of the NSF-funded  program and the Clean Slate Program at Stanford, based on the Ph.D. work of Martín Casado. Nicira developed ONIX, the first distributed control plane, used by Google in its infrastructure; OVS, the first OpenFlow-compliant software switch; and NVP (later NSX), the first network virtualization platform. We invited Teemu Koponen, a principal architect at Nicira, to tell the story.</p><p>During the early 2010s, the networking industry began to realize that SDN has many big advantages. It lifts complex protocols up and out of the switches into the control plane, where it is written in a modern programming language. This made it possible to reason about the correctness of the protocols simply by examining the software controlling the network and the forwarding state maintained by the switches. For the first time, it became possible to formally verify the behavior of a complete network.</p><p>Researchers, startups, network equipment vendors, and hyperscalers have all taken advantage of SDN principles to develop new ways to verify network behavior. We invited Professor George Varghese, who has been deeply involved in network verification research, to give us his perspective on network verification.</p><p>A main benefit of SDN is that it hands over the keys (of control) from the networking equipment vendors—who kept their systems closed and proprietary, and hence tended to evolve slowly—to software programmers, who could define the behavior for themselves, often in open source software. And indeed it happened: Today, most large networks are controlled by software written by those who own and operate networks rather than by networking equipment vendors.</p><p>But what about the hardware? Switches, routers, firewalls, and network interface cards are all built from special-purpose ASICs—highly integrated, cost-effective, and super-fast. The problem was the features and protocols that operated on packets (for example, forwarding, routing, firewalls, and security) were all baked into hardware at the time the chip was designed, two to three years before it was deployed. What if the network owner and operator needed to change and evolve the behavior in their network, for example to add a new way to measure traffic or a new way to verify behavior? A group of researchers and entrepreneurs set out to make the switches and NICs programmable by the user, to allow more rapid improvement and give the operator greater control. Not only did new programmable devices emerge, but a whole open source movement around the P4 programming language.</p><p>We invited Professor Nate Foster, who leads the P4 language ecosystem, to tell the story of how programmable forwarding planes came about.</p><p>So far, we have focused on SDN  networks running over electrical and optical cables in datacenters, enterprises, and long-haul WANs. SDN was originally defined with wireline networks in mind.</p><p>Yet, for cellular networks, the most widely used networks in the world, the need was even greater: Cellular networks have been held back for decades by closed, proprietary, and complex “standards” designed to allow equipment vendors to maintain a strong grip on the market. SDN provides an opportunity to open up networks, introducing well-defined control APIs and interfaces, moving control software to common operating systems running on commodity servers.</p><p>This story has only just begun, but it started thanks to NSF-funded research in the mid 2000s, then boosted by DARPA-funded programs to support open source software for cellular infrastructure. We invited Guru Parulkar and Oğuz Sunay to tell the story, both of whom developed open source cellular systems at the Open Networking Foundation and for the DARPA-funded Pronto project.</p>",

Does installing Python, managing virtual environments, and synchronizing dependencies between your colleagues really have to be so difficult? Well… no! A  new tool called <a href=\"https://docs.astral.sh/uv/\" rel=\"nofollow\">uv</a> came out recently that  how easy installing and using Python can be.</p><p>uv is a free, open-source tool built by Astral, a small startup that has been churning out Python tools (like the excellent linter <a href=\"https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ruff</a>) for the past few years. uv can:</p><ul><li>Install any Python version for you</li><li>Manage virtual environments</li><li>Solve dependency conflicts  quickly ( important for big projects.)</li></ul><p>What’s best is that it can do all of the above <strong>better than any other tool</strong>, in my opinion. It’s , written in Rust, and works on almost any operating system or platform.</p><p>uv is <a href=\"https://docs.astral.sh/uv/#installation\" rel=\"nofollow\">straightforward to install</a>. There are a few ways, but the easiest (in my opinion) is this one-liner command — for Linux and Mac, it’s:</p><pre><code> https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh </code></pre><p>or on Windows in powershell:</p><pre><code>powershell  ByPass </code></pre><p>You can then access uv with the command . <strong>Installing uv will not mess up any of your existing Python installations</strong> — it’s a separate tool, so it’s safe to install it just to try it out.</p><h2>Managing Python for a project</h2><p>It’s always a good idea to work with <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41972261/what-is-a-virtualenv-and-why-should-i-use-one\" rel=\"nofollow\">virtual environments</a> for any Python project. It keeps different bits of code and dependencies ringfenced from one another, and in my experience, it can save  of hassle to get into the habit of using virtual environments as soon as you can. uv naturally uses virtual environments, so it’s very easy to start using them if you get into using uv.</p><p>uv will build a Python environment for you based on what’s specified in a  file in the directory (or parent directories) you’re working in.  files are a <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62983756/what-is-pyproject-toml-file-for\" rel=\"nofollow\">standard, modern format</a> for specifying dependencies for a Python project. A barebones one might look a bit like this:</p><pre><code></code></pre><p>In essence, it just has to specify <strong>which Python version to use</strong> and  Adding a name and version number also aren’t a bad idea.</p><p>(Sidenote: for projects that you publish as packages, such as to the Python Package Index that pip and uv use,  files are a modern way to specify <a href=\"https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/\" rel=\"nofollow\">everything you need</a> to publish your package.)</p><h2>Making a new project with uv</h2><p>To start a new Python project with uv, you can run</p><p>Which will create a new project for you, with a , a , and other important bits of boilerplate.</p><p>There are a lot of different ways to run this command, like  (which only creates a pyproject.toml),  (which sets up a new Python package), and more. I recommend running  to read about them.</p><h2>Once you have/if you already have a  file</h2><p>Once you initialize a project — or if you already have a  file in your project — it’s very easy to start using uv. You just need to do</p><p>in the directory that your  file is in. This command (and in fact, most uv commands if you haven’t ran it already) will:</p><ol><li>Automatically install a valid version of Python</li><li>Install all dependencies to a new virtual environment in the directory </li><li>Create a  file in your directory, which saves the  version of  package installed — meaning that other colleagues can replicate your Python environment exactly.</li></ol><p>In principle, you can ‘activate’ this new virtual environment like any typical virtual environment that you may have seen in other tools, but the most ‘uv-onic’ way to use uv is simply to prepend any command with . This command automatically picks up the correct virtual environment for you and runs your command with it. For instance, to run a script — instead of</p><pre><code> .venv/bin/activate\npython myscript.py</code></pre><p>which will have the same effect. Likewise, to use a ‘tool’ like Jupyter Lab, you can just do</p><p>in your project’s directory, as opposed to first ‘activating’ the environment and then running  separately.</p><p>You can always just edit your  file manually: uv will detect the changes and rebuild your project’s virtual environment. But uv also has easier ways to add dependencies — you can just do</p><p>to add a package, including specifying version constraints (like the above.) This command automatically edits your  for you.  is also extremely powerful for adding remote dependencies from git or elsewhere on your computer (but I won’t get into that here.)</p><p>Finally, I think that one of the most useful things uv can do is to pin a specific Python version for your project. Doing</p><p>would pin the current project to  Python 3.12.9 for you, and anyone else using uv — meaning that you really can replicate the  same Python install across multiple machines.</p><h2>uvx: ignore all of the above and just run a tool, now!</h2><p>But sometimes, you might just want to run a tool quickly — like using Ruff to lint code somewhere, or starting a Jupyter notebook server without an environment, or even just quickly starting an IPython session with pandas installed so you can open up a file. The  command, which has a short alias , makes this insanely easy. Running a command like</p><p>will automatically download the tool you want to use and run it in a one-off virtual environment. Once the tool has been downloaded before, this is lightning-fast because of how uv uses caches.</p><p>There are a lot of occasions when I might want to do this — a common one might be to quickly start an IPython session with pandas installed (using  to add dependencies) so that I can quickly open &amp; look at a parquet file. For instance:</p><pre><code>uvx  pandas,pyarrow ipython</code></pre><p>Or, maybe just starting a Jupyter Lab server so that I can quickly open a Jupyter notebook that a student sent me:</p><pre><code>uvx  jupyter-core jupyter lab</code></pre><p>Or honestly just so many other weird, one-off use cases where  is really nice to have around. <strong>I don’t feel like I’m missing out by always using virtual environments</strong>, because  always gives you a ‘get out of jail free’ card whenever you need it.</p><h2>If that hasn’t sold you: a personal note</h2><p>I first discovered uv last year, while working together with our other lovely developers on building <a href=\"https://astrosky.eco/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Astrosky Ecosystem</a> — a wonderful project to build open-source social media integrations for astronomers online. But with multiple developers all working asynchronously on multiple operating systems, managing Python installations quickly became a huge task.</p><p>uv is an <strong>incredibly powerful simplification</strong> for us that we use across our entire tech stack. As developers, we can all work with identical Python installations, which is especially important given a number of semi-experimental dependencies that we use that have breaking changes with every version. On GitHub Actions, we’re planning to use uv to quickly build a Python environment and run our unit tests. In production, uv already manages Python for all of our servers.</p><p>It’s just  to always know that Python and package installation will  be handled <strong>consistently and correctly</strong> across all of our machines. <strong>That’s why uv is the best thing to happen to the Python ecosystem in a decade.</strong></p>",

Stay tuned!</p><p>First, let’s explore the dithering basics with this grayscale image example.</p><p>A grayscale image has various gray shades, from black to white.</p><p>Imagine a display that only shows black or white pixels, no grays. We must turn some pixels black and others white—but how?</p><p>One way is to map each pixel to the closest available color.</p><p>Pixels darker than medium gray turn black and lighter ones turn white.</p><p>This splits pixels into black or white groups.</p><p>However, this creates a harsh image with abrupt black-white transitions.</p><p>Shadow details vanish as gray pixels become fully black or white.</p><p>Dithering fixes this by selectively pushing some pixels towards the opposite color.</p><p>Some light gray pixels that are closer to white turn black.</p><p>Likewise, some dark grays turn white.</p><p>And it's done in a way that produces special patterns which simulate shades by varying the black-and-white pixel densities.</p><p>Denser black pixels are used in darker areas, while denser white pixels are used in lighter ones.</p><p>Next question: How are these patterns generated?</p><p>One simple dithering method, known as ordered dithering, uses a threshold map.</p><p>A threshold map is a grid of values representing brightness levels, from 0 (darkest) to 1 (brightest).</p><p>To dither, we compare each input pixel’s brightness to a corresponding threshold value.</p><p>If a pixel’s brightness exceeds the threshold (it’s brighter than the threshold), the pixel turns white. Otherwise, it turns black.</p><p>Repeating this for all pixels gives us the black-and-white dither patterns.</p><p>The threshold map is designed to output patterns where the black-and-white pixel density matches the input image’s shades.</p><p>So brighter input produces patterns with more white, while darker input produces more black.</p><p>These black-and-white density variations are what create the illusion of gray shades when viewed from a distance.</p><p>To dither larger images, we extend the threshold map to match the image size and follow the same principle:</p><p>Compare each pixel’s brightness to the threshold map, then turn it black or white accordingly.</p><p>The image now uses only two colors, but its overall appearance is preserved.</p><p>The variations in shades are now replaced by variations in black/white pixel density of the dithering patterns.</p><p>And that’s how dithering works in a nutshell: it replicates shades with fewer colors, which are strategically placed to maintain the original look.</p><p>I find it a bit ironic how I used to think dithering ‘adds’ a cool effect, when what it actually does is ‘remove’ colors!</p><p>That's all for now! We’ve reached the end, but there’s still a lot more to explore.</p><p>For example, we haven’t explored the algorithm to create a threshold map. (spoiler: there are many ways!)</p><p>There’s also another algorithm called error diffusion, which doesn’t use a threshold map.</p><p>Each algorithm creates a distinct, unique look, which I believe deserves its own article.</p><p>And that's why I decided to break this series into three parts.</p><p>In the next part, I’ll dive into various algorithms for creating threshold maps.</p><p>In the final part, I’ll focus on the error diffusion algorithm.</p><p>We'll dive even deeper into dithering's mechanisms in these next 2 parts, so stay tuned!</p><p>visualrambling.space is a personal project by Damar, someone who loves to learn about different topics and rambling about them visually.</p><p>If you like this kind of visual article, please consider following me on X/Twitter and sharing this with your friends.</p><p>I'll keep creating more visual articles like this!</p><p>https://x.com/damarberlari</p>",

Encoding Eight, Sixteen, and Thirty-Two Bit Operands</h2><div>\n x86 ADD Opcode:\n </div><ul><li>When Intel designed the 8086, one bit in the opcode, \n        , selected between 8 and 16 bit integer operand sizes. \n  </li><li>Later, when CPU added 32-bit integers to its architecture on 80386 \n        chip, there was a problem:\n  <ul><li>three encodings were needed to support 8, 16, and 32 bit sizes. \n  </li></ul></li><li>Solution was an .\n  </li><li>Intel studied x86 instruction set and came to the conclusion:\n  <ul><li>in a 32-bit environment, programs were more likely to use 8-bit and \n    32-bit operands far more often than 16-bit operands.\n  </li></ul></li><li>So Intel decided to let the size bit  in the opcode \n  select between 8- and 32-bit operands.\n</li></ul><h3>11.1. Encoding Sixteen Bit Operands</h3><div>\n x86 instruction format:\n </div>\n\n32-bit programs don't use 16-bit operands that often, but they do \nneed them now and then.<p>\n\nTo allow for 16-bit operands, Intel added prefix a 32-bit mode \ninstruction with the  with value \n.</p><p>\n\nThis prefix byte tells the CPU to operand on 16-bit data rather than \n32-bit data.\n\n</p><ul><li>There is nothing programmer has to do explicitly to put an operand size \n  prefix byte in front of a 16-bit instruction:\n  <ul><li>the assembler does this automatically as soon as 16-bit operand is found \n    in the instruction.\n  </li></ul></li><li>However, keep in mind that whenever you use a 16-bit operand in a 32-bit \n  program, the instruction is longer by one byte:<pre>    Opcode     Instruction\n    --------   ------------\n    41h         ECX\n    66h 41h     CX</pre></li><li>Be careful about using 16-bit instructions if size (and to a lesser extent, \n  speed) are important, because\n  <ol><li>instructions are longer, and\n    </li><li>slower because of their effect on the instruction cache.\n  </li></ol></li></ul><h2>12. x86 Instruction Prefix Bytes</h2><ul><li>Each prefix adjusts interpretation of the opcode:\n  <ol><li> prefix byte guarantees that instruction will \n    have exclusive use of all shared memory, until the instruction completes \n    execution:</li><li> instruction prefixes\n    where\n    <ul><li> repeats instruction the number of \n      times specified by .\n      </li><li> and  prefixes allow to terminate loop on the \n      value of  CPU flag.\n    </li></ul>\n    Related string manipulation instructions are:\n    <ul><li>, compare string, etc. \n    </li></ul>\n    See also string manipulation sample program: <a href=\"http://www.c-jump.com/CIS77/samples/rep_movsb.htm\"></a></li><li> prefix causes memory access to use \n     instead of  designated \n    for instruction operand.<pre>        2Eh = \n        36h = \n        3Eh = \n        26h = \n        64h = \n        65h = </pre></li><li>, .

      "content": "<p>Tailscale Peer Relays provides a customer-deployed and managed traffic relaying mechanism. By advertising itself as a peer relay, a Tailscale node can relay traffic for any peer nodes on the tailnet, even for traffic bound to itself. Tailscale Peer Relays can only relay traffic for nodes on your tailnet, and only for nodes that have access to the peer relay. Because they’re managed entirely by the customer, peer relays are less throughput-constrained than Tailscale’s managed DERP relays, and can provide higher throughput connections for traffic to and from locked-down cloud infrastructure, or behind strict network firewalls.</p><p>In testing with early design partners, we’ve seen throughputs nearing that of a direct connection; often multiple orders of magnitude higher than Tailscale’s managed DERP fleet.</p><p>While we’ve been keeping your network reliably connected for years with <a target=\"\" rel=\"noreferrer\" href=\"https://tailscale.com/kb/1232/derp-servers\">DERP</a>, we’ve heard from customers that the throughput and performance aspects of a QoS-aware managed relay fleet makes deployments in certain environments difficult or untenable. Furthermore, customers have noted that it’s non-trivial to deploy and manage <a target=\"\" rel=\"noreferrer\" href=\"https://tailscale.com/kb/1232/derp-servers#custom-derp-servers\">custom DERP fleets</a> (which run as a separate service and binary).</p><p>DERP provides an incredibly valuable service, setting up reliable connections between Tailscale clients anywhere in the world (including negotiating connections through peer relays). But often, DERP’s focus as a reliability and NAT traversal tool results in performance tradeoffs.</p><p>By contrast, Tailscale Peer Relays is designed as a performant connectivity tool, and can perform at a level rivaling direct connections. Peer relays can be placed right next to the resources they serve, and peer relays also run on top of UDP, both characteristics beneficial to lower latency and resource overhead. And, they are built into the Tailscale client itself for ease of deployment.</p><p>We want to move past even more hard NATs, and put Tailscale’s relaying technology in our customers’ hands, so they can use Tailscale at scale, anywhere, with ease. We believe our new Tailscale Peer Relays connectivity option—unique to Tailscale—gives customers the best performance and flexibility.</p><p>Peer relays are configured with a single UDP port that must be available to both sides of a connection. Tailscale Peer Relays is built right into the Tailscale client, and can be enabled with a simple command, using the <code>tailscale set --relay-server-port</code> flag from the Tailscale CLI. Once enabled via <a target=\"\" rel=\"noreferrer\" href=\"https://tailscale.com/kb/1591/peer-relays?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=fall-update-2025 \">the steps in our documentation</a>, clients can connect to infrastructure in hard NAT environments over the peer relay.</p><p><strong>And don’t worry, we still prefer to fly direct.</strong> Tailscale prefers direct connections wherever possible. Clients can then fall back to available peer relays, and finally leverage Tailscale’s managed DERP fleet, or any customer-deployed custom DERPs, to ensure you have connectivity wherever you need it. All of this traffic, over any connection, is still end-to-end encrypted via WireGuard®.</p><p>Tailscale Peer Relays is designed for the real world, based on the feedback we’ve received from customers and our own hard-earned networking expertise. It allows customers to make just one firewall exception for connections only coming from their tailnet. Peer relays scale across regions, are resilient to real-world network conditions, and graciously fall back to DERP (Tailscale’s or custom). Your network maintains its shape, but gains all kinds of flexibility.</p><p>Customers can now maintain performance benchmarks even where direct connections aren’t possible, by enabling Tailscale Peer Relays to build a deterministic and high-throughput relay topology.</p><p>We’ve had customers use peer relays to provide access into unmanaged networks, allowing their partners or customers to provide a controllable and auditable connectivity path without sacrificing performance.</p><p>In strict private networks, customers can build predictable access paths. Tailscale Peer Relays can be placed in public subnets with VPC peering to private subnets, allowing security teams to efficiently segment their private network infrastructure, while enabling networking teams to roll Tailscale out in full-mesh mode across the subnet.</p><p>Today, customers are using peer relays to establish relayed connections at near-direct speeds across a variety of environments and settings.</p><ul><li><strong>Enable high-throughput traffic through cloud NATs, like AWS Managed NAT Gateways:</strong> Applications and services behind a Managed NAT Gateway can leverage peer relays to relay traffic that can’t establish direct connections.</li><li><strong>Relay through network firewalls:</strong> Workloads running in strictly firewalled environments can predictably expose a single UDP port, limiting the Tailscale surface area and fast-tracking the approval process for firewall exceptions.</li><li><strong>Offload from Custom and Managed DERP: </strong>Minimize data-in-transit through Tailscale‘s managed DERP network, and remove the need for customer-maintained DERP servers.</li><li><strong>Provide access to locked down customer networks: </strong>Data plane traffic can be relayed through predictable endpoints in customer networks, so that they only need to open minimal numbers of ports to facilitate cross network connections.</li></ul><p>Tailscale Peer Relays is available today as a public beta. We’ve yet to establish all the connectivity paths we want to, and there’s still visibility and debugging improvements to work through. However, we’ve reliably seen our early design partners move to peer relay deployments with relative ease, and we’re ready for you to give it a try on your tailnet.</p><p>Tailscale Peer Relays can be enabled on all plans, including free (it’s our little way of working through the kinks of the modern internet with our customers). All customers can use two peer relays, for free, forever. As your needs scale, so will the number of available peer relays.

Then this article is for you!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>For a long time, Java Edition has used obfuscation (hiding parts of the code) – a common practice in the gaming industry. Now we’re changing how we ship Minecraft: Java Edition to remove obfuscation completely. We hope that, with this change, we can pave a future for Minecraft: Java Edition where it’s easier to create, update, and debug mods.&nbsp;</p><p>Minecraft: Java Edition has been obfuscated since its release. This obfuscation meant that people couldn’t see our source code. Instead, everything was scrambled – and those who wanted to mod Java Edition had to try and piece together what every class and function in the code did.&nbsp;</p><p>But we encourage people to get creative both in Minecraft and with Minecraft – so in 2019 we tried to make this tedious process a little easier by releasing “obfuscation mappings”. These mappings were essentially a long list that allowed people to match the obfuscated terms to un-obfuscated terms. This alleviated the issue a little, as modders didn’t need to puzzle out what everything did, or what it should be called anymore. But why stop there?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Removing obfuscation in Java Edition&nbsp;</h2><p>To make things even easier – and remove these intermediary steps – we’re removing obfuscation altogether! Starting with the first snapshot following the complete Mounts of Mayhem launch, we will no longer obfuscate Minecraft: Java Edition. This means that this build (and all future builds) will have all of our original names* – now with variable names and other names – included by default to make modding even easier.&nbsp;</p></div>",

The final result is a large-scale model optimized for high-speed use as an agent in Cursor.</p><p>Our motivation comes from our experience developing Cursor Tab, our custom completion model. We found that often developers want the smartest model that can support interactive use, keeping them in the flow of coding. In our development process, we experimented with a prototype agent model, codenamed Cheetah, to better understand the impact of faster agent models. Composer is a smarter version of this model that keeps coding delightful by being fast enough for an interactive experience.</p><p>Composer is a mixture-of-experts (MoE) language model supporting long-context generation and understanding. It is specialized for software engineering through reinforcement learning (RL) in a diverse range of development environments. At each iteration of training, the model is given a problem description and instructed to produce the best response, be it a code edit, a plan, or an informative answer. The model has access to simple tools, like reading and editing files, and also more powerful ones like terminal commands and codebase-wide semantic search.</p><p>To measure progress, we constructed an evaluation that measures a model's usefulness to a software developer as faithfully as possible. Our benchmark, Cursor Bench, consists of real agent requests from engineers and researchers at Cursor, along with hand-curated optimal solutions to these requests. The resulting evaluation measures not just the agent’s correctness, but also its adherence to a codebase's existing abstractions and software engineering practices.</p><p>Reinforcement learning allows us to actively specialize the model for effective software engineering. Since response speed is a critical component for interactive development, we incentivize the model to make efficient choices in tool use and to maximize parallelism whenever possible. In addition, we train the model to be a helpful assistant by minimizing unnecessary responses and claims made without evidence. We also find that during RL, the model learns useful behaviors on its own like performing complex searches, fixing linter errors, and writing and executing unit tests.</p><p>Efficient training of large MoE models requires significant investment into building infrastructure and systems research. We built custom training infrastructure leveraging PyTorch and Ray to power asynchronous reinforcement learning at scale. We natively train our models at low precision by combining our <a href=\"https://cursor.com/blog/kernels\">MXFP8 MoE kernels</a> with expert parallelism and hybrid sharded data parallelism, allowing us to scale training to thousands of NVIDIA GPUs with minimal communication cost. Additionally, training with MXFP8 allows us to deliver faster inference speeds without requiring post-training quantization.</p><p>During RL, we want our model to be able to call any tool in the Cursor Agent harness. These tools allow editing code, using semantic search, grepping strings, and running terminal commands. At our scale, teaching the model to effectively call these tools requires running hundreds of thousands of concurrent sandboxed coding environments in the cloud. To support this workload, we adapted existing infrastructure we built for Background Agents, rewriting our virtual machine scheduler to support the bursty nature and scale of training runs. This enabled seamless unification of RL environments with production environments.</p><p>Cursor builds tools for software engineering, and we make heavy use of the tools we develop. A motivation of Composer development has been developing an agent we would reach for in our own work. In recent weeks, we have found that many of our colleagues were using Composer for their day-to-day software development. With this release, we hope that you also find it to be a valuable tool.</p><p><em>¹ Benchmarked on an internal benchmark in the Cursor tool harness.

      "content": "<blockquote><p>TLDR: Yes, you can fit about 7 seconds of audio into 16K of flash and still have room for code. And you can even play LPC encoded audio on a 10 cent MCU.</p></blockquote><p>There’s quite a lot more detail in this video (and of course you can hear the audio!).</p><p>In the <a href=\"https://www.atomic14.com/2025/10/12/CH32V003-music\">previous project</a>, I had this ultra-cheap CH32V003 microcontroller playing simple tunes on a tiny SMD buzzer. It was just toggling a GPIO pin at musical note frequencies – 1-bit audio output – and it sounded surprisingly decent. That was a fun start, but now it’s time to push this little $0.10 MCU even further: can we make it actually talk?</p><p>Spoiler: Yes, we can! (well, there wouldn’t be much of a blog post if we couldn’t) This 8-pin RISC-V chip is now producing sampled audio data and spoken words. We’re really stretching the limits of what you can fit in 16 KB of flash.</p><h2>From Beeps to Actual Audio</h2><p>Moving from simple beeps to real audio meant using the microcontroller’s PWM output as a rudimentary DAC. Instead of just on/off beeping, I’m driving a waveform at an 8 kHz sample rate using a high-frequency PWM on the output pin. The hardware is the same tiny board as before\n – but I’ve swapped the small SMD buzzer for a small speaker. The buzer works too, but it’s quieter and very tinny.</p><p>The sample I wanted to test with is just over 6 seconds in length - it’s the iconic “Open the pod bay doors HAL…” sequence from 2001.</p><p>If we keep this audio at 16-bit PCM, 8kHZ, we’d need about 96KB – way beyond our 16 KB flash! And remember, that 16 KB has to hold both the audio data and our playback code. Clearly some aggressive compression is required.</p><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table><p>I considered a few encoding options for compressing the audio.</p><ul><li> Simply using 8-bit samples at 8 kHz cuts size in half (to ~47 KB for 6s), but that’s still about 3× too large for our flash.</li><li> Adaptive Differential PCM is a simple lossy compression that could quarter the size. In theory 6 seconds would be ~24 KB – much closer to fitting,</li><li> This is nice codec that packs audio into about 3.2 bits per sample (roughly 1/5 the size of 16-bit PCM)</li><li> Going even further with ADPCM, using only 2 bits per sample gives a 4:1 compression relative to 8-bit audio – that’s 75% storage savings.</li></ul><p>2-bit ADPCM is definitely the winner here. Our 6-second clip shrinks to under 12 KB, which comfortably fits in flash with room for code. This looked like the winner, provided the audio quality was acceptable. The decoder for 2-bit ADPCM is also very lightweight (my implementation compiled to under just over 1K of code - 1340 bytes!). It’s definitely low quality - but it actually sounds surprisingly ok.</p><h2>How does 2-bit ADPCM work?</h2><p>It’s actually a very simple algorithm. Both the encoder and decoder maintain a predicted signal value and a step size index into a predefined table. Each 2-bit code tells the decoder how to adjust the current prediction and the step size index. In essence, we’re coding the difference between the real audio and our prediction, with only four possible levels (since 2 bits gives 4 values). After each sample, the algorithm adapts: if the prediction error was large, we move to a bigger step size (to allow larger changes); if the error was small, we use a smaller step size for finer resolution. This adaptive step is what makes it ADPCM (Adaptive Differential PCM).</p><p>Our codes are as follows:</p><ul><li> (0): Go down by 1 step - subtract the step size from our current prediction</li><li> (1): Go up by 1 step - add the step size to our current prediction</li><li> (2): Go down by 2 steps - subtract the 2 x step size from our current prediction</li><li> (3): Go up by 2 steps - add the 2 x step size to our current prediction</li></ul><p>Even with this very high level of compression, the predicted waveform manages to track the original audio surprisingly well. The above graph shows a small snippet of the audio: the blue line is the original waveform and the yellow line is the ADPCM decoder’s output.</p><p>They’re not identical (and we wouldn’t expect them to be), but the general shape is preserved. When you play it back through the little speaker, it’s recognizable and surprisingly good.</p><p>To make my life easier, I built a quick conversion <a href=\"https://buzzer-studio.atomic14.com\">tool</a> to encode WAV files into this 2-bit ADPCM format. The tool lets me drag-and-drop a WAV, and it gives you the files with the data that can ve dropped into the firmware code.</p><p>Six seconds of audio is cool, but what about longer phrases or even arbitrary speech? Storing anything much longer with raw or ADPCM audio would quickly fill the 16K of flash.</p><p>For my second experiment, I tried something different: instead of recorded waveform audio, I used an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments_LPC_Speech_Chips\">old-school speech synthesis approach</a>. This leverages the fact that spoken language can be encoded very compactly by modeling the human voice, rather than storing the raw sound. Specifically, I integrated a library called <a href=\"https://github.com/going-digital/Talkie/tree/master/Talkie\">Talkie</a>.</p><p>Talkie is a software implementation of the Texas Instruments LPC speech synthesis architecture from the late 1970s. This was implemented in a variety of chips, most commonly the TMS5220 and TMS5100 speech chips.</p><p>These were used in things like the original Speak &amp; Spell, arcade games like early Star Wars, and speech add-ons for home computers (e.g. the BBC Micro).</p><p>The Talkie library (originally by <a href=\"https://github.com/going-digital/Talkie/tree/master/Talkie\">Peter Knight</a>, later added to by <a href=\"https://learn.adafruit.com/bringing-back-the-voice-of-speak-spell/software\">Adafruit</a>) comes with a big set of examples and vocabulary. It’s also possible to extract examples from old ROMs from arcade games.</p><p>Each phrase or word only takes a few hundred bytes or even less, so you can fit quite a lot of speech into a few kilobytes of flash. The trade-off is that the voice has a very computer-esque timbre – think of the Speak &amp; Spell’s voice. It’s clearly synthetic, but still understandable.</p><p>To say custom sentences not in the library, you either concatenate the available words/phonemes (which can be clunky), or you need to generate new LPC data. The original tools for this are a bit obscure – there’s BlueWizard (a classic Mac app) and PythonWizard (a command-line tool with TK GUI) which can analyze WAV files and produce LPC data.</p><p>I gave both a try with some success (and a few headaches setting them up). In the end, I cheated a bit and used an AI coding assistant to help me create a streamlined online tool for this.</p><p>The result is a little <a href=\"http://buzzer-studio.atomic14.com\">web app</a> where I can upload a recording of, say, my own voice, and it outputs the LPC data. It even lets me play back the synthesized voice in-browser to check it.</p><p>So there we have it – our 10¢ microcontroller now has a voice! By using 2-bit ADPCM compression, we can store short audio clips (up to around 8 seconds) even in 16 KB of flash, and play them back via PWM with decent fidelity.</p><p>And with the Talkie LPC speech synthesis, we can make the device “speak” lots of words and phrases with only a tiny memory footprint.</p><p>If you want to hear it for yourself, check out the video demo linked at the top of this post. In the video, you’ll see (and hear) the WarGames clip and the Star Wars quotes running on the hardware. It’s honestly amazing what these cheap little MCUs can do. We’re really pushing the boundaries of cheap hardware here.</p><p>You can find all my code on GitHub in this <a href=\"https://github.com/atomic14/ch32v003-audio\">repository</a>.</p>",

      "content": "<p>I feel like the tech world lives in two camps.</p><ol><li>One camp chases buzzwords.</li></ol><p>This camp tends to adopt whatever’s popular without thinking hard about whether it’s appropriate. They tend to fall for all the purported benefits the sales pitch gives them - real-time, infinitely scale, cutting-edge, cloud-native, serverless, zero-trust, AI-powered, etc.</p><p>You see this everywhere in the Kafka world: Streaming Lakehouse™️, Kappa™️ Architecture, Streaming AI Agents.</p><p>This phenomenon is sometimes known as . Modern practices actively encourage this. Consultants push “innovative architectures” stuffed with vendor tech via “insight” reports. System design interviews expect you to design Google-scale architectures that are inevitably at a scale 100x higher than the company you’re interviewing for would ever need. Career progression rewards you for replatforming to the Hot New Stack™️, not for being resourceful.</p><ol start=\"2\"><li>The other camp chases common sense</li></ol><p>This camp is far more pragmatic. They strip away unnecessary complexity and steer clear of overengineered solutions. They reason from first principles before making technology choices. They resist marketing hype and approach vendor claims with healthy skepticism.</p><p>Historically, it has felt like Camp 1 definitively held the upper hand in sheer numbers and noise. Today, it feels like the pendulum may be beginning to swing back, at least a tiny bit. Two recent trends are on the side of Camp 2:</p><p>Trend 1 - the “<a href=\"https://topicpartition.io/definitions/small-data\" data-slug=\"definitions/small-data\">Small Data</a>” movement. People are realizing two things - their data isn’t that big and their computers are becoming big too. You can rent a <a href=\"https://instances.vantage.sh/aws/ec2/x1e.xlarge\">128-core, 4 TB of RAM instance</a> from AWS. AMD just released 192-core CPUs this summer. That ought to be enough for anybody.</p><p>Trend 2 - the Postgres Renaissance. The space is seeing incredible growth and investment. In the last 2 years, the phrase <a href=\"https://github.com/Olshansk/postgres_for_everything\">“Just Use Postgres (for everything)”</a> has gained a ton of popularity. The basic premise is that you shouldn’t complicate things with new tech when you don’t need to, and that Postgres alone solves most problems pretty well. Postgres competes with purpose-built solutions like:</p><ul><li>Elasticsearch (functionality supported by Postgres’ /)</li><li>Redis ()</li><li>AI Vector Databases (, )</li><li>Snowflake (, )</li></ul><p>The claim isn’t that Postgres is functionally equivalent to any of these specialized systems. The claim is that it handles 80%+ of their use cases with 20% of the development effort. (Pareto Principle)</p><p>When you combine the two trends, the appeal becomes obvious. Postgres is a battle-tested, well-known system that is simple, scalable and reliable. Pair it with today’s powerful hardware and you quickly begin to realize that, more often than not, you do not need the state-of-the-art highly optimized and complex distributed system in order to handle your organization’s scale.</p><p><strong>A 500 KB/s workload should not use Kafka.</strong> There is a scalability cargo cult in tech that always wants to choose “the best possible” tech for a problem - but this misses the forest for the trees. The “best possible” solution frequently isn’t a technical question - it’s a practical one. Adriano makes an airtight case for why you should opt for  in his <a href=\"https://adriano.fyi/posts/2023-09-24-choose-postgres-queue-technology\">PG as Queue blog</a> (2023) that originally inspired me to write this.</p><p>Enough background. In this article, we will do three simple things:</p><p>I am not aiming for an exhaustive in-depth evaluation. Benchmarks are messy af. Rather, my goal is to publish some reasonable data points which can start a discussion.</p><p><em>(while this article is for Postgres, feel free to replace it with your database of choice)</em></p><p>If you’d like to skip straight to the results, here they are:</p><p>There are dozens of blogs out there using Postgres as a , but interestingly enough I haven’t seen one use it as a pub-sub messaging system.</p><p>A quick distinction between the two because I often see them get confused:</p><ol><li><p> are meant for point-to-point communication. They’re widely used for asynchronous background jobs: worker apps (clients) process a task in the queue like sending an e-mail or pushing a notification. The event is consumed once and it’s done with. A message is immediately deleted (popped) off the queue once it’s consumed. Queues do not have strict ordering guarantees.</p></li><li><p> messaging differs from the queue in that it is meant for one-to-many communication. This inherently means there is a large read fanout - more than one reader client is interested in any given message. Good pub-sub systems decouple readers from writers by storing data on disks. This allows them to not impose a max queue depth limit - something in-memory queues need to do in order to prevent them from going OOM.</p><p>There is also a general expectation that there is strict order - events should be read in the same order that they arrived in the system.</p></li></ol><p>Postgres’ main competitor here is Kafka, which is the standard in pub-sub today. Various (mostly-proprietary) alternatives exist.</p><p>Kafka uses the Log data structure to hold messages. You’ll see my benchmark basically reconstructs a log from Postgres primitives.</p><p>Postgres doesn’t seem to have any popular libraries for pub-sub use cases, so I had to write my own. The Kafka-inspired workflow I opted for is this:</p><ol><li>Writers produce batches of messages per statement (). Each transaction carries one batch insert and targets a single  table</li><li>Each writer is sticky to one table, but in aggregate they produce to multiple tables.</li><li>Each message has a unique monotonically-increasing offset number. A specific row in a special  table denotes the latest offset for a given  table.</li><li>Write transactions atomically update both the  data and the  row. This ensures consistent offset tracking across concurrent writers.</li><li>Readers poll for new messages. They consume the  table(s) sequentially, starting from the lowest offset and progressively reading up.</li><li>Readers are split into consumer groups. Each group performs separate, independent reads and makes progress on the  tables.</li><li>Each group contains 1 reader per  table.</li><li>Readers store their progress in a  table, with a row for each  pair.</li><li>Each reader updates the latest processed offset (claiming the records), selects the records and processes them inside a single transaction.</li></ol><p>This ensures Kafka-like semantics - gapless, monotonically-increasing offsets and at-least-once/at-most-once processing. This test in particular uses at-least-once semantics, but neither choice should impact the benchmark results.</p><figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=\"\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"sql\" data-theme=\"github-light github-dark\"><code data-language=\"sql\" data-theme=\"github-light github-dark\"></code></pre></figure><p>The benchmark runs  writer goroutines.

Each reader is assigned a particular consumer group and partition. The group as a whole reads all partitions while each reader in the group reads only one partition at a time.</p><p>The reader loops, opens a transaction, optimistically claims  records (by advancing the offset mark beyond them), selects them and processes the records.\nIf successful, it commits the transaction and through that advances the offset for the group.</p><p>It is a pull-based read (just like Kafka), rather than push-based. If the reader has no records to poll, it sleeps for a bit.</p><p>First it opens a transaction:</p><p>Then it claims the offsets:</p><figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=\"\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"sql\" data-theme=\"github-light github-dark\"><code data-language=\"sql\" data-theme=\"github-light github-dark\"></code></pre></figure><p>Followed by selecting the claimed records:</p><figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=\"\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"sql\" data-theme=\"github-light github-dark\"><code data-language=\"sql\" data-theme=\"github-light github-dark\"></code></pre></figure><p>Finally, the data gets processed by the business logic (no-op in our benchmark) and the transaction is closed:</p><p>If you’re wondering  - my understanding of that feature is that it’s an optimization and cannot be fully relied upon, so polling is required either way. Given that, I just copied Kafka’s relatively simple design.</p><p>The full code and detailed results are all published on GitHub at <a href=\"https://github.com/stanislavkozlovski/pg-queue-pubsub-benchmark\">stanislavkozlovski/pg-queue-pubsub-benchmark</a>.\nI ran three setups - a single-node 4 vCPU, a 3-node replicated 4 vCPU and a single-node 96 vCPU setup.

It’s funny to think that the majority of people run a complex distributed system like Kafka for similar workloads.</p><p>Now, a replicated setup to more accurately mimic the durability and availability guarantees of Kafka.</p><ul><li>3x <a href=\"https://instances.vantage.sh/aws/ec2/c7i.xlarge\">c7i.xlarge</a> Postgres servers /w 25GB gp3 9000 IOPS EBS volume\n<ul><li>each on a separate AZ (us-east-1a, us-east-1b, us-east-1c)</li><li>one  replica and one  replica</li></ul></li><li>a few custom Postgres settings like , , , <code>max_parallel_workers_per_gather</code> and of course - <ul><li><code>autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor = 0.05</code> set on the partition tables too (unclear if it has an effect)</li></ul></li><li>each row’s payload is 1 KiB (1024 bytes)</li><li>10 writers (2 writers per partition on average)</li><li>5x read fanout via 5 consumer groups</li><li>readers only access the primary DB; readers are in the same AZ as the primary;</li><li>20 reader clients total (4 readers per group)</li><li>write batch size: 100 records</li><li>read batch size: 200 records</li></ul><ul><li><p>write message rate: </p></li><li><p>write throughput: </p></li><li><p>write latency: 153.45ms p99 / 6.8ms p95</p></li><li><p>read message rate: </p></li><li><p>read message throughput: </p></li><li><p>read latency: 57ms p99; 4.91ms p95</p></li><li><p>end-to-end latency:  / 12ms p95</p></li><li><p>disk was at ~1200 writes/s with iostat claiming 46 MiB/s</p></li></ul><p>Now these are astonishing results! Throughput was not impacted at all. Latency increased but not extremely. Our p99 e2e latency 3x’d (60ms vs 185ms), but the p95 barely moved from 10.6ms to 12ms.</p><p>This shows that a simple 3-node Postgres cluster can pretty easily sustain what is a very common Kafka workload - 5 MB/s ingest and 25 MB/s egress. Not only that, but for a cheap cost too. Just $11,514 per year.</p><p>Typically, you’d expect Postgres to run more expensive than Kafka at a certain scale, simply because it wasn’t designed to be efficient for this use case.\nNot here though. Running Kafka yourself would cost the same. Running the same workload through a Kafka vendor will cost you at least $50,000 a year. 🤯</p><p>By the way, in Kafka it’s customary to apply client-side compression on your data. If we assume your messages were 5 KB in size and your clients applied a pretty regular compression ratio of 4x - Postgres is actually handling 20 MB/s ingress and 100 MB/s egress.</p><p>Ok, let’s see how far Postgres will go.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://instances.vantage.sh/aws/ec2/c7i.24xlarge\">c7i.24xlarge</a> (96 vCPU, 192 GiB RAM) Postgres server instance /w 250GB io2 12,000 IOPS EBS volume</li><li>modified Postgres settings ( on, other settings scaled to match the machine);\n<ul><li>still kept fsync &amp; synchronous_commit on for durability.</li><li><code>autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor = 0.05</code> set on the partition tables too (unclear if it has an effect)</li></ul></li><li>each row’s payload is 1 KiB (1024 bytes)</li><li>100 writers (~3.33 writers per partition on average)</li><li>5x read fanout via 5 consumer groups</li><li>150 reader clients total (5 readers per group)</li><li>write batch size: 200 records</li><li>read batch size: 200 records</li></ul><ul><li><p>write message rate: </p></li><li><p>write throughput: </p></li><li><p>write latency: 138ms p99 / 47ms p95</p></li><li><p>read message rate: </p></li><li><p>read message throughput: </p></li><li><p>end-to-end latency:  / 242ms p95 / 23.4ms p50</p></li><li><p>server kept at  CPU (basically idle);</p></li><li><p>bottleneck: The bottleneck was the write rate per partition. It seems like the test wasn’t able to write at a higher rate than 8 MiB/s (8k msg/s) per table with this design. I didn’t push further, but I do wonder now as I write this - how far would writes have scaled?</p><ul><li>Reads were trivial to scale. Adding more consumer groups was trivial - I tried with 10x fanout and still ran at low CPU. I didn’t include it because I didn’t feel the need to push to an unrealistic read-fanout extreme.</li></ul></li></ul><p>240 MiB/s ingress and 1.16 GiB/s egress are pretty good! The 96 vCPU machine was overkill for this test - it could have done a lot more, or we could have simply opted for a smaller machine. For what it’s worth, I do think it’s worth it to deploy a separate Kafka cluster at this scale. Kafka can save you a lot of money here because it can be more efficient in how it handles cross-zone network traffic with features like <a href=\"https://blog.2minutestreaming.com/p/diskless-kafka-topics-kip-1150\">Diskless Kafka</a>.</p><p>These tests seem to show that Postgres is pretty competitive with Kafka at low scale.</p><p>You may have noticed none of these tests were particularly long-running. From my understanding, the value in longer-running tests is to test table vacuuming in Postgres, as that can have negative performance effects. In the pub-sub section, vacuuming doesn’t apply because the tables are append-only. My other reasoning for running shorter tests was to keep costs in check and not spend too much time.</p><p>In any case, no benchmark is perfect. My goal wasn’t to indisputably prove . Rather, I want to start a discussion by showing that what’s possible is likely larger than what most people assume. I certainly didn’t assume I’d get such good numbers, especially with the pub-sub part.</p><p>In Postgres, a queue can be implemented with <code>SELECT FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED</code>. This command selects an unlocked row and locks it. It also skips reading already-locked rows. That’s how mutual exclusion is achieved - a worker can’t get other workers’ jobs.</p><p>Postgres has a very popular <a href=\"https://github.com/pgmq/pgmq\">pgmq</a> library that offers a slick queue API. To keep it simple and understand the end-to-end flow better, I decided to write my own queue. The basic version of it is very easy. My workflow is:</p><ol><li>lock row &amp; take job (<code>SELECT FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED</code>)</li><li>process job ()</li><li>mark job as “done” ( a field or  the row into a separate table)</li></ol><p>Postgres competes with RabbitMQ, AWS SQS, NATS, Redis and to an extent Kafka here.</p><p>We use a simple  table. When an element is processed off the queue, it’s moved into the archive table.</p><figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=\"\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"sql\" data-theme=\"github-light github-dark\"><code data-language=\"sql\" data-theme=\"github-light github-dark\"></code></pre></figure><p>We again run  writer client goroutines.\nEach one simply loops and sequentially inserts a single random item into the table:</p><figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=\"\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"sql\" data-theme=\"github-light github-dark\"><code data-language=\"sql\" data-theme=\"github-light github-dark\"></code></pre></figure><p>It only inserts one message per statement, which is pretty inefficient at scale.</p><p>We again run  reader client goroutines. Each reader loops and processes one message.\nThe processing is done inside a database transaction.</p><figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=\"\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"sql\" data-theme=\"github-light github-dark\"><code data-language=\"sql\" data-theme=\"github-light github-dark\"></code></pre></figure><p>Each reader again only works with one message at a time per transaction.</p><p>I again ran the same three setups - a single-node 4 vCPU, a 3-node replicated 4 vCPU and a single-node 96 vCPU setup. Here are the summarized results for each:</p><p><small><em>The results are the average of two 15-minute tests. I also ran three 2-minute tests. They all performed similarly.</em></small></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://instances.vantage.sh/aws/ec2/c7i.xlarge\">c7i.xlarge</a> Postgres server /w 25GB gp3 9000 IOPS EBS volume</li><li>all default Postgres settings</li><li>each row’s payload is 1 KiB (1024 bytes)</li><li>10 writer clients, 15 reader clients</li></ul><ul><li>write latency: 2.46ms p99</li><li>end-to-end latency: 17.72ms p99</li></ul><p>What I found Postgres wasn’t good at was handling client count. The bottleneck in this setup was the read clients. Each client could not read more than ~192 messages a second because of its median read latency and sequential read nature.</p><p>Increasing client count boosted throughput but violated my ~60% CPU target. Trying to run 50 write and 50 read clients got to 4000 msg/s without increasing the queue depth but pegged the server’s CPU to 100%. I wanted to keep the benchmarks realistic for what you may run in production, rather than maxing out what a machine can do. This would be easily alleviated with a connection pooler (standard across all prod PG deployments) or a larger machine.</p><p>Another thing worth mentioning is that the workload could sustain a lot more writes than reads. If I didn’t throttle the benchmark, it would write at 12,000 msg/s and read at 2,800 msg/s. In the spirit of simplicity, I didn’t debug further and instead throttled my writes to see at what point I could get a stable 1:1 workload.</p><ul><li>3x <a href=\"https://instances.vantage.sh/aws/ec2/c7i.xlarge\">c7i.xlarge</a> Postgres servers /w 25GB gp3 9000 IOPS EBS volume\n<ul><li>each on a separate AZ (us-east-1a, us-east-1b, us-east-1c)</li><li>one  replica and one  replica</li></ul></li><li>a few custom Postgres settings like , , , <code>max_parallel_workers_per_gather</code> and of course - </li><li>each row’s payload is 1 KiB (1024 bytes)</li><li>10 writer clients, 15 reader clients</li><li>readers only access the primary DB; readers are in the same AZ as the primary;</li></ul><ul><li>end-to-end latency: 920ms p99 ⚠️; 536ms p95; 7ms p50</li></ul><p>As expected, throughput and latency were impacted somewhat. But not that much. It’s still over 2000 messages a second, which is pretty good for an HA queue!</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://instances.vantage.sh/aws/ec2/c7i.24xlarge\">c7i.24xlarge</a> Postgres server instance /w 250GB io2 12,000 IOPS EBS volume</li><li>modified Postgres settings ( on, other settings scaled to match the machine);\n<ul><li>still kept fsync &amp; synchronous_commit on for durability.</li></ul></li><li>each row’s payload is 1 KiB (1024 bytes)</li><li>100 writer clients, 200 reader clients</li></ul><ul><li>message rate: </li><li>write latency: 9.42ms p99</li><li>end-to-end latency: 930ms p99 ⚠️; 709ms p95; 12.6ms p50</li></ul><p>This run wasn’t that impressive. There is some bottleneck in the single-table queue approach at this scale which I didn’t bother figuring out. I figured that it wasn’t important to reach absurd numbers on a single table, since all realistic scenarios would have multiple queues and never reach 20,000 msg/s on a single one. The 96 vCPU instance would likely scale far further were we to run a few separate queue tables in parallel.</p><p>Even a modest Postgres node can durably push thousands of queue ops/sec, which already covers the scale 99% of companies ever hit with a single queue.\nAs I said earlier, the last 2 years have seen the Just Use Postgres slogan become mainstream. The <a href=\"https://github.com/pgmq/pgmq\">library</a>’s star history captures this trend perfectly:\n<img src=\"https://topicpartition.io/blog/images/pgmq_star_history.png\" alt=\"pgmq\"></p><p>Most of the time - . You should always default to Postgres until the constraints prove you wrong.</p><p>Kafka is obviously better optimized for pub-sub workloads. Queue systems are obviously better optimized for queue workloads. The point is that <strong>picking a technology based on technical optimization alone is a flawed approach</strong>. To throw an analogy:</p><blockquote><p>a Formula One car is optimized to drive faster, but I still use a sedan to go to work. I am way more comfortable driving my sedan than an F1 car.</p></blockquote><p>The Postgres sedan comes with many quality-of-life comforts that the F1 Kafka does not:</p><ul><li>ability to debug messages with regular SQL</li><li>ability to delete, re-order or edit messages in place</li><li>ability to join pub-sub data with regular tables</li><li>ability to trivially read specific data via rich SQL queries (, , )</li></ul><p>Giving up these comforts is a justified sacrifice for your F1 car to go at 378 kmh (235 mph), but masochistic if you plan on driving at 25kmh (15 mph).</p><p>Donald Knuth warned us in 1974 -  is the root of all evil. Deploying Kafka at small scale is premature optimization.\nThe point of this article is to show you that this “small scale” number has grown further than what people remember it to be - it can comfortably mean many megabytes per second.</p><p>We are in a Postgres Renaissance for a reason: Postgres is  good enough. Modern NVMEs and cheap RAM allow it to scale absurdly high.</p><h2>Custom Solutions for Everything?<a role=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" data-no-popover=\"true\" href=\"https://topicpartition.io/blog/postgres-pubsub-queue-benchmarks#custom-solutions-for-everything\"></a></h2><p>Naive engineers tend to adopt a specialized technology at the slightest hint of a need:</p><ul><li> Redis, of course!</li><li> Let’s deploy Elasticsearch!</li><li> BigQuery or Snowflake - that’s what our data analysts used at their last job.</li><li> We need a NoSQL database like MongoDB.</li><li><em>Have to crunch some numbers on S3?</em> Let’s use Spark!</li></ul><p>A good engineer thinks through the bigger picture.</p><ul><li><em>Does this new technology move the needle?</em></li><li><em>Is shaving a few milliseconds off our query worth the extra organizational complexity introduced with the change?</em></li></ul><p>At small scale, these systems hurt you more than they benefit you. Distributed systems - both in terms of node count and system cardinality - should be respected, feared, avoided and employed only as a weapon of last resort against particularly gnarly problems. Everything with a distributed system becomes more challenging and time-consuming.</p><p>The problem is <strong>the organizational overhead</strong>. The organizational overhead of adopting a new system, learning its nuances, configs, establishing monitoring, establishing processes around deployments and upgrades, attaining operational expertise on how to manage it, creating runbooks, testing it, debugging it, adopting its clients and API, using its UI, keeping up with its ecosystem, etc.</p><p>All of these are real organizational costs that can take months to get right, even if the system in question isn’t difficult (a lot are). Managed SaaS offerings trade off some of the organizational overhead for greater financial costs - but they still don’t remove it all. And until you reach the scale where the technology is necessary, you pay these extra <em>{financial, organizational}</em> costs for zero significant gain.</p><p>If the same can be done with tech for which you’ve already paid the organizational costs for (e.g Postgres), adopting something else prematurely is most definitely an anti-pattern. You don’t need web-scale technologies when you don’t have web-scale problems.</p><h2>MVI (a better alternative)<a role=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" data-no-popover=\"true\" href=\"https://topicpartition.io/blog/postgres-pubsub-queue-benchmarks#mvi-a-better-alternative\"></a></h2><p>What I think is a better approach is to search for the <strong>minimum viable infrastructure</strong> (MVI): build the smallest amount of system while still providing value.</p><ol><li>choose  technology your org is already  with\n<ul><li> == meets your users’ needs without being too slow/expensive/insecure</li><li> == your org has prior experience, has runbooks/ops setups, monitoring, UI, etc</li></ul></li><li>solve a real problem with it</li><li>use the minimum set of features\n<ul><li>the fewer features you use, the more flexibility you have to move off the infra in question in the future (e.g if locked in with a vendor)</li></ul></li></ol><p>Bonus points if that technology:</p><ul><li>is widely adopted so finding good engineers for it is trivial (Postgres - check)</li><li>has a strong and growing network effect (Postgres - check)</li></ul><p>The MVI approach reduces the surface area of your infra.

Even engineers inside a company, who ought to be motivated to keep things simple, have strong incentives to pursue extra complexity. It benefits their career by giving them a project to use as ammo for their next promotion and improves their resume (cool tech/story on there) for their next job-hop. Plus it’s simply more fun.</p><p>This is why I think we, as an industry, don’t always use the simplest solution available.</p><p>In most cases, Postgres is that simplest solution that is available.</p><p>I want to wrap this article up, but one rebuttal I can’t miss addressing is the “it won’t scale argument”.</p><p>The argument goes something like this: “in today’s age we can go viral at a moment’s notice; these viral moments are very valuable for our business so we need to aggressively design in a way that keeps our app stable under traffic spikes”</p><p>I have three arguments against this:</p><p><a href=\"https://bohanzhang.me/\">Bohan Zhang</a>, a member of OpenAI’s infrastructure team and co-founder of <a href=\"https://ottertune.com/\">OtterTune</a> (a Postgres tuning service), can be quoted as saying:</p><blockquote><p><em>“At OpenAI, we utilize an unsharded architecture with one writer and multiple readers, demonstrating that PostgreSQL can scale gracefully under massive read loads.”</em></p><p><em>“The main message of my talk was that if you are not too write heavy, you can scale Postgres to a very high read throughput with read replicas using only a single master! That is exactly the message that needs to be spelled out as that covers  of apps.”</em></p><p><em>“Postgres is probably the default choice for developers right now. You can use Postgres for a very long time. If you are building a startup with read-heavy workloads, just start with Postgres. If you hit a scalability issue, increase the instance size. You can scale it to a very large scale. If in the future the database becomes a bottleneck, congratulations. You have built a successful startup. It’s a good problem to have.”</em></p><p>(slightly edited for clarity and grammar)</p></blockquote><p>Despite their rapid growth to a user base of more than 800 million, OpenAI has still NOT opted for a web-scale distributed database. If they haven’t… why does your unproven project need to?</p><h3>2.

      "content": "<p>I created the website you’re reading with VS Code. Behind the scenes I use Astro, a static site generator that gets out of the way while providing nice conveniences.</p><p>Using VS Code was a no-brainer: everyone in the industry seems to at least be familiar with it, every project can be opened with it, and most projects can get enhancements and syntactic helpers in a few clicks. In short: VS Code is free, easy to use, and widely adopted.</p><p>A Rustacean colleague kept singing <a href=\"https://helix-editor.com/\">Helix</a>’s praises. I discarded it because he’s much smarter than I am, and I only ever use vim when I need to fiddle with files on a server. I like when things “Just Work” and didn’t want to bother learning how to use Helix nor how to configure it.</p><p>Today it has become my daily driver. Why did I change my mind? What was preventing me from using it before? And how difficult was it to get there?</p><p>Automation and technology make work easier, this is why we produce technology in the first place. But it also means you grow more dependent on the tech you use. If the tech is produced transparently by an international team or a team you trust, it’s fine. But if it’s produced by a single large entity that can screw you over, it’s dangerous.</p><p>VS Code might be open source, but in practice it’s produced by Microsoft. Microsoft has a problematic relationship to consent and is shoving AI products down everyone’s throat. I’d rather use tools that respect me and my decisions, and I’d rather not get my tools produced by already monopolistic organizations.</p><p>Microsoft is also based in the USA, and the political climate over there makes me want to depend as little as possible on American tools. I know that’s a long, uphill battle, but we have to start somewhere.</p><p>I’m not advocating for a ban against American tech in general, but for more balance in our supply chain. I’m also not advocating for European tech either: I’d rather get open source tools from international teams competing in a race to the top, rather than from teams in a single jurisdiction. What is happening in the USA could happen in Europe too.</p><p>I’ve never found vim particularly pleasant to use but it’s everywhere, so I figured I might just get used to it. But one of the things I never liked about vim is the number of moving pieces. By default, vim and neovim are very bare bones. They can be extended and completely modified with plugins, but I really don’t like the idea of having extremely customize tools.</p><p>I’d rather have the same editor as everyone else, with a few knobs for minor preferences. I am subject to choice paralysis, so making me configure an editor before I’ve even started editing is the best way to tank my productivity.</p><p>When my colleague told me about Helix, two things struck me as improvements over vim.</p><ol><li><strong>Helix’s philosophy is that everything should work out of the box.</strong> There are a few configs and themes, but everything should work similarly from one Helix to another. All the language-specific logic is handled in Language Servers that implement the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Server_Protocol\">Language Server Protocol</a> standard.</li><li><strong>In Helix, first you select text, and then you perform operations onto it.</strong> So you can visually tell what is going to be changed before you apply the change. It fits my mental model much better.</li></ol><p>But there are major drawbacks to Helix too:</p><ol><li><strong>After decades of vim, I was scared to re-learn everything.</strong> In practice this wasn’t a problem at all because of the very visual way Helix works.</li><li><strong>VS Code “Just Works”, and Helix sounded like more work than the few clicks from VS Code’s extension store.</strong> This is true, but not as bad as I had anticipated.</li></ol><p>After a single week of usage, Helix was already very comfortable to navigate. After a few weeks, most of the wrinkles have been ironed out and I use it as my primary editor. So how did I overcome those fears?</p><p> It can sound silly, but the very first step to get into Helix was not to overthink it. I just installed it on my mac with  and gave it a go. I was not too familiar with it, so I looked up <a href=\"https://docs.helix-editor.com/usage.html\">the official documentation</a> and noticed there was a tutorial.</p><p>This tutorial alone is what convinced me to try harder. It’s an interactive and well written way to learn how to move and perform basic operations in Helix. I quickly learned how to move around, select things, surround them with braces or parenthesis. I could  what I was about to do before doing it. This has been epiphany. Helix just worked the way I wanted.</p><p>Better: I could get things done faster than in VS Code after a few minutes of learning. Being a lazy person, I never bothered looking up VS Code shortcuts. Because the learning curve for Helix is slightly steeper, you  to learn those shortcuts that make moving around feel so easy.</p><p>Not only did I quickly get used to Helix key bindings: my vim muscle-memory didn’t get in the way at all!</p><p>The built-in tutorial is a very pragmatic way to get started. You get results fast, you learn hands on, and it’s not that long. But if you want to go further, you have to look for docs. Helix <a href=\"https://docs.helix-editor.com/\">has officials docs</a>. They seem to be fairly complete, but they’re also impenetrable as a new user. They focus on what the editor supports and not on what I will want to do with it.</p><p>After a bit of browsing online, I’ve stumbled upon <a href=\"https://helix-nikita-revencos-projects.vercel.app/start-here/basics\">this third-party documentation website</a>. The domain didn’t inspire me a lot of confidence, but the docs are really good. They are clearly laid out, use-case oriented, and they make the most of Astro Starlight to provide a great reading experience. The author <a href=\"https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/pull/12127#issuecomment-2525902615\">tried to upstream these docs, but that won’t happen</a>. It looks like they are upstreaming their docs to the current website. I hope this will improve the quality of upstream docs eventually.</p><p>After learning the basics and finding my way through the docs, it was time to ensure Helix was set up to help me where I needed it most.</p><p>In my free time, I mostly use my editor for three things:</p><ol><li>Tweak my website with Astro</li><li>Edit yaml to faff around my Kubernetes cluster</li></ol><p>Helix is a “stupid” text editor. It doesn’t know much about what you’re typing. But it supports Language Servers that implement the Language Server Protocol. Language Servers understand the document you’re editing. They explain to Helix what you’re editing, whether you’re in a TypeScript function, typing a markdown link, etc. With that information, Helix and the Language Server can provide code completion hints, errors &amp; warnings, and easier navigation in your code.</p><p>In addition to Language Servers, Helix also supports plugging code formatters. Those are pieces of software that will read the document and ensure that it is consistently formatted. It will check that all indentations use spaces and not tabs, that there is a consistent number of space when indenting, that brackets are on the same line as the function, etc. In short: it will make the code pretty.</p><p>Markdown is not really a programming language, so it might seem surprising to configure a Language Server for it. But if you remember what we said earlier, Language Servers can provide code completion, which is useful when creating links for example. <a href=\"https://github.com/artempyanykh/marksman\">Marksman</a> does exactly that!</p><p>We can check that Helix is happy with it with the following command</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"console\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>But Language Servers can also help Helix display errors and warnings, and “code suggestions” to help fix the issues. It means Language Servers are a perfect fit for… grammar checkers! Several grammar checkers exist. The most notable are:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://ltex-plus.github.io/ltex-plus/\">LTEX+</a>, the Language Server used by <a href=\"https://languagetool.org/\">Language Tool</a>. It supports several languages must is quite resource hungry.</li><li><a href=\"https://writewithharper.com/\">Harper</a>, a grammar checker Language Server developed by Automattic, the people behind WordPress, Tumblr, WooCommerce, Beeper and more. Harper only support English and its variants, but they intend to support more languages in the future.</li></ul><p>I mostly write in English and want to keep a minimalistic setup. Automattic is well funded, and I’m confident they will keep working on Harper to improve it. Since grammar checker LSPs can easily be changed, I’ve decided to go with Harper for now.</p><p>To install it, homebrew does the job as always:</p><p>Then I edited my <code>~/.config/helix/languages.toml</code> to add Harper as a secondary Language Server in addition to marksman</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"toml\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>Finally I can add a markdown linter to ensure my markdown is formatted properly. Several options exist, and <a href=\"https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint\">markdownlint</a> is one of the most popular. My colleagues recommended the new kid on the block, a  equivalent: <a href=\"https://github.com/rvben/rumdl\">rumdl</a>.</p><p>Installing rumdl was pretty simple on my mac. I only had to add the repository of the maintainer, and install rumdl from it.</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"console\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>After that I added a new  to my <code>~/.config/helix/languages.toml</code> and added it to the language servers to use for the markdown .</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"toml\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>Since my website already contained a  I could import it to the rumdl format with</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"console\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>You might have noticed that I’ve added a little quality of life improvement: soft-wrap at 80 characters.</p><p>Now if you add this to your own  you will notice that the text is completely left aligned.

There is <a href=\"https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/pull/9838\">a PR tackling the problem</a> but it has been stale for most of the year. The maintainers are overwhelmed by the number of PRs making it their way, and it’s not clear if or when this PR will be merged.</p><p>In the meantime, a workaround exists, with a few caveats. It is possible to add spaces to the left gutter (the column with the line numbers) so it pushes the content towards the center of the screen.</p><p>To figure out how many spaces are needed, you need to get your terminal width with </p><p>In my case, when in full screen, my terminal is 243 characters wide.

But the gutter itself has a width of 4 characters, that I need to remove from the total. So I need to subtract them from the total, which leaves me with  characters to add.</p><p>I can open my <code>~/.config/helix/config.toml</code> to add a new key binding that will automatically add or remove those spaces from the left gutter when needed, to shift the content towards the center.</p><div><figure><pre data-language=\"toml\"><code></code></pre></figure></div><p>Now when in normal mode, pressing  then  then  will add/remove the spaces.

I find it particularly easy and fast to edit code with it.</strong> It takes a tiny bit more work to get the language support than it does in VS Code, but it’s nothing insurmountable. There is a slightly steeper learning curve than for VS Code, but I consider it to be a good thing. It forced me to learn how to move around and edit efficiently, because there is no way to do it inefficiently. Helix remains intuitive once you’ve learned the basics.</p><p>I am a GNOME enthusiast, and I adhere to the same principles: <strong>I like when my apps work out of the box, and when I have little to do to configure them.</strong> This is a strong stance that often attracts a vocal opposition. I like products that follow those principles better than those who don’t.</p><p>With that said, Helix sometimes feels like it is maintained by one or two people who have a strong vision, but who struggle to onboard more maintainers. As of writing, Helix has more than 350 PRs open. Quite a few bring interesting features, but the maintainers don’t have enough time to review them.</p><p>Those 350 PRs mean there is a lot of energy and goodwill around the project. <strong>People are willing to contribute. Right now, all that energy is gated, resulting in frustration</strong> both from the contributors who feel like they’re working in the void, and the maintainers who feel like there at the receiving end of a fire hose.</p><p><strong>A solution to make everyone happier without sacrificing the quality of the project would be to work on a Contributor Ladder.</strong> CHAOSS’ Dr Dawn Foster published <a href=\"https://fastwonderblog.com/2025/08/12/governance-part-3-new-contributors-and-pathways-to-leadership/\">a blog post about it</a>, listing interesting resources at the end.</p>",

      "content": "<p>We recently overhauled our internal tools for visualizing the compilation of JavaScript and WebAssembly. When SpiderMonkey’s optimizing compiler, Ion, is active, we can now produce interactive graphs showing exactly how functions are processed and optimized.</p><div><p>You can play with these graphs right here on this page. Simply write some JavaScript code in the  function and see what graph is produced. You can click and drag to navigate, ctrl-scroll to zoom, and drag the slider at the bottom to scrub through the optimization process.</p><p>As you experiment, take note of how stable the graph layout is, even as the sizes of blocks change or new structures are added. Try clicking a block's title to select it, then drag the slider and watch the graph change while the block remains in place. Or, click an instruction's number to highlight it so you can keep an eye on it across passes.</p></div><p>We are not the first to visualize our compiler’s internal graphs, of course, nor the first to make them interactive. But I was not satisfied with the output of common tools like <a href=\"https://graphviz.org/\">Graphviz</a> or <a href=\"https://mermaid.js.org/\">Mermaid</a>, so I decided to create a layout algorithm specifically tailored to our needs. The resulting algorithm is simple, fast, produces surprisingly high-quality output, and can be implemented in less than a thousand lines of code. The purpose of this article is to walk you through this algorithm and the design concepts behind it.</p><div><p><i>Read this post on desktop to see an interactive demo of iongraph.</i></p></div><p>As readers of this blog already know, SpiderMonkey has several tiers of execution for JavaScript and WebAssembly code. The highest tier is known as Ion, an optimizing SSA compiler that takes the most time to compile but produces the highest-quality output.</p><p>Working with Ion frequently requires us to visualize and debug the SSA graph. Since 2011 we have used a tool for this purpose called <a href=\"https://github.com/sstangl/iongraph\">iongraph</a>, built by Sean Stangl. It is a simple Python script that takes a JSON dump of our compiler graphs and uses Graphviz to produce a PDF. It is perfectly adequate, and very much the status quo for compiler authors, but unfortunately the Graphviz output has many problems that make our work tedious and frustrating.</p><p>The first problem is that the Graphviz output rarely bears any resemblance to the source code that produced it. Graphviz will place nodes wherever it feels will minimize error, resulting in a graph that snakes left and right seemingly at random. There is no visual intuition for how deeply nested a block of code is, nor is it easy to determine which blocks are inside or outside of loops. Consider the following function, and its Graphviz graph:</p><div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div></div><p>Counterintuitively, the  appears  the two assignments in the body of the loop. Since this graph mirrors JavaScript control flow, we’d expect to see the return at the bottom. This problem only gets worse as graphs grow larger and more complex.</p><p>The second, related problem is that Graphviz’s output is unstable. Small changes to the input can result in large changes to the output. As you page through the graphs of each pass within Ion, nodes will jump left and right, true and false branches will swap, loops will run up the right side instead of the left, and so on. This makes it very hard to understand the actual effect of any given pass. Consider the following before and after, and notice how the second graph is almost—but not quite—a mirror image of the first, despite very minimal changes to the graph’s structure:</p><p>None of this felt right to me. Control flow graphs should be able to follow the structure of the program that produced them. After all, a control flow graph has many restrictions that a general-purpose tool would not be aware of: they have very few cycles, all of which are well-defined because they come from loops; furthermore, both JavaScript and WebAssembly have reducible control flow, meaning all loops have only one entry, and it is not possible to jump directly into the middle of a loop. This information could be used to our advantage.</p><p>Beyond that, a static PDF is far from ideal when exploring complicated graphs. Finding the inputs or uses of a given instruction is a tedious and frustrating exercise, as is following arrows from block to block. Even just zooming in and out is difficult. I eventually concluded that we ought to just build an interactive tool to overcome these limitations.</p><h2>How hard could layout be?</h2><p>I had one false start with graph layout, with an algorithm that attempted to sort blocks into vertical “tracks”. This broke down quickly on a variety of programs and I was forced to go back to the drawing board—in fact, back to the source of the very tool I was trying to replace.</p><p>The algorithm used by , the typical hierarchical layout mode for Graphviz, is known as the Sugiyama layout algorithm, from a 1981 paper by Sugiyama et al. As introduction, I found a short series of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_FbSCWLC3A&amp;list=PLubYOWSl9mIvoXDwf_Wqcrvlg15N_AWQE&amp;index=38\">lectures</a> that broke down the Sugiyama algorithm into 5 steps:</p><ol><li>, where the direction of some edges are flipped in order to produce a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph\">DAG</a>.</li><li>, where vertices are assigned into horizontal layers according to their depth in the graph, and dummy vertices are added to any edge that crosses multiple layers.</li><li>, where vertices on a layer are reordered in order to minimize the number of edge crossings.</li><li>, where vertices are horizontally positioned in order to make the edges as straight as possible.</li><li>, where the final graph is rendered to the screen.</li></ol><p>These steps struck me as surprisingly straightforward, and provided useful opportunities to insert our own knowledge of the problem:</p><ul><li>Cycle breaking would be trivial for us, since the only cycles in our data are loops, and loop backedges are explicitly labeled. We could simply ignore backedges when laying out the graph.</li><li>Leveling would be straightforward, and could easily be modified to better mimic the source code. Specifically, any blocks coming after a loop in the source code could be artificially pushed down in the layout, solving the confusing early-exit problem.</li><li>Permuting vertices to reduce edge crossings was actually just a bad idea, since our goal was stability from graph to graph. The true and false branches of a condition should always appear in the same order, for example, and a few edge crossings is a small price to pay for this stability.</li><li>Since reducible control flow ensures that a program’s loops form a tree, vertex positioning could ensure that loops are always well-nested in the final graph.</li></ul><p>Taken all together, these simplifications resulted in a remarkably straightforward algorithm, with the <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla-spidermonkey/iongraph/blob/fc27ee3e8f3bd3c020aaf2498de9a260da089bc1/src/Graph.ts\">initial implementation</a> being just 1000 lines of JavaScript. (See this <a href=\"https://x.com/its_bvisness/status/1957565307809329465?s=46\">demo</a> for what it looked like at the time.) It also proved to be very efficient, since it avoided the most computationally complex parts of the Sugiyama algorithm.</p><h2>iongraph from start to finish</h2><p>We will now go through the entire iongraph layout algorithm. Each section contains explanatory diagrams, in which rectangles are basic blocks and circles are dummy nodes. Loop header blocks (the single entry point to each loop) are additionally colored green.</p><p>Be aware that the block positions in these diagrams are not representative of the actual computed layout position at each point in the process. For example, vertical positions are not calculated until the very end, but it would be hard to communicate what the algorithm was doing if all blocks were drawn on a single line!</p><p>We first sort the basic blocks into horizontal tracks called “layers”. This is very simple; we just start at layer 0 and recursively walk the graph, incrementing the layer number as we go. As we go, we track the “height” of each loop, not in pixels, but in layers.</p><p>We also take this opportunity to vertically position nodes “inside” and “outside” of loops. Whenever we see an edge that exits a loop, we defer the layering of the destination block until we are done layering the loop contents, at which point we know the loop’s height.</p><p>A note on implementation: nodes are visited multiple times throughout the process, not just once. This can produce a quadratic explosion for large graphs, but I find that an early-out is sufficient to avoid this problem in practice.</p><p>The animation below shows the layering algorithm in action. Notice how the final block in the graph is visited twice, once after each loop that branches to it, and in each case, the block is deferred until the entire loop has been layered, rather than processed immediately after its predecessor block. The final position of the block is below the entirety of both loops, rather than directly below one of its predecessors as Graphviz would do. (Remember, horizontal and vertical positions have not yet been computed; the positions of the blocks in this diagram are hardcoded for demonstration purposes.)</p><div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div></div><h3>Step 2: Create dummy nodes</h3><p>Any time an edge crosses a layer, we create a dummy node. This allows edges to be routed across layers without overlapping any blocks. Unlike in traditional Sugiyama, we always put downward dummies on the left and upward dummies on the right, producing a consistent “counter-clockwise” flow. This also makes it easy to read long vertical edges, whose direction would otherwise be ambiguous. (Recall how the loop backedge flipped from the right to the left in the “unstable layout” Graphviz example from before.)</p><p>In addition, we coalesce any edges that are going to the same destination by merging their dummy nodes. This heavily reduces visual noise.</p><p>This is the fuzziest and most ad-hoc part of the process. Basically, we run lots of small passes that walk up and down the graph, aligning layout nodes with each other. Our edge-straightening passes include:</p><ul><li>Pushing nodes to the right of their loop header to “indent” them.</li><li>Walking a layer left to right, moving children to the right to line up with their parents. If any nodes overlap as a result, they are pushed further to the right.</li><li>Walking a layer right to left, moving parents to the right to line up with their children. This version is more conservative and will not move a node if it would overlap with another. This cleans up most issues from the first pass.</li><li>Straightening runs of dummy nodes so we have clean vertical lines.</li><li>“Sucking in” dummy runs on the left side of the graph if there is room for them to move to the right.</li><li>Straighten out any edges that are “nearly straight”, according to a chosen threshold. This makes the graph appear less wobbly. We do this by repeatedly “combing” the graph upward and downward, aligning parents with children, then children with parents, and so on.</li></ul><p>It is important to note that dummy nodes participate fully in this system. If for example you have two side-by-side loops, straightening the left loop’s backedge will push the right loop to the side, avoiding overlaps and preserving the graph’s visual structure.</p><p>We do not reach a fixed point with this strategy, nor do we attempt to. I find that if you continue to repeatedly apply these particular layout passes, nodes will wander to the right forever. Instead, the layout passes are hand-tuned to produce decent-looking results for most of the graphs we look at on a regular basis. That said, this could certainly be improved, especially for larger graphs which do benefit from more iterations.</p><p>At the end of this step, all nodes have a fixed X-coordinate and will not be modified further.</p><h3>Step 4: Track horizontal edges</h3><p>Edges may overlap visually as they run horizontally between layers. To resolve this, we sort edges into parallel “tracks”, giving each a vertical offset. After tracking all the edges, we record the total height of the tracks and store it on the preceding layer as its “track height”. This allows us to leave room for the edges in the final layout step.</p><p>We first sort edges by their starting position, left to right. This produces a consistent arrangement of edges that has few vertical crossings in practice. Edges are then placed into tracks from the “outside in”, stacking rightward edges on top and leftward edges on the bottom, creating a new track if the edge would overlap with or cross any other edge.</p><p>The diagram below is interactive. Click and drag the blocks to see how the horizontal edges get assigned to tracks.</p><div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div></div><p>Finally, we assign each node a Y-coordinate. Starting at a Y-coordinate of zero, we iterate through the layers, repeatedly adding the layer’s height and its track height, where the layer height is the maximum height of any node in the layer. All nodes within a layer receive the same Y-coordinate; this is simple and easier to read than Graphviz’s default of vertically centering nodes within a layer.</p><p>Now that every node has both an X and Y coordinate, the layout process is complete.</p><div><div><pre><code></code></pre></div></div><p>The details of rendering are out of scope for this article, and depend on the specific application. However, I wish to highlight a stylistic decision that I feel makes our graphs more readable.</p><p>When rendering edges, we use a style inspired by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_diagram\">railroad diagrams</a>. These have many advantages over the Bézier curves employed by Graphviz. First, straight lines feel more organized and are easier to follow when scrolling up and down. Second, they are easy to route (vertical when crossing layers, horizontal between layers). Third, they are easy to coalesce when they share a destination, and the junctions provide a clear indication of the edge’s direction. Fourth, they always cross at right angles, improving clarity and reducing the need to avoid edge crossings in the first place.</p><p>Consider the following example. There are several edge crossings that may traditionally be considered undesirable—yet the edges and their directions remain clear. Of particular note is the vertical junction highlighted in red on the left: not only is it immediately clear that these edges share a destination, but the junction itself signals that the edges are flowing downward. I find this much more pleasant than the “rat’s nest” that Graphviz tends to produce.</p><p>It may seem surprising that such a simple (and stupid) layout algorithm could produce such readable graphs, when more sophisticated layout algorithms struggle. However, I feel that the algorithm succeeds  of its simplicity.</p><p>Most graph layout algorithms are optimization problems, where error is minimized on some chosen metrics. However, these metrics seem to correlate poorly to readability in practice. For example, it seems good in theory to rearrange nodes to minimize edge crossings. But a predictable order of nodes seems to produce more sensible results overall, and simple rules for edge routing are sufficient to keep things tidy. (As a bonus, this also gives us layout stability from pass to pass.) Similarly, layout rules like “align parents with their children” produce more readable results than “minimize the lengths of edges”.</p><p>Furthermore, by rejecting the optimization problem, a human author gains more control over the layout. We are able to position nodes “inside” of loops, and push post-loop content down in the graph,  we reject this global constraint-solver approach. Minimizing “error” is meaningless compared to a human  meaning through thoughtful design.</p><p>And finally, the resulting algorithm is simply more efficient. All the layout passes in iongraph are easy to program and scale gracefully to large graphs because they run in roughly linear time. It is better, in my view, to run a fixed number of layout iterations according to your graph complexity and time budget, rather than to run a complex constraint solver until it is “done”.</p><p>By following this philosophy, even the worst graphs become tractable. Below is a screenshot of a zlib function, compiled to WebAssembly, and rendered using the old tool.</p><p>It took about  for Graphviz to produce this spaghetti nightmare. By comparison, iongraph can now lay out this function in . The result is still not particularly beautiful, but it renders thousands of times faster  is much easier to navigate.</p><p>Perhaps programmers ought to put less trust into magic optimizing systems, especially when a human-friendly result is the goal. Simple (and stupid) algorithms can be very effective when applied with discretion and taste.</p><p>We have already integrated iongraph into the Firefox profiler, making it easy for us to view the graphs of the most expensive or impactful functions we find in our performance work. Unfortunately, this is only available in specific builds of the SpiderMonkey shell, and is not available in full browser builds. This is due to architectural differences in how profiling data is captured and the flags with which the browser and shell are built. I would love for Firefox users to someday be able to view these graphs themselves, but at the moment we have no plans to expose this to the browser. However, one bug tracking some related work can be found <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1987005\">here</a>.</p><p>We will continue to sporadically update iongraph with more features to aid us in our work. We have several ideas for new features, including <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla-spidermonkey/iongraph/issues/9\">richer navigation</a>, search, and visualization of <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla-spidermonkey/iongraph/issues/4\">register allocation info</a>. However, we have no explicit roadmap for when these features may be released.</p><p>To experiment with iongraph locally, you can run a debug build of the SpiderMonkey shell with ; this will dump information to . This file can then be loaded into the <a href=\"https://mozilla-spidermonkey.github.io/iongraph/\">standalone deployment of iongraph</a>. Please be aware that the user experience is rough and unpolished in its current state.</p><p>The source code for iongraph can be found on <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla-spidermonkey/iongraph\">GitHub</a>. If this subject interests you, we would welcome contributions to iongraph and its integration into the browser.

This exposed countless internal projects, financial reports, and dealer dashboards.</li><li>Exposed Azuga API key compromised test drive fleet management system.</li></ul><p>If you are in the US and ask your friends and family if they have heard of “Tata Motors”, they would likely say no. However, if you go overseas, Tata Motors and the Tata Group in general are a massive, well-known conglomerate. Back in 2023, I took my hacking adventures overseas and found many vulnerabilities with Tata Motors. This post covers 4 of the most impactful findings I discovered that I am finally ready to share today. Let’s dive in!</p><p><strong>Note that all secrets/credentials shown have been rotated</strong>, meaning they are no longer valid and cannot be used anymore. Additionally, no substantial amounts of data were downloaded as part of any testing, nor was there any obvious evidence of malicious access.</p><h2><strong>AWS Keys in E-Dukaan Marketplace</strong></h2><p><a href=\"https://edukaan.cv.tatamotors/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">E-Dukaan</a> is a Tata Motors site where their customers can buy spare parts for their vehicles. It’s a typical E-Commerce site, but it had a dark secret!</p><p>Can you see it? Right there, in plaintext, are AWS keys. For those unfamiliar, you NEVER EVER want to expose these because people can use them to download all your files stored on Amazon, upload malicious content, rack up massive bills, etc.</p><p>Intrigued, I put them into S3 Browser to see what it unlocked access to. The answer was.. basically everything. A long list of buckets packed with sensitive information. Here’s a few examples:</p><p><strong>A customer database backup?</strong> Check ✅</p><p><strong>Customer lists and market intelligence?</strong> Yup ✅</p><p><strong>Hundreds of thousands of invoices for E-Dukaan containing customer information, like PAN?</strong> Of course ✅</p><p> Absolutely ✅ (about 40 GB worth of reports in here)</p><p>You may be wondering, where was this AWS keyset actually used? What made it worth the risk of exposing so much? Answer: to download a 4 KB file containing tax codes:</p><h2><strong>Decryptable AWS Keys in FleetEdge</strong></h2><p>Finding the AWS keys in E-Dukaan was so easy that it felt like cheating. This next one was more challenging (but not by much).</p><p><a href=\"https://fleetedge.home.tatamotors/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">FleetEdge</a> is Tata Motors’ fleet management/tracking solution. More info is <a href=\"https://fleetedge.tatamotors.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here</a>. Looking at the API calls that are executed on site load as a guest user, one immediately stuck out:</p><p>Right there in the response is another set of AWS keys, but this time they were not plaintext – they appeared to be encrypted. A quick search of a decrypt method turned up the exact code, and setting a breakpoint there was enough to reveal the contents:</p><p><a href=\"https://eaton-works.com/2025/08/18/intel-outside-hack/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">As recently seen with Intel</a>, there seems to be a trend where developers will do this pointless client-side decryption. When the client has the key, it’s strange that anyone would think that would be secure. Maybe these devs knew what the E-Dukaan team was doing and wanted to (try) doing things a little better?</p><p>This set of AWS keys has a similarly serious impact. There was another long list of new buckets you could access. At one point, S3 Browser had estimated  in one bucket before it crashed. Here’s a few examples:</p><p>Fleet insights – this is where 70 TB+ of data was found. There was some datalake with files going back to 1996!</p><p>You also had write access to some websites. You could easily slip in some malware on the frontpage and wreak some havoc.</p><h2><strong>Backdoor admin access to Tableau</strong></h2><p> This flaw is not believed to be linked to Tableau itself and instead was introduced by Tata Motors.</p><p>Let’s go back to E-Dukaan now. Turns out, it’s the gift that keeps on giving. Poking around the source code of the website, I came across some interesting code:</p><p>The first obvious issue was the username and password in the comments. If you look closer, you can see an HTTP call to get a “trusted token”. Crucially, it only needs username and site name (no password). Thanks to the code comment, we had a username to try. Performing the HTTP POST manually yielded a token!</p><p>When you plug that into the infoviz URL like the code does, you will be redirected to Tableau!</p><p>But there is more fun to be had. This user didn’t have access to much. Since we essentially had a backdoor into Tableau needing only username, we could in theory log in as anyone. One of the cards had the server admin as the owner, and it was possible to get the username that way:</p><p>With that in hand, I went through the same process of getting a token, and then I had total control over Tableau with access to everything. I didn’t dig too deep after this since it was a lot of sensitive corporate stuff, and I had proven the vulnerability at this point.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.azuga.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Azuga</a> is a fleet management platform. Tata Motors used it for their test drive website, presumably to keep tabs on where their cars are. Right there in the JS code was the Azuga token that should never have left the server. A quick API test was enough to confirm it was valid, and that is where I wrapped things up.</p><p>All 4 issues were reported to Tata Motors through CERT-IN. Tata Motors was a bit slow in rotating the AWS keys. Given what was exposed, I had hoped they would have done it faster.</p><ul><li> Reported. A response is received shortly after confirming they will take action with the concerned authority.</li><li> I request an update.</li><li> Tata Motors shared with CERT-IN (who then shared with me) that the issues are remediated.</li><li> I confirm  issues were remediated and the AWS keys were still present on the websites, and active.</li><li> After no updates and finding the AWS issues still not remediated, I send over some more specific steps on what must be done.</li><li> They confirm receipt and are working on taking action. After this date and up until , there were various back and forth emails trying to get Tata Motors to revoke the AWS keys. I am not sure if something was lost in translation, but it took a lot of pestering and specific instructions to get it done.</li></ul><h2><strong>India’s largest automaker should be more secure</strong></h2><p>Compared to some of my other recent hacks, these weren’t anything super sophisticated. You just had to know where to look. Secrets leak all the time, but the impact is often tempered by the secret having limited access. In this case, having 2 sets of AWS keys leak with access to so much is incredibly concerning. When buying a car, you should be able to trust the automaker will take reasonable actions to keep your data secure. I hope Tata Motors does better in the future – someone else would have absolutely discovered these vulnerabilities at some point, and that would have been a much darker story.</p>",

      "content": "<p>The world is in a race to build its first quantum computer capable of solving practical problems not feasible on even the largest conventional supercomputers. While the quantum computing paradigm promises many benefits, it also threatens the security of the Internet by breaking much of the cryptography we have come to rely on.</p><p>To mitigate this threat, Cloudflare is helping to migrate the Internet to Post-Quantum (PQ) cryptography. Today, <a href=\"https://radar.cloudflare.com/adoption-and-usage#post-quantum-encryption\"></a> of traffic to Cloudflare's edge network is protected against the most urgent threat: an attacker who can intercept and store encrypted traffic today and then decrypt it in the future with the help of a quantum computer. This is referred to as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_now,_decrypt_later\"><u>harvest now, decrypt later</u></a>threat.</p><p>However, this is just one of the threats we need to address. A quantum computer can also be used to crack a server's <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/transport-layer-security-tls/\"></a> certificate, allowing an attacker to impersonate the server to unsuspecting clients. The good news is that we already have PQ algorithms we can use for quantum-safe authentication. The bad news is that adoption of these algorithms in TLS will require significant changes to one of the most complex and security-critical systems on the Internet: the Web Public-Key Infrastructure (WebPKI).</p><p>The central problem is the sheer size of these new algorithms: signatures for ML-DSA-44, one of the most performant PQ algorithms standardized by NIST, are 2,420 bytes long, compared to just 64 bytes for ECDSA-P256, the most popular non-PQ signature in use today; and its public keys are 1,312 bytes long, compared to just 64 bytes for ECDSA. That's a roughly 20-fold increase in size. Worse yet, the average TLS handshake includes a number of public keys and signatures, adding up to 10s of kilobytes of overhead per handshake. This is enough to have a <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/another-look-at-pq-signatures/#how-many-added-bytes-are-too-many-for-tls\"></a> on the performance of TLS.</p><p>That makes drop-in PQ certificates a tough sell to enable today: they don’t bring any security benefit before Q-day — the day a cryptographically relevant quantum computer arrives — but they do degrade performance. We could sit and wait until Q-day is a year away, but that’s playing with fire. Migrations always take longer than expected, and by waiting we risk the security and privacy of the Internet, which is <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/universal-ssl/\"></a>.</p><p>It's clear that we must find a way to make post-quantum certificates cheap enough to deploy today by default for everyone — not just those that can afford it. In this post, we'll introduce you to the plan we’ve brought together with industry partners to the <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/plants/about/\"></a> to redesign the WebPKI in order to allow a smooth transition to PQ authentication with no performance impact (and perhaps a performance improvement!). We'll provide an overview of one concrete proposal, called <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-davidben-tls-merkle-tree-certs/\"><u>Merkle Tree Certificates (MTCs)</u></a>, whose goal is to whittle down the number of public keys and signatures in the TLS handshake to the bare minimum required.</p><p>But talk is cheap. We <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/experiment-with-pq/\"></a><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-encrypted-client-hello/\"></a><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/why-tls-1-3-isnt-in-browsers-yet/\"></a> that, as with any change to the Internet, it's crucial to test early and often. <b>Today we're announcing our intent to deploy MTCs on an experimental basis in collaboration with Chrome Security.</b> In this post, we'll describe the scope of this experiment, what we hope to learn from it, and how we'll make sure it's done safely.</p><div><h2>The WebPKI today — an old system with many patches</h2><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/bootstrap-mtc/#the-webpki-today-an-old-system-with-many-patches\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a></div><p>Why does the TLS handshake have so many public keys and signatures?</p><p>Let's start with Cryptography 101. When your browser connects to a website, it asks the server to  itself to make sure it's talking to the real server and not an impersonator. This is usually achieved with a cryptographic primitive known as a digital signature scheme (e.g., ECDSA or ML-DSA). In TLS, the server signs the messages exchanged between the client and server using its , and the client verifies the signature using the server's . In this way, the server confirms to the client that they've had the same conversation, since only the server could have produced a valid signature.</p><p>If the client already knows the server's public key, then only  is required to authenticate the server. In practice, however, this is not really an option. The web today is made up of around a billion TLS servers, so it would be unrealistic to provision every client with the public key of every server. What's more, the set of public keys will change over time as new servers come online and existing ones rotate their keys, so we would need some way of pushing these changes to clients.</p><p>This scaling problem is at the heart of the design of all PKIs.</p><p>Instead of expecting the client to know the server's public key in advance, the server might just send its public key during the TLS handshake. But how does the client know that the public key actually belongs to the server? This is the job of a .</p><p>A certificate binds a public key to the identity of the server — usually its DNS name, e.g., . The certificate is signed by a Certification Authority (CA) whose public key is known to the client. In addition to verifying the server's handshake signature, the client verifies the signature of this certificate. This establishes a chain of trust: by accepting the certificate, the client is trusting that the CA verified that the public key actually belongs to the server with that identity.</p><p>Clients are typically configured to trust many CAs and must be provisioned with a public key for each. Things are much easier however, since there are only 100s of CAs instead of billions. In addition, new certificates can be created without having to update clients.</p><p>These efficiencies come at a relatively low cost: for those counting at home, that's  signature and  public key, for a total of <b>2 signatures and 1 public key</b> per TLS handshake.</p><p>That's not the end of the story, however. As the WebPKI has evolved, so have these chains of trust grown a bit longer. These days it's common for a chain to consist of two or more certificates rather than just one. This is because CAs sometimes need to rotatetheir keys, just as servers do. But before they can start using the new key, they must distribute the corresponding public key to clients. This takes time, since it requires billions of clients to update their trust stores. To bridge the gap, the CA will sometimes use the old key to issue a certificate for the new one and append this certificate to the end of the chain.</p><p>That's signature and public key, which brings us to<b> 3 signatures and 2 public keys</b>. And we still have a little ways to go.</p><p>The main job of a CA is to verify that a server has control over the domain for which it’s requesting a certificate. This process has evolved over the years from a high-touch, CA-specific process to a standardized, <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555/\"></a> used for issuing most certificates on the web. (Not all CAs fully support automation, however.) This evolution is marked by a number of security incidents in which a certificate was to a party other than the server, allowing that party to impersonate the server to any client that trusts the CA.</p><p>Automation helps, but <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DigiNotar#Issuance_of_fraudulent_certificates\"></a> are still possible, and mistakes are almost inevitable. <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/unauthorized-issuance-of-certificates-for-1-1-1-1/\"></a>, several certificates for Cloudflare's encrypted 1.1.1.1 resolver were issued without our involvement or authorization. This apparently occurred by accident, but it nonetheless put users of 1.1.1.1 at risk. (The mis-issued certificates have since been revoked.)</p><p>Ensuring mis-issuance is detectable is the job of the Certificate Transparency (CT) ecosystem. The basic idea is that each certificate issued by a CA gets added to a public . Servers can audit these logs for certificates issued in their name. If ever a certificate is issued that they didn't request itself, the server operator can prove the issuance happened, and the PKI ecosystem can take action to prevent the certificate from being trusted by clients.</p><p>Major browsers, including Firefox and Chrome and its derivatives, require certificates to be logged before they can be trusted. For example, Chrome, Safari, and Firefox will only accept the server's certificate if it appears in at least two logs the browser is configured to trust. This policy is easy to state, but tricky to implement in practice:</p><ol><li><p>Operating a CT log has historically been fairly expensive. Logs ingest billions of certificates over their lifetimes: when an incident happens, or even just under high load, it can take some time for a log to make a new entry available for auditors.</p></li><li><p>Clients can't really audit logs themselves, since this would expose their browsing history (i.e., the servers they wanted to connect to) to the log operators.</p></li></ol><p>The solution to both problems is to include a signature from the CT log along with the certificate. The signature is produced immediately in response to a request to log a certificate, and attests to the log's intent to include the certificate in the log within 24 hours.</p><p>Per browser policy, certificate transparency adds  signatures to the TLS handshake, one for each log. This brings us to a total of <b>5 signatures and 2 public keys</b> in a typical handshake on the public web.</p><p>The WebPKI is a living, breathing, and highly distributed system. We've had to patch it a number of times over the years to keep it going, but on balance it has served our needs quite well — until now.</p><p>Previously, whenever we needed to update something in the WebPKI, we would tack on another signature. This strategy has worked because conventional cryptography is so cheap.

On the familiar side, the subject and public key are exactly what we might expect: the DNS name is  and the public key is for a familiar signature algorithm, ECDSA-P256. This algorithm is not PQ, of course — in the future we would put ML-DSA-44 there instead.</p><p>On the unusual side, OpenSSL appears to not recognize the signature algorithm of the issuer and just prints the raw OID and bytes of the signature. There's a good reason for this: the MTC does not have a signature in it at all! So what exactly are we looking at?</p><p>The trick to leave out signatures is that a Merkle Tree Certification Authority (MTCA) produces its  certificates  rather than individually. In place of a signature, the certificate has an  of the certificate in a batch of certificates signed by the MTCA.</p><p>To understand how inclusion proofs work, let's think about a slightly simplified version of the MTC specification. To issue a batch, the MTCA arranges the unsigned certificates into a data structure called a  that looks like this:</p><p>Each leaf of the tree corresponds to a certificate, and each inner node is equal to the hash of its children. To sign the batch, the MTCA uses its secret key to sign the head of the tree. The structure of the tree guarantees that each certificate in the batch was signed by the MTCA: if we tried to tweak the bits of any one of the certificates, the treehead would end up having a different value, which would cause the signature to fail.</p><p>An inclusion proof for a certificate consists of the hash of each sibling node along the path from the certificate to the treehead:</p><p>Given a validated treehead, this sequence of hashes is sufficient to prove inclusion of the certificate in the tree. This means that, in order to validate an MTC, the client also needs to obtain the signed treehead from the MTCA.</p><p>This is the key to MTC's efficiency:</p><ol><li><p>Signed treeheads can be disseminated to clients out-of-band and validated offline. Each validated treehead can then be used to validate any certificate in the corresponding batch, eliminating the need to obtain a signature for each server certificate.</p></li><li><p>During the TLS handshake, the client tells the server which treeheads it has. If the server has a signatureless certificate covered by one of those treeheads, then it can use that certificate to authenticate itself. That's <b>1 signature,1 public key and 1 inclusion proof</b> per handshake, both for the server being authenticated.</p></li></ol><p>Now, that's the simplified version. MTC proper has some more bells and whistles. To start, it doesn’t create a separate Merkle tree for each batch, but it grows a single large tree, which is used for better transparency. As this tree grows, periodically (sub)tree heads are selected to be shipped to browsers, which we call . In the common case browsers will be able to fetch the most recent landmarks, and servers can wait for batch issuance, but we need a fallback: MTC also supports certificates that can be issued immediately and don’t require landmarks to be validated, but these are not as small. A server would provision both types of Merkle tree certificates, so that the common case is fast, and the exceptional case is slow, but at least it’ll work.</p><p>Ever since early designs for MTCs emerged, we’ve been eager to experiment with the idea. In line with the IETF principle of “<a href=\"https://www.ietf.org/runningcode/\"></a>”, it often takes implementing a protocol to work out kinks in the design. At the same time, we cannot risk the security of users. In this section, we describe our approach to experimenting with aspects of the Merkle Tree Certificates design  changing any trust relationships.</p><p>Let’s start with what we hope to learn. We have lots of questions whose answers can help to either validate the approach, or uncover pitfalls that require reshaping the protocol — in fact, an implementation of an early MTC draft by <a href=\"https://www.cs.ru.nl/masters-theses/2025/M_Pohl___Implementation_and_Analysis_of_Merkle_Tree_Certificates_for_Post-Quantum_Secure_Authentication_in_TLS.pdf\"></a> and <a href=\"https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-davidben-tls-merkle-tree-certs-07.html#name-acknowledgements\"></a> did exactly this. We’d like to know:</p><p> Protocol ossification (the tendency of implementation bugs to make it harder to change a protocol) is an ever-present issue with deploying protocol changes. For TLS in particular, despite having built-in flexibility, time after time we’ve found that if that flexibility is not regularly used, there will be buggy implementations and middleboxes that break when they see things they don’t recognize. TLS 1.3 deployment <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/why-tls-1-3-isnt-in-browsers-yet/\"></a> than we hoped for this very reason. And more recently, the rollout of PQ key exchange in TLS caused the Client Hello to be split over multiple TCP packets, something that many middleboxes <a href=\"https://tldr.fail/\"></a>.</p><p><b>What is the performance impact?</b> In fact, we expect MTCs to the size of the handshake, even compared to today's non-PQ certificates. They will also reduce CPU cost: ML-DSA signature verification is about as fast as ECDSA, and there will be far fewer signatures to verify. We therefore expect to see a . We would like to see if there is a measurable performance improvement.</p><p><b>What fraction of clients will stay up to date? </b>Getting the performance benefit of MTCs requires the clients and servers to be roughly in sync with one another. We expect MTCs to have fairly short lifetimes, a week or so. This means that if the client's latest landmark is older than a week, the server would have to fallback to a larger certificate. Knowing how often this fallback happens will help us tune the parameters of the protocol to make fallbacks less likely.</p><p>In order to answer these questions, we are implementing MTC support in our TLS stack and in our certificate issuance infrastructure. For their part, Chrome is implementing MTC support in their own TLS stack and will stand up infrastructure to disseminate landmarks to their users.</p><p>As we've done in past experiments, we plan to enable MTCs for a subset of our free customers with enough traffic that we will be able to get useful measurements. Chrome will control the experimental rollout: they can ramp up slowly, measuring as they go and rolling back if and when bugs are found.</p><p>Which leaves us with one last question: who will run the Merkle Tree CA?</p><div><h3>Bootstrapping trust from the existing WebPKI</h3><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/bootstrap-mtc/#bootstrapping-trust-from-the-existing-webpki\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a></div><p>Standing up a proper CA is no small task: it takes years to be trusted by major browsers. That’s why Cloudflare isn’t going to become a “real” CA for this experiment, and Chrome isn’t going to trust us directly.</p><p>Instead, to make progress on a reasonable timeframe, without sacrificing due diligence, we plan to \"mock\" the role of the MTCA. We will run an MTCA (on <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/azul/\"></a> based on our <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/azul-certificate-transparency-log/\"></a>), but for each MTC we issue, we also publish an existing certificate from a trusted CA that agrees with it. We call this the . When Chrome’s infrastructure pulls updates from our MTCA log, they will also pull these bootstrap certificates, and check whether they agree. Only if they do, they’ll proceed to push the corresponding landmarks to Chrome clients. In other words, Cloudflare is effectively just “re-encoding” an existing certificate (with domain validation performed by a trusted CA) as an MTC, and Chrome is using certificate transparency to keep us honest.</p><p>With almost 50% of our traffic already protected by post-quantum encryption, we’re halfway to a fully post-quantum secure Internet. The second part of our journey, post-quantum certificates, is the hardest yet though. A simple drop-in upgrade has a noticeable performance impact and no security benefit before Q-day. This means it’s a hard sell to enable today by default. But here we are playing with fire: migrations always take longer than expected. If we want to keep an ubiquitously private and secure Internet, we need a post-quantum solution that’s performant enough to be enabled by default .</p><p>Merkle Tree Certificates (MTCs) solves this problem by reducing the number of signatures and public keys to the bare minimum while maintaining the WebPKI's essential properties. We plan to roll out MTCs to a fraction of free accounts by early next year. This does not affect any visitors that are not part of the Chrome experiment. For those that are, thanks to the bootstrap certificates, there is no impact on security.</p><p>We’re excited to keep the Internet fast  secure, and will report back soon on the results of this experiment: watch this space! MTC is evolving as we speak, if you want to get involved, please join the IETF <a href=\"https://mailman3.ietf.org/mailman3/lists/plants@ietf.org/\"></a>.</p>",

      "content": "<p>The ongoing development of Tor Browser is made possible thanks to the support of our community. If Tor Browser is important to you, now is a great time to support our mission to , as all donations will be matched by <a href=\"https://powerupprivacy.com/\">Power Up Privacy</a> through December 31, 2025.</p><p>Tor Browser 15.0 inherits a multitude of useful new features and usability improvements from Firefox that have passed our audit. For desktop, these include vertical tabs: providing a more manageable, alternative layout with open and pinned tabs stacked in a sidebar rather than across the top of the window. For ease of access, Bookmarks can be retrieved directly from the sidebar when expanded too. However, regardless of whether you prefer horizontal or vertical tabs, everyone  benefits from the addition of tab groups: helping you keep on top of the clutter by organizing tabs into collapsible groups that can be given names and color-coded. Tor Browser 15.0 also inherits elements of Firefox's recent address bar refresh, including a new unified search button that allows you to switch search engines on the fly, search bookmarks or tabs, and reference quick actions from the same menu.</p><p>Note that Tor Browser tabs are still private tabs, and will clear when you close the browser. This enforces a kind of natural tidiness in Tor Browser since each new session starts fresh – however for privacy-conscious power users, project managers, researchers, or anyone else who accumulates tabs frighteningly quickly, we hope these organizational improvements will give you a much needed productivity boost.</p><p>On Android, screen lock adds an extra layer of security to your browsing sessions. After enabling screen lock in Settings &gt; Tabs, your tabs will lock automatically when you switch away from the browser without closing it. Upon returning to the app, you'll be prompted to unlock your tabs using your fingerprint, face, or pass code, depending on which option your device is configured to use.</p><p>Like Tor Browser for Desktop, your browsing session will still be cleared when Tor Browser is closed. However, this feature provides peace of mind in a specific scenario: by ensuring that your browsing remains private even if someone has gained temporary access to your unlocked phone with Tor Browser open in the background – whether you've handed it to a friend, or left your device sitting on a table.</p><h3>Updates to Android and Linux device compatibility</h3><p>At present, Firefox 140 and Tor Browser 15.0 support Android 5.0 or later, which was released almost 11 years ago. While Mozilla's commitment to support such an old version of Android is admirable, it introduces several technical and security challenges for developers. As a consequence, Firefox have announced their intention to increase the minimum support requirements to Android 8.0, and have also decided to drop support for x86 CPUs for <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/futurereleases/2025/09/15/raising-the-minimum-android-version-for-firefox/\">Android</a> and <a href=\"https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-has-ended-support-32-bit-linux\">Linux</a>. Sadly, it's not possible for the Tor Project to maintain support for these platforms on our own without official support from Mozilla.</p><p>While these changes won't impact Tor Browser users immediately, we expect them to take effect with the release of Tor Browser 16.0 mid-next year. This means that Tor Browser 15.0 will be the last major release to support x86 for Linux and Android, in addition to Android 5.0, 6.0, and 7.0. However, we will continue to release minor updates with security fixes for these platforms until Tor Browser 16.0's eventual release.</p><p>Although nobody wants to see support for their platform get dropped, it's an important step to maintain the stability and security of both Firefox and Tor Browser over time, and will allow developers to utilize newer technologies in both browsers. In addition, supporting x86 for Android has been particularly challenging for our developers due to the 100MB package size limit imposed by Google Play. While we have deployed several workarounds to stay within this limit in the recent past, these often come at a cost – such as x86 Android users missing out on the Conjure pluggable transport, for example.</p><h3>Disabling of WebAssembly now managed by NoScript</h3><p>WebAssembly (or Wasm) is a web technology that helps websites and web apps run faster. It allows web developers to write programs in languages like C, C++ or Rust, and compiles these into a special format that web browsers can run more efficiently.</p><p>As has been suggested in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2407.12297v1\">this meta-analysis from 2024</a>, further investigation of Wasm's potential exploits is necessary – therefore Wasm is currently disabled in the Safer and Safest security levels in order to reduce Tor Browser's attack surface. Up until now, this was achieved by setting the global preference  to false – however this approach was no longer viable after Mozilla implemented part of their PDF reader in Wasm between versions 128 and 140. Consequently, we have decided to move control of Wasm to NoScript, which is bundled with Tor Browser, and already manages JavaScript and other security features. This means that Wasm now works on privileged browser pages such as the PDF renderer, but NoScript will continue blocking the technology on regular websites at the Safer and Safest security levels.</p><p>Users who have manually set  to \"false\" while in the Standard security level will see their security level represented as \"Custom\" instead. To mitigate any issues that may arise with the browser's PDF reader, we encourage those users to switch the preference back to \"true\", thereby passing management of Wasm over to NoScript. Furthermore, manually disabling Wasm at the Standard security level (either via NoScript or ) may also <a href=\"https://tb-manual.torproject.org/anti-fingerprinting/\">make your fingerprint more unique</a> by deviating from Tor Browser's default configuration. To avoid this scenario, we recommend sticking with one of the <a href=\"https://tb-manual.torproject.org/security-settings/\">pre-defined security levels</a> and caution users against making further changes to individual preferences in about:config.</p><p>Alternatively, should you wish to keep Wasm disabled in future, we invite you to increase your security level to Safer or Safest going forward. Note that both Safer and Safest users may notice  switch to \"true\" automatically as management of Wasm is passed over to and blocked by NoScript, meaning that you are still protected regardless. In addition, Safest users in particular are not vulnerable to any potential vulnerabilities introduced by Wasm since the format requires JavaScript to work.</p><p>Tor Browser 15.0 comes with a number of known issues that can be found in <a href=\"https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/-/issues\">Tor Browser's issue tracker</a>. In particular, we would like to highlight the following:</p><p>The initial release of vertical tabs in Tor Browser includes a couple of quirks:</p><ul><li>When the sidebar is visible (such as when vertical tabs are enabled), the window may visibly resize when Tor Browser is launched.</li><li>Due to variations in window size, <a href=\"https://support.torproject.org/tbb/maximized-torbrowser-window/\">Letterboxing</a> may be visible. You still get the anti-fingerprinting protections provided by Letterboxing, but the default window size will be different than intended.</li></ul><p>We are currently working to issue a fix for both of these bugs. Please see <a href=\"https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/-/issues/44096\">tor-browser#44096</a> for details.</p><ul><li>Web pages may not load after updating Tor Browser on older versions of Android. This can be fixed by clearing your app cache manually in <code>Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Tor Browser &gt; Storage &amp; cache</code>.</li></ul>",

      "content": "<p>One day on my drive home, I saw three towers. One of them had a bunch of blinking white lights, another one had red lights that kind of faded in and out, and the third one, well, it wasn't doing anything. I'm lucky to have a radio engineer for a dad, so Dad: <em>why do some towers blink?</em></p><p>Joe: Well, blinking I would call like the way you described it, \"flashing\", \"white light\", or \"strobe\". All these lights are to aid pilots and air traffic. helicopters, fighter planes, regular jets. So that's the purpose of it.</p><p>Jeff: Well that one tower that I saw had red lights that faded in and out, but I even think there's a freestanding tower just north of here that has red and white on top.</p><p>Joe: Well red lighting is a thing. It's in the regulations, it specifies red lighting or white lighting, and one of the things like the red lights can be a bulb like this inside of a red housing, could be LED.</p><p>Jeff: Where'd you find this bulb? This was not in my studio.</p><p>Joe: This bulb is a spare bulb for a tower site. And most of us use the same bulb, same socket, 620 watts. It's a very standard broadcast bulb for a broadcast tower. And a lot of the beacons, they're pretty tall and they'll have one right-side up, and one upside-down. So they'll have two bulbs in the socket. That way, when one bulb burns out, you realize you have a bulb out, but you're still legal with the second bulb.</p><p>Jeff: At my house, I don't have any of this kind of bulb anymore [incandescent]. I have, you know, this is a little bit different size, these are LED. Is that similar on towers?</p><p>Joe: Yeah. So it is the same. Like an <a href=\"https://pr-tech.com/product/l-864865-dual-beacon/\">LED assembly for a tower</a> could be kind of flat, and it has, you know, it's set to just do what it needs to do. So in like white light, that's, typically it used to be always strobes. And at KMOX, you remember we had the whole assembly there. and you see the glass bulb, with xenon gas inside.</p><p>So those were the old way for that, but the newer ones are all white LED, and they can be little pancake-looking things compared to what the things are now. They can direct that LED light really to help airplanes and have less trouble for people who live in homes or apartment buildings nearby.</p><p>Jeff: So if they have a tower like the one that's just north of here that's in a residential area, you're not just flashing everybody constantly.</p><p>Jeff: You know, thinking about that tower, though, why do different towers have different lighting and different colors and things? And I even remember, like, on the tower that's right by here, there's actually teeny tiny little lights that are, like, on the sides, on the legs of the tower.</p><p>Joe: Yeah, well, tower lighting is in the responsibility of FAA, and they have a detailed plan. The options depend on the heights of the tower, where they are at. The location is obviously important. And sometimes red is a good solution, sometimes white, and sometimes both, red and white solution. And an example is the tower that you're talking about.</p><p>Jeff: So why would you want both? It seems like that's twice the complexity.</p><p>Joe: You would have strobe in the day and red at night. And people in their homes at night, a pulsing red light is a lot easier than a big flashing white light.</p><p>Jeff: So sometimes if people are complaining about it, you might go to that solution.</p><p>Joe: You can propose the red at night and the dual lighting works. And then you literally see these two packs and one will be red and one will be white. That's what I've seen mostly, although I heard that they make one now. It's all in one.</p><p>Jeff: [sarcastically] You could have RGB lights—could you do Home Assistant for your tower lighting?</p><p>Joe: You'd have RGB, but that would not be allowed by the FAA.</p><p>Jeff: We'll actually talk about that a little bit too later, because there are some regulations for how you actually monitor these things.</p><p>Jeff: But before we get to that, what about the one tower I saw didn't have any lights that were blinking at all. And I zoomed in and I saw that there was a light on top, but it just wasn't doing anything.</p><p>Joe: Yeah. Well, and this is about daytime mode. So a tower that's painted, and that's legal for obstruction marking, and you don't have to light during the day. So at night, their lights would come on. So you can be in a situation where, like here, you could see three towers. One might be day and night with white light, and two of them might be red light day only, but one kicks on earlier than the other because of their exact photo cell triggering the lights.</p><p>Jeff: Or if the photo cell is covered by a layer of soot from 40 years...</p><p>Joe: Yeah. So that tower is probably in daytime mode, or it could be an AM tower. An AM tower below 200 feet doesn't have to be lit, so that's another one. In fact, all towers, I guess, under 200 feet, unless you're in a particular area where the FAA would require it.</p><p>Jeff: You always have to refer back to the documentation.</p><p>Joe: You always refer to the documentation.</p><p>Jeff: But what is the tower site that we went to for the hot dogs?</p><p>Joe: KHOJ? KHOJ, yeah. Those don't have lights. Those do not have lights.</p><p>Jeff: Because they're under 200 feet.</p><p>Joe: Yes, so they don't need lighting. So, and then they don't need painting either. So that's one of those things that, again, always refer to that because just because you have a tower that's under 200 feet doesn't mean you don't have to make sure it complies or you may have to paint it or you may have to light and paint.</p><p>Tower painting has changed a lot over the years. The older towers have lead in them. So whenever there's a project on the tower, it's not unusual to see the guys in some kind of a, what do they call those?</p><p>Jeff: A full ghillie suit? Or I don't know what they're called.</p><p>Joe: Yeah. Yeah. So they have that too. So anyway, that's the bottom line from then till now.</p><h2>But some short towers  have lights...</h2><p>Jeff: So far, we've been talking about radio and TV towers, the ones that are really big. But what about little small towers? I know I see a lot of cell towers that don't have any lights at all, but sometimes they do. They just have one little light bulb on top. Or even if they're 50 to 100 feet tall, I've seen it sometimes.</p><p>Joe: Yeah, and there's always a reason for seeing a light somewhere, almost always on structures, including buildings and so forth. But if you look around the area where you're seeing that tower that you know is not 200 feet and it's got a light on the top, look you're probably near an airport, a heliport, or somewhere where there's an aviation hazard. You know hospitals, they have their helipads there.</p><p>So everywhere there is a possible hazard for flight for aircraft is going to have lights involved, and that's why we see a lot of buildings even have lights.</p><p>Jeff: So it sounds like we have towers and even buildings that have to have lights put up but who's in charge of all this? Like if I'm going to put up my own tower, who do I need to talk to to make sure that i'm doing it right and get it approved?</p><p>So that includes our broadcast towers, big chimney stacks, water towers, bridges, nuclear power plant cooling towers, wind turbines, tall electrical towers, you know, those ones that they cross a river, they'll have those extra tall ones with markings in the middle. Sometimes those are required to have lighting.</p><p>And there are also rules that even apply during construction projects. So you've got these big buildings going up And you'll notice the cranes will have lights on them. And there's a spec for that, how many lights have to be on the crane, what height it has to be at.</p><p>As you look around the next 12 months, look around at all those lights. You'll enjoy it like I do.</p><p>Jeff: You'll look like a radio engineer once you know about these things!</p><h2>Estimating tower height by light</h2><p>Jeff: So that's made me think, like, looking through these instructions, I did find this page. And I thought, like, could you use tower lights, the number of them, as a way to judge how tall a tower is? Kind of a rough estimate.</p><p>Joe: Yes, actually you can because the specifications, like for tall, these would apply to radio and TV towers. They require so many lights depending on the height.</p><p>Like around here, we would have the F4 version with four lights, four blinking light levels, a light at the top if the antenna here at the top is higher than 40 feet.</p><p>So you can kind of look and get an idea of whether you're looking at a 500-foot tower or a 1,000-foot tower. I don't think you could go like 700 versus 1,000 as easily.</p><p>But you can tell, and the guys know. I know a couple of pilots that are also engineers or selling in radio business, and they can do that. They'll tell you, you know, like I was passing a tower. What's a tower that's a 1,200-foot tower doing out here? So it's pretty fun, and you go to this document has everything you need if you want to take the time and study that and memorize it and then fly.</p><h2>Monitoring and reporting outages (and NOTAMs)</h2><p>Jeff: One other thing that since we've been running this channel I keep getting emails about, if someone sees that there's lights out on a tower, like let's say it's nighttime and you're out there and you notice like one of these towers for the past few days hasn't had a light on, can you do anything about that? What should you do?</p><p>Joe: Well, first of all, if it's required to be lit, every tower that's required to be lit is also required to be monitored.</p><p>So in radio, we put a monitoring circuit on the electrical feed to the filaments and you can measure how much current is going through there, right? So you've got to monitor it. You've got to get alarmed by that. The alarm can call you or reach you. But you also have to call every day, check your circuit, your system, and make sure the lights are on. So if you only are lit at night, that means that call has to happen after it's dark.</p><p>You've got to verify that your lighting is working, and you have to report it within 30 minutes. And you find that if a light's out, you've got to report it. And we call that a <a href=\"https://notams.aim.faa.gov/#News\">NOTAM</a>, where the FAA puts it on a system that all the pilots can have access to. And they know that there's a tower there, but it's lights out. And they can use it in their flight planning.</p><p>Jeff: You're an engineer and you have the tie-in with the FAA or whatever. But what would I be able to do if I did see a tower that was out?</p><p>Joe: Well, you can do a NOTAM search. Try to look through and see if you see it. The other thing, you could contact the tower owner or the engineer at the site, the tower's engineer, and they can check into it. They should already know because they have their monitoring equipment, right?</p><p>Joe: They should already know. They do.</p><p>And then, of course, if you're out there, usually the tower, either on the tower or in the fencing around it or on the building, will have an <a href=\"https://wireless2.fcc.gov/UlsApp/AsrSearch/asrRegistrationSearch.jsp\">ASR number</a>, which identifies that tower to the FAA and the FCC, actually. But that number would be the exact tower that you'd be reporting.</p><p>Jeff: So hopefully you learned a little bit more about why there are so many flashing lights around at night and not just for radio towers, but for bridges, buildings, and more. What other things do you want to know about towers? Let us know in the comments.</p>",

In many ways, it isn’t too dissimilar to the usual drug-discovery process!

But this is necessarily tied up with machine-learning for chemical design accelerating, so, again, this is not necessarily something I’d expect EvE’s work to contribute to by the end of the year. But perhaps soon!</p><p>This all said, even if you agreed that the value proposition that EvE is claiming is real, you may struggle to verbalize exactly how you would understand the off-target effects of the 13,000~ FDA approved drugs out there. What assays would you use? How do you dose any given drug? How do you understand the translation of your assay to real-world settings?</p><p>Let’s walk through the EvE workflow.</p><p>First, you need to decide what drugs you're actually going to test. While there are technically around 13,000 FDA-approved drugs out there, many of them aren't particularly relevant for this kind of screening. You can immediately exclude things like topical medications, inhalants, radioisotopes, and simple nutrients, stuff that is known to be largely innocuous or not have much systemic impact. After this initial filtering, you end up with about 1,600 small molecule drugs that are worth investigating. But this number gets further whittled down further based on practical constraints; availability, cost, licensing requirements, etc.</p><p>From this, EvE ended up with a library of 1,397 compounds to screen.</p><p><em>(everything x everything)</em></p><p>And, indeed, that turns out to be the case.</p><p><strong>7-transmembrane receptors (also known as GPCRs). </strong><a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11089380/\" rel=\"\"> 110 GPCR’s</a><a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11279859/\" rel=\"\"> 12-13 NR’s</a><a href=\"https://data.evebio.org/data_explorer__3.html#targets\" rel=\"\"> 56 GPCR’s and 29 NR’s</a></p><p>They hope to do much more than this too, but we’ll cover that in the last section.</p><p><a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10252477/\" rel=\"\"> 13% of FDA-approved drugs target NR’s</a><a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5820538/\" rel=\"\"> 35% for GPCR’s</a></p><ol><li><p><strong>TR-FRET-based co-factor recruitment assays for NRs</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>.

The numbers ranged from a low of 11 to a high of 104 potential off-targets routinely profiled per company, with a median of about 45. Interestingly, the industry’s opinions regarding which potential off-targets to screen vary widely.

      "content": "<p>When creating animations, we can decide how to transition between states using a  Historically, we’ve used Bézier curves for this, which provide us with a range of different options:</p><p>In this demo, each of these circles moves from side to side over the same duration, but they’re  very differently. This can dramatically change how the animation feels.</p><p>Bézier curves are great, but there are certain things they just can’t do. For example:</p><p>In the past, we’ve needed to rely on JavaScript libraries to provide these sorts of interpolations, which introduces a whole bunch of trade-offs; most JavaScript animations run on the main thread, for example, which means they won’t run smoothly if other stuff is happening in our application!</p><p>Fortunately, modern CSS has provided us a new tool that enables us to create springs, bounces, and so much more all in native CSS: the  timing function. In this blog post, I’ll show you how it works, and share some tools you can use to get started right away!</p><p>The core idea here is surprisingly simple: instead of using mathematically-derived Bézier curves, we can instead draw the easing curve we want, by specifying a set of individual points on a cartesian plane.</p><p>For example, this graph approximates an “ease” curve using 11 points:</p><p>This  like a curve, but if you look closely, you’ll notice that it’s actually a bunch of straight line segments. It’s like those “connect the dots” drawings, where a shape emerges from a bunch of straight lines.</p><p>This is why they named it “linear()”. Unlike Bézier curves, which are actual mathematical curves, the  function only draws straight lines between a set of provided points.</p><p>Here’s what the actual CSS looks like for the  animation graphed above:</p><div translate=\"no\" data-less-bottom-margin=\"false\"><div><pre><code></code></pre></div></div><p>The  function takes a set of numbers, with 0 representing the starting value and 1 representing the final value. We can think of this as a ratio of the transition progress. We can pass as many numbers as we want, and they’ll all be evenly-spaced across the specified duration.</p><p>We can use  to emulate spring physics, capturing the data from a real modeled spring. Let’s suppose we’re trying to recreate this springy motion:</p><p>Just for fun, I did my best to trace that springy shape by hand, guesstimating 11 values based on that graph. Here’s what that looks like:</p><p>Yikes. This does not feel great. 😂</p><p>We’ll look at how to make it better, but first, here’s the code for this not-great animation:</p><div translate=\"no\" data-less-bottom-margin=\"false\"><div><pre><code></code></pre></div></div><p>Like with Bézier curves, the  function allows us to pick values outside the 0 to 1 range, to  the target like springs do. So that second value, , means that we’ve overshot the target location by 25%.</p><p><strong>The problem is that 11 values are just not enough to faithfully reproduce a springy value like this.</strong> The element is clearly moving robotically between discrete points rather than smoothly oscillating like a spring.</p><p>But if we crank up the number of points, the simulation becomes much more believable. I wrote some code to calculate the values for  and here’s the result:</p><p>Much more convincing, right?</p><p>As you can tell from my failed experiment above, we aren’t really meant to write these  datasets by hand. Instead, we should use tools that dynamically calculate them for us.</p><p>The best tool I’ve seen is <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://linear-easing-generator.netlify.app/\">Linear() Easing</a>, by Jake Archibald and Adam Argyle. It comes pre-loaded with all of the math required to convert spring parameters into a highly-optimized  string, and if you have another JS-based timing function, you can easily edit the code to use that instead!</p><p>There’s also <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://easingwizard.com/\">Easing</a>, which is the most comprehensive and nicely-designed tool I’ve found. It uses  to model springs, bounces, wiggles, and more, and provides a bunch of tools to test out your timing functions.</p><p>Both of these tools take advantage of a more-advanced syntax for the  timing function. In addition to the progress ratio, certain points also have a time percentage:</p><div translate=\"no\" data-less-bottom-margin=\"false\"><div><pre><code></code></pre></div></div><p>Like before, we have a list of progress ratios from 0 to 1 (or beyond, for overshooting). Most of these points also have a second value, a percentage. This controls where each point is placed in time. So, rather than having a bunch of evenly-spaced values, we can position them strategically, to achieve the same curve with a smaller # of points.</p><p>For example, we can model that same spring with only 25 points, instead of 50:</p><p>Honestly, I’m not sure that this is  much of a savings in terms of kilobytes; we use a smaller # of points, but each point requires two pieces of information instead of just one. Either way, both of the recommended tools use this syntax, so presumably they’ve found that it’s beneficial!</p><p>We’ll talk more about the performance implications shortly.</p><p>The  function is a lovely API that greatly expands what we can do in vanilla CSS, but like everything, there are some tradeoffs and limitations worth considering.</p><p>When using JavaScript libraries that implement physics-based animations like springs or bounces, we don’t specify an animation . Instead, we configure our animation using physical properties like stiffness, damping, and mass. The animation takes however long it takes based on the physics.</p><p><strong>That’s not how CSS transitions work, though.</strong> CSS transitions require a duration:</p><div translate=\"no\" data-less-bottom-margin=\"false\"><div><pre><code></code></pre></div></div><p>The <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://linear-easing-generator.netlify.app/\">Linear() Easing Generator</a> solves this by dynamically deriving a duration based on the provided spring settings. The duration is calculated based on how much time is necessary until the spring settles down and stops moving.</p><p>This works in  cases, but it means we can’t model a zero-friction spring. When we set “damping” to , the spring  oscillate forever, but there’s no such thing as an infinite-duration transition.</p><p><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://easingwizard.com/\">Easing</a> works a bit differently: “duration” is a user-configurable parameter, and it doesn’t recalculate as we adjust the spring settings. To make this work, Easing Wizard fudges the numbers a bit. Certain parameters are internally clamped, so that they won’t produce impossible curves.</p><p>For example, with low mass/stiffness, damping has little to no effect, which is definitely not how it should work. 😅</p><p>I prefer the solution that Jake/Adam came up with for Linear() Easing Generator, but really, there is no perfect solution here. Springs aren’t meant to be time-based, so it feels a bit like trying to come up with the best way to stuff a square peg into a round hole. It’s an awkward way to think about physics-based animation.</p><p>One of the hardest problems in web animation is dealing with interrupts. The web is a dynamic place, and there’s no guarantee that an element will be allowed to complete its transition. Sometimes, it’ll be updated halfway through. What should happen in that case?</p><p>Well, let’s give it a shot. This demo implements the same basic transition using the  function as well as React Spring, a library based around JavaScript spring physics. <strong>Click the button quickly, to interrupt the transition:</strong></p><p>If you click the button twice, very quickly, you should see something like this:</p><p>(If you’re not able to click that quickly, you can also focus the button and press \"Enter\" twice.)</p><p>When both animations run without interruption, they appear nearly identical. But if we trigger the button again mid-transition, they behave  differently.</p><p><strong>Here’s the fundamental difference:</strong> the version using React Spring takes the element’s  into account. It takes a moment to slow down, before swinging back in the opposite direction. The CSS version, by contrast, turns around instantly, as though it hit a wall.</p><p>And the CSS version’s behaviour feels unnatural. This spring is meant to be pretty loose and smooth, but on that rebound transition, it feels tight and quick. 🤔</p><p>The reason this happens is a bit complicated, and too much of a rabbit hole to get into here. To summarize at a high level, CSS transitions have <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/css-transitions-1/#reversing\">special</a> for handling interrupts. There’s a concept in the specification called the <em>reversing shortening factor</em> that proportionally reduces the duration of interrupted transitions. So, a spring intended to take 1600ms might re-run at only 400ms. This looks fine with Bézier curves, but we’re trying to emulate physics here, and we can’t just speed it up and expect it to feel natural.</p><p>It’s a bit like taking a recording of someone walking at a leisurely pace, speeding it up by 2x, and trying to pass it off as someone jogging. The speed might be correct, but it sure as heck won’t look natural!</p><p>In order to convincingly simulate a spring using , we need  of data points. It’s not uncommon for my springs to have 40+ data points!</p><p>It  like this could have a significant impact on performance, but I wasn’t sure. And whenever I’m not sure about something like this, I try to figure it out with some testing.</p><ol><li><div>Is the framerate affected by complex  values?</div></li><li><div>Does it balloon the size of my CSS bundles?</div></li></ol><p>The first concern was easy to test. I created a basic animation and tested two different  strings. The first string was the simplest possible value, . The second string had &gt;100 values.</p><p><strong>Both animations ran equally smoothly, even on low-end hardware.</strong> I could not detect even a small difference between the two approaches. 👍</p><p>For the second concern, I created 3 maximum-accuracy springs with Easing Wizard, with an average of 75 values each, and added them to the CSS for my course platform. It’s important to test things like this in the context of a real application.</p><p>Here are the resulting file sizes:</p><ul><li><div>By default, my CSS bundle is 63.3kB, which compresses to 10.2kB with gzip.</div></li><li><div>With these extra springs, my CSS bundle grew to 67.1kB, which compresses to 11.5kB with gzip.</div></li></ul><p>So, in this particular context, these 3 very-large springs added ~1.3kB to my CSS bundle.</p><p>To put that number in context: on a typical 3G connection (2mb/s), it will take 5ms (0.005 seconds) to download this extra chunk of CSS. It will also add some processing time on the device, but we’re still talking about a completely imperceptible amount of time.</p><p>Now, this assumes we only have 3  chunks in the entire bundle. If you copy/paste this large string for every animation, you could wind up with dozens of copies, so it’s a good idea to use CSS variables to reuse the same  timing function in multiple places. Let’s talk about how to do that!</p><p> strings tend to be big and unwieldy. In addition to the potential performance concerns, it’s also just kind of annoying to work with them!</p><p>Rather than sprinkle  values across the codebase, I recommend storing a handful of common timing functions in globally-available CSS variables. If you already have a system for design tokens, I think it’s a great idea to extend it with some  timing functions!</p><p>We also need to consider browser support. As I mentioned earlier,  is a somewhat-new feature, and isn’t available in all browsers.</p><p>Over the past few months, I’ve been experimenting with how to use these timing functions effectively. Here’s the pattern I’ve landed on:</p><div translate=\"no\" data-less-bottom-margin=\"false\"><div><pre><code></code></pre></div></div><p>If the user is using an older browser which doesn't support , we’ll provide a fallback transition using Bézier curves. You can use <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://easingwizard.com/\">Easing</a> to come up with something that still feels alright (we can  mimic springs using Bézier curves by overshooting the target; it doesn’t look anywhere near as smooth, but it’s a decent fallback option).</p><p>The  at-rule allows us to specify extra CSS in supported browsers. So, we overwrite  with the actual  value. I also like to record the stiffness/damping for springs in a comment, so that if I want to adjust the spring settings in the future, I remember how to reconstruct this  string. And finally, I add  to stop the Prettier formatter from putting each point on its own line, and turning this 1-line declaration into a 50-line list of numbers.</p><p>We can then use the  and  variables wherever we typically apply transitions or keyframe animations. Like with all animations, we should make sure to respect user motion preferences. I write more about the “prefers-reduced-motion” media query in my blog post, <a href=\"https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/prefers-reduced-motion/\">Accessible Animations in React</a> (this post is mainly for React devs, but the first half of the post should still be useful for all web developers!).</p><p>For the past year, I’ve been working on the ultimate animations course. ✨</p><p>In this course, we use modern CSS features like  alongside JavaScript, SVG, and Canvas to create top-tier whimsical animations and interactions. I share all of the tips and tricks I’ve learned after nearly two decades of experience.</p><p>I’m hoping to release this course in the first half of 2026. You can learn more and sign up here:</p>",

      "content": "\n<p>We’re Robin, Louis, and Thomas. Pipelex is a DSL and a Python runtime for repeatable AI workflows. Think Dockerfile/SQL for multi-step LLM pipelines: you declare steps and interfaces; any model/provider can fill them.<p>Why this instead of yet another workflow builder?<p>- Declarative, not glue code: you state what to do; the runtime figures out how.\n- Agent-first: each step carries natural-language context (purpose, inputs/outputs with meaning) so LLMs can follow, audit, and optimize. Our MCP server enables agents to run pipelines but also to build new pipelines on demand.\n- Open standard under MIT: language spec, runtime, API server, editor extensions, MCP server, n8n node.\n- Composable: pipes can call other pipes, created by you or shared in the community.<p>Why a domain-specific language?<p>- We need context, meaning and nuances preserved in a structured syntax that both humans and LLMs can understand\n- We need determinism, control, and reproducibility that pure prompts can't deliver\n- Bonus: editors, diffs, semantic coloring, easy sharing, search & replace, version control, linters…<p>How we got there:<p>Initially, we just wanted to solve every use-case with LLMs but kept rebuilding the same agentic patterns across different projects. So we challenged ourselves to keep the code generic and separate from use-case specifics, which meant modeling workflows from the relevant knowledge and know-how.<p>Unlike existing code/no-code frameworks for AI workflows, our abstraction layer doesn't wrap APIs, it transcribes business logic into a structured, unambiguous script executable by software and AI. Hence the \"declarative\" aspect: the script says what should be done, not how to do it. It's like a Dockerfile or SQL for AI workflows.<p>Additionally, we wanted the language to be LLM-friendly. Classic programming languages hide logic and context in variable names, functions, and comments: all invisible to the interpreter. In Pipelex, these elements are explicitly stated in natural language, giving AI full visibility: it's all logic and context, with minimal syntax.<p>Then, we didn't want to write Pipelex scripts ourselves so we dogfooded: we built a Pipelex workflow that writes Pipelex workflows. It's in the MCP and CLI: \"pipelex build pipe '…'\" runs a multi-step, structured generation flow that produces a validated workflow ready to execute with \"pipelex run\". Then you can iterate on it yourself or with any coding agent.<p>What’s included: Python library, FastAPI and Docker, MCP server, n8n node, VS Code extension.<p>What we’d like from you<p>1. Build a workflow: did the language work for you or against you?\n2. Agent/MCP workflows and n8n node usability.\n3. Suggest new kinds of pipes and other AI models we could integrate\n4. Looking for OSS contributors to the core library but also to share pipes with the community<p>Known limitations<p>- Connectors: Pipelex doesn’t integrate with “your apps”, we focus on the cognitive steps, and you can integrate through code/API or using MCP or n8n\n- Visualization: we need to generate flow-charts\n- The pipe builder is still buggy\n- Run it yourself: we don’t yet provide a hosted Pipelex API, it’s in the works\n- Cost-tracking: we only track LLM costs, not image generation or OCR costs yet\n- Caching and reasoning options: not supported yet<p>Links<p>- GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/Pipelex/pipelex\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/Pipelex/pipelex</a>\n- Cookbook: <a href=\"https://github.com/Pipelex/pipelex-cookbook\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/Pipelex/pipelex-cookbook</a>\n- Starter: <a href=\"https://github.com/Pipelex/pipelex-starter\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/Pipelex/pipelex-starter</a>\n- VS Code extension: <a href=\"https://github.com/Pipelex/vscode-pipelex\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/Pipelex/vscode-pipelex</a>\n- Docs: [<a href=\"https://docs.pipelex.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://docs.pipelex.com</a>](<a href=\"https://docs.pipelex.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://docs.pipelex.com/</a>)\n- Demo video (2 min): <a href=\"https://youtu.be/dBigQa8M8pQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/dBigQa8M8pQ</a>\n- Discord for support and sharing: <a href=\"https://go.pipelex.com/discord\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://go.pipelex.com/discord</a><p>Thanks for reading.

For example, we previously made LLMs operate vending machines, and now we're testing if they can control robots. There are two parts to this test:<p>1. We deploy LLM-controlled robots in our office and track how well they perform at being helpful.<p>2. We systematically test the robots on tasks in our office. We benchmark different LLMs against each other. You can read our paper \"Butter-Bench\" on arXiv: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.21860\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.21860</a><p>The link in the title above (<a href=\"https://andonlabs.com/evals/butter-bench\">https://andonlabs.com/evals/butter-bench</a>) leads to a blog post + leaderboard comparing which LLM is the best at our robotic tasks.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45733169\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45733169</a></p>\n<p>Points: 186</p>\n<p># Comments: 99</p>\n",

However, goal was to combine privacy of Vanadium with the power of desktop extensions and Helium features, and make it accessible to a wider audience. (Passkeys from Bitwarden Mobile should also work straight away once merged in the list of FIDO2 privileged browsers)</p><p>Build scripts are in the repo if you want to compile it yourself. You can find pre-built releases there too.</p><p>Would love any feedback/support!</p>",

      "content": "<p>Hi HN, I’m Dvir, a young developer. Last year, I got rejected after a job interview because I lacked some CPU knowledge. After that, I decided to deepen my understanding in the low level world and learn how things work under the hood. I decided to try and create an OS in C and ASM as a way to broaden my knowledge in this area.</p><p>This took me on the most interesting ride, where I’ve learned about OS theory and low level programming on a whole new level.  I’ve spent hours upon hours, blood and tears, reading different OS theory blogs, learning low level concepts, debugging, testing and working on this project.</p><p>This part was the longest, but also the easiest. I felt like I understood the theory, but still could not connect it into actual code. Sitting down and starting to code was difficult, but I knew that was the next step I needed to  take! \nI began by working on the bootloader, which is optional since you can use a pre-made one (I switched to GRUB later), but implementing it was mainly for learning purposes and to warm up on ASM. These were my steps after that:</p><pre><code>  1) I started implementing the VGA driver, which gave me the ability to display text.\n  2) Interrupts - IDT, ISR, IRQ, which signal to the CPU that a certain event occurred and needs handling (such as faults, hardware connected device actions, etc).\n  3) Keyboard driver, which enables me to display the same text I type on my keyboard.\n  4) PMM (Physical memory management)\n  5) Paging and virtual memory management\n  6) RTC driver - clock addition (which was, in my opinion, optional)\n  7) PIT driver - Ticks every certain amount of time, and also  \n  8) FS (File System) and physical HDD drivers - for the HDD I chose PATA (HDD communication protocol) for simplicity (SATA is a newer but harder option as well).\n     For the FS I chose EXT2 (The Second Extended FileSystem), which is a foundational linux FS structure introduced in 1993. This FS structure is not the simplest,\n     but is very popular in hobby-OS, it is very supported, easy to set up and upgrade to newer EXT versions, it has a lot of materials online, compared to other\n     options. This was probably the longest and largest feature I had worked on.\n  9) Syscall support.\n  10) Libc implementation.\n  11) Processing and scheduling for multiprocessing.\n  12) Here I also made a shell to test it all.\n</code></pre>\nAt this point, I had a working shell, but later decided to go further and add a GUI! I was working on the FS (stage 8), when I heard about Hack Club’s Summer of Making (SoM). This was my first time practicing in HackClub, and I want to express my gratitude and share my enjoyment of participating in it.<p>At first I just wanted to declare the OS as finished after completing the FS, and a bit of other drivers, but because of SoM my perspective was changed completely. Because of the competition, I started to think that I needed to ship a complete OS, with processing, GUI and the bare minimum ability to run Doom. I wanted to show the community in SoM how everything works.</p><p>Then I worked on it for another 2 months, after finishing the shell, just because of SoM!,  totalling my project to almost 7 months of work. At this time I added full GUI support, with dirty rectangles and double buffering, I made a GUI mouse driver, and even made a full Doom port! things I would've never even thought about without participating in SoM.</p><p>Every project has challenges, especially in such a low level project. I had to do a lot of debugging while working on this, and it is no easy task. I highly recommend using GDB which helped me debug so many of my problems, especially memory ones.</p><p>The first major challenge I encountered was during the coding of processes - I realized that a lot of my paging code was completely wrong, poorly tested, and had to be reworked. During this time I was already in the competition and it was difficult keeping up with devlogs and new features while fixing old problems in a code I wrote a few months ago.</p><p>Some more major problems occurred when trying to run Doom, and unlike the last problem, this was a disaster. I had random PFs and memory problems, one run could work while the next one wouldn’t, and the worst part is that it was only on the Doom, and not on processes I created myself. These issues took a lot of time to figure out. I began to question the Doom code itself, and even thought about giving up on the whole project.</p><p>After a lot of time spent debugging, I fixed the issues. It was a combination of scheduling issues, Libc issues and the Qemu not having enough (wrongfully assuming 128MB for the whole OS was enough).</p><p>Finally, I worked throughout all the difficulties, and shipped the project! In the end, the experience working on this project was amazing. I learned a lot, grew and improved as a developer, and I thank SoM for helping to increase my motivation and make the project memorable and unique like I never imagined it would be.</p>",

It now uses KDL for configuration, which is much cleaner than YAML. The syntax is versatile enough that you can create a custom DSL of sorts. Ferron uses it to replicate if statements, and uses them to filter access by IP or headers.</p><div><div><div><p>Engineer at System76 and Pop!_OS maintainer</p></div></div></div>",

      "content": "Personally, I think the JJ VCS (<a href=\"https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj</a>) hit a point some time in this past year where I find it hard to find a great reason to continue using git. Over the years I've cobbled together aliases and bash functions to try to improve my git workflow, but after using jj, which works with ~any git repo and integrates great with Github repos, all of the workflow issues I ran into with git are not only solved, but improved in ways I couldn't manage with simple scripts.<p>One example is the op log, which lets you go to any point in your repo's time and provides simple undo and redo commands when you want to back out of a merge, didn't mean to rebase, etc.</p><p>Because I have a pretty strong conviction that JJ is at this point a cleaner and more powerful version of git, my hopes are that it continues to grow. With that, it seemed a proper full-featured GUI was missing for the VCS. There's some plugins that add some integration into VS Code, and there's one in the works to get Intellij support working, but many of the constructs JJ provides in my opinion necessitate a grounds-up build of a GUI around how JJ works.</p><p>Right now, [name-redacted] is an MVP in an open beta. I did my best to support all of the core functionality one would need, though there's many nice-to-haves that I am going to add, like native merge support, native splitting, etc. Most of this will be based on feedback from the Beta.</p><p>I'm really grateful for the great community JJ has built, alongside the HN community itself in the countless VCS-based posts I've read over the years, and am hoping for lots of input here during Beta under real usage - the goal is to be a full-featured desktop GUI for the VCS, similar to many of the great products that are out there for git.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Hey HN! I’ve recently open-sourced Pyversity, a lightweight library for diversifying retrieval results. Most retrieval systems optimize only for relevance, which can lead to top-k results that look almost identical. Pyversity efficiently re-ranks results to balance relevance and diversity, surfacing items that remain relevant but are less redundant. This helps with improving retrieval, recommendation, and RAG pipelines without adding latency or complexity.</p><p>- Unified API: one function (diversify) supporting several well-known strategies: MMR, MSD, DPP, and COVER (with more to come)</p><p>- Lightweight: the only dependency is NumPy, keeping the package small and easy to install</p><p>- Fast: efficient implementations for all supported strategies; diversify results in milliseconds</p><p>Re-ranking with cross-encoders is very popular right now, but also very expensive. From my experience, you can usually improve retrieval results with simpler and faster methods, such as the ones implemented in this package. This helps retrieval, recommendation, and RAG systems present richer, more informative results by ensuring each new item adds new information.</p><p>Code and docs: github.com/pringled/pyversity</p><p>Let me know if you have any feedback, or suggestions for other diversification strategies to support!</p>",

Born from frustration with complex traditional NMS tools like Zabbix, it bridges legacy (SNMP/syslog) and modern (gNMI, OTLP) protocols for cloud-native environments.</p><p>We built ServiceRadar to simplify monitoring hybrid telecom networks, evolving it into a Kubernetes-native solution with Helm and Docker support. It uses mTLS with SPIFFE/SPIRE, NATS JetStream for event streaming (90M+ EPS), and SRQL for intuitive queries. Integrated with OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, and CloudEvents, it fills the network visibility gap in CNCF’s application-focused observability stack.</p><p>We’re seeking early adopters to try our demo or deploy locally—no sign-up needed. Feedback on usability or contributions for new protocols would be awesome.</p><p>Quick Start: helm install serviceradar carverauto/serviceradar or docker compose up -d</p><p>Join our Discord or use GitHub Issues to share thoughts.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Hi HN! I'm Nick from Inkeep. We built an agent builder with true 2-way sync between code and a drag-and-drop visual editor, so devs and non-devs can collaborate on the same agents. Here’s a demo video: <a href=\"https://go.inkeep.com/video\">https://go.inkeep.com/video</a>.</p><p>As a developer, the flow is:\n1) Build AI Chat Assistants or AI Workflows with the TypeScript SDK 2) Run `inkeep push` from your CLI to publish 3)Edit agents in the visual builder (or hand off to non-technical teams) 4) Run `inkeep pull to edit in code again.</p><p>We built this because we wanted the accessibility of no-code workflow builders (n8n, Zapier), but the flexibility and devex of code-based agent frameworks (LangGraph, Mastra). We also wanted first-class support for chat assistants with interactive UIs, not just workflows. OpenAI got close, but you can only do a one-time export from visual builder to code and there’s vendor lock-in.</p><p>How I've used it: I bootstrapped a few agents for our marketing and sales teams, then was able to hand off so they can maintain and create their own agents. This has enabled us to adopt agents across technical and non-technical roles in our company on a single platform.</p><p>We leaned on open protocols to make it easy to use agents anywhere:\nAn MCP endpoint, so agents can be used from Cursor/Claude/ChatGPT\nA Chat UI library with interactive elements you can customize in React\nAn API endpoint compatible with the Vercel AI SDK `useChat` hook\nSupport for Agent2Agent (A2A) so they work with other agent ecosystems</p><p>We made some practical templates like a customer_support, deep_research, and docs_assistant. Deployment is easy with Vercel/Docker with a fair-code license and there's a traces UI and OTEL logs for observability.</p><p>Under the hood, we went all-in on a multi-agent architecture. Agents are made up of LLMs, MCPs, and agent-to-agent relationships. We’ve found this approach to be easier to maintain and more flexible than traditional “if/else” approaches for complex workflows.</p><p>The interoperability works because the SDK and visual builder share a common underlying representation, and the Inkeep CLI bridges it with a mix of LLMs and TypeScript syntactic sugar. Details in our docs: <a href=\"https://docs.inkeep.com\">https://docs.inkeep.com</a>.</p><p>We’re open to ideas and contributions! And would love to hear about your experience building agents - what works, hasn’t worked, what’s promising?</p>",
